00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.660
 this time we bring to the table 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.020
 operations that is to the kitchen table 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.600
 a small breeding of canaries that due 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.180
 a snag in the nest has been left 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.490
 completely deformed from all the 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.860
 right lateral of your body affecting 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.860
 both his leg and his right wing 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.220
 first of all we proceed to carry 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.920
 his paw sites deformed to 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.040
 later helping us with stars 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.460
 strips of adhesive tape fix this 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.460
 body 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.740
 it is very important in this case to have in 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.320
 count the type of tape that 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.409
 we use on this occasion 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.110
 this type of flesh- colored tape 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.200
 Throughout life we use it for 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.260
 different reasons the first one is 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.840
 excellent grip the second is that 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.910
 to look more like the natural color of the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.640
 Breeding skin can pass 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.450
 perfectly unnoticed by the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.450
 eyes of the mother 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.110
 once we make sure of the correct 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.860
 position of its leg is not for others 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.630
 place a second strip in another direction 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.340
 to make sure the fixation of the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.909
 same 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.789
 we must be extremely careful to 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.490
 place these strips since these do not 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.280
 can not be too loose and very 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.310
 tight 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.700
 If they are too loose, their effectiveness is not 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.130
 would be the same if on the contrary 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.740
 they are very narrow we run the risk 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.470
 of suffocating the young 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.890
 a very important detail to have in 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.890
 account is to change these fixes every 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.010
 two or three days the development of 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.790
 offspring during this period is very fast 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.420
 and so we will avoid oppressing some of 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.420
 your vital organs 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.459
 Second, we proceed to repeat the 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.940
 operation in this case with your wing 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.940
 right 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.180
 once the wing is fixed in its position 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.810
 correct we will repeat the previous process 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.720
 that is helping us strip star 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.500
 tape fix the same on your 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.500
 correct place 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.840
 It is very important after each step 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.689
 ensuring the correct exposure of 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.930
 these strips in this way we 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:12.140
 We guarantee not to cause damage 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.140
 collateral 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.819
 and finally we finish the process 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.299
 cutting another small strip of 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.540
 adhesive tape by which we join the 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:29.319
 fixations made previously 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:33.370
 in this way it is much more compact 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.189
 the goal of all this is to get the 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.230
 greater possible immobilization of both 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:43.290
 tips for a while 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.290
 Approximately between 10 and 20 days 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.630
 once back to the nursery of the nest 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.330
 we must exercise extreme vigilance 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.780
 we can take the risk that the 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.390
 mother press the child in this case to 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.300
 already have a considerable size and not 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.880
 to be able to expel him from the nest we run a 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.130
 even greater risk that may be the 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.130
 abandonment of the gaze completely 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.420
 This is the breeding with which we are going 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.500
 performing the previous operation once 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.880
 completely between human and outside of 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.870
 despite the success it obtained yet we 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.200
 there is a small detail to correct them 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.340
 the back finger of his right leg does not 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.340
 is in its right place 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:49.930
 being the breeding still in full development 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:53.539
 this defect is very easy to correct 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.360
 we just have to fix the finger on his 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:05:00.099
 correct position again with a 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.099
 narrow strip of adhesive tape 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.570
 in this case the only precaution that 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.380
 we must take is to place your finger 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.860
 rear in a position further back than 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.860
 the normal 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.470
 in this way what we intend 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.340
 to get is to stretch the tendon of the finger 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:33.000
 back of your right leg to the fullest 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:36.830
 for once loose fixing this 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.830
 stay in its correct position
