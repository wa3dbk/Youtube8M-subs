here's a verse a capital of the third
string<00:00:46.940> here<00:00:47.239> okay<00:00:47.540> so<00:00:47.570> everything<00:00:48.230> you're

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
string here okay so everything you're

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.860 
string here okay so everything you're
gonna<00:00:48.620> do<00:00:48.829> is<00:00:48.949> relative<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.460> that<00:00:49.670> capital<00:00:50.089> so

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
gonna do is relative to that capital so

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.450 
gonna do is relative to that capital so
the<00:00:50.989> capital<00:00:51.350> is<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.470> basis<00:00:51.980> for<00:00:52.010> less<00:00:52.339> so

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
the capital is the basis for less so

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.430 
the capital is the basis for less so
that's<00:00:52.610> a<00:00:52.699> zero<00:00:53.089> and<00:00:53.690> we<00:00:53.809> woke<00:00:53.960> up<00:00:54.140> from<00:00:54.350> the

that's a zero and we woke up from the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.329 
that's a zero and we woke up from the
capital<00:00:54.860> one<00:00:58.659> okay<00:00:59.659> so<00:01:00.320> what<00:01:00.860> we<00:01:00.949> have<00:01:00.979> to<00:01:01.220> do

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
beach best you'll just replace that's

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.350 
beach best you'll just replace that's
foster<00:02:49.150> play<00:02:49.330> ending<00:02:49.780> here<00:02:49.990> zero<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:52.330> just

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
foster play ending here zero you just

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.910 
foster play ending here zero you just
play<00:02:52.810> zero<00:02:53.530> all<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.710> way<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.250> end<00:02:54.430> okay

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
play zero all the way to the end okay

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.780 
play zero all the way to the end okay
alright<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.250> should<00:02:57.400> make<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.550> better

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
alright so that should make a better

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.100 
alright so that should make a better
sense<00:02:58.030> then<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.300> can<00:02:58.420> even<00:02:58.540> add<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.900> an<00:02:59.020> E

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
sense then you can even add that an E

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:12.540 
sense then you can even add that an E
chord<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.620> answer<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.010> could<00:03:00.100> go<00:03:11.550> court

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
chord on the answer you could go court

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.580 
chord on the answer you could go court
but<00:03:13.450> if<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.810> don't<00:03:13.990> shoot<00:03:14.170> about<00:03:14.410> will
