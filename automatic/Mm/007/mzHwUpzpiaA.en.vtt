well so just gonna apply that it's
really<00:02:01.740> really<00:02:01.920> messy-looking<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.970> that's

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
really really messy-looking but that's

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.149 
really really messy-looking but that's
just<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:03.840> using<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.289> so<00:02:04.439> much<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.860> I

t-zone area and my cheeks because that's

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.180 
t-zone area and my cheeks because that's
where<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.450> tend<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.810> be<00:03:12.930> oily<00:03:13.380> even<00:03:13.920> though<00:03:14.010> not

very<00:03:14.510> oily<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:16.049> general<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.190> if<00:03:17.849> I<00:03:18.030> do<00:03:18.090> get

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
very oily and general but if I do get

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.180 
very oily and general but if I do get
oily<00:03:18.660> thats<00:03:18.900> where<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.889> happens<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:22.190> don't

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
oily thats where it happens so I don't

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.460

a<00:03:25.500> little<00:03:25.680> bit

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
a little bit

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.650 
a little bit
because<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:26.980> don't<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.790> mat<00:03:27.970> face<00:03:28.239> look<00:03:28.540> I

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
because I don't like the mat face look I

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.390 
because I don't like the mat face look I
don't<00:03:28.810> really<00:03:28.900> like<00:03:29.020> that<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:29.860> just<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.370> little
