00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.300 
similar to gameplay in league of legends
or<00:00:19.050> dota<00:00:19.380> if<00:00:19.560> you've<00:00:19.740> ever<00:00:19.830> played<00:00:20.039> those

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.060 
or dota if you've ever played those
games<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:21.210> basically<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.869> do<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.289> you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
games so basically what you do is you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.269 
games so basically what you do is you
start<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:24.019> no<00:00:25.019> units<00:00:25.380> as<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:25.859> none

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
start with no units as you can see none

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.859 
start with no units as you can see none
of<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> players<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.970> units<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:27.539> they<00:00:27.689> all

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
of the players have units but they all

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.470 
of the players have units but they all
have<00:00:27.900> equipped<00:00:28.500> ultimate<00:00:29.010> fuel<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.640> item<00:00:29.970> so

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
have equipped ultimate fuel the item so

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
have equipped ultimate fuel the item so
that<00:00:30.510> they<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:30.960> buy<00:00:31.109> as<00:00:31.349> many<00:00:31.560> abilities<00:00:31.949> as

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
that they can buy as many abilities as

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.970 
that they can buy as many abilities as
they<00:00:32.640> want<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.930> they're<00:00:34.380> basically<00:00:34.500> only

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
they want and so they're basically only

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.250 
they want and so they're basically only
going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.280> use<00:00:35.309> their<00:00:35.730> abilities<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.329> mix<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
going to use their abilities and mix and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.340 
going to use their abilities and mix and
teamwork<00:00:37.890> as<00:00:38.370> well<00:00:39.000> as<00:00:39.149> strategy<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.899> they

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
teamwork as well as strategy and they

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.290 
teamwork as well as strategy and they
all<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> ground<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.149> all

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
all have to be on the ground at all

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.380 
all have to be on the ground at all
times<00:00:42.329> once<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.200> timer<00:00:43.500> reaches<00:00:43.980> zero<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:45.000> as

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
times once that timer reaches zero so as

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.420 
times once that timer reaches zero so as
you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:46.289> now<00:00:46.530> time<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.039> reaching

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
you can see right now time is reaching

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.310 
you can see right now time is reaching
zero<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> land<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
zero so they all have to land on the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.959 
zero so they all have to land on the
ground<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> work

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
ground and then they have to work

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.000 
ground and then they have to work
together<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.480> clear<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> neutrals<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.620> kill

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
together to clear the neutrals and kill

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
together to clear the neutrals and kill
the<00:00:53.190> enemy<00:00:53.520> team<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.840> only<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.230> one

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the enemy team so they all only have one

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.670 
the enemy team so they all only have one
life<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:57.000> die<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.660> game's<00:00:57.899> over<00:00:58.199> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
life so if you die the game's over so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.819 
life so if you die the game's over so
whichever<00:00:59.190> team<00:00:59.550> can<00:01:00.289> completely<00:01:01.289> wipe<00:01:01.649> out

team without having to worry about those
neutrals<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:31.979> they<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.189> all<00:01:32.340> clear

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and now they are working on kind of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.380 
and now they are working on kind of
draining<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.560> health<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:39.030> team

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
draining the health of the other team

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.170 
draining the health of the other team
members<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.650> they<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.909> kill

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
and so this is all about strategy at

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.069 
and so this is all about strategy at
this<00:01:44.520> point<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:45.240> about<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.720> makes<00:01:45.930> you

this point it's about what makes you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.380 
this point it's about what makes you
choose<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.100> dock<00:01:47.549> almost<00:01:47.880> goes<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.030> there

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
choose and dock almost goes down there

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.149 
choose and dock almost goes down there
as<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> Osprey<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> most

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
as you can see the Osprey is the most

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.530 
as you can see the Osprey is the most
important<00:01:50.549> back<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.850> game<00:01:51.000> because<00:01:51.180> doc

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
important back in the game because doc

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.340 
important back in the game because doc
was<00:01:51.720> almost<00:01:52.229> zero<00:01:52.649> health<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:55.079> Osprey

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
was almost zero health and the Osprey

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.660 
was almost zero health and the Osprey
was<00:01:55.530> able<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.770> heal<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.040> up<00:01:56.130> all<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> ground

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
was able to heal it up all on the ground

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.920 
was able to heal it up all on the ground
to<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.909> boy<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> might<00:01:57.180> actually<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.570> down<00:01:57.719> but

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
to be boy I might actually go down but

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.230 
to be boy I might actually go down but
again<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> Osprey<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.860> healing<00:01:59.219> bboy<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.759> so

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
again the Osprey is healing bboy up so

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
again the Osprey is healing bboy up so
the<00:02:00.659> most<00:02:00.960> important<00:02:01.409> part<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.710> keep<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the most important part is to keep the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.580 
the most important part is to keep the
medic<00:02:02.430> healer<00:02:02.820> alive<00:02:03.240> which<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.170> Osprey

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
medic healer alive which is the Osprey

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and then while bboy is a paladin so that

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.469 
and then while bboy is a paladin so that
he<00:02:07.350> can<00:02:07.530> tank<00:02:07.770> damage<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.700> are<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
he can tank damage and they are the
