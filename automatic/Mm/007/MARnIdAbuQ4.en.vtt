00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.830 

this<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.740> inside<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:29.050> controller

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.870 

the<00:01:33.680> simple<00:01:34.310> pot<00:01:34.520> right<00:01:34.790> there<00:01:35.200> this<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:36.260> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
the simple pot right there this is the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.080 
the simple pot right there this is the
main<00:01:37.880> one<00:01:38.150> that<00:01:38.510> has<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.590> switches<00:01:40.010> on<00:01:40.190> it

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.490 

that<00:01:44.090> little<00:01:44.330> boy<00:01:44.510> that<00:01:44.540> there<00:01:45.140> is<00:01:45.320> the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
that little boy that there is the

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.170 
that little boy that there is the
resistor<00:01:48.500> switches<00:01:49.010> it<00:01:49.190> changes<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.970> pitch

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
resistor switches it changes the pitch

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.640 
resistor switches it changes the pitch
of<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.510> keys<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.790> main<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:54.440> main

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
of the keys this is the main the main

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.540 
of the keys this is the main the main
board<00:01:55.030> has<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.110> 386<00:01:57.110> amplified<00:01:57.979> ship<00:01:58.310> right

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
board has a 386 amplified ship right

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.790 
board has a 386 amplified ship right
there<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:01.970> power<00:02:02.570> switch<00:02:02.840> connects<00:02:03.650> to

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
there this is a power switch connects to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.979 
there this is a power switch connects to
the<00:02:03.920> battery<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:05.119> that's<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:06.009> output

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
the battery and that's the output

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.180 
the battery and that's the output
connected<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.170> speaker<00:02:09.709> or<00:02:09.739> another

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
connected to a speaker or another

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.460 
connected to a speaker or another
amplifier<00:02:11.050> then<00:02:12.050> this<00:02:12.830> way<00:02:13.070> over<00:02:13.280> here<00:02:14.470> it's

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
amplifier then this way over here it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.750 
amplifier then this way over here it's
just<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.920> switch<00:02:21.100> each<00:02:22.100> one<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.400> these<00:02:22.520> little

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
just a switch each one of these little

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.280 
just a switch each one of these little
buttons<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.300> just<00:02:23.570> another<00:02:23.870> switch

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
buttons is just another switch

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.110 
buttons is just another switch
underneath<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.190> can<00:02:25.370> use<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.700> for<00:02:25.910> just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
underneath so you can use that for just

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.260 
underneath so you can use that for just
about<00:02:26.360> anything<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:28.520> then<00:02:28.670> wire<00:02:28.850> ease<00:02:29.090> all

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
about anything and then wire ease all

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:37.900 
about anything and then wire ease all
the<00:02:29.390> way<00:02:30.070> over<00:02:31.070> here<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:33.610> resistors<00:02:36.910> and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
the way over here to the resistors and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.310 
the way over here to the resistors and
then<00:02:38.090> underneath<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:38.870> thing<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:41.320> the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
then underneath this thing is a the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.590 
then underneath this thing is a the
tools<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.519> two<00:02:43.730> switches<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:45.019> strum<00:02:45.799> bar

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
tools the two switches for the strum bar

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.170 
tools the two switches for the strum bar
this<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.959> whammy<00:02:48.140> bar<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.430> controller

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
this is the whammy bar of the controller

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:58.270 
this is the whammy bar of the controller
it's<00:02:50.810> just<00:02:51.110> mounted<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:55.630> pot<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.010> can

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
it's just mounted to a pot and you can

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.560 
it's just mounted to a pot and you can
just<00:02:58.459> replace<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:59.030> with<00:02:59.150> anything<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.600> want

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.449 

that's<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.720> chargeable<00:03:06.380> nine<00:03:06.709> gold<00:03:09.250> with<00:03:10.250> this

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
that's a chargeable nine gold with this

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.539 
that's a chargeable nine gold with this
right<00:03:10.730> here<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.420> just<00:03:11.660> cut<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.459> traces<00:03:13.459> so

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
right here you I just cut the traces so

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.569 
right here you I just cut the traces so
you<00:03:16.549> don't<00:03:16.760> have<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.829> mess<00:03:18.829> up<00:03:19.040> any<00:03:19.280> of<00:03:19.370> the

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
you don't have to mess up any of the

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.150 
you don't have to mess up any of the
other<00:03:19.730> circuits<00:03:20.450> on<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.750> board

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.090 

you<00:03:25.760> could<00:03:25.940> use<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.960> for<00:03:27.020> anything<00:03:27.260> also

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
you could use this for anything also

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.750 
you could use this for anything also
this<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.300> for<00:03:29.440> just<00:03:30.440> another<00:03:30.830> switch<00:03:31.190> it's<00:03:31.580> not

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
this is for just another switch it's not

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.190 
this is for just another switch it's not
connected<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.210> anything<00:03:34.690> I'll<00:03:35.690> try<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.900> put

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
connected to anything I'll try to put

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.260 
connected to anything I'll try to put
some<00:03:36.830> schematics<00:03:37.580> up<00:03:37.790> then<00:03:37.970> I'll<00:03:38.060> show

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
some schematics up then I'll show

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.480 
some schematics up then I'll show
exactly<00:03:38.690> how<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.410> made<00:03:40.120> all<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.180> this
