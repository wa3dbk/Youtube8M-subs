00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.449

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.770
 years since it leaves gta san andreas and 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.539
 here we are celebrating in this event 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.769
 committed rockstar ingenia online in the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.810
 which is about falling for the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.640
 precipices and die and that no kidding 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.400
 ok let's go fourth guys let's go quarters 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.470
 come on let's go let's go this one with motorcycle 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.329
 crotto cuatros perendengues that you have 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.380
 pelendengues true the bike I think is the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.180
 best option for and around here but now 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.320
 touches road if all that pasta of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.540
 cortitas and how we put the batteries 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.829
 and what is complicated then complicated 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.989
 there in front of me I have two subscribers and 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.840
 I get going 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.160
 you already know how to support real the video with a 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 like I liked this marathon and if 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.879
 you want me to do another for the next 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.020
 event that they are worth, let's try 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.309
 pillar 22 evans and from before guys what 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.449
 complicated because the second one is going to 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.180
 catch the slipstream the first and so 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.630
 So much they will go faster than them but 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.520
 I never lose hope in life 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.470
 this curve fails suddenly there is super 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.290
 professionals but has been offered 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.670
 a very professional plan is worth let's go 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.640
 how to make the horse here to catch 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.729
 the speed went down very short race the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.160
 mountain and let's go let's see if it is given 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.840
 a touch something because if it is not worth they are 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.640
 super puncher is super puncher what 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.950
 I have what I have what I have what I have what 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.660
 I have there I have it here in front I have it 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.660
 in the eye of the canyon 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.110
 6 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.549
 anticipate six minutes 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.549
 no not worth 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:51.539
 let's click this subscriber that goes 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.689
 varying the slipstream has to be by 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.689
 in front of 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.259
 that's not going to take for sack to take 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.560
 by sack or leave the road of 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.869
 pillas reduced uncle neither here nor pay and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.340

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.260

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.400

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.350

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.780
