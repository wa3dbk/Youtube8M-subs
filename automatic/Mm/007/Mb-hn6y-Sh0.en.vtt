hello<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.200> Mike<00:00:07.500> rj11<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.849> this

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
hello this is Mike rj11 and in this

hello this is Mike rj11 and in this
video<00:00:09.210> I'm<00:00:09.330> going<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.510> be<00:00:09.630> replacing<00:00:10.019> my<00:00:10.320> spark

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
video I'm going to be replacing my spark

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.350 
video I'm going to be replacing my spark
plugs<00:00:10.889> but<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.519> also<00:00:11.700> thought<00:00:11.969> I'd<00:00:12.120> do<00:00:12.269> an

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
plugs but I also thought I'd do an

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.209 
plugs but I also thought I'd do an
experiment<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:12.929> somebody<00:00:13.259> else<00:00:13.410> telling<00:00:14.130> me

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
experiment that somebody else telling me

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.519 
experiment that somebody else telling me
on<00:00:14.309> YouTube<00:00:14.580> suggested<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.210> try<00:00:15.440> so<00:00:16.440> they

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
on YouTube suggested I try so they

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.490 
on YouTube suggested I try so they
suggested<00:00:16.770> why<00:00:17.220> not<00:00:17.250> see<00:00:17.789> if<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.779> spark<00:00:19.320> if

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
suggested why not see if the spark if

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.620 
suggested why not see if the spark if
the<00:00:19.800> engine<00:00:20.160> has<00:00:20.189> more<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:20.699> less<00:00:20.880> vibration

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the engine has more or less vibration

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.750 
the engine has more or less vibration
before<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.350> after<00:00:22.949> changing<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.400> spark

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
before and after changing the spark

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.429 
before and after changing the spark
plugs<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.630> might<00:00:24.779> indicate<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
plugs and that might indicate that the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.689 
plugs and that might indicate that the
engine<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.740> running<00:00:25.980> better<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.550> has<00:00:26.670> less

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
engine is running better if it has less

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.150 
engine is running better if it has less
vibration<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.230> thought<00:00:28.470> why<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.800> that'd<00:00:29.070> be

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
vibration so I thought why not that'd be

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
vibration so I thought why not that'd be
pretty<00:00:29.310> easy<00:00:29.539> smartphones<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.869> many

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
pretty easy smartphones have so many

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.840 
pretty easy smartphones have so many
thousands<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.890> apps<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:32.700> maybe

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
thousands of apps in the or maybe

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.370 
thousands of apps in the or maybe
probably<00:00:33.300> millions<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.840> apps<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> App

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
probably millions of apps in the App

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.340 
probably millions of apps in the App
Store<00:00:34.410> or<00:00:34.829> Google<00:00:35.309> Play<00:00:35.940> Store<00:00:36.120> rather<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.200> why

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
Store or Google Play Store rather so why

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.610 
Store or Google Play Store rather so why
not<00:00:37.530> find<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.540> an<00:00:39.540> app<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:40.110> measuring

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
not find it an app for measuring

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.910 
not find it an app for measuring
vibration<00:00:40.829> using<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.850> accelerometer<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
vibration using the accelerometer and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.369 
vibration using the accelerometer and
see<00:00:43.920> see<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.899> find<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.050> difference

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
see see if I can find a difference

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.770 
see see if I can find a difference
before<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.129> after<00:00:47.250> spark<00:00:47.670> plug<00:00:47.820> change<00:00:48.120> so

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
before and after spark plug change so

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.369 
before and after spark plug change so
this<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.670> vibro<00:00:50.670> meter<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:52.020> first<00:00:52.230> app

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this just vibro meter just the first app

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.170 
this just vibro meter just the first app
that<00:00:52.410> came<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:53.879> when<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
that came up and as you can see when I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.900 
that came up and as you can see when I
move<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.600> around<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.129> records<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.340> maximum

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
move it around it records the maximum

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.170 
move it around it records the maximum
and<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.750> mean<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.770> average<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.370> well

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and the mean and the average or well

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
and the mean and the average or well
notice<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> instant<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.440> big<00:01:01.590> thumper<00:01:01.980> there

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
notice the instant the big thumper there

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.280 
notice the instant the big thumper there
but<00:01:02.910> I'll<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.600> will<00:01:04.019> see<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.229> if

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
but I'll see what it will see what if

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
but I'll see what it will see what if
that's<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.309> got<00:01:05.489> stick<00:01:05.640> my<00:01:05.790> phone<00:01:06.030> on

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that's so you just got stick my phone on

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
that's so you just got stick my phone on
the<00:01:06.450> engine<00:01:07.020> block<00:01:07.049> here<00:01:07.439> somewhere

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the engine block here somewhere

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890 
the engine block here somewhere
I<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.670> stick<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.450> something

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
I just stick it like here or something

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.179 
I just stick it like here or something
somewhere<00:01:10.500> where<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
somewhere where I can get it in the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.760 
somewhere where I can get it in the
exact<00:01:11.460> same<00:01:11.670> spot<00:01:11.880> every<00:01:12.150> time<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.260> then

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
exact same spot every time and then

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.020 
exact same spot every time and then
we'll<00:01:13.920> start<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> engine<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:14.850> 10

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
we'll start up the engine for like 10

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.090 
we'll start up the engine for like 10
seconds<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> let<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.409> run<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
seconds and let it run and see what the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.170 
seconds and let it run and see what the
average<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.549> I've<00:01:20.640> got<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:20.939> phone

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
average is and so I've got my phone

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.600 
average is and so I've got my phone
duct-taped<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.810> my<00:01:21.960> engine<00:01:22.290> because<00:01:23.159> before<00:01:23.549> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
duct-taped on my engine because before I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
duct-taped on my engine because before I
tried<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.330> setting<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.470> it

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
tried just setting it here but it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
tried just setting it here but it
flipped<00:01:25.799> over<00:01:25.950> when<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.310> started<00:01:26.820> starting<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
flipped over when I started starting the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:41.160 
flipped over when I started starting the
engine

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170

all<00:01:53.850> right<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.420> are<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> old<00:01:54.780> ones<00:01:54.869> out

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
all right so here are the old ones out

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.639 
all right so here are the old ones out
just<00:01:56.189> look<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:56.789> and<00:01:57.110> I'd<00:01:58.110> say<00:01:58.289> these<00:01:58.409> have

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
just look at them and I'd say these have

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.060 
just look at them and I'd say these have
probably<00:01:59.250> been<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.880> about<00:02:00.860> thousand<00:02:01.860> miles

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
probably been in about thousand miles

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.119 
probably been in about thousand miles
since<00:02:02.429> I<00:02:02.700> recap<00:02:03.450> them<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.100> clean<00:02:05.100> them<00:02:05.219> off<00:02:05.369> so

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
since I recap them and clean them off so

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:12.290 
since I recap them and clean them off so
it's<00:02:08.129> kind<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.369> crusty<00:02:08.789> again<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:12.090> is

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
it's kind of crusty again this is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.040 
it's kind of crusty again this is
probably<00:02:12.739> yeah<00:02:14.540> actually<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.900> probably

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
probably yeah actually this is probably

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.789 
probably yeah actually this is probably
the<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.410> has<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.800> shortest<00:02:17.099> electrode

so<00:02:22.799> here<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.340> can<00:02:23.489> compare<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.239> new<00:02:24.510> one

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
so here you can compare it to a new one

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.020 
so here you can compare it to a new one
and<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:25.830> can<00:02:26.010> see<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.489> electrode<00:02:26.910> is

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
and you can see that the electrode is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.550 
and you can see that the electrode is
certainly<00:02:27.360> longer<00:02:29.209> so<00:02:30.209> these<00:02:31.110> are<00:02:31.290> certainly

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
certainly longer so these are certainly

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.729 
certainly longer so these are certainly
starting<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.130> they're<00:02:33.120> starting<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.709> run<00:02:34.709> low

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
starting to they're starting to run low

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.449 
starting to they're starting to run low
on<00:02:34.950> iridium<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.030> guess<00:02:36.769> this<00:02:37.769> one<00:02:37.950> here<00:02:38.130> doesn't

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
on iridium I guess this one here doesn't

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.240 
on iridium I guess this one here doesn't
look<00:02:38.549> like<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:38.880> very<00:02:39.150> uh<00:02:39.950> eaten<00:02:40.950> away<00:02:41.069> it

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
look like it's very uh eaten away it

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.420 
look like it's very uh eaten away it
looks<00:02:41.610> pretty<00:02:41.880> good<00:02:42.860> but<00:02:43.860> they<00:02:44.069> all<00:02:44.190> still

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
looks pretty good but they all still

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.940 
looks pretty good but they all still
have<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.700> crusty<00:02:45.180> stuff<00:02:45.239> on<00:02:45.630> them<00:02:45.950> this

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
have that crusty stuff on them this

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.559 
have that crusty stuff on them this
one's<00:02:47.190> kind<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.549> brownish<00:02:47.849> color<00:02:48.060> there

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
one's kind of a brownish color there

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.600 
one's kind of a brownish color there
this<00:02:49.170> one's<00:02:49.380> nice<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.620> white<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.310> think<00:02:50.489> this

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
this one's nice and white I think this

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.520 
this one's nice and white I think this
one<00:02:50.790> probably<00:02:51.060> looks<00:02:51.239> bout<00:02:51.930> how<00:02:52.079> they<00:02:52.230> should

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
one probably looks bout how they should

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.100 
one probably looks bout how they should
look<00:02:52.739> this<00:02:53.549> one's<00:02:53.760> got<00:02:53.970> an<00:02:54.329> extra<00:02:54.840> amount<00:02:54.900> of

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
look this one's got an extra amount of

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.740 
look this one's got an extra amount of
crusty<00:02:55.560> stuff<00:02:56.209> especially<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.480> middle

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
crusty stuff especially on the middle

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.390 
crusty stuff especially on the middle
part<00:02:58.200> there<00:02:58.549> this<00:02:59.549> one<00:02:59.760> doesn't<00:03:00.510> look<00:03:00.630> too<00:03:00.870> bad

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
part there this one doesn't look too bad

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.210 
part there this one doesn't look too bad
so<00:03:02.400> these<00:03:02.790> two<00:03:03.060> mid<00:03:03.329> middle<00:03:03.780> cylinder<00:03:04.350> ones

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
so these two mid middle cylinder ones

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.740 
so these two mid middle cylinder ones
are<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.030> ones<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.329> I'd<00:03:06.510> say<00:03:06.750> look<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.470> worst

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
are the ones that I'd say look the worst

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.520 
are the ones that I'd say look the worst
but<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.049> don't<00:03:10.950> know<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:12.959> one<00:03:13.109> looks

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
but I don't know so that one looks

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.349 
but I don't know so that one looks
pretty<00:03:13.739> good<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:15.090> one<00:03:15.239> looks<00:03:15.450> okay<00:03:16.049> but

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
pretty good and this one looks okay but

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.930 
pretty good and this one looks okay but
the<00:03:18.359> two<00:03:18.540> middle<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.139> um<00:03:19.290> there's<00:03:19.940> look

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
the two middle so um there's look

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.690 
the two middle so um there's look
probably<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.900> worst<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:22.889> let's<00:03:23.220> put<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.579> new

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
probably the worst so let's put the new

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.840 
probably the worst so let's put the new
ones<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:25.069> so<00:03:26.069> yeah<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.519> then<00:03:26.700> we'll

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
ones in and so yeah and then we'll

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.059 
ones in and so yeah and then we'll
measure<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.299> vibration<00:03:28.290> after<00:03:28.590> we<00:03:28.769> put<00:03:28.950> them

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
measure the vibration after we put them

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.949 
measure the vibration after we put them
in<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.340> see<00:03:29.519> if<00:03:29.609> it's<00:03:29.730> any<00:03:29.819> different<00:03:29.959> all

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
in and see if it's any different all

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.120 
in and see if it's any different all
right<00:03:31.079> so<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.230> got<00:03:31.380> him<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.709> tighten<00:03:31.980> them<00:03:32.069> down

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
right so I got him and tighten them down

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.059 
right so I got him and tighten them down
and<00:03:32.569> I<00:03:33.569> just<00:03:33.780> went<00:03:33.959> with<00:03:34.049> what<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.500> think<00:03:34.920> it

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
and I just went with what I think it

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.009 
and I just went with what I think it
says<00:03:35.250> on<00:03:35.430> here<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.359> seems<00:03:36.569> about<00:03:36.750> right

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
says on here and it seems about right

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.920 
says on here and it seems about right
so<00:03:37.620> 14<00:03:38.549> am<00:03:38.760> not<00:03:39.000> really<00:03:39.120> sure<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.660> might<00:03:39.810> be

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
so 14 am not really sure that might be

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.610 
so 14 am not really sure that might be
the<00:03:40.049> socket<00:03:40.440> size<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.950> then<00:03:41.519> 1/2<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.239> 2/3<00:03:42.870> so

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
the socket size and then 1/2 to 2/3 so

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.550 
the socket size and then 1/2 to 2/3 so
1/2<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.639> 2/3<00:03:45.030> turn<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:45.959> did<00:03:46.109> that<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.470> it

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
1/2 to 2/3 turn and I did that and it

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.830 
1/2 to 2/3 turn and I did that and it
felt<00:03:47.010> pretty<00:03:47.130> good<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.519> felt<00:03:47.760> like<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.329> forget

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
felt pretty good it felt like I forget

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.330 
felt pretty good it felt like I forget
how<00:03:48.930> many<00:03:48.989> pounds<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.650> force<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:50.069> supposed<00:03:50.310> to

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
how many pounds of force you supposed to

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.050 
how many pounds of force you supposed to
put<00:03:50.519> on<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.760> but<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.120> thought<00:03:51.419> about<00:03:51.630> right<00:03:51.870> so

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
put on it but I thought about right so

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.360 
put on it but I thought about right so
so<00:03:54.060> yeah<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:55.230> now<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:55.380> just<00:03:55.560> got<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.889> put<00:03:56.250> the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
so yeah so now I just got to put the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.780 
so yeah so now I just got to put the
spark<00:03:56.819> plugs<00:03:57.090> or<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.829> mag<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:59.190> whatever<00:03:59.639> these

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
spark plugs or the mag to whatever these

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.449 
spark plugs or the mag to whatever these
things<00:04:00.000> are<00:04:00.150> called<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.950> coils<00:04:01.950> back<00:04:02.129> on<00:04:02.340> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
things are called the coils back on the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.449 
things are called the coils back on the
coil<00:04:02.640> packs<00:04:02.909> so<00:04:03.599> put<00:04:03.900> these<00:04:03.989> back<00:04:04.230> on<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.650> got

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
coil packs so put these back on I got

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.080 
coil packs so put these back on I got
some<00:04:05.700> grease

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
some grease

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.059 
some grease
to<00:04:06.269> some<00:04:07.019> spark<00:04:07.379> plug<00:04:07.590> boot<00:04:07.890> grease<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:09.920> put<00:04:10.920> in

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
to some spark plug boot grease to put in

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.949 
to some spark plug boot grease to put in
the<00:04:11.160> end<00:04:11.310> here<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.760> help<00:04:12.239> insulate<00:04:12.569> it<00:04:12.810> better

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
the end here to help insulate it better

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.170 
the end here to help insulate it better
so<00:04:13.410> let's<00:04:13.739> put<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.160> all<00:04:14.760> right<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.030> put

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
so let's put that in all right so put

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.689 
so let's put that in all right so put
some<00:04:15.450> spark<00:04:15.750> plug<00:04:16.139> grease<00:04:16.620> on<00:04:16.859> there<00:04:17.070> or<00:04:17.519> a

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
some spark plug grease on there or a

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:18.920 
some spark plug grease on there or a
dielectric<00:04:18.150> grease<00:04:18.239> whatever<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.720> want<00:04:18.870> to

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
dielectric grease whatever you want to

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.710 
dielectric grease whatever you want to
call<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.199> and<00:04:19.410> stick<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:20.310> down<00:04:20.489> in<00:04:20.549> there<00:04:20.820> and

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
call it and stick it down in there and

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.180 
call it and stick it down in there and
now<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.870> can<00:04:21.989> bolt<00:04:22.260> everything<00:04:22.590> down<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.919> put

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
now you can bolt everything down and put

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.780 
now you can bolt everything down and put
it<00:04:23.280> back<00:04:23.370> together

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
it back together

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.820 
it back together
alright<00:04:24.449> smell<00:04:24.840> it's<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.169> moment<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.590> truth

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
alright smell it's the moment of truth

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.680 
alright smell it's the moment of truth
to<00:04:26.010> see<00:04:26.040> if<00:04:26.280> there's<00:04:26.430> any<00:04:26.970> change<00:04:27.389> in<00:04:27.630> the

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
to see if there's any change in the

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.210 
to see if there's any change in the
amount<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.990> vibration<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.680> engine<00:04:28.800> after

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
amount of vibration of the engine after

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.570 
amount of vibration of the engine after
I<00:04:29.280> change<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.760> spark<00:04:30.000> plugs

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580

[Music]

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:05:11.519 

[Music]

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:11.529 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:29.370 

you

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.530 

so<00:05:29.980> after<00:05:30.250> examining<00:05:30.670> the<00:05:30.730> before-and-after

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
so after examining the before-and-after

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.770 
so after examining the before-and-after
footage<00:05:31.840> I<00:05:32.080> don't<00:05:32.620> see<00:05:32.800> much<00:05:32.920> of<00:05:32.980> a<00:05:33.130> difference

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
footage I don't see much of a difference

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.720 
footage I don't see much of a difference
they<00:05:34.780> both<00:05:34.960> ended<00:05:35.260> up<00:05:35.380> with<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.770> final<00:05:36.310> value<00:05:36.700> of

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
they both ended up with a final value of

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.430 
they both ended up with a final value of
5.9<00:05:37.630> that's<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.020> average

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
5.9 that's the average

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.620 
5.9 that's the average
whether<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.610> app<00:05:39.760> is<00:05:40.030> good<00:05:40.240> or<00:05:40.420> my

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
whether the app is good or my

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.750 
whether the app is good or my
accelerometer<00:05:40.990> is<00:05:41.320> very<00:05:42.040> accurate<00:05:42.280> I<00:05:42.610> don't

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
accelerometer is very accurate I don't

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.800 
accelerometer is very accurate I don't
know<00:05:42.910> but<00:05:43.240> it<00:05:43.780> seems<00:05:43.990> pretty<00:05:44.080> good<00:05:44.440> so<00:05:45.780> so<00:05:46.780> I

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
know but it seems pretty good so so I

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.440 
know but it seems pretty good so so I
guess<00:05:46.990> this<00:05:47.170> means<00:05:47.530> as<00:05:48.490> as<00:05:48.910> far<00:05:49.240> as<00:05:49.330> the

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
guess this means as as far as the

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.500 
guess this means as as far as the
vibration<00:05:49.930> means<00:05:50.170> art<00:05:50.590> shows<00:05:50.890> that<00:05:51.390> like<00:05:52.390> ice

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
vibration means art shows that like ice

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.340 
vibration means art shows that like ice
or<00:05:52.660> may<00:05:53.050> not<00:05:53.260> be<00:05:53.500> much<00:05:53.800> of<00:05:53.860> a<00:05:54.070> improve<00:05:55.350> improved

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
or may not be much of a improve improved

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.410 
or may not be much of a improve improved
fuel<00:05:57.010> efficiency<00:05:57.100> but<00:05:57.790> I<00:05:57.910> don't<00:05:58.060> know<00:05:58.120> I<00:05:58.300> have

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
fuel efficiency but I don't know I have

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.890 
fuel efficiency but I don't know I have
a<00:05:58.480> cold

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
a cold

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.080 
a cold
so<00:05:59.350> but<00:05:59.950> anyways<00:06:00.190> that's<00:06:00.490> about<00:06:00.640> it<00:06:00.820> hope<00:06:00.970> you

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
so but anyways that's about it hope you

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.850 
so but anyways that's about it hope you
enjoy<00:06:01.270> this<00:06:01.420> experiment<00:06:01.990> that's<00:06:02.530> about<00:06:02.710> it

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
enjoy this experiment that's about it

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.610 
enjoy this experiment that's about it
thanks<00:06:03.160> for<00:06:03.310> watching
