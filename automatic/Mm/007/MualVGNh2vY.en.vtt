 tonight 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.470
 some games are historically very 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.970
 related to the practice of lan quake iii 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.769
 has no real solo mode he has 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.360
 precisely designed and calibrated for 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.140

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.450
 gatherings 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.040
 the fps and the rts in any case was this the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.420
 case until the appearance of moba that 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.910
 some consider it a sub genre 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.349
 rts these are complex games that 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.349
 ask for high degree of mastery 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.250
 technical and theoretical 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.150

 under certain advanced techniques 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.709
 considered essential to get 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.590

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.099
 learns everything is learned especially when

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.110
 occasional gatherings sometimes 

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:47.939
 gigantic attracting hundreds of 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.889
 players and stretching over several days 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:53.569
 participants sing with frenzy 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.569

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.930
 the oils and again last what I have 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.890

 body in its last limits 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.250
 but that also help to make 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.840
 to reach a state of ecstasy video game 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.770
