these<00:02:12.060> two<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:12.540> files<00:02:12.750> right<00:02:13.020> here

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
these two little files right here

maybe<00:03:02.010> perhaps<00:03:02.400> there's<00:03:02.820> some<00:03:03.060> files<00:03:03.270> that

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
maybe perhaps there's some files that

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.270 
maybe perhaps there's some files that
don't<00:03:03.570> work<00:03:03.750> but<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.020> mean<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.890> every<00:03:05.040> one<00:03:05.190> that

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
don't work but I mean for every one that

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.490 
don't work but I mean for every one that
I've<00:03:05.430> tested<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.270> was<00:03:06.390> only<00:03:06.510> for<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.900> you

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
I've tested but it was only for you you

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.380 
I've tested but it was only for you you
can<00:03:07.650> download<00:03:07.830> any<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.310> these<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.790> be<00:03:09.090> our

can download any of these that be our

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.790 
can download any of these that be our
STM<00:03:10.110> files<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:13.459> once<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.580> have<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.209> can

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
STM files so once you have that you can

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
straightforward software it's not needed

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.140 
straightforward software it's not needed
and<00:04:35.290> then<00:04:36.130> you<00:04:36.340> could<00:04:36.490> put<00:04:36.730> this<00:04:36.850> stuff

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
and then you could put this stuff

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
file or di I'm not sure what that stands

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.540 
file or di I'm not sure what that stands
for

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
for

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.840 
for
I<00:04:45.580> forget<00:04:45.940> actually<00:04:46.680> anyhow<00:04:47.680> so<00:04:48.490> you'd<00:04:48.610> open

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
I forget actually anyhow so you'd open

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:56.780 
I forget actually anyhow so you'd open
up<00:04:48.940> this<00:04:49.890> double<00:04:50.890> click<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.420> file<00:04:53.190> open<00:04:54.190> and

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.580 

then<00:04:57.790> as<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:58.240> can<00:04:58.360> see<00:04:58.420> here<00:04:58.750> there's<00:04:59.500> your

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
then as you can see here there's your

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.680 
then as you can see here there's your
file<00:04:59.919> it'll<00:05:00.520> be<00:05:00.640> wherever<00:05:00.820> you<00:05:00.940> put<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:01.390> put

file it'll be wherever you put it I put

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.120 
file it'll be wherever you put it I put
it<00:05:01.990> in<00:05:02.110> my<00:05:02.169> desktop<00:05:02.410> so<00:05:02.710> I'm<00:05:02.800> gonna<00:05:02.950> double

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
it in my desktop so I'm gonna double

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.310 
it in my desktop so I'm gonna double
click<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.700> as<00:05:04.570> you'll<00:05:04.720> see<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:05.200> can

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
click that and as you'll see you can

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:13.860 
click that and as you'll see you can
play<00:05:05.500> it<00:05:11.760> now<00:05:12.760> plays<00:05:13.060> this<00:05:13.150> Long's<00:05:13.390> perfectly

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
play it now plays this Long's perfectly

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.920 
play it now plays this Long's perfectly
so<00:05:14.140> then<00:05:15.100> I<00:05:15.130> believe<00:05:15.820> you<00:05:16.180> want<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.419> save<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:16.660> as

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
so then I believe you want to save it as

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.010 
so then I believe you want to save it as
a<00:05:20.220> WAV<00:05:21.220> file<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:21.580> guess<00:05:21.940> let's<00:05:22.390> see<00:05:22.600> here<00:05:22.870> oh

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
a WAV file I guess let's see here oh

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.780 
a WAV file I guess let's see here oh
okay<00:05:23.560> you<00:05:23.620> want<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:23.890> do<00:05:24.010> the<00:05:24.100> uncompressed<00:05:24.580> PCM

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
okay you want to do the uncompressed PCM

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.580 
okay you want to do the uncompressed PCM
so<00:05:25.390> dot<00:05:25.630> wave<00:05:25.810> would<00:05:26.050> definitely<00:05:26.500> be

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
so dot wave would definitely be

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.200 
so dot wave would definitely be
beneficial<00:05:26.850> so<00:05:27.850> the<00:05:27.970> name<00:05:28.150> of<00:05:28.270> garden<00:05:28.570> for<00:05:28.720> me

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
beneficial so the name of garden for me

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.650 
beneficial so the name of garden for me
okay<00:05:31.210> so<00:05:32.169> and<00:05:32.560> then<00:05:32.650> there<00:05:32.890> it<00:05:32.979> is<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:34.630> should

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
okay so and then there it is you should

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.659 
okay so and then there it is you should
be<00:05:34.960> able<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.169> listen<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.500> it<00:05:35.620> sometimes<00:05:36.520> you

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
be able to listen to it sometimes you

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.030 
be able to listen to it sometimes you
can't<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:38.050> in<00:05:38.740> my<00:05:38.860> case<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:39.220> can<00:05:40.919> some<00:05:41.919> of

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
can't but in my case you can some of

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.920 
can't but in my case you can some of
that<00:05:42.130> is<00:05:42.340> all<00:05:42.580> that<00:05:42.760> is<00:05:42.850> required<00:05:42.880> however<00:05:43.570> if

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
that is all that is required however if

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.390 
that is all that is required however if
you<00:05:44.020> want<00:05:44.290> to<00:05:44.380> use<00:05:44.500> something<00:05:44.740> like<00:05:44.860> iTunes

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
you want to use something like iTunes

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.460 
you want to use something like iTunes
I'm<00:05:45.910> not<00:05:46.030> entirely<00:05:46.300> sure<00:05:46.450> if<00:05:46.720> iTunes<00:05:47.169> can

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
I'm not entirely sure if iTunes can

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.800 
I'm not entirely sure if iTunes can
allow<00:05:47.710> this<00:05:47.919> can<00:05:48.760> allow<00:05:48.910> a<00:05:48.940> WAV<00:05:49.210> file<00:05:49.479> so<00:05:49.720> if

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
allow this can allow a WAV file so if

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.640 
allow this can allow a WAV file so if
you<00:05:49.870> want<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.050> put<00:05:50.140> on<00:05:50.229> your<00:05:50.290> iPod<00:05:50.620> or
