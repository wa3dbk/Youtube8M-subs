00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
at nighttime because of the night vision

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.130 
at nighttime because of the night vision
whether<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.240> use<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:06.570> not<00:02:06.750> obviously

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
whether you use it or not obviously

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.020 
whether you use it or not obviously
that's<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.619> even<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.550> chose

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
to use it without the night vision I

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.750 
to use it without the night vision I
think<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.649> still<00:02:10.800> looks<00:02:10.950> pretty<00:02:10.979> badass<00:02:11.340> just

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
think it still looks pretty badass just

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.840 
think it still looks pretty badass just
because<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> actually

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
because I actually

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.670 
because I actually
do<00:02:13.030> like<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.420> flight<00:02:13.690> pants<00:02:14.140> like<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:14.620> a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
do like the flight pants like it it's a

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.900 
do like the flight pants like it it's a
different<00:02:14.830> look<00:02:15.160> than<00:02:15.340> from<00:02:15.610> what<00:02:15.760> we've<00:02:15.880> seen

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
different look than from what we've seen

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.050 
different look than from what we've seen
and<00:02:16.420> other<00:02:17.110> sort<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.800> military<00:02:18.040> esque<00:02:18.550> outfits

but<00:02:19.480> overall<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.410> definitely<00:02:20.830> think<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.070> a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
but overall I definitely think it's a

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.310 
but overall I definitely think it's a
great<00:02:21.400> one<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:22.360> know<00:02:22.540> for<00:02:22.840> all<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.050> people
