guy and this is again held like a nice

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.730 
guy and this is again held like a nice
pretty<00:01:45.540> much<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> knife<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:46.500> you

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
pretty much like a knife so I think you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.800 
pretty much like a knife so I think you
could<00:01:46.890> find<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.220> very<00:01:47.399> easy<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.060> shoot<00:01:48.540> with

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
could find it very easy to shoot with

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
could find it very easy to shoot with
that<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:53.369> I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
that and you know just like that but I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.819 
that and you know just like that but I
recommend<00:01:54.240> starting<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.899> paintballs<00:01:55.560> first

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
recommend starting with paintballs first

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.740 
recommend starting with paintballs first
until<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.790> developed<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.299> feeling<00:01:57.600> for

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
until you have developed a feeling for

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.139

now<00:02:37.769> what<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:39.000> he<00:02:39.269> saw<00:02:39.480> it

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
now what this is and he saw it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.300 
now what this is and he saw it
demonstrated<00:02:40.290> today<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:42.590> it's<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:44.010> very

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
demonstrated today and it's a very

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.500 
demonstrated today and it's a very
flexible<00:02:44.640> type<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.390> rubber<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.489> on<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.060> end

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
flexible type of rubber and on the end

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.309 
flexible type of rubber and on the end
of<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.080> where<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.500> would<00:02:49.709> see<00:02:50.870> sticking<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
of it where you would see sticking and

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.820 
of it where you would see sticking and
cutting<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.330> cloth<00:02:54.330> much<00:02:54.870> like<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> cloth<00:02:55.560> of

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
cutting is a cloth much like a cloth of

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.430 
cutting is a cloth much like a cloth of
a<00:02:55.920> shirt<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.880> sewn<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.569> so<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:57.959> never<00:02:58.170> going

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
a shirt but sewn in so it's never going

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.160 
a shirt but sewn in so it's never going
to<00:02:58.560> come<00:02:58.709> off<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.760> put<00:03:00.060> red<00:03:00.420> lipstick<00:03:00.989> on

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
to come off and you put red lipstick on

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.860 
to come off and you put red lipstick on
it<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.160> I'll<00:03:02.489> just<00:03:02.760> use<00:03:02.970> his<00:03:03.180> cheek<00:03:03.480> here

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
it and so I'll just use his cheek here

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.289 
it and so I'll just use his cheek here
you<00:03:04.860> would<00:03:05.040> see<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> cut<00:03:05.670> if<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.150> were

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
you would see a cut if we were

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.089 
you would see a cut if we were
practicing<00:03:06.810> now<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.319> course<00:03:07.530> if<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:07.920> do

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
practicing now of course if you do

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.849 
practicing now of course if you do
practice<00:03:08.610> with<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:08.940> eye<00:03:09.180> protection<00:03:09.989> you

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
practice with this eye protection you

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.530 
practice with this eye protection you
know<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.459> course<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.760> go<00:03:11.940> light<00:03:12.239> you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
know and of course you go light you

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.120 
know and of course you go light you
don't<00:03:12.660> want<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.019> hurt<00:03:13.170> somebody<00:03:13.560> with<00:03:13.620> us<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
don't want to hurt somebody with us and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.780 
don't want to hurt somebody with us and
then<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.600> bottom<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.650> blue<00:03:17.100> color<00:03:17.459> and

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
then on the bottom is a blue color and

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.990 
then on the bottom is a blue color and
if<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.359> hit<00:03:18.720> him<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.019> forehead<00:03:19.670> this<00:03:20.670> would

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
if I hit him in the forehead this would

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.750 
if I hit him in the forehead this would
show<00:03:21.299> an<00:03:21.630> impact<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:22.950> class<00:03:23.220> we<00:03:23.549> wear<00:03:23.730> a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
show an impact but in class we wear a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.440 
show an impact but in class we wear a
helmet<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:25.040> what's<00:03:26.040> great<00:03:26.280> about<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.819> is<00:03:27.150> if

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
helmet but what's great about this is if

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.250 
helmet but what's great about this is if
he<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.109> attacker<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.920> he's<00:03:29.370> coming<00:03:29.790> at<00:03:29.940> me

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
he is the attacker and he's coming at me

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.129 
he is the attacker and he's coming at me
then<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.859> course<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.340> lets<00:03:32.609> me<00:03:32.819> know<00:03:33.000> after<00:03:33.959> the

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
then of course it lets me know after the

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.500 
then of course it lets me know after the
fight<00:03:34.410> what<00:03:35.160> kind<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.549> injuries<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.150> would<00:03:36.359> have

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
fight what kind of injuries I would have

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.440 
fight what kind of injuries I would have
got<00:03:36.720> maybe<00:03:37.319> nothing<00:03:37.950> but<00:03:38.220> at<00:03:38.489> least<00:03:38.670> defensive

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
rubber but what is also I mean using

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.259 
rubber but what is also I mean using
this<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.379> teaches<00:04:00.799> you<00:04:01.010> how<00:04:01.519> many<00:04:01.579> cuts<00:04:02.060> you

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
this it teaches you how many cuts you

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.000 
this it teaches you how many cuts you
would<00:04:02.450> have<00:04:02.569> gotten<00:04:02.840> in<00:04:03.049> real<00:04:03.260> life<00:04:03.500> in<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:03.829> real
