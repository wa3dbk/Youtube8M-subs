00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
 the global banking summit drawn from 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.770
 always humanity as if they were 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.160
 training cattle you want one 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.490
 test 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.200
 the very simple letter all these 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.509
 leaders know that the money for the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.580
 men like water for fish in times 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.740
 of Sicily that make the fish abandon 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.380
 dry areas and go into puddles 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.510
 of water on this rule the bankers 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.910
 of the nineteenth century they have moved millions of 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.550
 men from Europe to North America 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.550
 creating monetary rarity in Europe and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.200
 plenty of currency in america what 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.780
 you have to do then to solve the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.250
 immigration problem us 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.200
 we said it 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.489
 every people must be owner 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.899
 of its currency 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.270
 that is us when they come here 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.809
 non-EU is right that we call 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.820
 their second due hospitality 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.670
 there is no doubt Christian conscience here 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.750
 you have to have hospitality though you need to 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.489
 tell him if you want money at your home 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.949
 you must have ownership of yours 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.320
 money then every people to understand 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.049
 do this you must put against the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.479
 respective central bank because the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.650
 property should be removed the central bank goes 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.600
 returned to the people 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.920
 when people come back to be i 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.439
 masters of their currency 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.340
 the group of livestock breeders 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.049
 human being that is the great usurers who are 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.850
 become the masters of the world and that 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.880
 treat men as if it were 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.189
 let's dress for training this isn't it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.979
 will no longer tolerate it will no longer exist 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.610
 when we see that for example in the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.380
 kosovo 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.409
 there are the bullets that carry uranium 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 impoverished and causing diseases that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.460
 we know now when this is manufactured 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.950
 bullet it is clear that it is done in 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.549
 function of certain purposes for these 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.579
 purposes are foreseen because it is foreseeable 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.509
 so wanted that is who uses this is 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.329
 as if I use disinfectants for 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.229
 to kill parasites that are in 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.150
 countryside 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.729
 I want to kill parasites 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.100
 yes i do i take the pump i put 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.230
 the water I put in the copper sulfate 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.270
 of the acts of always so many vases in 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.730
 campaign and disinfect months they have 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.070
 have said how they kill i 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.020
 microbes and it seems to me the goal with with 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.870
 disinfectants then as the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.760
 disinfectant here is not good then that 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.020
 let's make these projects because 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.780
 once bullets are fired 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.970
 will continue to use this feature 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.830
 which leads to death 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.890
 these are death producers 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.200
 these people do not love do not love are not 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.890
 capable of loving and therefore not capable of 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.550
 serving this is people only capable of 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.830
 use for those who suffer at the beginning 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.560
 love for other jobs if 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.080
 same at the beginning of the judgment of 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.320
 value that creates utility replaces itself 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.020
 a pseudo value judgment that creates 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.780
 selfishness the principle of equity 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.670
 coincides with the ability of oneself and 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.400
 naturally on these premises yes 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.100
 trigger times of decline for that 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.220
 command the worst we are experiencing 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.519
 times of decline because unfortunately at 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.600
 top of the monetary and political system 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.550
 world 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:28.440
 there are people who consider humanity as 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.470
 if they were animal objects livestock from 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.470
 breeding
