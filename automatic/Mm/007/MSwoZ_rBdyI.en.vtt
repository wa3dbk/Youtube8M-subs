00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.329 

okay<00:00:03.949> so<00:00:04.010> um<00:00:04.840> making<00:00:05.890> nanoparticles<00:00:06.890> I<00:00:07.040> think

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:07.339 
okay so um making nanoparticles I think

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.129 
okay so um making nanoparticles I think
I've<00:00:07.490> done<00:00:07.700> this<00:00:07.880> before<00:00:08.120> but<00:00:08.389> oh<00:00:08.809> that's<00:00:08.990> the

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
I've done this before but oh that's the

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.330 
I've done this before but oh that's the
progression<00:00:09.650> on<00:00:09.770> it<00:00:09.950> so<00:00:10.129> it's<00:00:10.250> actually

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
progression on it so it's actually

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.060 
progression on it so it's actually
relatively<00:00:10.850> interesting<00:00:11.240> and<00:00:11.900> what<00:00:12.830> I've<00:00:12.920> got

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
relatively interesting and what I've got

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.670 
relatively interesting and what I've got
here<00:00:13.280> is<00:00:13.610> AB<00:00:14.240> green<00:00:14.539> tea<00:00:14.750> it's<00:00:15.049> just<00:00:15.289> a<00:00:15.379> nice

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
here is AB green tea it's just a nice

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.849 
here is AB green tea it's just a nice
cup<00:00:16.490> of<00:00:16.520> hot<00:00:16.699> green<00:00:17.119> tea<00:00:17.470> and<00:00:18.470> you<00:00:18.589> can<00:00:18.740> make

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
cup of hot green tea and you can make

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.589 
cup of hot green tea and you can make
and<00:00:19.099> none<00:00:19.279> of<00:00:19.400> particles<00:00:19.910> relatively<00:00:20.420> easily

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
and none of particles relatively easily

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.740 
and none of particles relatively easily
just<00:00:21.470> by<00:00:21.619> adding<00:00:21.949> a<00:00:22.369> metal<00:00:22.910> salt<00:00:23.150> into<00:00:23.720> the

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
just by adding a metal salt into the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.900 
just by adding a metal salt into the
green<00:00:24.019> tea<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.099> porphyrins<00:00:25.640> in<00:00:25.820> the

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
green tea and the porphyrins in the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.880 
green tea and the porphyrins in the
green<00:00:26.119> tea

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
green tea

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.310 
green tea
reduced<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.189> metal<00:00:29.119> salt<00:00:29.240> and<00:00:29.539> former

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
reduced the metal salt and former

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.770 
reduced the metal salt and former
capping<00:00:30.650> agent<00:00:31.009> around<00:00:31.130> it<00:00:31.519> and<00:00:31.669> help<00:00:32.390> it<00:00:32.540> to

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
capping agent around it and help it to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.130 
capping agent around it and help it to
stay<00:00:33.650> as<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:33.980> metal<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.390> not<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.719> format

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
stay as a metal so not to format

stay as a metal so not to format
nanoparticles<00:00:37.039> what<00:00:37.250> you<00:00:37.370> need<00:00:37.550> is<00:00:37.730> some<00:00:37.940> kind

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
nanoparticles what you need is some kind

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.260 
nanoparticles what you need is some kind
of<00:00:38.329> an<00:00:38.930> salt<00:00:39.320> precursor<00:00:39.860> now<00:00:40.820> I'm<00:00:40.969> going<00:00:41.180> to

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
of an salt precursor now I'm going to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.290 
of an salt precursor now I'm going to
use<00:00:41.480> our<00:00:41.809> three<00:00:42.050> chloride<00:00:42.609> only<00:00:43.609> because<00:00:43.850> I've

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
use our three chloride only because I've

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.630 
use our three chloride only because I've
gotten<00:00:44.750> three<00:00:45.050> chloride<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.039> can<00:00:46.190> use<00:00:46.399> on

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
gotten three chloride you can use on

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.330 
gotten three chloride you can use on
sulfates<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:47.390> assume<00:00:48.109> on<00:00:48.320> two<00:00:48.620> chlorides<00:00:49.100> as

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
sulfates and assume on two chlorides as

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.500 
sulfates and assume on two chlorides as
well<00:00:49.519> there's<00:00:49.850> lots<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.090> different<00:00:50.390> things

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
well there's lots of different things

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.560 
well there's lots of different things
that<00:00:50.719> you<00:00:50.899> can<00:00:51.079> use<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:52.239> just<00:00:53.239> get<00:00:53.480> a<00:00:53.510> little

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
that you can use and just get a little

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.799 
that you can use and just get a little
bit<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:56.620> stick<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.710> in<00:00:57.800> your<00:00:57.829> green<00:00:58.039> tea<00:00:58.809> it's

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
bit and stick it in your green tea it's

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.930 
bit and stick it in your green tea it's
fitting<00:01:00.230> because<00:01:00.320> it's<00:01:00.760> anhydrous<00:01:01.760> on

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
fitting because it's anhydrous on

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.479 
fitting because it's anhydrous on
through<00:01:02.179> chloride<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.899> that<00:01:02.929> has<00:01:03.199> a<00:01:03.489> strong

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
through chloride and that has a strong

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.880 
through chloride and that has a strong
reaction<00:01:04.699> with<00:01:05.510> water<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.500> see<00:01:06.710> what's

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
reaction with water so you see what's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.150 
reaction with water so you see what's
happened<00:01:07.250> there<00:01:07.600> now<00:01:08.600> I'm<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.320> man<00:01:09.620> 3<00:01:09.860> chloride

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
happened there now I'm to man 3 chloride

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.250 
happened there now I'm to man 3 chloride
when<00:01:10.610> added<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:11.000> water<00:01:11.150> gives<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.870> bright<00:01:12.050> red

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
when added to water gives a bright red

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.420 
when added to water gives a bright red
solution<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:13.700> this<00:01:13.940> one<00:01:14.180> is<00:01:14.540> black<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:16.310> the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
solution and this one is black and the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.150 
solution and this one is black and the
reason<00:01:16.760> this<00:01:16.910> one<00:01:17.120> is<00:01:17.270> black<00:01:17.480> is<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.860> team<00:01:19.190> has

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
reason this one is black is the team has

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.580 
reason this one is black is the team has
almost<00:01:22.160> immediately<00:01:23.290> reduced<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.440> iron

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
almost immediately reduced the iron

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.460 
almost immediately reduced the iron
salts<00:01:24.980> to<00:01:25.370> zero<00:01:25.730> a<00:01:25.850> felon<00:01:26.150> time<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:27.080> what's<00:01:27.290> in

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
salts to zero a felon time so what's in

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.010 
salts to zero a felon time so what's in
there<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:28.190> um<00:01:29.120> tea<00:01:29.920> surrounded<00:01:31.600> zero<00:01:32.600> valent

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
there is um tea surrounded zero valent

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.710 
there is um tea surrounded zero valent
are<00:01:33.230> nanoparticles<00:01:33.970> now<00:01:34.970> that's<00:01:35.540> very

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
are nanoparticles now that's very

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.380 
are nanoparticles now that's very
interesting<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:37.090> quite<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.120> nice<00:01:38.360> little

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
interesting and quite a nice little

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.170 
interesting and quite a nice little
solution<00:01:39.110> but<00:01:39.740> actually<00:01:40.400> relatively<00:01:40.850> useless

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
solution but actually relatively useless

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.480 
solution but actually relatively useless
because<00:01:42.110> you<00:01:42.680> can't<00:01:42.890> do<00:01:43.040> anything<00:01:43.190> with<00:01:43.460> it

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
because you can't do anything with it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.800 
because you can't do anything with it
the<00:01:44.150> iron<00:01:44.300> in<00:01:44.570> there<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:45.110> I'm<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:45.680> dispersed

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
the iron in there is I'm so dispersed

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.030 
the iron in there is I'm so dispersed
nothing's<00:01:47.810> gonna<00:01:47.930> happen<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.590> if<00:01:48.650> I<00:01:48.740> hold<00:01:48.920> the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
nothing's gonna happen so if I hold the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.970 
nothing's gonna happen so if I hold the
magnet<00:01:49.400> there<00:01:49.610> then<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:51.320> can't<00:01:51.560> see<00:01:51.770> anything

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
magnet there then you can't see anything

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.190 
magnet there then you can't see anything
nothing's<00:01:52.580> happening<00:01:52.880> with<00:01:53.060> darned<00:01:53.510> none<00:01:54.080> of

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
nothing's happening with darned none of

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.530 
nothing's happening with darned none of
particles<00:01:54.680> are<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:55.040> there<00:01:55.370> it's<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.450> a

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
particles are in there it's just a

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.110 
particles are in there it's just a
problem<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:57.050> how<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.320> get<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.770> mount<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.880> I'm

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
problem of how to get the mount and I'm

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.750 
problem of how to get the mount and I'm
I<00:01:59.450> was<00:01:59.870> thinking<00:02:00.380> about<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.620> problem<00:02:01.070> now<00:02:01.310> if

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
I was thinking about that problem now if

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.150 
I was thinking about that problem now if
you<00:02:02.000> reduce<00:02:02.540> that<00:02:02.570> just<00:02:03.350> be<00:02:03.470> evaporated<00:02:04.040> away

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
you reduce that just be evaporated away

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.580 
you reduce that just be evaporated away
what<00:02:04.910> you'll<00:02:05.090> get<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:05.600> thick<00:02:05.870> black<00:02:06.170> Atari

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
what you'll get is a thick black Atari

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.919 
what you'll get is a thick black Atari
substance<00:02:07.160> because<00:02:07.910> that<00:02:08.060> thick<00:02:08.300> black<00:02:08.599> tarry

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
substance because that thick black tarry

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.140 
substance because that thick black tarry
substance<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.920> are<00:02:10.039> gonna<00:02:10.310> part

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
substance is the are gonna part

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.210 
substance is the are gonna part
making<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.239> tower<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.349> says<00:02:13.590> equally

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
making a tower and it says equally

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.130 
making a tower and it says equally
useless<00:02:14.519> there<00:02:15.209> says<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:15.780> very<00:02:15.989> little

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
useless there says really very little

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.569 
useless there says really very little
you<00:02:16.319> can<00:02:16.349> deal<00:02:16.650> with<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.920> it's<00:02:17.099> quite<00:02:17.280> sticky

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
you can deal with it it's quite sticky

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.809 
you can deal with it it's quite sticky
and<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.810> what<00:02:19.049> did<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.290> occurred<00:02:20.189> to<00:02:20.220> me<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.519> do

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
and so what did it occurred to me to do

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.539 
and so what did it occurred to me to do
was<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.599> try<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.040> hydrothermally<00:02:23.040> carbonize

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
was to try to hydrothermally carbonize

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.839 
was to try to hydrothermally carbonize
it<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.420> we<00:02:24.599> would<00:02:24.840> end<00:02:25.170> up<00:02:25.349> with<00:02:25.849> carbon

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
it so that we would end up with carbon

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.800 
it so that we would end up with carbon
cans<00:02:27.620> are<00:02:28.620> nanoparticles<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:30.060> should<00:02:30.390> come

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
cans are nanoparticles that should come

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.160 
cans are nanoparticles that should come
out<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.959> solution<00:02:31.909> be<00:02:32.909> very<00:02:33.269> stable<00:02:36.170> ethically

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
out of solution be very stable ethically

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.309 
out of solution be very stable ethically
so<00:02:38.000> have<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.120> seen<00:02:39.390> other<00:02:39.599> videos<00:02:40.049> on

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
so have you seen other videos on

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.649 
so have you seen other videos on
hydrothermal<00:02:41.069> colonization<00:02:41.939> you've<00:02:42.329> seen<00:02:42.540> me

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
hydrothermal colonization you've seen me

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.960 
hydrothermal colonization you've seen me
using<00:02:42.989> this<00:02:43.109> thing<00:02:43.319> this<00:02:44.250> thing<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
using this thing this thing is a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.880 
using this thing this thing is a
three-part<00:02:45.629> fittings<00:02:46.109> that<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.470> bought<00:02:46.709> at<00:02:46.859> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
three-part fittings that I bought at the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.580 
three-part fittings that I bought at the
local<00:02:47.220> plumbers<00:02:47.519> store<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.959> it's<00:02:49.139> iron<00:02:49.319> it's

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
local plumbers store and it's iron it's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.610 
local plumbers store and it's iron it's
encoded<00:02:49.889> on<00:02:50.599> it's<00:02:51.599> about<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.840> 50<00:02:52.230> milliliter

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
encoded on it's about a 50 milliliter

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.649 
encoded on it's about a 50 milliliter
capacity<00:02:53.220> what<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.150> wrap<00:02:54.329> that<00:02:54.540> with

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
capacity what I do is wrap that with

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.979 
capacity what I do is wrap that with
PTFE<00:02:55.260> tape<00:02:56.060> bonked<00:02:57.060> one<00:02:57.269> end<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.659> really

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
PTFE tape bonked one end down really

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.619 
PTFE tape bonked one end down really
tightly<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.739> then<00:02:59.010> pour<00:02:59.700> my<00:02:59.849> tea<00:02:59.909> solution

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
tightly and then pour my tea solution

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.849 
tightly and then pour my tea solution
into<00:03:01.079> there<00:03:01.260> put<00:03:02.329> PTFE<00:03:03.329> tape<00:03:04.079> on<00:03:04.319> there<00:03:04.560> and

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
into there put PTFE tape on there and

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:05.960 
into there put PTFE tape on there and
then<00:03:05.069> screw<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.459> whole<00:03:05.579> thing<00:03:05.790> together

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
then screw the whole thing together

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.430 
then screw the whole thing together
tightly<00:03:07.159> now<00:03:08.159> you<00:03:08.220> need<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.909> fill<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.359> not<00:03:10.139> to

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
tightly now you need to fill that not to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.160 
tightly now you need to fill that not to
quite<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.950> top<00:03:11.220> about<00:03:11.549> 4/5<00:03:12.299> full<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:13.049> can

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
quite the top about 4/5 full you can

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.930 
quite the top about 4/5 full you can
leave<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> little<00:03:13.440> bit<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.680> air<00:03:13.829> in<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.159> and

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
leave a little bit of air in it and

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.360 
leave a little bit of air in it and
screw<00:03:15.569> that<00:03:15.660> whole<00:03:15.870> thing<00:03:16.109> down<00:03:16.290> once<00:03:17.250> you

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
screw that whole thing down once you

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.879 
screw that whole thing down once you
scoop<00:03:17.609> that<00:03:17.790> whole<00:03:18.030> thing<00:03:18.269> down<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:19.049> can<00:03:19.650> heat

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
scoop that whole thing down you can heat

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.680 
scoop that whole thing down you can heat
that<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.910> will<00:03:21.060> get<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> buildup<00:03:21.569> of

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
that and it will get a buildup of

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.110 
that and it will get a buildup of
pressure<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.280> buildup<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.639> temperature

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
pressure and a buildup of temperature

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.000 
pressure and a buildup of temperature
now<00:03:24.510> I've<00:03:24.720> been<00:03:24.900> using<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.440> thing<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.889> do

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
now I've been using this thing to do

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.129 
now I've been using this thing to do
hydrothermal<00:03:26.639> carbonization<00:03:27.139> experiments

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
hydrothermal carbonization experiments

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.490 
hydrothermal carbonization experiments
for<00:03:28.849> weeks<00:03:29.849> now<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.810> it's<00:03:31.019> actually<00:03:31.230> doing<00:03:31.440> a

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
for weeks now and it's actually doing a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.580 
for weeks now and it's actually doing a
really<00:03:31.650> quite<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:31.859> good<00:03:32.099> job<00:03:32.129> so<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.590> wouldn't

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
really quite a good job so I wouldn't

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.199 
really quite a good job so I wouldn't
really<00:03:34.799> worry<00:03:35.069> too<00:03:35.430> much<00:03:35.459> about<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.970> pressure

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
really worry too much about the pressure

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.869 
really worry too much about the pressure
build-up<00:03:36.690> those<00:03:37.049> things<00:03:37.319> are<00:03:37.609> directed<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.849> a

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
build-up those things are directed to a

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.220 
build-up those things are directed to a
pressure<00:03:39.209> greater<00:03:39.599> than<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.049> pressure

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
pressure greater than the pressure

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.259 
pressure greater than the pressure
you're<00:03:40.470> gonna<00:03:40.650> get<00:03:40.889> just<00:03:41.430> by<00:03:41.579> heating<00:03:41.760> that

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
you're gonna get just by heating that

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.119 
you're gonna get just by heating that
so<00:03:42.750> once<00:03:42.900> I've<00:03:43.049> made<00:03:43.169> up<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.440> tea<00:03:43.590> solution

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
so once I've made up the tea solution

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.069 
so once I've made up the tea solution
what<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.000> did<00:03:45.180> was<00:03:45.299> stick<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.599> on<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.780> radiator

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
what I did was stick it on the radiator

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.089 
what I did was stick it on the radiator
for<00:03:46.739> about<00:03:47.040> 4<00:03:47.340> weeks<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:49.319> went<00:03:49.590> thick<00:03:49.919> and

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
for about 4 weeks and it went thick and

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.360 
for about 4 weeks and it went thick and
black<00:03:50.310> like<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:51.660> that's<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.959> reduced<00:03:52.410> tea

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
black like that so that's a reduced tea

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.580 
black like that so that's a reduced tea
and<00:03:53.819> nanoparticle<00:03:54.720> solution<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.470> that's

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
and nanoparticle solution and that's

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.640 
and nanoparticle solution and that's
what<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.829> caught<00:03:56.099> into<00:03:56.400> my<00:03:56.519> autoclave<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:57.650> both

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
what I caught into my autoclave so both

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.789 
what I caught into my autoclave so both
back<00:03:58.829> into<00:03:59.069> my<00:03:59.220> home<00:03:59.549> pipe<00:04:00.540> bits<00:04:00.810> bolted<00:04:01.500> it

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
back into my home pipe bits bolted it

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.949 
back into my home pipe bits bolted it
down<00:04:01.829> and<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.489> put<00:04:02.639> in<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.849> oven<00:04:02.970> at<00:04:03.449> 180

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
down and I put in the oven at 180

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.969 
down and I put in the oven at 180
degrees<00:04:04.139> for<00:04:05.359> 10<00:04:06.359> hours<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:07.049> what<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.650> got<00:04:07.829> out

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
degrees for 10 hours and what I got out

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:15.140 
degrees for 10 hours and what I got out
of<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.340> was<00:04:10.519> this<00:04:11.959> now<00:04:12.959> that's<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:14.250> suspended<00:04:14.940> on

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
of it was this now that's a suspended on

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.330 
of it was this now that's a suspended on
nanoparticles<00:04:16.019> so

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
nanoparticles so

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.909 
nanoparticles so
and<00:04:16.760> there's<00:04:17.450> some<00:04:17.660> uh<00:04:17.870> nanoparticles<00:04:18.769> at<00:04:18.829> the

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
and there's some uh nanoparticles at the

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.379 
and there's some uh nanoparticles at the
bottom<00:04:19.310> there<00:04:19.549> now<00:04:19.880> it's<00:04:20.030> obviously<00:04:20.329> very

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
bottom there now it's obviously very

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.690 
bottom there now it's obviously very
sunny<00:04:20.870> here<00:04:21.169> so<00:04:21.799> we<00:04:21.980> can't<00:04:22.190> really<00:04:22.370> see<00:04:22.669> very

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
sunny here so we can't really see very

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.670 
sunny here so we can't really see very
well<00:04:23.150> so<00:04:23.419> we're<00:04:23.600> gonna<00:04:23.720> take<00:04:23.930> this<00:04:24.110> one<00:04:24.290> inside

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
well so we're gonna take this one inside

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.620 
well so we're gonna take this one inside
and<00:04:25.100> I'm<00:04:25.280> gonna<00:04:25.430> show<00:04:25.669> you<00:04:25.700> what<00:04:26.210> happens<00:04:26.240> to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
and I'm gonna show you what happens to

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.990 
and I'm gonna show you what happens to
it<00:04:26.900> inside<00:04:27.440> so<00:04:27.889> I've<00:04:27.980> taken<00:04:28.160> this<00:04:28.370> inside<00:04:28.730> and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
it inside so I've taken this inside and

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.760 
it inside so I've taken this inside and
poured<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:29.300> into<00:04:29.450> this<00:04:29.660> little<00:04:29.870> test<00:04:30.200> tube<00:04:30.470> and

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
poured it into this little test tube and

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.040 
poured it into this little test tube and
there<00:04:30.980> is<00:04:31.130> my<00:04:31.310> mixture<00:04:31.730> of<00:04:32.060> our<00:04:32.690> nano

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
there is my mixture of our nano

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.070 
there is my mixture of our nano
particles<00:04:33.710> coated<00:04:34.160> in<00:04:34.430> carbon<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.180> suspended

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
particles coated in carbon and suspended

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:46.120 
particles coated in carbon and suspended
in<00:04:36.380> water<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:38.110> watch<00:04:39.110> this<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:45.440> there<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:45.980> go

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
in water so watch this and there you go

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.530 
in water so watch this and there you go
the<00:04:46.669> arm<00:04:46.940> flaps<00:04:47.540> quite<00:04:48.440> rapidly<00:04:49.389> around<00:04:50.389> the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
the arm flaps quite rapidly around the

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.340 
the arm flaps quite rapidly around the
magnet<00:04:55.870> magnet<00:04:56.870> away

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
magnet magnet away

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.060 
magnet magnet away
they're<00:04:57.770> real<00:04:58.100> dispersed<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.979> for<00:05:03.979> the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
they're real dispersed and for the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.750 
they're real dispersed and for the
magnet<00:05:04.400> back<00:05:04.580> home<00:05:05.889> and<00:05:06.889> then<00:05:07.310> you<00:05:07.430> can<00:05:07.580> see

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
magnet back home and then you can see

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.240 
magnet back home and then you can see
them<00:05:07.910> coming<00:05:08.270> out<00:05:08.360> of<00:05:11.800> solution<00:05:12.800> and

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
them coming out of solution and

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.000 
them coming out of solution and
collecting<00:05:13.700> around<00:05:13.880> that<00:05:14.060> field<00:05:14.770> so<00:05:15.770> there<00:05:15.919> we

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
collecting around that field so there we

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.620 
collecting around that field so there we
go

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
go

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.240 
go
carbon<00:05:17.630> coated<00:05:18.050> s<00:05:18.320> they're<00:05:18.800> both<00:05:19.010> are

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
carbon coated s they're both are

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.610 
carbon coated s they're both are
nanoparticles<00:05:20.080> from<00:05:21.080> hydrothermal

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
nanoparticles from hydrothermal

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.060 
nanoparticles from hydrothermal
carbonization<00:05:23.020> now<00:05:24.020> I<00:05:24.320> think<00:05:24.710> lots<00:05:24.890> of<00:05:25.010> people

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
carbonization now I think lots of people

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.250 
carbonization now I think lots of people
be<00:05:25.460> interested<00:05:25.610> in<00:05:25.970> this<00:05:26.210> because<00:05:27.020> there's

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
be interested in this because there's

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.630 
be interested in this because there's
lots<00:05:27.410> of<00:05:27.560> really<00:05:27.710> interesting<00:05:27.830> things<00:05:28.250> you

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
lots of really interesting things you

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.659 
lots of really interesting things you
can<00:05:28.820> do<00:05:29.000> with<00:05:29.600> particles<00:05:30.140> like<00:05:30.350> that<00:05:30.640> anyway

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
can do with particles like that anyway

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.630 
can do with particles like that anyway
hope<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.330> enjoyed
