border<00:00:27.480> what<00:00:28.019> are<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.619> stick<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.460> blacks

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
border what are you to stick like blacks

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420 
border what are you to stick like blacks
on<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> video<00:00:30.599> because<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.529> motor<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.250> as

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
on it video because this motor is not as

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.780 
on it video because this motor is not as
powerful<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.800> also<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> propellers<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.670> as

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
powerful and also the propellers not as

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.930 
powerful and also the propellers not as
sharp<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> Gulf<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.040> United<00:00:38.520> didn't<00:00:38.790> have

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
sharp so the Gulf of United didn't have

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.880 
sharp so the Gulf of United didn't have
enough<00:00:39.180> energy<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.140> replaced<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> with

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
enough energy so now we replaced it with

00:00:40.890 --> 00:02:39.309 
enough energy so now we replaced it with
these<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.670> cables

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.570
