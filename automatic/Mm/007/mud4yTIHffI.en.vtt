00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello hello hello I welcome you right 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 welcome to a new follow available 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.559
 or 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.570
 in my case because I am an absolute 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.759
 and talented player but 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
 anybody has a lot of fun 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.460
 shit in this game and make 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.769
 that's why I'm ebola and funny 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.539
 By the way, that's enough of me 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.310
 Hope you break it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.960
 No, I just had a real life again 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.789
 After a few months, I really feel like it 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.320
 league of legends again because 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.719
 I have something quite right now 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.280
 Cool then by a friend 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.050
 possibility to get in 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.550
 quotes but that's what i'm about 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.170
 after that a little bit better and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.960
 Here you see these visible 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.450
 trade balance nicely packaged the kiss but 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.829
 here for the course set really cool 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.570
 and yes I have here a bit 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.190
 cut together as you can see 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 I have some cool 10 here now 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.300
 have extra broken even extra 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.410
 I left extra here 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.520
 as I said I have been three now 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 months 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.409
 4 no league of legends played anymore 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.150
 that means I did not know me at all 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.920
 In this mode from the farm he completes 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.799
 I still know three against three 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.110
 but three against three painters do not work 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.729
 There is no such thing as a sense of humor 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.960
 That really confused me a lot 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.390
 and accordingly I have 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.580
 a pass world totally stupid set 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.650
 or or just not at all and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.689
 He did not know how to solve something 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.040
 I'm in the mess I have 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.290
 then not seen through 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.670
 but why am I actually watching this video 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.290
 By the way, I'm doing a lot here as well 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.340
 cool guys with whom I found here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.680
 I've played all of them 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.720
 my frenzel is yes that was natural 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.340
 really good 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.750
 Unfortunately, that was us here I have my 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.610
 franz liszt we helped here 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.890
 supported me here a bit 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.960
 because I have a buddy 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.880
 that just works a cool thing 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.040
 just get the opportunity you 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.630
 to introduce something here and that 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.200
 app 0 sumo and that's extra so he has 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.869
 nicely expressed for my skills 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.610
 had put batteries then has meant nice 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.130
 No, but I'm really not like that 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.380
 really 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.150
 what is so general league of 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.980
 Legend concerns especially the items 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.050
 because I have earlier with the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.970
 good chris played together and he has 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.610
 usually a bit said yes here 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.870
 that would be something very good and that is quite 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.810
 good but I never actually did 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.380
 serious 1 1 teams occupied the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.540
 was flowing I imagine I am so 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.940
 I believe that a few left 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.630
 Hard work is and a poster, however 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.370
 still stolen at the end but I am myself 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.520
 never really intense with the items 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.660
 busy and just feeding at 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.580
 I simply too fast for disposal 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.230
 which item do I need now because of me 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.360
 here yes I'm actually playing otherwise 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.190
 usually only support and in this 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.870
 Mode because you do not need support for what 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.640
 you have but also lane someone 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.070
 which you can support if you are 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.700
 alone and need then consider this yes 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.410
 magic power and so on and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.540
 accordingly told me recently 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.110
 here there will be an app soon 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.660
 go to the beta test and there you can 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.030
 then actually see what yours 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.200
 Use this for items that you can 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.000
 but of course you are in the game as well 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.250
 For example, you also get something like 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.960
 a beginner ghost during the game 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.180
 even that means you can actually 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.680
 one can watch the mobile phone incidentally 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.320
 you 'll hear a little bit about that 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.560
 strengths are the opposing character 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:34.870
 You get told or go away 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.430
 We definitely get one like that 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.500
 few item suggestions this man has 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.070
 simply use can depending on how you 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.630
 then actually just what you were 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.350
 you want to do if support wants to do 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.940
 as if you want to do it and so on 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.560
 and so on and that's why I thought so 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.390
 that's a cool opportunity for you 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.230
 that's easy to imagine and 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.100
 maybe for the beta test too 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.150
 inspire me because I do too 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.090
 With 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.900
 I really just use the chance 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.370
 which commanded me 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:11.980
 they are getting better now 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.900
 maybe just the politics active me 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.030
 was executed so that was not 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.949
 more solemnly I have so shit me 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.600
 but then I will too 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.850
 incredibly fast and nervous 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.830
 press wrong keys and so what 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.039
 So that's really not anymore 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.680
 solemnly yes in any case 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.300
 i had the model oli here i come here 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.610
 it means something different but I call it 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.070
 for fun's sake from the live stream 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.789
 it came that morello li comes and 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.020
 I had got the wm start here 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.800
 explains what I ever here 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.970
 thought it is I do not know 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.830
 if still no particular order 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.050
 played as I said I play otherwise 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.090
 really always sport and even there I know 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.479
 Not after four months what I did 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.699
 because once played first but 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.860
 I supported and have my team 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.620
 I tried to give my best 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.030
 so he mean my multi always 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.070
 I also had shorts regularly 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.320
 time of my friend in the middle of the game 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.560
 get this control set 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.050
 that you only have that , so to speak 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.820
 you no longer have to aim for the spell 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.710
 There goes where the mouse degree 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.389
 that is what has me in the 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.460
 end effect even more confused but 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.659
 I think it was a very funny game 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.099
 I have now specially this such a 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.570
 bit cut memory so what in 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.849
 the kind just wants to do more often 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.470
 and also my snowy arts cut 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:37.050
 Improve artist accordingly 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.050
 I want and that's why I have here 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.830
 only the ultima forest again but I have to 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.210
 say i have fun again 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.160
 times at moorings had therefore 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.320
 I hope so in the near future 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.030
 a bit more content will come 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.830
 and I just have those now 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.110
 longtime 10 so a bit out 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.180
 chained so look here now 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.190
 Let's take the crew and see where I am 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.510
 maybe a little something 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.250
 smart and do where I times 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.810
 maybe a little bit die 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.460
 my statistics in the end never look that way 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.590
 Good I think I once had it 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.920
 ne hammer statistics with luxury goods for 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.180
 aram and there i had the i had 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.700
 people brought away right but 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.530
 otherwise yes as I said I am what 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.940
 support but in this case here too 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.180
 been very funny many thanks 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.620
 also to my players there 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.530
 actually helped more and the 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.570
 I also advised a few teams 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.620
 and if you will now cool the 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.290
 will now look kulisse 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.700
 you see you are captured and 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.170
 Now he offers himself right away 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.490
 pretty, I think so if a little 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.500
 I'm not exactly wrong 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.670
 Now he has stopped this time 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.670
 and now bm 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.640
 yes, there I was proud does not say in that 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.680
 moment but i would look at each one 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.540
 if you like this performance 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.590
 thing on support I could like 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.840
 she said she definitely will 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.360
 support and do our other 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.300
 then 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.590
 photo handout sheet as well with and 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.270
 then the cool thing is if you are now 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.090
 actually for this beta test 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.969
 you have the possibility to sign up 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:12.289
 because date friend can win because 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:13.520
 currently giving away 100,000 riot points 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:15.860
 that means you can not of course 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.759
 win a total of 100,000 riot points 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.770
 that would be great 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.569
 but you definitely have the chance 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.639
 where you are so different things 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.590
 by following the twitter account and 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.060
 so on and so on more or one 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.009
 greater chance to win 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.449
 and accordingly yes I would you 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:30.740
 Just recommend going down to the 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.419
 video description click on the link 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.009
 sign up for the beta on is on 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.240
 Every case is super great, so I'm glad 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:37.219
 me very much if all this now 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.099
 really then is slower 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:42.139
 because that could actually be real 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:43.909
 help and then maybe there helps 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:45.849
 such a newcomer is also the newcomer
