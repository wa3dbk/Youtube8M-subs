00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
said this video is all about premature

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.699 
said this video is all about premature
Town<00:01:15.340> Hall<00:01:15.550> 10<00:01:15.789> and<00:01:16.090> by<00:01:16.450> premature<00:01:16.810> Hamilton

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
Town Hall 10 and by premature Hamilton

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.430 
Town Hall 10 and by premature Hamilton
what<00:01:17.979> I<00:01:18.009> mean<00:01:18.190> is<00:01:18.399> they've<00:01:19.030> upgraded<00:01:19.440> well

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
what I mean is they've upgraded well

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.559 
what I mean is they've upgraded well
before<00:01:20.860> or<00:01:21.160> they've<00:01:21.520> operated<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:22.060> town<00:01:22.270> hall

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
before or they've operated the town hall

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.050 
before or they've operated the town hall
well<00:01:23.020> before<00:01:23.259> they've<00:01:23.890> upgraded<00:01:24.640> their

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
well before they've upgraded their

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.320 
well before they've upgraded their
defenses<00:01:25.599> the<00:01:25.869> walls<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.940> maybe<00:01:27.940> even<00:01:28.149> the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
defenses the walls and maybe even the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.760 
defenses the walls and maybe even the
troops<00:01:28.690> so<00:01:29.849> generally<00:01:30.849> they're<00:01:31.390> our<00:01:32.259> level

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
troops so generally they're our level

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.949 
troops so generally they're our level
that<00:01:32.860> they<00:01:33.039> shouldn't<00:01:33.369> be<00:01:33.599> and<00:01:34.599> i'll<00:01:34.720> probably

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
that they shouldn't be and i'll probably

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:38.609 
that they shouldn't be and i'll probably
impacted<00:01:35.259> gameplay<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:37.690> that<00:01:38.080> really<00:01:38.319> comes

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
impacted gameplay and that really comes

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.510 
impacted gameplay and that really comes
into<00:01:38.830> in<00:01:39.069> the<00:01:39.160> form<00:01:39.429> of<00:01:39.580> Luke<00:01:40.209> penalties

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
into in the form of Luke penalties

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.590 
into in the form of Luke penalties
unlike<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.670> bonuses<00:01:43.090> for<00:01:43.360> attacking<00:01:43.660> other

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
unlike of bonuses for attacking other

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.740 
unlike of bonuses for attacking other
Tannehill<00:01:44.930> 10<00:01:45.110> players<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:47.000> strategy<00:01:47.420> on

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
Tannehill 10 players so the strategy on

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.840 
Tannehill 10 players so the strategy on
the<00:01:47.840> base<00:01:48.049> like<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:48.619> i<00:01:48.830> find<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:49.369> is<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.640> come

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
the base like this i find it is to come

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.600 
the base like this i find it is to come
in<00:01:50.000> from<00:01:50.270> one<00:01:50.540> particular<00:01:50.750> point<00:01:51.740> really<00:01:52.369> hard

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
in from one particular point really hard

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.450 
in from one particular point really hard
and<00:01:52.759> really<00:01:52.820> fast<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:54.500> also<00:01:54.799> if<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.190> can<00:01:55.310> see

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
and really fast and also if you can see

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.060 
and really fast and also if you can see
the<00:01:55.610> infernal<00:01:56.180> tower<00:01:56.619> some<00:01:57.619> people<00:01:57.860> call<00:01:58.009> that

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
the infernal tower some people call that

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.570 
the infernal tower some people call that
the<00:01:58.310> Eye<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.549> Sauron<00:02:00.040> it's<00:02:01.040> not<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.340> great

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
the Eye of Sauron it's not that great

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.830 
the Eye of Sauron it's not that great
when<00:02:02.479> it's<00:02:03.159> targeting<00:02:04.159> t1<00:02:04.850> troops<00:02:05.149> or<00:02:05.509> you

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
when it's targeting t1 troops or you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.949 
when it's targeting t1 troops or you
know<00:02:05.930> weaker<00:02:06.350> troops<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.759> reason<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.209> it

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
know weaker troops and the reason is it

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.320 
know weaker troops and the reason is it
will<00:02:09.170> kill<00:02:09.440> them<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:10.250> know<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.610> little<00:02:11.150> bit

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
will kill them you know a little bit

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.640 
will kill them you know a little bit
slower<00:02:11.690> than<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.200> an<00:02:12.650> expo<00:02:13.010> will<00:02:13.840> which<00:02:14.840> which

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
slower than a an expo will which which

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.970 
slower than a an expo will which which
is<00:02:15.800> fine<00:02:16.130> but<00:02:16.520> it's<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:16.880> not<00:02:16.940> very<00:02:17.239> effective

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
is fine but it's just not very effective

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.140 
is fine but it's just not very effective
you're<00:02:18.980> better<00:02:19.130> off<00:02:19.250> with<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.489> cannon<00:02:19.880> if

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
you're better off with a cannon if

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.750 
you're better off with a cannon if
that's<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.569> case<00:02:20.709> where<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.890> inferno<00:02:22.280> towers

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
that's the case where the inferno towers

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.430 
that's the case where the inferno towers
really<00:02:23.300> good<00:02:23.450> as<00:02:23.569> against<00:02:23.900> things<00:02:24.380> like

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
really good as against things like

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.030 
really good as against things like
peckers<00:02:25.010> golems<00:02:25.959> heroes<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.769> know<00:02:27.860> even

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
peckers golems heroes and you know even

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.040 
peckers golems heroes and you know even
Giants<00:02:28.580> it's<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.880> stronger<00:02:29.300> troops<00:02:29.600> where<00:02:29.870> it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
Giants it's the stronger troops where it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.900 
Giants it's the stronger troops where it
can<00:02:30.230> really<00:02:30.410> kick<00:02:30.860> in<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.190> terms<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
can really kick in in terms of the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.910 
can really kick in in terms of the
increased<00:02:32.239> power<00:02:32.480> because<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.500> gets

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
increased power because that gets

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.390 
increased power because that gets
stronger<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.790> longer<00:02:35.300> target<00:02:35.900> something<00:02:36.400> but

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
stronger the longer target something but

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.699 
stronger the longer target something but
anyway<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:37.850> gone<00:02:38.060> now<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.260> that's<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.560> end

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
anyway it's gone now so that's the end

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.100 
anyway it's gone now so that's the end
of<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.760> Queen<00:02:41.000> has<00:02:41.180> been<00:02:41.209> released<00:02:41.630> the
