this<00:00:15.820> section<00:00:16.059> of<00:00:16.360> this<00:00:16.450> decal<00:00:17.140> peels<00:00:17.410> off<00:00:17.650> so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
tediously and slowly and the heat gun

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.689 
tediously and slowly and the heat gun
represents<00:00:23.260> its<00:00:23.380> own<00:00:23.529> trade-offs<00:00:24.009> meaning<00:00:24.580> it

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
represents its own trade-offs meaning it

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.380 
represents its own trade-offs meaning it
gets<00:00:24.939> very<00:00:25.000> hot<00:00:25.570> if<00:00:25.869> you<00:00:26.859> know<00:00:27.300> happen<00:00:28.300> to

notice in the first part of the video
that<00:00:30.070> it<00:00:30.580> looked<00:00:30.759> like<00:00:30.939> I<00:00:31.089> was<00:00:31.119> keeping<00:00:31.390> the

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
that it looked like I was keeping the

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.280 
that it looked like I was keeping the
heat<00:00:31.810> gun<00:00:32.020> pretty<00:00:32.590> far<00:00:32.980> away<00:00:33.900> it's<00:00:34.900> just<00:00:35.020> that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
heat gun pretty far away it's just that

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.709 
heat gun pretty far away it's just that
the<00:00:35.410> heat<00:00:35.620> gun<00:00:35.770> gets<00:00:36.010> that<00:00:36.280> hot<00:00:36.640> that<00:00:37.090> my<00:00:37.120> hands

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
the heat gun gets that hot that my hands

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.819 
the heat gun gets that hot that my hands
are<00:00:37.809> literally<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:40.180> this<00:00:40.629> very<00:00:41.140> fine<00:00:41.530> line

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
are literally it's this very fine line

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.360 
are literally it's this very fine line
between<00:00:42.010> burning<00:00:42.550> my<00:00:42.850> hands<00:00:43.180> my<00:00:43.570> fingers<00:00:43.629> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
between burning my hands my fingers and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.130 
between burning my hands my fingers and
keeping<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.460> decal<00:00:45.969> pliable<00:00:46.719> where<00:00:46.930> I<00:00:46.960> can

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
keeping the decal pliable where I can

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.660 
keeping the decal pliable where I can
peel<00:00:47.440> it<00:00:47.469> off<00:00:47.710> but<00:00:48.070> because<00:00:48.160> it's<00:00:48.550> a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
peel it off but because it's a

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.540 
peel it off but because it's a
professional-grade<00:00:49.329> heat<00:00:49.840> gun<00:00:50.109> gets<00:00:50.829> very

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
professional-grade heat gun gets very

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.860 
professional-grade heat gun gets very
hot<00:00:51.879> so<00:00:52.359> keeping<00:00:53.199> it<00:00:53.379> 12<00:00:53.710> inches<00:00:53.829> away<00:00:54.190> is

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
hot so keeping it 12 inches away is

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.779 
hot so keeping it 12 inches away is
enough<00:00:55.870> to<00:00:56.079> keep<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:56.350> warm

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
enough to keep it warm

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.430 
enough to keep it warm
so<00:00:58.210> there's<00:00:58.390> trade-offs<00:00:58.780> with<00:00:58.899> that<00:00:59.079> now<00:00:59.320> I'm

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
so there's trade-offs with that now I'm

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.950 
so there's trade-offs with that now I'm
going<00:00:59.469> to<00:00:59.649> show<00:00:59.800> you<00:00:59.859> this<00:01:00.190> eraser<00:01:01.059> tool<00:01:01.329> which

is safe on car paint
I've<00:01:04.960> yet<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.379> use<00:01:05.650> it<00:01:05.830> on<00:01:05.920> anything<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.400> it's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
what I'm going to do actually first

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.280 
what I'm going to do actually first
things<00:01:12.610> first

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
things first

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.380 
things first
I've<00:01:14.290> been<00:01:14.560> using<00:01:14.740> this<00:01:14.979> eraser<00:01:15.490> tool<00:01:15.790> on<00:01:16.150> many

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
I've been using this eraser tool on many

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.069 
I've been using this eraser tool on many
jobs<00:01:16.720> you<00:01:17.229> can<00:01:17.500> see<00:01:17.860> that<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:19.270> starts<00:01:19.689> wearing

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
jobs you can see that it starts wearing

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.920 
jobs you can see that it starts wearing
and<00:01:20.470> uneven<00:01:21.040> shape<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.670> hopefully<00:01:22.360> this<00:01:22.750> is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
and uneven shape to it hopefully this is

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.649 
and uneven shape to it hopefully this is
focusing<00:01:23.530> in

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
focusing in

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.870 
focusing in
this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.439> what<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.710> looks<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.040> brand-new<00:01:26.369> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
this is what it looks like brand-new you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.779 
this is what it looks like brand-new you
can<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> size<00:01:27.539> difference<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.579> can

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
can see the size difference so you can

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.359 
can see the size difference so you can
get<00:01:29.939> lots<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.509> jobs<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.289> them<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.860> think

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
get lots of jobs out of them I think

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.380 
get lots of jobs out of them I think
it's<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> 30<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.630> $35<00:01:34.350> tool<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.390> amazing

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it's about a 30 to $35 tool it's amazing

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.499 
it's about a 30 to $35 tool it's amazing
so<00:01:37.289> what<00:01:37.409> I'm<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:37.679> do<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.329> to

so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.270 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
continue<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.350> film<00:01:40.679> this<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.539> the

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
lot of work you've got to really have

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.789 
lot of work you've got to really have
the<00:02:02.310> strength<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:03.000> keep<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.539> drill<00:02:04.349> motor<00:02:04.619> in

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the strength to keep the drill motor in

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.330 
the strength to keep the drill motor in
place<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.840> you're<00:02:06.840> constantly<00:02:07.110> fighting<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
place and you're constantly fighting the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.710 
place and you're constantly fighting the
rotation<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:10.080> racer<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:11.849> lure<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.360> racer

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
ahead so you will wear out quickly and I

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.289 
ahead so you will wear out quickly and I
will<00:02:20.670> change<00:02:21.060> positions<00:02:22.849> based<00:02:23.849> on<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
will change positions based on the

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.080 
will change positions based on the
leverage<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.019> something<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.799> learned

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
leverage and something I learned

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.030 
leverage and something I learned
and<00:02:27.209> even<00:02:27.780> at<00:02:27.959> this<00:02:28.200> stage<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.860> my<00:02:28.890> career

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and even at this stage in my career

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.000 
and even at this stage in my career
after<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.000> don't<00:02:30.209> know<00:02:30.269> how<00:02:30.420> many<00:02:30.480> well<00:02:30.989> 25<00:02:31.680> plus

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
after I don't know how many well 25 plus

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.220 
after I don't know how many well 25 plus
years<00:02:32.340> I'm<00:02:32.970> still<00:02:33.360> learning<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:33.989> always

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
years I'm still learning so I always

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.320 
years I'm still learning so I always
question<00:02:34.890> like<00:02:35.069> I'm<00:02:35.250> buffer<00:02:35.550> pads<00:02:35.790> why<00:02:36.120> don't

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
question like I'm buffer pads why don't

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.570 
question like I'm buffer pads why don't
they<00:02:36.510> make<00:02:37.069> like<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.280> high<00:02:38.459> speed<00:02:39.349> buffers

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
they make like the high speed buffers

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.740 
they make like the high speed buffers
reversible<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:41.910> could<00:02:42.060> change<00:02:42.300> direction

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
reversible so you could change direction

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.800 
reversible so you could change direction
and<00:02:43.200> get<00:02:43.500> more<00:02:43.680> use<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.069> pads<00:02:44.420> well<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.510> kind

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
and get more use of the pads well I kind

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.839 
and get more use of the pads well I kind
of<00:02:45.870> learned<00:02:46.080> not<00:02:46.920> necessarily<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.489> hard<00:02:47.700> way

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
of learned not necessarily the hard way

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.020 
of learned not necessarily the hard way
but<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.150> learned<00:02:48.299> on<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:48.629> tool<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.730> you

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
but I learned on this tool so if you

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.900 
but I learned on this tool so if you
this<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.690> reversible<00:02:52.140> roll<00:02:52.739> over<00:02:53.069> I<00:02:53.370> can

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
this is a reversible roll over I can

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.330 
this is a reversible roll over I can
reverse<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.420> here

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
reverse it here

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.030 
reverse it here
but<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.489> have<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.060> have<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.930> going<00:02:58.170> clockwise

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
but you have to have it going clockwise

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.400 
but you have to have it going clockwise
so<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.480> tool<00:03:01.459> stays<00:03:02.459> taut<00:03:03.290> because<00:03:04.290> if

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
so that this tool stays taut because if

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.630 
so that this tool stays taut because if
I<00:03:04.530> was<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.890> reverse<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.549> go

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
I was to reverse it and go

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.190 
I was to reverse it and go
counterclockwise<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.870> thing<00:03:07.079> would

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
counterclockwise this thing would

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.830 
counterclockwise this thing would
unscrew<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:09.000> next<00:03:09.269> thing<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.420> know<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
unscrew and next thing you know the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.900 
unscrew and next thing you know the
thing<00:03:10.049> would<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.200> fall<00:03:10.530> off<00:03:10.799> so<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.370> have<00:03:11.640> to

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
thing would just fall off so you have to

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.830 
thing would just fall off so you have to
basically<00:03:12.120> work<00:03:12.720> in<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:14.310> counter<00:03:15.239> direction

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
basically work in the counter direction

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.190 
basically work in the counter direction
of<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.140> threads<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.489> that's<00:03:17.670> why<00:03:17.879> I<00:03:17.910> learned

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
of the threads so that's why I learned

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.760 
of the threads so that's why I learned
you<00:03:20.620> don't<00:03:20.860> want<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.160> reverse<00:03:21.459> your<00:03:21.640> tool<00:03:22.770> like

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
you don't want to reverse your tool like

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.470 
you don't want to reverse your tool like
if<00:03:23.950> your<00:03:24.130> arms<00:03:24.610> are<00:03:24.730> getting<00:03:24.849> tired

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
if your arms are getting tired

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.330 
if your arms are getting tired
and<00:03:25.660> you're<00:03:25.870> leveraging<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.709> really<00:03:27.040> hard

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
and you're leveraging it really hard

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.250 
and you're leveraging it really hard
against<00:03:27.849> one<00:03:28.180> way<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.450> think<00:03:28.810> I'll<00:03:29.020> just

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
against one way you think I'll just

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.900 
against one way you think I'll just
reverse<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:29.980> leverage<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.550> other<00:03:30.670> way

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
reverse it and leverage it the other way

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.449 
reverse it and leverage it the other way
well<00:03:31.630> this<00:03:31.810> head<00:03:32.080> will<00:03:32.319> work<00:03:32.530> itself<00:03:32.920> off<00:03:33.160> so

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
well this head will work itself off so

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.699 
well this head will work itself off so
that's<00:03:34.360> just<00:03:34.510> an<00:03:34.720> added<00:03:34.900> note<00:03:35.310> anyhow<00:03:36.310> let's

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
that's just an added note anyhow let's

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.790 
that's just an added note anyhow let's
let's<00:03:38.709> just<00:03:38.770> get<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.340> work<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:40.120> I'll<00:03:40.800> speed

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
let's just get to work and I'll speed

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.530 
let's just get to work and I'll speed
this<00:03:41.830> part<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.489> film<00:03:42.730> up<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.209> can<00:03:43.360> see

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
this part of the film up so you can see

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:52.960 
this part of the film up so you can see
max

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970

you

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.060 

okay<00:04:29.560> time<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.190> move<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:31.120> ladder<00:04:32.070> hopefully
