 utorrent top of the discussion 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.640
 more people all the doctors say 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.619
 that if it is an iso software that allows 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.719
 to believe that you have a video game cd 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.980
 but actually no it's a fake celine 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:42.000
 moreau you can play on it 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:46.739
 so that's the file bearing and that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.680

 tubes when you tube 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.780
