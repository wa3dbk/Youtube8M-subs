00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
place the sin inside we're doing this

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.140 
place the sin inside we're doing this
right<00:06:43.650> there<00:06:43.830> let's<00:06:44.190> put<00:06:44.280> it<00:06:44.460> in<00:06:45.080> latch<00:06:46.080> I

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
right there let's put it in latch I

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.719 
right there let's put it in latch I
think<00:06:48.150> I'm<00:06:48.240> supposed<00:06:48.330> to<00:06:48.509> put<00:06:48.720> this<00:06:49.520> this<00:06:50.520> is

think I'm supposed to put this this is

00:06:50.729 --> 00:07:02.429 
think I'm supposed to put this this is
kind<00:06:51.000> of<00:06:51.060> embarrassing
