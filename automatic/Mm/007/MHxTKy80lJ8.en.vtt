00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.900
 to start making the diagnosis came 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.880
 we have to check my engine load system the world 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.899
 agrees 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.810
 and just like the whole team 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.249
 placed here 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:31.519
 on the scale d 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.250
 tension 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.920
 We really have to stay here. 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.070
 the charge on this battery is in agreement 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.070
 then select what voltage 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.280
 and I'm going to make the measurement here 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 always respecting the polarity we play 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.350
 of reason 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.110
 maybe here with the tip 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.880
 on negative cable 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.080
 and points red on the positive cable 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.269
 take care of my battery 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:03.079
 be 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.820
 12 point 25 volks 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.660
 now here 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.640
 we found that the battery 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.040
 is above nominal value 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.240
 now I'm going to ask our departure mate for we came here how much 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.120
 arrest that my 'piano loader' house who is the coach is in the 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.010
 providing 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.010
 so please leave 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.810
 our generator who is the coach 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.189
 we are supplying a large quantity 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.270
 detention 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.360
 according to our manual 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.360
 we found that this system 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.570
 a very important mechanical device 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.490
 have and know how to use 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 foot or multimeter 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.810
 the reason is that I can do some diagnostics 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.319
 as for example charges transforming ignition 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.780
 or between them 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.850
 It's like after working here at the moment. 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.670
 is the well that works by checking a sail cable 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.699
 like the brow of a sail cable 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.899
 I put a multimeter on the scale 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.899
 resistance 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.629
 I go here 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.649
 a cable 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.049
 and check 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.699
 which tech 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:27.239
 the resistance that is present in the suppressor 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:33.079
 is here in the transformer stage insert on the two only knots 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.129
 is to get a total existence 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.519
 this resistance making me read her who ate multimeter 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.770
 it has to be 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.669
 the value 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:44.600
 cadu 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.780
 do not hit those values ​​make the substitution 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.689
 in another item that also that I can see 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.559
 using multimeter powder would be an ignition transformer 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.969
 I can with him according to the technical manual 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.940
 check the resistance that is present in the primary 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.909
 and in the secondary transformer ten 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.829
 the suspect would have cameras we can see 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.129
 would be sailing 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.139
 like I'd test that candle by checking the top where it goes 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.099
 staff or suppressor 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.639
 to the central electrode and check the receptivity 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:27.599
 if it is outside the standards established by the manufacturer 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.059
 make your replacement 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.859
 one of the ones also in the candle that is very important you know 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.400
 the temperature code 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.400
 foot is characteristic of this beautiful 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.230
 it is also very important you see by the following 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.129
 if you put a candle that is not compatible with this car 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.469
 vehicle may present 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.040
 we just started 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.619
 make that first diagnosis 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.619
 in the most accessible and easy-to-author parts 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:05.420
 now we're going to start and for the more complex parts, whether or not I stay 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.880
 special tools 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.739
 and much more care 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.089
 such as 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:11.730
 another timing 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.009
 I give the 'motor' 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:16.069
 the timing of this 'engine' 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.069
 I have to be very careful. 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:21.500
 if I change 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.550
 or the colloquy wants to date this synchronism 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.400
 What is going to happen? I can. 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.499
 have a valve worth 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.499
 or also became a question and so on 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.020
 never author she felt 11 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.670
 it features two brands that I have to be very careful 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.710
 when doing 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.819
 this placement of this rush 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.379
 such as the police 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.529
 in the valve control tree police 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:50.749
 her presence here 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.900
 I put a mark on it 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.650
 at this point 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.559
 and the belt cover 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:57.819
 we have here 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.479
 the couple 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.650
 then this command it has to stay 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.569
 parallel between this assault 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:05.580
 it's that 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.000
 this mark here 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.089
 of this police 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.409
 another detail here that we have to pay close attention to 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:15.279
 this fringe here 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.370
 which arise g 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.259
 of the oil pump 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.180
 it is suitable for engines 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.629
 eight valves 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.449
 as for the motors 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.439
 16 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:26.569
 people 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.539
 are here in this conversation 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.000
 cop here these years here 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.070
 It has to be compatible 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.740
 like the rsi 16 or eight valve motorcycle model 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:41.659
 so here we have two markings 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.770
 the first one here in the state 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.740
 chinese simpsons team leap 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.480
 on the left side 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.249
 we have a 2 v mark 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:54.689
 what does this 2 v mean we have 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:56.349
 two new 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:57.800
 per cylinder 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.470
 in this large area that in these had to go 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.130
 on the right side 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.419
 we have here a mark 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.639
 What does this represent? 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.280
 that I have 4 valves 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.339
 per cylinder 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:14.779
 that is motorcycle 16 absences 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.580
 this motor that 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.050
 in this case he is the author 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.159
 eight valves so here I came back to position 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:24.879
 these alfredinho 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.330
 along as at that time 2 v 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.860
 then positioned two vetoes 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.020
 he asked 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.900
 This motor is here. 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.860
 be 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.180
 in synchronism one of the care we have to have when assembling the belt 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.830
 serrated 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.199
 it is with your tensioning 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.589
 as I know that this tensioning of this belt is correct 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.870
 releasing this thirteen screw here from key 13 and an area of ​​6 millimeters 

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:55.039
 team 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.139
 they always acted duel in the direction of the time 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:04.259
 this assault here is the present here on our tensioner has to hit 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.970
 in the middle 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.229
 I gave up here 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.409
 beating in the middle of this event I know she's strapped is with her 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:14.469
 tensioning
