thought this one was really interesting

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.149 
thought this one was really interesting
because<00:01:35.759> um<00:01:36.329> uh<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:38.430> looks<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:39.320> back<00:01:40.320> oh<00:01:40.740> crap

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
because um uh it looks like back oh crap

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.590 
because um uh it looks like back oh crap
I<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.549> even<00:01:41.640> know<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.299> took<00:01:42.450> this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
I don't even know and I just took this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.980 
I don't even know and I just took this
in<00:01:42.719> history<00:01:43.020> class<00:01:43.170> um<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:45.509> Berlin<00:01:45.780> Wall

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
in history class um the Berlin Wall

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.840 
in history class um the Berlin Wall
whenever<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.500> was<00:01:46.590> made<00:01:46.770> blah<00:01:47.009> blah<00:01:47.100> blah<00:01:47.130> um

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
whenever that was made blah blah blah um

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.080 
whenever that was made blah blah blah um
it<00:01:48.810> looks<00:01:48.869> exactly<00:01:49.469> like<00:01:49.789> we<00:01:50.789> had<00:01:50.939> these

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
it looks exactly like we had these

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
it looks exactly like we had these
history<00:01:51.450> books<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.350> looked<00:01:52.799> exactly<00:01:52.920> like

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
history books and it looked exactly like

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.249 
history books and it looked exactly like
the<00:01:53.610> little<00:01:53.909> town<00:01:54.119> thingy<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.930> they<00:01:55.049> had<00:01:55.229> in

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the little town thingy that they had in

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.810 
the little town thingy that they had in
there<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:55.979> guards<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.520> everything

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
there and all the guards and everything

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.240 
there and all the guards and everything
and<00:01:57.000> I'm<00:01:57.990> pretty<00:01:58.350> sure<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.859> is<00:01:59.009> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.189> be

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and I'm pretty sure this is going to be

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.660 
and I'm pretty sure this is going to be
a<00:01:59.310> pretty<00:01:59.520> close<00:02:00.180> quarter<00:02:00.960> map<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.520> looks

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
a pretty close quarter map and it looks

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.039 
a pretty close quarter map and it looks
like<00:02:02.729> there's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.530> core<00:02:04.530> courtyard<00:02:05.399> type<00:02:05.670> deal

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
like there's a core courtyard type deal

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.800 
like there's a core courtyard type deal
in<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.920> map<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:08.820> I<00:02:08.850> think<00:02:09.149> that's<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> be

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
in the map so I think that's going to be

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.850 
in the map so I think that's going to be
a<00:02:09.869> pretty<00:02:10.800> good<00:02:11.009> place<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.940> flag<00:02:12.209> in

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
a pretty good place for the be flag in

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.690 
a pretty good place for the be flag in
domination

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
domination

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.619 
domination
of<00:02:15.349> so<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.800> map<00:02:17.610> looks<00:02:17.910> really<00:02:18.270> neat<00:02:18.510> i

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
of so that that map looks really neat i

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.180 
of so that that map looks really neat i
think<00:02:18.840> i'm<00:02:18.959> going<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.620> purchasing<00:02:20.160> this

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.229 
much but um it looks kind of like that
map<00:02:49.830> with<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.130> bridge<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> middle<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.120> it

map with the bridge in the middle of it

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.740 
map with the bridge in the middle of it
and<00:02:51.650> i'm<00:02:52.650> pretty<00:02:52.890> sure<00:02:53.220> be<00:02:54.030> flag<00:02:54.329> is<00:02:54.510> going<00:02:54.690> to

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
and i'm pretty sure be flag is going to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.479 
and i'm pretty sure be flag is going to
go<00:02:54.930> right<00:02:55.140> on<00:02:55.319> that<00:02:55.470> bridge<00:02:55.769> for<00:02:56.099> domination

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
go right on that bridge for domination

go right on that bridge for domination
and<00:02:57.260> i<00:02:58.260> think<00:02:59.190> it's<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.400> medium-sized<00:03:00.000> map<00:03:00.269> i'm

and i think it's a medium-sized map i'm

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.960 
and i think it's a medium-sized map i'm
pretty<00:03:01.170> sure<00:03:01.349> it's<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.530> medium-sized<00:03:02.010> map<00:03:02.220> and

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
pretty sure it's a medium-sized map and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.630 
pretty sure it's a medium-sized map and
it<00:03:03.750> looks<00:03:03.959> really<00:03:04.290> neat<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:05.190> because<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.549> the
