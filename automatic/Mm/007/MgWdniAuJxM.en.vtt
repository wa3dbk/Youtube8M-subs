space above the eyes those are going to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.700 
space above the eyes those are going to
be<00:02:43.590> very<00:02:43.620> dark<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.880> toughest<00:02:45.330> part<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:46.440> this

darker but you're going to see me kind
of<00:03:02.040> like<00:03:02.220> change<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.760> relationships<00:03:03.540> of

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
of like change the relationships of

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.920 
of like change the relationships of
those<00:03:04.380> two<00:03:04.620> tones<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.790> off<00:03:05.910> as<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.690> shade

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
those two tones on and off as I shade

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.290 
those two tones on and off as I shade
the<00:03:07.140> areas<00:03:07.770> around<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.280> while<00:03:09.150> you're

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
the areas around it while you're

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.510 
the areas around it while you're
watching<00:03:09.480> me<00:03:09.780> draw<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.650> know<00:03:10.740> it's<00:03:11.400> going

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
watching me draw so you know it's going

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.950 
watching me draw so you know it's going
to<00:03:11.610> seem<00:03:11.820> dark<00:03:12.150> then<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.750> seem

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
to seem dark then it's going to seem

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.070 
to seem dark then it's going to seem
light<00:03:13.430> but<00:03:14.430> it's<00:03:14.760> eventually<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.870> be

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
light but it's eventually going to be

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.840 
light but it's eventually going to be
one<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> darker<00:03:16.770> tones<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.610> drawer

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
one of the darker tones of this drawer

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.200 
one of the darker tones of this drawer
on<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.230> add<00:03:19.230> tones<00:03:19.560> with<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.190> method<00:03:20.940> called

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
on I add tones with a method called

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.690 
on I add tones with a method called
cross<00:03:21.570> hatching<00:03:22.020> which<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.440> just<00:03:22.770> line<00:03:23.400> next

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
cross hatching which is just line next

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.510 
cross hatching which is just line next
to<00:03:23.820> line<00:03:24.090> next<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.450> line<00:03:25.070> then<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.190> smooth

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
to line next to line then I smooth

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.940 
to line next to line then I smooth
things<00:03:26.730> out<00:03:26.910> with<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.210> paintbrush<00:03:27.800> if<00:03:28.800> you

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
things out with the paintbrush if you

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.410 
things out with the paintbrush if you
don't<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> paintbrush<00:03:29.700> or<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.270> don't

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
don't have a paintbrush or you don't

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.810 
don't have a paintbrush or you don't
have<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> blending<00:03:30.990> stump<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:32.250> could<00:03:32.400> use<00:03:32.580> a

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
have a blending stump you could use a

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.020 
have a blending stump you could use a
q-tip<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.950> get<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:34.980> lot<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.190> questions<00:03:35.640> about<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
q-tip I get a lot of questions about the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.180 
q-tip I get a lot of questions about the
q-tip<00:03:36.420> does<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.720> work<00:03:36.900> as<00:03:37.050> well<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:38.040> actually

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
q-tip does it work as well it actually

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.810 
q-tip does it work as well it actually
does<00:03:38.690> but<00:03:39.690> almost<00:03:40.050> as<00:03:40.260> well<00:03:40.410> I'll<00:03:40.590> say<00:03:40.800> but<00:03:41.040> you

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
does but almost as well I'll say but you

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.690 
does but almost as well I'll say but you
want<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.090> let<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.330> get<00:03:42.959> some<00:03:43.770> graphite<00:03:44.490> on

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
want to let it get some graphite on

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.040 
want to let it get some graphite on
there<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.240> will<00:03:45.450> make<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> big

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
there and that will make a big

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.260 
there and that will make a big
difference<00:03:46.610> you<00:03:47.610> know<00:03:47.640> it's<00:03:47.880> not<00:03:48.030> going<00:03:48.180> to

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
difference you know it's not going to

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.790 
difference you know it's not going to
work<00:03:48.390> as<00:03:48.600> well<00:03:48.750> right<00:03:48.959> away<00:03:50.570> but<00:03:51.570> yeah<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.470> time

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
work as well right away but yeah in time

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.340 
work as well right away but yeah in time
it<00:03:53.070> will<00:03:53.100> definitely<00:03:53.610> work<00:03:53.940> as<00:03:54.300> well<00:03:54.540> now<00:03:55.290> you

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
it will definitely work as well now you

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.520 
it will definitely work as well now you
see<00:03:55.680> me<00:03:55.860> starting<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.580> add<00:03:57.080> volume<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.320> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
see me starting to add volume to the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.830 
see me starting to add volume to the
face<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.130> if<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.400> notice<00:03:59.580> i<00:03:59.880> kinda<00:04:00.150> I've<00:04:00.600> been

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
face and if you notice i kinda I've been

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.110 
face and if you notice i kinda I've been
erasing<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.410> lot<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.800> original<00:04:02.490> lines<00:04:02.730> and

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
erasing a lot of the original lines and

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.210 
erasing a lot of the original lines and
when<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.080> erase<00:04:04.350> you'll<00:04:04.590> still<00:04:04.830> be<00:04:04.950> able<00:04:04.980> to

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
when you erase you'll still be able to

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.610 
when you erase you'll still be able to
see<00:04:05.370> them<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:05.700> little<00:04:05.850> bit<00:04:06.090> but<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:07.320> know<00:04:07.440> we

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.710 
see them a little bit but you know we
want<00:04:07.770> them<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.310> go<00:04:08.580> what<00:04:09.180> makes<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.510> drawer

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
want them to go what makes the drawer

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.280 
want them to go what makes the drawer
and<00:04:09.840> look<00:04:10.050> realistic<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:11.209> when<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.360> make<00:04:13.080> sure

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
and look realistic is when you make sure

and look realistic is when you make sure
that<00:04:13.500> all<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.830> lines<00:04:14.160> have<00:04:14.490> been<00:04:15.109> done

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
that all of the lines have been done

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.039 
that all of the lines have been done
away<00:04:16.320> with<00:04:16.520> there's<00:04:17.520> no<00:04:17.880> lines<00:04:18.180> in<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.510> face<00:04:18.720> I

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
away with there's no lines in the face I

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.680 
away with there's no lines in the face I
mean<00:04:19.470> you'll<00:04:19.620> get<00:04:19.770> eyelashes<00:04:20.459> you'll<00:04:21.419> get<00:04:21.540> the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
mean you'll get eyelashes you'll get the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.840 
mean you'll get eyelashes you'll get the
mouth<00:04:21.840> line<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.169> suppose<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.130> shouldn't<00:04:23.400> say<00:04:23.580> no

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
mouth line I suppose I shouldn't say no

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.170 
mouth line I suppose I shouldn't say no
lines<00:04:24.120> but<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:25.680> know<00:04:25.770> there's<00:04:26.010> variation<00:04:26.700> if

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
lines but you know there's variation if

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.050 
lines but you know there's variation if
into<00:04:27.360> those<00:04:27.509> lines<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:29.160> want<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.430> do<00:04:29.550> do

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
into those lines so you want to do do

then I did some light hatching over it

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.930 
then I did some light hatching over it
and<00:04:58.460> that<00:04:59.460> will<00:04:59.550> give<00:04:59.580> it<00:04:59.849> some<00:05:00.000> good<00:05:00.180> texture
