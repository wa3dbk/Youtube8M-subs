00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
order the figure wasn't like very I

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.190 
order the figure wasn't like very I
think<00:06:26.880> what<00:06:27.000> happened<00:06:27.330> was<00:06:27.390> I<00:06:27.630> got<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:27.990> book

reason<00:06:55.380> but<00:06:56.000> this<00:06:57.000> guy<00:06:57.210> is<00:06:57.480> so<00:06:57.780> cute<00:06:58.260> this<00:06:59.160> is<00:06:59.370> a

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
reason but this guy is so cute this is a

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.030 
reason but this guy is so cute this is a
cutest<00:07:00.360> I've<00:07:00.480> ever<00:07:00.690> had<00:07:00.930> and<00:07:01.260> I<00:07:01.440> love<00:07:01.890> it

cutest I've ever had and I love it
and<00:07:02.520> it<00:07:02.640> wasn't<00:07:02.880> that<00:07:02.970> expensive<00:07:03.120> either<00:07:03.720> i

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
and it wasn't that expensive either i

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.350 
and it wasn't that expensive either i
think<00:07:04.230> the<00:07:04.740> dude<00:07:05.010> made<00:07:05.250> it<00:07:05.400> by<00:07:05.670> himself<00:07:05.850> and

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
think the dude made it by himself and

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.630 
think the dude made it by himself and
that's<00:07:06.780> like<00:07:06.930> what<00:07:07.230> i<00:07:07.470> really<00:07:07.770> like<00:07:07.950> i<00:07:08.160> like<00:07:08.190> to

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 
support artists gallery i would save up

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.010 
support artists gallery i would save up
some<00:07:11.040> money<00:07:11.100> to<00:07:11.700> spend<00:07:12.210> at<00:07:12.510> the<00:07:12.540> artists

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
some money to spend at the artists

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.710 
some money to spend at the artists
gallery<00:07:13.200> because<00:07:13.650> i<00:07:13.770> feel<00:07:13.920> like<00:07:14.010> it's<00:07:14.190> really

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
gallery because i feel like it's really

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.230 
gallery because i feel like it's really
it's<00:07:15.720> a<00:07:15.840> good<00:07:16.050> it's<00:07:16.320> good<00:07:17.310> like<00:07:17.490> when<00:07:17.820> artists

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
it's a good it's good like when artists

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.340 
it's a good it's good like when artists
spend<00:07:18.450> money<00:07:18.690> for<00:07:18.990> to<00:07:19.890> pay<00:07:19.920> for<00:07:20.400> other<00:07:20.550> artists

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
spend money for to pay for other artists

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.050 
spend money for to pay for other artists
and<00:07:22.350> that's<00:07:22.590> probably<00:07:23.070> like<00:07:23.160> one<00:07:23.610> of<00:07:23.640> the<00:07:23.850> best

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
and that's probably like one of the best

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.580 
and that's probably like one of the best
i<00:07:24.240> think<00:07:24.480> most<00:07:24.720> of<00:07:24.840> the<00:07:24.930> money<00:07:25.110> actually<00:07:25.290> went

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590 
i think most of the money actually went

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.650 
i think most of the money actually went
to<00:07:25.650> video<00:07:25.980> games<00:07:26.040> now<00:07:26.490> on<00:07:26.670> that<00:07:26.880> considering

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 
to video games now on that considering

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.360 
to video games now on that considering
i'm<00:07:27.810> looking<00:07:28.080> the<00:07:28.260> stack<00:07:28.560> of<00:07:28.740> video<00:07:28.950> games<00:07:29.160> and

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370 
i'm looking the stack of video games and

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.090 
i'm looking the stack of video games and
they<00:07:29.430> were<00:07:29.610> not<00:07:29.760> cheap<00:07:30.290> anyway<00:07:31.290> that<00:07:32.070> was

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:32.100 
they were not cheap anyway that was

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.220 
they were not cheap anyway that was
comic<00:07:32.670> palooza<00:07:32.970> that's<00:07:33.270> what<00:07:33.510> I<00:07:33.540> did<00:07:33.930> over<00:07:33.960> the

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230 
comic palooza that's what I did over the
