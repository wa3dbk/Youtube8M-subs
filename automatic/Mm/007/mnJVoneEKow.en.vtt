00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
serpent and the interesting thing about

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650 
serpent and the interesting thing about
this<00:00:53.190> buff<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.760> 100<00:00:54.120> percent<00:00:54.480> which<00:00:54.629> is

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
this buff it's 100 percent which is

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.240 
this buff it's 100 percent which is
rather<00:00:55.590> large<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.309> spell<00:00:56.879> steal<00:00:57.120> buff<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
rather large for a spell steal buff and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.360 
rather large for a spell steal buff and
it<00:00:59.250> also<00:00:59.489> stacks<00:01:00.500> indefinitely<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.250> only

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
it also stacks indefinitely it's only

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.060 
it also stacks indefinitely it's only
limited<00:01:02.910> by<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.120> number<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.629> actual<00:01:04.379> serpent

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
limited by the number of actual serpent

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.640 
limited by the number of actual serpent
binders<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.970> island<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.659> think<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.409> around

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
binders of the island I think is around

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.870 
binders of the island I think is around
20<00:01:08.010> or<00:01:08.040> something<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.490> stack<00:01:11.850> up

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
20 or something and you can stack up

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.320 
20 or something and you can stack up
this<00:01:12.240> buff<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.070> do<00:01:14.070> almost<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> little<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
this buff and do almost a little bit of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.100 
this buff and do almost a little bit of
damage<00:01:16.310> now<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.790> buff<00:01:17.970> only<00:01:18.240> lasts<00:01:18.689> 20

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
damage now the buff only lasts 20

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.550 
damage now the buff only lasts 20
seconds<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.420> it's<00:01:21.420> rather<00:01:21.840> difficult<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
seconds and it's rather difficult to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.090 
seconds and it's rather difficult to
harvest<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.250> lot<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.670> buffs<00:01:23.939> afraid<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.950> do

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
harvest a lot of buffs afraid this to do

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.730 
harvest a lot of buffs afraid this to do
any<00:01:26.369> serious<00:01:26.729> damage<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.720> buff<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
any serious damage with this buff you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.060 
any serious damage with this buff you
probably<00:01:29.369> need<00:01:29.670> several<00:01:29.970> people<00:01:31.070> because

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
probably need several people because

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.020 
probably need several people because
then<00:01:32.430> because<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:34.590> serpent<00:01:35.310> binders<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:35.939> you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
then because the serpent binders as you

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
then because the serpent binders as you
can<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.360> there<00:01:36.540> they<00:01:36.750> stun<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.350> repeatedly

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
can see there they stun you repeatedly

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.770 
can see there they stun you repeatedly
they<00:01:38.400> don't<00:01:38.610> do<00:01:38.700> negligible<00:01:39.329> damage<00:01:39.600> because

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
they don't do negligible damage because

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.410 
they don't do negligible damage because
they<00:01:39.930> aren't<00:01:40.079> level<00:01:40.619> 90<00:01:41.040> or<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.430> they<00:01:42.060> really

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
they aren't level 90 or so they really

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.300 
they aren't level 90 or so they really
need<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> few<00:01:42.840> people<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.920> take<00:01:44.100> his

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
need a few people with you to take his

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.319 
need a few people with you to take his
CC<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.909> healing<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.390> stuff<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:47.329> once

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
CC and healing and stuff like that once

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.499 
CC and healing and stuff like that once
you<00:01:48.540> get<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> buff<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.909> then<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.420> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
you get the buff on you then because it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.300 
you get the buff on you then because it
only<00:01:51.600> lasts<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.200> 20<00:01:52.619> seconds<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.100> kind<00:01:53.280> of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
only lasts for 20 seconds it's kind of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.340 
only lasts for 20 seconds it's kind of
difficult<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.060> anywhere<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.110> use

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
difficult to get it anywhere you can use

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.319 
difficult to get it anywhere you can use
the<00:01:55.530> same<00:01:55.740> trick<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.610> used<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the same trick that I used with the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.200 
the same trick that I used with the
icicles<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.439> most<00:01:59.040> recent<00:01:59.520> videos<00:01:59.939> that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
icicles in the most recent videos that

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.800 
icicles in the most recent videos that
you<00:02:00.270> must<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.600> aware<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:02.390> because<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.600> is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
you must be aware of because this is

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.490 
you must be aware of because this is
Pandaria<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.270> take<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.780> icicles

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
Pandaria you can take your icicles

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.100 
Pandaria you can take your icicles
through<00:02:07.770> any<00:02:07.890> port<00:02:08.250> within<00:02:08.580> Pandaria<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.050> you

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
through any port within Pandaria so you

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.290 
through any port within Pandaria so you
could<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.560> example<00:02:10.590> port<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> timeless

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
could for example port to the timeless

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.100 
could for example port to the timeless
Isle<00:02:12.510> from
