00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 tells the story of a silly traveler 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.480
 He is traveling and why it was silly 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.620
 because he was fooled very easily 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.200
 for some medicines 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.529
 the people of the villages deceived him and 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.500
 they left my shoes without money 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.930
 I have a sick sister 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.300
 I do not have money to buy seeds 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.640
 for the body but as the traveler was 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.640
 fool was thrilled with the lies of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.920
 the villagers who said it has saved us and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.440
 he answered that you are happy that 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.440
 be happy and that you eat partridges 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.450
 in the end the traveler stayed 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.850
 completely naked and had so much 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.730
 embarrassed that he decided to continue his trip to 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.830
 through the woods and then it 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.070
 crossed with the animals that lived in the 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.890
 forest the animals wanted to eat at 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.610
 traveler and they used skilful words to 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.610
 cheat him 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.549
 evidently the traveler was left 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.240
 cheat and now gave them a foot now a 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.240
 arm 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.880
 finally the traveler only had the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.790
 head and the last animal gave him his 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.010
 eyes 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.770
 that animal told the traveler while 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.410
 he ate his eyes thank you like 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.350
 thank you I want to give you a gift and 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.020
 I leave that 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.530
 but it was just a piece of paper in the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.370
 who had written fool and the traveler who 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.600
 she started crying and crying 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.090
 Grace is very first gift and illusion 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.740
 dailos 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.070
 Thanks 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.140
 while saying that I was crying through 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.370
 of the eyes that I no longer had 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.909
 and then the traveler died there 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.909
 same 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.489
 how endearing is 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:13.600
 the harm the suffering think about 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:16.360
 that 's wasting time 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.600
 but the traveler did not think about his own 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.600
 pain 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.760
 it is possible that for someone only 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.400
 a poor fool but for me it is not 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.879
 although for the rest of the people it is a 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.329
 easy person to cheat I'm not going to 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.329
 cheat 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.300
 to me 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.570
 what I would like is to make you happy 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.570
 true
