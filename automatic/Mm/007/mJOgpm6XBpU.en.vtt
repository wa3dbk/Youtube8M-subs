00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.589
 this is my object of today 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.230
 desire looks from the outside like normal 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.780
 But it is not halfway two engines 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.790
 and thus mtm wants the 400 km h 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.170
 sound barrier crack 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.490
 1000 ps can not be on any 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.199
 toddler playground but try out 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.970
 also you already have as official here 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.090
 we have a wonderful long start and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.980
 Runway for big big planes and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.380
 I'm curious how much I and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.029
 to create my little friend today 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.230
 but will not break 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.300
 because the car is still a record 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.040
 drive yes means two motors 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.219
 Of course, two tachometers 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.570
 funny enough and two start button for 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.360
 that means the motors become individual 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.559
 Started over city â€‹â€‹buttons and you have 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.539
 Of course, still only one shift lever 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.550
 So these are the gearboxes 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.020
 mechanically connected the switching linkage 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.660
 and you also notice when the clutch 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.610
 because that's just about easy 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.980
 Two couplings are for every 500 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.149
 ps engines and such a clutch I have 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.649
 never seen and i think i have 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.690
 later on hip and knee hurt if 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.809
 I'm done here 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.809
 we'll see 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.470
 that was the rear engine and that was 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.470
 become the father 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.100
 a two-liter four-cylinder engine in front 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.230
 one behind 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.910
 this car was built exclusively 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.190
 to go straight fast 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.230
 a variety of spoilers and find 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.230
 should provide sufficient downforce 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.810
 the contemplative Wettstetten at 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.540
 ingolstadt here was the company mtm 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.550
 engines engineering mayer 1990 from 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.360
 former Audi engineer roland meyer 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.210
 founded 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.010
 the engines want an audi tt 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.700
 Tinkerer also an ambitious goal 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.010
 to reach 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.470
 400 km h should the car at a 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.090
 record attempt in Italian nardo in 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.070
 burning the asphalt 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.020
 the double pack with its two turbo 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.329
 Charged engines was on the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.090
 in-house roller dynamometer matched 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:05.009
 and tested but data are a thing 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.009
 drive yourself another 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.789
 So we go a little gas and 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.789
 See if a plane lands 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.170
 So four and a half meyer 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.560
 it does not really work 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.560
 off 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.750
 as thanks to the windows 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.170
 should 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.170
 300 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.379
 It really has a special car for top 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.000
 speed is built that means you are 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.370
 also get in and drive somewhere 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.930
 the field completely out because you can 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.599
 not just go with gas but 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.579
 You first have to stand at first gas 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.930
 Carefully roll out that's you 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.640
 are completely impressed and you can 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.109
 the gas passed with gas off you go 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.780
 not there goes out a motor and that is 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.640
 way too complicated for one 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.680
 speed of 400 km h too 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.280
 the enormous drag has to be reached 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.660
 be overcome 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.330
 it's just that 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.800
 drag to the square over the 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.000
 understandability increases so that means 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.319
 want to drive twice as fast 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.250
 do not you need the double the 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.740
 four times the power 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.740
 the ncl solution is an additional motor 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.790
 will someone like mtm have the experience 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.350
 easy with this four cylinder engine 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.940
 in the back one packs and almost 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.860
 in the back again a front axle installed 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.410
 and that all just then 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.850
 bit about the electronics 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.650
 synchronized by that so one 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.000
 high performance sets the performance 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.650
 It's late when that's the case 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.100
 drive off 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.100
 in the first course 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.790
 until five actually happens 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.840
 nothing and after that comes really big 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.840
 turbo but not right now 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.160
 really incredible 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.300
 we guide 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.300
 march did not reach her 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.710
 very impressed like the car at 309 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.470
 go away from gas and then full throttle 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.750
 it at 300 still flies away again when 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.790
 over the season does not have twelve 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.920
 come over or maybe at 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.910
 the Bergisch circle but not so long 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.140
 really on the speedometer but you play 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.750
 really just stop that car 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.780
 definitely stopping possible performance over 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.880
 shot has the 400 km h apply as 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.390
 magic limit in the arms race of the 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:08.160
 tuner the tt was already close with 393 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.000
 the jump from 393 to plate 407 km / h 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.260
 but in the high 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.980
 speed range you need for 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.900
 the 7 km h I guess 100 ps or 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.820
 something and the question is just the flames 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.710
 you need and when does offer 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.180
 when is the air resistance and the 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.550
 performance is the same and when 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.380
 I can not continue I guess 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.610
 even that would be to create otherwise 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.320
 Not so good things the guys Nardo 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.390
 Southern Italy on the 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.910
 high-speed line blees mtm 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.730
 to the record attempt 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.340
 the precious be motogp is meticulous 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.630
 prepared for the magical 400 km h 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.700
 border break 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.470
 the evening before, the tension is great 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.210
 The car will be one last time 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.210
 reviewed and verified 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.659
 The race day starts badly 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.379
 the weather is not ideal but mtm wants 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.689
 to try it 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.399
 on the 12 6 kilometer long track 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.030
 builds driver florian gruber 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:04.770
 speed up 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.510
 by the inclination of the circular path drives 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.510
 the car almost without lateral forces 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.810
 in the end it was not quite 390 km / h 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.640
 indicate the meters 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.440
 the strong wind always has the car 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.110
 get restless again 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.190
 gntm no reason to blow the 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.750
 Dare has kept 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.750
 the record is theoretically possible 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.830
 on 1 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.150
 personal hot record I could 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.020
 not crack it was the start 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.840
 runway know too short 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.550
 nato has mtm the targeted 400 km 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.410
 h also not quite done 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.580
 but as I know the boys 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.030
 they will be back soon 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.030
 try out
