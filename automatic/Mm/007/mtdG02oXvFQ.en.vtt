might even show them right now but I'm
not<00:00:25.500> sure<00:00:25.680> where<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> stuck<00:00:26.849> him<00:00:26.970> he's<00:00:27.119> probably

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
not sure where I stuck him he's probably

not sure where I stuck him he's probably
in<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.599> drawer<00:00:27.980> but<00:00:28.980> back<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.240> gun<00:00:32.000> I'm

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
in a drawer but back to the the gun I'm

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.670 
in a drawer but back to the the gun I'm
not<00:00:33.180> sure<00:00:33.239> they<00:00:33.630> have<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> serial<00:00:34.290> number<00:00:34.530> right

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
not sure they have a serial number right

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.549 
not sure they have a serial number right
here<00:00:34.710> I'm<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.190> sure<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:35.550> that's<00:00:35.780> if<00:00:36.780> they're

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
here I'm not sure if that's if they're

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.500 
here I'm not sure if that's if they're
all<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> same<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.700> Megatron's<00:00:39.239> are

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
all the same or if the Megatron's are

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.060 
all the same or if the Megatron's are
actually<00:00:39.930> numbered<00:00:40.379> that'd<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.739> pretty<00:00:40.950> cool

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
actually numbered that'd be pretty cool

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.830 
actually numbered that'd be pretty cool
if<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.399> could<00:00:41.640> actually<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.180> well<00:00:42.719> I've<00:00:42.809> got

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
if you could actually see well I've got

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.580 
if you could actually see well I've got
Megatron<00:00:43.530> number<00:00:44.030> 17<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.500> 10,000<00:00:46.500> or

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
Megatron number 17 out of 10,000 or

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.709 
Megatron number 17 out of 10,000 or
however<00:00:46.770> many<00:00:47.039> he's<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.520> built<00:00:47.789> but

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
however many he's going to be built but

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.110 
however many he's going to be built but
mine's<00:00:49.910> 4640<00:00:50.910> e<00:00:52.039> so<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.610> someone<00:00:53.820> has<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
mine's 4640 e so if someone has a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.580 
mine's 4640 e so if someone has a
different<00:00:54.570> number<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:54.930> let<00:00:55.079> me<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
different number when let me know but I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.939 
different number when let me know but I
think<00:00:55.860> they're<00:00:55.980> probably<00:00:56.219> all<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> same

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
think they're probably all the same

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.410 
think they're probably all the same
since<00:00:58.949> I'm<00:00:59.129> REE<00:00:59.250> filming<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.120> show

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
since I'm REE filming this I can show

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.070 
since I'm REE filming this I can show
the<00:01:00.809> laser<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:02.059> not<00:01:03.059> laser<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.899> lights

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the laser now not laser it just lights

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.820 
the laser now not laser it just lights
up

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 

online<00:01:08.730> you<00:01:08.910> won't<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.210> careful<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.720> went<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:09.990> I

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
online you won't be careful I went and I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.710 
online you won't be careful I went and I
pulled<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> trigger<00:01:10.800> on<00:01:10.890> mine<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.660> if<00:01:12.660> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
pulled the trigger on mine and if you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.210 
pulled the trigger on mine and if you
pull<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> back<00:01:13.380> they'll<00:01:13.590> come<00:01:13.830> back<00:01:14.010> about

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
pull it back they'll come back about

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.500 
pull it back they'll come back about
that<00:01:14.400> far<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> try<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.270> pull<00:01:15.480> it

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
that far but if you try to pull it

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.780 
that far but if you try to pull it
further<00:01:15.870> it<00:01:16.590> pulls<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> whole<00:01:17.190> trigger<00:01:17.520> group

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
further it pulls the whole trigger group

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.470 
further it pulls the whole trigger group
down<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:19.290> broke<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.620> tab<00:01:20.070> off<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.790> what's

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
down and I broke a tab off of what's

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.940 
down and I broke a tab off of what's
supposed<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.900> hold<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.800> place<00:01:23.810> but

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.710 

this<00:01:28.950> guy<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.250> such<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.730> piece<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> work<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.570> get

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
this guy is such a piece of work to get

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.030 
this guy is such a piece of work to get
into<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.050> mode<00:01:31.320> I'm<00:01:31.560> really<00:01:31.800> not<00:01:31.980> looking

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
into this mode I'm really not looking

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.320 
into this mode I'm really not looking
forward<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:33.020> making<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.580> overview<00:01:35.580> of<00:01:35.730> the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
forward to making the overview of the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.450 
forward to making the overview of the
three<00:01:36.600> different<00:01:36.960> leader<00:01:37.110> classes<00:01:37.680> leader

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
three different leader classes leader

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.380 
three different leader classes leader
class<00:01:38.700> supreme<00:01:40.040> masterpiece<00:01:41.060> just<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.360> I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
class supreme masterpiece just because I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.150 
class supreme masterpiece just because I
might<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:42.900> transform<00:01:43.500> him<00:01:43.680> again<00:01:43.890> back

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
might have to transform him again back

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.730 
might have to transform him again back
into<00:01:44.460> robot<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.030> he<00:01:45.150> will<00:01:45.270> stay<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.600> robot<00:01:46.170> for

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
into robot and he will stay in robot for

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.040 
into robot and he will stay in robot for
the<00:01:46.860> rest<00:01:47.160> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> time<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:47.970> own<00:01:48.240> him<00:01:48.510> he

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
the rest of the time that I own him he

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.010 
the rest of the time that I own him he
will<00:01:49.170> probably<00:01:49.440> never<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.070> transformed<00:01:50.820> again

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
will probably never be transformed again

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.719 
will probably never be transformed again
because<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.860> guy<00:01:53.040> almost<00:01:53.190> feels<00:01:53.610> like

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
because this guy almost feels like

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.760 
because this guy almost feels like
you've<00:01:54.479> only<00:01:54.690> got<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.080> many<00:01:55.200> transformations

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you've only got so many transformations

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.850 
you've only got so many transformations
in<00:01:56.369> him<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.270> once<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> use<00:01:57.780> those<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.350> he<00:01:58.710> is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
in him and once you use those up he is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.800 
in him and once you use those up he is
gonna<00:01:59.100> break<00:01:59.460> something<00:01:59.850> or<00:02:00.119> wear<00:02:00.390> something

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
gonna break something or wear something

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.450 
gonna break something or wear something
out<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.229> mean<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.550> just<00:02:03.020> bad<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.680> take

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
out I mean it's just bad and if you take

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.040 
out I mean it's just bad and if you take
and<00:02:05.729> hold<00:02:06.360> him<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:07.260> this<00:02:08.570> well<00:02:09.570> not<00:02:09.869> right

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
and hold him like this well not right

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.590 
and hold him like this well not right

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
give ah I'm gonna give his robot mode

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.750 
give ah I'm gonna give his robot mode
and<00:02:54.930> eight<00:02:55.350> because<00:02:55.739> it's<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.980> very<00:02:56.190> nice<00:02:56.370> robot

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
and eight because it's a very nice robot

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.910 
and eight because it's a very nice robot
mode<00:02:57.000> very<00:02:57.390> spindly<00:02:57.900> its<00:02:58.050> kind<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.410> weakened

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
mode very spindly its kind of weakened

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.890 
mode very spindly its kind of weakened
the<00:02:59.040> hips<00:02:59.370> though<00:02:59.730> that's<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.630> only<00:03:00.780> thing

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
the hips though that's the only thing

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.140 
the hips though that's the only thing
that<00:03:01.050> keeps<00:03:01.290> them<00:03:01.500> from<00:03:01.880> scoring<00:03:02.880> bear

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
that keeps them from scoring bear

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.720 
that keeps them from scoring bear
because<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:03.450> might<00:03:03.630> notice<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.260> my<00:03:04.709> robot<00:03:05.459> sec

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
because you might notice in my robot sec

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.610 
because you might notice in my robot sec
we're<00:03:06.090> gonna<00:03:06.239> have<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.540> robot<00:03:06.840> mode<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.470> was

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
we're gonna have in robot mode it was

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.110 
we're gonna have in robot mode it was
always<00:03:07.830> leaning<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.459> that's<00:03:08.610> because<00:03:08.760> his

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
always leaning and that's because his

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.759 
always leaning and that's because his
hips<00:03:09.360> just<00:03:09.810> don't<00:03:10.200> hold<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.930> gun<00:03:13.200> mode<00:03:13.470> is

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
hips just don't hold the gun mode is

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.130 
hips just don't hold the gun mode is
going<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.340> get<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.519> 9<00:03:14.880> even<00:03:15.510> though<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:15.810> a

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
going to get a 9 even though it is a

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.479 
going to get a 9 even though it is a
verily<00:03:16.950> over<00:03:17.310> scale<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:19.069> I've<00:03:20.069> actually

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
verily over scale like I've actually

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.970 
verily over scale like I've actually
held<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:21.120> real<00:03:22.100> p38<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.930> it's<00:03:24.930> only<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.350> hair

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
held a real p38 and it's only a hair

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.009 
held a real p38 and it's only a hair
larger<00:03:26.970> than<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.420> like<00:03:29.420> maybe<00:03:30.420> only<00:03:30.690> that

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
larger than this like maybe only that

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.270 
larger than this like maybe only that
much<00:03:31.530> longer

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.530 

this<00:03:35.180> thing<00:03:35.510> feels<00:03:36.730> like<00:03:37.730> holding<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.150> desert

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
this thing feels like holding a desert

this thing feels like holding a desert
eagle<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:40.280> that's<00:03:40.430> what<00:03:40.610> makes<00:03:40.819> it<00:03:40.940> funny<00:03:41.270> that

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
eagle so that's what makes it funny that

they<00:03:42.200> have<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:42.650> many<00:03:42.680> or<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.610> can<00:03:43.790> import<00:03:44.060> that

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
they have so many or you can import that

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.090 
they have so many or you can import that
sort<00:03:44.510> replica<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:45.470> it's<00:03:45.680> not<00:03:45.950> I<00:03:47.350> mean<00:03:48.350> yeah

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
sort replica so it's not I mean yeah

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.850 
sort replica so it's not I mean yeah
it's<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.370> replica<00:03:49.580> if<00:03:50.030> like<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:51.440> made<00:03:51.650> one

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
it's a replica if like you made one

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.170 
it's a replica if like you made one
custom<00:03:52.310> fit<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.850> fit<00:03:53.090> Andre<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.750> Giant's<00:03:54.230> hand

actually Andre Giants ring finger was

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.300 
actually Andre Giants ring finger was
the<00:04:01.819> size<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.780> half-dollar<00:04:03.260> ok<00:04:03.920> nevermind

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
the size of a half-dollar ok nevermind

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.300 
the size of a half-dollar ok nevermind
Andre<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.819> Giant<00:04:05.120> could<00:04:05.270> not<00:04:05.450> have<00:04:05.600> held<00:04:05.810> this

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
Andre the Giant could not have held this

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.210 
Andre the Giant could not have held this
his<00:04:07.310> fingers<00:04:07.940> were<00:04:07.970> too<00:04:08.120> large<00:04:08.450> my<00:04:08.959> mistake

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
his fingers were too large my mistake

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.130 
his fingers were too large my mistake
but<00:04:10.220> uh

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.890 

if<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.920> buy<00:04:16.160> this<00:04:16.220> guy<00:04:16.670> and<00:04:17.060> you're<00:04:17.540> not<00:04:17.720> going

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
if you buy this guy and you're not going

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.960 
if you buy this guy and you're not going
to<00:04:17.959> display<00:04:18.350> them<00:04:18.590> in<00:04:18.709> gun<00:04:19.340> mode<00:04:19.579> I<00:04:19.760> would

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
to display them in gun mode I would

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.870 
to display them in gun mode I would
recommend<00:04:20.239> never<00:04:20.750> transform<00:04:21.350> him<00:04:21.650> just<00:04:22.640> leave

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
recommend never transform him just leave

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.330 
recommend never transform him just leave
them<00:04:23.030> in<00:04:23.180> robot<00:04:23.540> mode<00:04:23.740> unbroken<00:04:24.740> unmolested

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
them in robot mode unbroken unmolested

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.120 
them in robot mode unbroken unmolested
because<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:29.110> honestly<00:04:30.110> think<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.800> is<00:04:30.920> his

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
because I honestly think it is his

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.659 
because I honestly think it is his
better<00:04:31.400> mode<00:04:32.140> because<00:04:33.140> this<00:04:33.919> is<00:04:34.100> just<00:04:34.130> hard<00:04:34.520> to

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
better mode because this is just hard to

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.880 
better mode because this is just hard to
display<00:04:35.150> even<00:04:35.990> though<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.169> does<00:04:36.380> look<00:04:36.650> cool

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
display even though it does look cool

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:43.210 
display even though it does look cool
but

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.490 

he's<00:04:43.820> kata<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.510> don't<00:04:45.140> know<00:04:47.230> while<00:04:48.230> he<00:04:48.350> is<00:04:48.470> a

he's kata I don't know while he is a

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.670 
he's kata I don't know while he is a
great<00:04:49.070> fantastic<00:04:49.760> figure<00:04:50.330> an<00:04:50.680> engineering

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
great fantastic figure an engineering

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.070 
great fantastic figure an engineering
standpoint<00:04:52.040> I<00:04:52.340> mean<00:04:52.520> he's<00:04:52.670> great<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.900> have

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
standpoint I mean he's great to have

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.360 
standpoint I mean he's great to have
everything<00:04:54.530> fit<00:04:55.100> as<00:04:55.280> good<00:04:55.730> as<00:04:55.970> they<00:04:56.120> do<00:04:57.370> but

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
everything fit as good as they do but

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.950 
everything fit as good as they do but
that<00:04:58.520> doesn't<00:04:58.880> make<00:04:59.000> him<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.270> good<00:04:59.420> toy

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.100 

like<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.680> said<00:05:04.740> his<00:05:05.430> individual<00:05:06.030> modes<00:05:06.300> score

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
like I said his individual modes score

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.850 
like I said his individual modes score
high<00:05:07.380> I<00:05:07.789> at<00:05:08.789> seven<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:09.330> eight<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:10.139> you<00:05:10.199> fear

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
high I at seven and eight so you fear

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.629 
high I at seven and eight so you fear
7.5<00:05:11.789> average<00:05:12.210> but<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.560> transformation<00:05:14.490> is

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
7.5 average but the transformation is

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:21.310 
7.5 average but the transformation is
going<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.120> bring<00:05:15.360> him<00:05:15.509> down<00:05:15.680> to<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.710> six<00:05:17.270> because

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.700 

I<00:05:21.380> have<00:05:22.070> never<00:05:22.900> transformed<00:05:23.900> anything<00:05:24.470> like

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
I have never transformed anything like

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.210 
I have never transformed anything like
this<00:05:24.950> before<00:05:25.280> and<00:05:25.880> after<00:05:26.780> next<00:05:27.710> week<00:05:27.980> when<00:05:28.190> i

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
this before and after next week when i

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.530 
this before and after next week when i
do<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.670> overview<00:05:29.540> I<00:05:29.720> never<00:05:30.080> will<00:05:30.290> again<00:05:30.620> I

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
do the overview I never will again I

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.360 
do the overview I never will again I
mean<00:05:32.540> like<00:05:33.350> that<00:05:33.680> can<00:05:33.890> see<00:05:34.040> that<00:05:34.220> could

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
mean like that can see that could

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.950 
mean like that can see that could
possibly<00:05:34.760> be<00:05:34.850> worse<00:05:35.120> than<00:05:35.300> this<00:05:35.450> as<00:05:35.660> if<00:05:35.810> they

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
possibly be worse than this as if they

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.980 
possibly be worse than this as if they
make<00:05:36.170> a<00:05:36.200> masterpiece<00:05:36.580> Unicron<00:05:37.780> that<00:05:38.780> is

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
make a masterpiece Unicron that is

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.680 
make a masterpiece Unicron that is
perfectly<00:05:39.560> spherical<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:40.510> transforms<00:05:41.510> like

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
perfectly spherical and transforms like

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.150 
perfectly spherical and transforms like
he<00:05:41.810> did<00:05:41.960> in<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.140> movie<00:05:42.320> that<00:05:42.770> would<00:05:42.950> be<00:05:43.130> a

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
he did in the movie that would be a

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:51.100 
he did in the movie that would be a
nightmare<00:05:44.680> but<00:05:48.820> anyway<00:05:49.820> y'all<00:05:50.720> have<00:05:50.870> a<00:05:50.900> good

nightmare but anyway y'all have a good

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.320 
nightmare but anyway y'all have a good

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
day and I'm sorry to brand it so long in

day and I'm sorry to brand it so long in
this<00:05:53.540> job<00:05:53.930> good
