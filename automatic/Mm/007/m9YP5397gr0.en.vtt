00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.710
 we were good used to do the router and 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:24.090
 samsung galaxy 'aces' and the model is the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.970
 gts 58 39 and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.600
 you have to download a file that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.200
 I will leave in the reads of the description 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.150
 when you download it and the computer 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:40.540
 connect the mobile with a cable 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.370
 or will this little message come connected 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.560
 you count 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.340
 and you pass it to the sd card and to know 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.030
 if you have passed, go to the file 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.030
 archive 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.200
 and there comes a gt s 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.960
 9.5 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.900
 good 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.900
 now we disconnect and turn off 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.119
 and now to enter we have recovery in 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.810
 mode the button on key plus and 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.810
 home button 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.510
 now it's off and we press 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.110
 we still keep pressing 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.650
 until we get the recovery mode 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.470
 now 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.710
 let's apply from devote 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.830
 we give you the home button 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:02.409
 and we look for the file that is 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.810
 ruth gts 28 we were 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.380
 and now we give the first one that is 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.380
 rebound 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.200
 and it's very easy 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.200
 the process 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.310
 the only thing that takes a little more 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.310
 normally and it is already 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.020
 I try the ma with this model 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.860
 the link of distinction to this model 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.270
 not with another model no longer tested 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.270
 today he is promoted 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.790
 now you are going to see if it has a lot of root 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.620
 to the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.060
 here and we'll see what the application is 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.510
 super user 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.510
 we give him 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.060
 and good is already here and that's the only thing 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.319
 you have to do other applications with 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.359
 ruth and it will allow you access 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.739
 good guys if I'm not sure that 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:31.150
 you have done well hopefully this application 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.150
 It's called Ruth Seger 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.739
 BELIZE osa give 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.500
 and we have discovered lesson we have 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.420
 access then we are already sure what 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.420
