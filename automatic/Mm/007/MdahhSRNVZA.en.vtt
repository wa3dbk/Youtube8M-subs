00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.600
 in e joly the ch'ti and therefore little 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.870
 after a few short days we will say that I bought that I 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 try 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.960
 and for 100 m 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.940
 I fall I see that criticism of history eliott so thereafter 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.200
 the liner of evil but so there is an hour express ali nur 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.860
 so that looks like 6 more I liked it 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.390
 so I thought I liked him bless a note marc in his eyes 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.350
 I'm fine so 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.549
 on the other hand for this year berlin were also a particularly disappointed 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.980
 so I'm not used to this video site, but I got 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.320
 felt obliged because 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 it was necessary to see that accounts what happened to me so 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.979
 I already had good that I am able to use minors of 10 dinars 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.060
 in the case of this one 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.280
 so for me I use that locals 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.280
 so the man 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 with the tip like that now the plaster wood 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.220
 So here is the worst 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.740
 my old 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.420
 mayor of pikine 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.780
 the most dangerous people used and this one should be 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.970
 in air gcc this Thursday not long ago 2 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.590
 in e3 every day 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.880
 eram 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.990
 he is great 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.340
 frankly 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.000
 I found it so super non-lapointe and well it is easy 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.109
 can there be worse than the one he likes 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.510
 % over a year we can do the supercars and I loved 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.129
 we have against the man groups of four 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.379
 to better preserve the eve 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.299
 so the match 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.620
 I savor though a sun that started with the money 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.639
 so I live here or there what was happening any player is possible so 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.929
 the man I said to myself maybe it'll be up 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.159
 anyway 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.989
 and as in the cinema m 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.099
 sometimes I put yesterday castor oil on gigantic seats in 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.279
 europe i was struggling but maxis and maybe that 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.739
 taking risk it remains besides it's a certainty 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:54.569
 it did me well explained so I decided by stopped to put the 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.129
 rigor 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.559
 and for the man 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:58.749
 the 2007 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.379
 Don Quixote to Conflict 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.019
 so genius a trader for maybe three days so that's 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.639
 firefighters and I told myself bob janssen had entrusted julie corey trying to 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.150
 put in the spotlight to know if it was really a beautiful energy 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.369
 he confided 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.189
 so I'm going to be used and indeed 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.300
 maynard 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.530
 the marble cause an allergy nicolas only one cover not understand 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.289
 so the ol well it starts to swell my eyelid 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.129
 so I am happy and proud of the human being 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.119
 and then then that's ok 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.320
 perfectly understood the little night music party 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.170
 Gnpc theory because they had little little crusts 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.279
 final 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.629
 like when do you have how old can you read 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.249
 bompard has excessively year 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:47.299
 work hard a little 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.499
 here and after I had some small crusts 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.039
 just as disturbing still alive 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.999
 so for 100 euros in flowers for this vnf engineer 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.099
 that can also if he does not 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.099
 especially per month but good 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:05.859
 hold 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.989
 to specify it anyway so think that I am in order to homs 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.839
 I have to buy myself with happiness what am I going to take and two 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.219
 when I saw the wolf 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.509
 at one hour of play 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:17.569
 julie 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.469
 the yvelines 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.359
 so there an experience 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.409
 so I bought it was in the sand 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.439
 thanks to a donation of his solid cardboard so I will not try 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.289
 6% in an intermarchÃ© et al 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.520
 so that's what I could not try 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.449
 still gibbs even dream 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.349
 I liked the purpose of accessing it 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.860
 So here is 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.439
 the young man 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:45.040
 to hear him forgive first shaken design sold 6 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.040
 visit I'm a stylist 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.819
 course is of course very atypical 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.819
 relief then have long 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.419
 and for saint jo 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.729
 in fact so super of AIDS 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.289
 but as a tool of conquest 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.289
 it looks like it is necessary to add water in celebration 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.050
 look at it I do not know if you see middle 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.159
 in Algeria the pain I am a bitten or that of the penalty on allo uncle 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.240
 we put tons of water 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.520
 I know I'm a victim I know it's not them 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.520
 nerves 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.800
 so I do not understand 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.629
 I do not understand at all 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:40.360
 how can we 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.589
 used to dinard 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:43.539
 like that 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.539
 dangor doing super 15 sorting made a pretty 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.710
 League 1 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.279
 I do not know more 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.279
 frankly we will 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:02.789
 I do not understand 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.789
 if I thought I was a designer 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.830
 I do not understand at all 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.150
 then there would be a little bit of that once it's 7 it's a negative vote if 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.150
 that of india 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
 of arrival so I found that it will not be part of 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.629
 so I do not know what they did is that if you do too nice 

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:31.759
 maybe only d percent and gold certainly a manufacturing defect 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.909
 at death per year 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:38.289
 so if you've ever used this project lexar what you do not have 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:39.479
 worry 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:42.529
 a nice feat of comments 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:45.569
 because here I do not understand 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.180
 I do not understand at all 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.499
 how could he do that 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:54.899
 so I want to clarify that it's the black color that I bought this 

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:57.899
 black color so it's not at all worried rihour 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.080
 our color so it's really only black 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.909
 % here 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.779
 the girls on the decline was too swollen 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:11.779
 you show but two 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.860
 pity because I really liked good 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.779
 ease of application and then at the intensity of the month I saw 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:21.600
 dr 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.839
 and that of arcachon 

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:26.839
 I do not know what it's used for 

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:28.169
 it's not at all 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:31.339
 for the donation balon finally I bought my dinars ticket 

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:33.749
 the day before Wednesday morning 

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:36.649
 I had bought m 

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:42.029
 that's a group zero race code and it's almost a year ago charles
