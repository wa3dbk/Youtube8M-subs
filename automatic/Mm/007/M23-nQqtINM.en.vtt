Sparkle<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.880> found<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.269> bit<00:03:36.299> hard<00:03:36.750> to

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
Sparkle and I found it a bit hard to

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.539 
Sparkle and I found it a bit hard to
work<00:03:37.109> with<00:03:37.319> I<00:03:37.500> guess<00:03:37.889> you're<00:03:38.160> supposed<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.430> put

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
work with I guess you're supposed to put

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.370 
work with I guess you're supposed to put
it<00:03:38.639> on<00:03:38.730> your<00:03:38.849> brow<00:03:39.030> bone<00:03:39.359> but<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.959> found<00:03:40.200> it

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
it on your brow bone but I found it

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.259 
it on your brow bone but I found it
looking<00:03:40.530> just<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:40.980> little<00:03:41.190> bit<00:03:41.310> too<00:03:41.639> much<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.239> I

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
looking just a little bit too much so I

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.569 
looking just a little bit too much so I
really<00:03:42.750> only<00:03:42.780> put<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.319> like<00:03:43.470> right<00:03:43.919> here<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.519> I

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
really only put it like right here and I

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.759 
really only put it like right here and I
really<00:03:44.790> didn't<00:03:45.030> blend<00:03:45.239> too<00:03:45.389> far<00:03:45.599> up<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.989> kept<00:03:46.530> my

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
really didn't blend too far up I kept my

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.220 
really didn't blend too far up I kept my
brow<00:03:47.010> very<00:03:47.430> under<00:03:47.940> my<00:03:48.060> brow<00:03:48.269> very<00:03:48.599> neutral<00:03:49.049> but

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
brow very under my brow very neutral but

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.069 
brow very under my brow very neutral but
um<00:03:49.980> in<00:03:50.220> terms<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.730> pigmentation<00:03:51.180> it's<00:03:51.780> also

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
um in terms of pigmentation it's also

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.390 
um in terms of pigmentation it's also
decent<00:03:52.260> but<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.650> one<00:03:52.799> like<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.040> said<00:03:53.069> was<00:03:53.370> a

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
decent but this one like I said was a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.610 
decent but this one like I said was a
little<00:03:53.669> bit<00:03:53.760> hard<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.000> work<00:03:54.090> with<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:55.139> kind<00:03:55.500> of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
little bit hard to work with it kind of

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.270 
little bit hard to work with it kind of
just<00:03:56.989> translates<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.139> sparkle<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:59.099> do

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
just translates that sparkle and you do

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.069 
just translates that sparkle and you do
get<00:03:59.430> two<00:03:59.639> applicators<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:00.510> just<00:04:00.720> dropped

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
get two applicators and I just dropped

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.110 
get two applicators and I just dropped
them<00:04:01.440> but<00:04:01.919> they<00:04:02.340> go<00:04:02.519> here<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.849> there<00:04:02.940> to

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
them but they go here and there to

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.089 
them but they go here and there to
sponge<00:04:03.419> applicators<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.139> don't<00:04:04.950> really

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
sponge applicators I don't really

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.759 
sponge applicators I don't really
recommend<00:04:05.280> using<00:04:05.700> them<00:04:05.910> for<00:04:06.440> two<00:04:07.440> reasons

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
recommend using them for two reasons

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.650 
recommend using them for two reasons
they'll<00:04:07.980> retain<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.639> glitter<00:04:08.849> and<00:04:09.150> they<00:04:09.480> also

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
they'll retain the glitter and they also

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.539 
they'll retain the glitter and they also
won't<00:04:09.870> deliver<00:04:10.230> as<00:04:10.530> much<00:04:10.680> pigmentation<00:04:11.430> as

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
won't deliver as much pigmentation as

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.490 
won't deliver as much pigmentation as
you<00:04:11.639> may<00:04:11.790> want<00:04:11.940> now<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.690> two<00:04:12.959> shades<00:04:13.200> down

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
you may want now the two shades down

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.809 
you may want now the two shades down
here<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:13.829> was<00:04:13.919> wondering<00:04:14.040> like<00:04:14.310> what<00:04:14.549> goes<00:04:14.669> on

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
here I was wondering like what goes on

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.129 
here I was wondering like what goes on
with<00:04:15.030> these<00:04:15.209> are<00:04:15.389> these<00:04:15.540> just<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:15.900> if<00:04:16.049> you

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
with these are these just like if you

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.750 
with these are these just like if you
want<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.380> pair<00:04:16.650> them<00:04:16.859> cuz<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.250> know<00:04:17.340> green<00:04:17.609> and

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
want to pair them cuz you know green and

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.979 
want to pair them cuz you know green and
purple<00:04:18.090> go<00:04:18.209> very<00:04:18.419> well<00:04:18.510> together

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
purple go very well together

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.229 
purple go very well together
and<00:04:19.470> apparently<00:04:19.709> number<00:04:20.250> one<00:04:20.579> which<00:04:21.000> was

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
and apparently number one which was

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.630 
and apparently number one which was
right<00:04:21.450> here<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:22.200> primer<00:04:22.620> yet<00:04:23.099> it's<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.400> very

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
right here is a primer yet it's a very

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.719 
right here is a primer yet it's a very
sparkly<00:04:24.479> powder<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.800> has<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.010> bit<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.280> fallout

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
sparkly powder that has a bit of fallout

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.080 
sparkly powder that has a bit of fallout
so

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
so

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.050 
so
it's<00:04:27.300> really<00:04:27.720> not<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.020> good<00:04:28.199> primer<00:04:28.560> at<00:04:28.889> all<00:04:29.250> but

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
it's really not a good primer at all but

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.700 
it's really not a good primer at all but
if<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.389> put<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:30.660> under<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.050> purple<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.590> will

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
if you put it under the purple you will

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.800 
if you put it under the purple you will
get<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:31.889> lot<00:04:32.250> more<00:04:32.520> glitter<00:04:33.270> like<00:04:33.510> your<00:04:33.660> eyes

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
get a lot more glitter like your eyes

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.040 
get a lot more glitter like your eyes
will<00:04:34.110> be<00:04:34.139> extremely<00:04:35.010> glittering<00:04:35.930> whereas<00:04:36.930> if

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
will be extremely glittering whereas if

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.080 
will be extremely glittering whereas if
you<00:04:37.139> put<00:04:37.169> it<00:04:37.410> on<00:04:37.530> top<00:04:37.889> it<00:04:38.460> won't<00:04:38.669> be<00:04:38.880> as

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
you put it on top it won't be as

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.200 
you put it on top it won't be as
littering<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:40.560> what<00:04:41.040> I<00:04:41.070> would<00:04:41.280> say<00:04:41.460> is<00:04:41.760> apply

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
littering so what I would say is apply

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.900 
littering so what I would say is apply
your<00:04:42.479> actual<00:04:42.960> primer<00:04:43.380> then<00:04:44.040> applying<00:04:44.430> number

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
your actual primer then applying number

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.750 
your actual primer then applying number
one<00:04:45.120> then<00:04:45.780> apply<00:04:46.110> two<00:04:46.650> three<00:04:47.010> four<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:47.729> then

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
one then apply two three four and then

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.750 
one then apply two three four and then
five<00:04:48.270> now<00:04:49.229> number<00:04:49.560> five<00:04:49.770> is<00:04:50.040> supposed<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.520> be

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
five now number five is supposed to be

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.230 
five now number five is supposed to be
the<00:04:51.380> enhance<00:04:52.380> with<00:04:52.650> sparkle<00:04:53.100> topcoat<00:04:53.580> but

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
the enhance with sparkle topcoat but

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.550 
the enhance with sparkle topcoat but
number<00:04:54.510> five<00:04:54.660> really<00:04:54.900> just<00:04:55.199> makes<00:04:55.350> your<00:04:55.500> eye

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
number five really just makes your eye

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.890 
number five really just makes your eye
look<00:04:55.710> much<00:04:56.370> darker<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:57.210> if<00:04:57.300> you're<00:04:57.449> looking<00:04:57.630> so

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
look much darker so if you're looking so

look much darker so if you're looking so
if<00:04:57.990> you've<00:04:58.139> already<00:04:58.260> done<00:04:58.500> your<00:04:58.560> looking<00:04:58.919> your

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
much darker look I actually applied it

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.850 
much darker look I actually applied it
in<00:05:03.180> this<00:05:03.360> V<00:05:03.540> and<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:04.020> can<00:05:04.200> see<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.560> just<00:05:04.590> made

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
in this V and you can see it just made

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.159 
in this V and you can see it just made
everything<00:05:05.010> more<00:05:05.880> like<00:05:06.360> almost<00:05:06.570> blackened

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
everything more like almost blackened

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.260 
everything more like almost blackened
which<00:05:07.800> is<00:05:07.950> pretty<00:05:08.160> but<00:05:08.460> if<00:05:08.639> you're<00:05:08.820> not<00:05:09.000> going

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
which is pretty but if you're not going

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.420 
which is pretty but if you're not going
for<00:05:09.419> that<00:05:09.540> black<00:05:09.900> blackened<00:05:10.740> purple<00:05:11.250> look

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
for that black blackened purple look

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.310 
for that black blackened purple look
just<00:05:12.030> keep<00:05:12.180> it<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.389> way<00:05:12.419> it<00:05:12.540> is<00:05:12.720> put<00:05:13.200> this

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
just keep it the way it is put this

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.750 
just keep it the way it is put this
underneath<00:05:13.620> but<00:05:14.220> make<00:05:14.340> sure<00:05:14.400> you<00:05:14.580> use<00:05:14.729> a

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.960 
underneath but make sure you use a
primer<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:15.840> can<00:05:15.960> even<00:05:16.080> Pat<00:05:16.350> some<00:05:16.700> over<00:05:17.700> on

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
primer and you can even Pat some over on

primer and you can even Pat some over on
the<00:05:18.180> top<00:05:18.419> and<00:05:18.600> if<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:18.750> treat<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.110> like<00:05:19.200> a

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.020 
the top and if you treat it like a
glitter<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:19.979> how<00:05:20.220> you<00:05:20.280> would<00:05:20.460> apply<00:05:20.700> glitter

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
look now let me just so this is really

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.379 
look now let me just so this is really
heavy<00:05:37.350> swatched<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.190> you<00:05:38.280> can<00:05:38.460> see<00:05:38.760> how<00:05:39.150> like

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
heavy swatched and you can see how like

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.110 
heavy swatched and you can see how like
grainy<00:05:39.810> it<00:05:40.080> is<00:05:40.229> but<00:05:41.039> when<00:05:41.190> you<00:05:41.220> apply<00:05:41.700> it<00:05:41.729> out

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
grainy it is but when you apply it out

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.080 
grainy it is but when you apply it out
look<00:05:42.360> at<00:05:42.450> this<00:05:42.599> the<00:05:42.720> Purple's<00:05:43.080> already<00:05:43.380> gone

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
look at this the Purple's already gone

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.430 
look at this the Purple's already gone
but<00:05:45.090> when<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:45.330> shear<00:05:45.660> down<00:05:45.870> you<00:05:46.050> put<00:05:46.260> it<00:05:46.349> on

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
but when you shear down you put it on

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.680 
but when you shear down you put it on
top<00:05:46.740> or<00:05:47.039> below<00:05:47.190> that's<00:05:48.150> where<00:05:48.389> you<00:05:48.479> get<00:05:48.630> that

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
top or below that's where you get that

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.740 
top or below that's where you get that
sparkle<00:05:49.349> from<00:05:49.530> now<00:05:50.190> I'm<00:05:50.460> gonna<00:05:50.580> layer<00:05:50.880> purple

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
on top so you can see so as you can see

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.330 
on top so you can see so as you can see
it<00:05:54.840> kind<00:05:55.139> of<00:05:55.260> just<00:05:55.560> adds<00:05:55.800> that<00:05:56.039> extra

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
it kind of just adds that extra

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.420 
it kind of just adds that extra
dimension<00:05:56.880> of<00:05:57.389> sparkle<00:05:57.960> which<00:05:58.620> is<00:05:58.770> nice<00:05:58.979> and

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
dimension of sparkle which is nice and

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.120 
dimension of sparkle which is nice and
then<00:05:59.970> we<00:06:00.120> have<00:06:00.300> that<00:06:00.419> last<00:06:00.660> one<00:06:00.960> that<00:06:01.200> that

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
then we have that last one that that

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.529 
then we have that last one that that
when<00:06:02.310> they<00:06:02.460> say<00:06:02.639> enhance<00:06:03.030> with<00:06:03.210> glitter<00:06:03.450> and

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
when they say enhance with glitter and

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.890 
when they say enhance with glitter and
again<00:06:04.400> you<00:06:05.400> can<00:06:05.580> see<00:06:05.729> it's<00:06:05.970> quite<00:06:06.240> darkened

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
again you can see it's quite darkened

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.420 
again you can see it's quite darkened
but<00:06:07.200> if<00:06:07.320> you<00:06:07.410> put<00:06:07.560> it<00:06:07.650> over<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.889> purple<00:06:08.130> it's

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
but if you put it over the purple it's

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.550 
but if you put it over the purple it's
gonna<00:06:08.520> blacken<00:06:09.030> a<00:06:09.120> little<00:06:09.419> bit<00:06:09.539> but<00:06:10.080> again<00:06:10.380> it

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
gonna blacken a little bit but again it

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.170 
gonna blacken a little bit but again it
does<00:06:10.800> add<00:06:11.039> that<00:06:11.220> little<00:06:11.370> bit<00:06:11.490> of<00:06:11.580> sparkle<00:06:11.820> so<00:06:12.150> I

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
does add that little bit of sparkle so I

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.790 
does add that little bit of sparkle so I
would<00:06:12.510> say<00:06:12.690> use<00:06:12.930> that<00:06:13.110> maybe<00:06:13.320> just<00:06:13.620> in<00:06:13.710> your

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
would say use that maybe just in your

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.920 
would say use that maybe just in your
outer<00:06:14.010> V<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.310> add<00:06:14.490> sparkle<00:06:14.910> there<00:06:15.060> and<00:06:15.389> use

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
outer V to add sparkle there and use

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.110 
outer V to add sparkle there and use
this<00:06:16.110> for<00:06:17.010> the<00:06:17.099> rest<00:06:17.310> of<00:06:17.460> your<00:06:17.639> lid<00:06:17.849> so<00:06:18.090> that
