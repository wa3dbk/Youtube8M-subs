00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.320
 south park the stick of truth 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.060
 boldly write to peculiar 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.099
 protracted course the game do not 10 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.199
 years but for all the time since its announcement 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.750
 stick and walls just did that 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.849
 endured judge for himself he he held in 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.510
 end of december 11 in may of the next 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.629
 of the year announced the postponement of 1 quarter 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.730
 2013 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.070
 and all last year we listened 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.239
 slurred posts from a new publisher 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.920
 ubisoft company 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.480
 who undertook to release the game after 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.699
 bankruptcy estrus 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.370
 We then said that the game will not be released 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.469
 2013 is said that before the end of the year so 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.239
 just go on sale then all the same 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.879
 set a date in December but with reservation 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.640
 what is the date of the console release it n to 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.829
 south park will be released sometime in the spring '14 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.780
 but in the end, and the console abandoned the same 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.159
 term 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.830
 actually why am I so long about it 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.260
 crucify the funniest thing here is that for everything 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.909
 this time about the game became known yes 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.070
 virtually anything from south park 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.510
 released literally pieces of five rollers from 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.310
 which gameplay 2 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.380
 with the gameplay there is typed from the force 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.750
 minutes and 2 given that one of 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.420
 trailers goes as much as seven minutes 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.100
 after what you see you can do exactly two 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.930
 O game will almost 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.300
 interactive cartoon with himself 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.340
 best sense of the concept and gameplay 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.430
 will be based on Japanese mechanics 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.930
 rpk type understood fantasy the very beginning 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.680
 players will have to create their 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.390
 character 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.220
 play for famous heroes like cards 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.590
 or kayla here they can not speak 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.380
 in the role of npc in the plot of our nameless 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.120
 hero new child in town and at school 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.980
 who just need to get something 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.230
 friends and all students are busy right now 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.180
 nothing more than a massive role-playing game 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.490
 which they fight on wooden swords 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.110
 and hurled imaginary spells 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.570
 but at some point everything goes 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.750
 awry when it turns out it's gone 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.670
 the branch is a stick of truth and we need it 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.660
 return in the end everything turns out in the spirit 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.190
 original series 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.500
 children's fun turns around 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.050
 Armageddon where the final 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.430
 the battle between good and evil is generally like 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.989
 usually 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.120
 say something more specific 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.969
 gameplay can not be known that in the south 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.870
 park will be 5 classes this is a warrior paladin 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:24.670
 wizard princess and jew rely 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.469
 that we can choose different factions 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.209
 which are based at different points 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.769
 cities from cubes to crayfish will need 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.810
 go on quests that they imagine 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.790
 represent is also not entirely clear 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.409
 they showed us how at different levels 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.180
 relief items we 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.459
 we will eliminate enemies and make our way 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.730
 on location to then fight 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.129
 with the enemies so far to make a clear 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.659
 the prediction of the tangent game is completely 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.310
 impossible on one side of the game 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.439
 works the creator of the original series 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.450
 trey parker and matt stone who 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.950
 engaged in panache and voice characters 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.230
 so for the design and spirit of the series 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.239
 worry surely is not necessary and the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.739
 developers from obsidian deserve 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.459
 trust in spite of their past 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.439
 sins 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.480
 but on the other hand there is a lot 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.280
 questions about the gameplay will at least 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.439
 some choice and its consequences and 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.180
 ending with ending all the way everything 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.859
 very interesting tiger canonical 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.019
 fits into a common story which 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.090
 starts immediately after 3 7 and parodies 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.739
 console wars who knows can play and 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.569
 somehow affect the future plot 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.329
 cartoon series but one of the main questions 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.549
 friend that will be completely true except 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.169
 overruns on locations and bits which 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.150
 may well be bored if nothing 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.709
 the original with them will not do this 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.689
 case, the game will turn into a banal 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.370
 full length for through force will have to 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.189
 make yourself play a drink there 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.550
 of the moment and then there are no cutscenes 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:41.710
 and the spirit of the series will not save the game 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.050
 I had everything with you on this joker 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.610
 continue or passive my videos like 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.610
 and comment all the while
