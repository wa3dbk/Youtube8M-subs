00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
complications it's not something that I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.889 
complications it's not something that I
think<00:00:35.610> many<00:00:35.910> people<00:00:36.059> would<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.780> when

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.330 
think many people would think of when
they<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:36.989> Mel<00:00:37.320> Blanc<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.800> think<00:00:38.100> that

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
they think Mel Blanc but I think that

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.709 
they think Mel Blanc but I think that

right<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> wrist<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.090> nobody

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
right on the wrist then then nobody

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.789
