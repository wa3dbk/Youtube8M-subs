00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 very good guys here we are in another 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.490
 more gta 5 video online in this case 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.990
 I bring you a new trick and good guys 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.880
 before starting, please ask 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.410
 everyone who likes this video 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.090
 because I think I'm one of the first 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.070
 upload this trick to the Spanish community 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.049
 not to say the first one and the truth is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.340
 that always has much merit that of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.600
 upload the tricks first since good 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.890
 when they leave, everyone gets to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.420
 record it and try to upload it first 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.260
 so nothing like I say if you want a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.820
 like this video the wta what 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.900
 I would really appreciate it so nothing 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.730
 guys, once said, let's go 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.320
 start with the trick that I know it is 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.599
 It's about the trick, basically, what 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.279
 what it's about is climbing the walls 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.390
 with a bike if it would indeed be 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.219
 right now freaking out saying danny and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 that's how balls are done for good now 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.399
 himself is living on the screen videos and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.020
 about how I do it, I 'm going to explain 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.690
 how to do it is really worth it and this is 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.980
 how to ride a bike people tell you 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.450
 look then you have to set foot here 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 another foot here you have to focus on 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.450
 chair and try to pedal and try 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.890
 explain the balance 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.420
 but at the end of the day you when you learn 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.860
 riding a bike is when you've 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.480
 already tried a thousand times with what I 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.949
 tell people to explain it to you 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.149
 you are going to learn to ride a bike 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.559
 you have to try or not 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.239
 basically this trick is the same has 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.739
 his theory but really at the end and at 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.120
 is achieved by practicing with the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.799
 practice you get to do the trick 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.150
 perfectly because to me already in the end what 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.690
 I know when I tried to do 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.340
 about 20-30 minutes to perfection 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.680
 climbed all the walls someone penthouses 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.960
 Well basically the theory is that when 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.970
 we are or whether we have to go cap on 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.280
 a fixed wall crashing 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.440
 a wall and just before arriving 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.760
 but not just or justly not 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.340
 because otherwise we're not going to stick it in your mouth 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.040
 we have to give place of the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.350
 jump position with the r1 l1 no 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.760
 I remember what button was right now but 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.970
 nothing we can in that position a 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.560
 just before arriving and just 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.390
 we jump and put the front wheel 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.860
 against the wall and just when you're 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.020
 already rubbing the front wheel against the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.479
 wall we have to give the l 2 so that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.130
 the rear wheel turn as if it had 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.020
 counting reverse gear and then 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.250
 then we will reverse the wall and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.350
 then the bike will go up 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.210
 it really is very complicated I say 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.440
 detailing the first 5-10 minutes going to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.300
 cost a huevazo I did not stop 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.830
 the stick against the wall because pÃ©rez 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.810
 did not calculate the distance well and also 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.220
 let's jump it hit me against the wall 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.660
 etcetera and the truth that was a bit 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.800
 Fuck I stayed on planes that really 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.060
 I'm not going to get to but 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.680
 really once that time passes to 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.880
 the 20 to the 30 minutes already leaves to the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.530
 perfection I'm really going to see 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.210
 how it leads me to jump up shrubs 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.380
 super giants in a giant wall 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.210
 I go up a lot is 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.010
 really awesome this trick is 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.020
 I really say that is really nothing 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.730
 as I say what we have to do 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.200
 we jump against a wall not far away 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.520
 not very close to when we arrived at the same time 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.990
 because if we jump too close, we're not going 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.540
 glued mouth if we jump far no 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.040
 let's have the minimum power not that 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.360
 requires to do this trick but that 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.790
 we have to jump between half more or 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.290
 less and put the front wheel when 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.630
 we are touching with the front time the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.940
 wall we give the l2 to go back 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.770
 and then we will go for it assigns 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.120
 guys this has basically been all 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.470
 this is the whole theory now only remains 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.880
 practice it and do it because you will have to 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.410
 very cool and as he said when talking 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.030
 I would really appreciate it in this video and 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.560
 nothing if you liked it very much 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.910
 You can also give him a favorite and if not 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.590
