 I extract another a boxing in this case 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.990
 I have the alcatel one touch idol alpha that 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.980

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:22.460
 packaging let's say limited edition 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.769
 of this box is rounded golden 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.509
 it looks like metal or plastic and 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.509
 let's see how 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.989
 As you can see it comes in a morel box 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.289
 I said it's round limited edition that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.070
 give a touch really first let's go to 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.360
 then to proceed to remove the insurance 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.150
 uncover 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.020
 and we see here in 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.540
 how it is accommodated 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.820
 in this case round spaces 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.210
 that have gaps are filled with 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.760
 this little quilt all a material 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.810
 like of well-padded bread so that it 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.940
 Protect the team were here 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.350
 and let's put inside the phone a 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.390
 moment on the one hand 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.890
 we go back to him inside we see that we have 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.950
 first some small instructions 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.850
 where is the tool included for 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.100

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.990
 we have documentation and information 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:39.280
 about the guarantee we also have the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:42.190
 microusb to usb cable for charging purposes 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.820
 and synchronization with the computer the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.130
 hearing aids in black the adapter 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.789
 for hearing aids through the micro 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.220
 usb because it has no port to connect 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.399
 the hearing aids directly here 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.640
 is the adapter to charge to the wall 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.250
 using the usb cable included from 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.200
 we open and that's all that the 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.950
 house then we go now with the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.819
 protagonist of this episode we are going to 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.360
 first to remove the stickers you have 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.319

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.450
 the front design we have 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.000

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.940
 in the bottom part we can see that the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.740
 signage of the buttons is inside 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.500
 of a transparent area like 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.890
 we saw at the top a plastic 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.760
 translucent all around the team 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.430

 absolutely nothing on the left 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.360
