folks have had multiple requests for
different<00:00:29.310> minecraft<00:00:30.210> flowers<00:00:31.520> both<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.759> them

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
different minecraft flowers both of them

different minecraft flowers both of them
that<00:00:33.390> were<00:00:33.600> requested<00:00:34.260> are<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.520> but

that were requested are in this one but

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.709 
that were requested are in this one but
that<00:00:35.790> doesn't<00:00:36.030> mean<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.149> I'm<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.329> gonna<00:00:36.540> be

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna be

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.330 
that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna be
doing<00:00:36.870> some<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> other<00:00:37.530> flowers<00:00:38.010> now<00:00:38.160> that

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
doing some of the other flowers now that

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.600 
doing some of the other flowers now that
they've<00:00:38.430> introduced<00:00:38.969> more<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> game<00:00:40.610> but

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
they've introduced more to the game but

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.420 
they've introduced more to the game but
that<00:00:41.760> brings<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.780> very<00:00:43.110> important<00:00:43.800> topic

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that brings up the very important topic

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.240 
that brings up the very important topic
in<00:00:44.610> my<00:00:44.879> opinion<00:00:45.559> something<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.710> hasn't<00:00:46.950> gone

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
in my opinion something that hasn't gone

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.049 
in my opinion something that hasn't gone
away<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.850> people<00:00:48.059> thought<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> would<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:50.059> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
away and people thought it would is the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
away and people thought it would is the
poppy<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.930> Rose<00:00:52.640> transfer<00:00:53.640> now<00:00:54.739> my<00:00:55.739> personal

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
poppy for Rose transfer now my personal

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.150 
poppy for Rose transfer now my personal
opinion<00:00:57.020> it<00:00:58.020> doesn't<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.469> matter<00:00:59.449> but<00:01:00.449> I

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
opinion it doesn't really matter but I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
opinion it doesn't really matter but I
do<00:01:02.160> kind<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.080> wonder<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.530> were

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
do kind of wonder what they were

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.429 
do kind of wonder what they were
thinking<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.430> take<00:01:05.610> out<00:01:05.820> something<00:01:06.320> that<00:01:07.320> has

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
thinking to take out something that has

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.950 
thinking to take out something that has
been<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> game<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.310> long<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.330> Rose<00:01:09.570> was

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
been in the game as long as the Rose was

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.770 
been in the game as long as the Rose was
the<00:01:09.990> standard<00:01:10.650> rose<00:01:11.299> it's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> very<00:01:12.540> odd<00:01:12.750> thing

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the standard rose it's a very odd thing

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.160 
the standard rose it's a very odd thing
to<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.500> nonetheless<00:01:14.509> this<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> chose

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to do nonetheless this is what I chose

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.010 
to do nonetheless this is what I chose
to<00:01:16.500> build<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.310> represent<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> -<00:01:18.060> neither<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
to build to represent the - neither of

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.990 
to build to represent the - neither of
them<00:01:19.500> are<00:01:20.420> 100%<00:01:21.420> accurate<00:01:21.900> they<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.439> both

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
them are 100% accurate they are both

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.330 
them are 100% accurate they are both
interpreted<00:01:24.590> through<00:01:25.590> Lego<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:27.060> means<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
interpreted through Lego that means that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.270 
interpreted through Lego that means that
to<00:01:29.340> make<00:01:29.460> them<00:01:29.640> 100%<00:01:29.970> accurate<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:31.530> Lego<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
to make them 100% accurate with Lego is

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.969 
to make them 100% accurate with Lego is
almost<00:01:32.729> impossible<00:01:33.409> if<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.590> were<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.799> use

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
almost impossible if you were to use

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.370 
almost impossible if you were to use
flats<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.030> could<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> very<00:01:36.869> similar

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
flats you could get a very similar

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230 
flats you could get a very similar
similar<00:01:37.890> proximity<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> would<00:01:39.090> still

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
similar proximity but it would still

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
similar proximity but it would still
look<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.600> little<00:01:39.810> wonky<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.979> went<00:01:41.220> ahead<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
look a little wonky so I went ahead and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240 
look a little wonky so I went ahead and
did<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.899> interpretation<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.500> best<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.130> I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
did it in interpretation as best as I

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.120 
did it in interpretation as best as I
could<00:01:44.310> keeping<00:01:45.060> true<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.320> pixel<00:01:46.710> format

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
could keeping true to the pixel format

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.660

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
of both of these flowers the only major

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.490 
of both of these flowers the only major
issues<00:01:51.149> again<00:01:51.600> something<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.140> comes<00:01:52.320> up

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
issues again something that comes up

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.780 
issues again something that comes up
every<00:01:52.710> single<00:01:52.979> time<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.369> build<00:01:53.579> something

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
every single time you build something

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.420 
every single time you build something
with<00:01:53.970> Legos<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.020> trying<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.500> transform<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
with Legos and trying to transform a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.300 
with Legos and trying to transform a
perfect<00:01:57.210> square<00:01:57.590> into<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> perfect<00:01:59.219> square

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
perfect square into a perfect square

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.990 
perfect square into a perfect square
block<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.149> Lego<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.659> just

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
block and Lego it just

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.510 
block and Lego it just
it's<00:02:02.930> lost<00:02:03.230> in<00:02:03.380> translation<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:04.010> little<00:02:04.220> bit<00:02:04.370> so

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
it's lost in translation a little bit so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.130 
it's lost in translation a little bit so
you<00:02:04.610> can<00:02:04.670> see<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.090> differences<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:05.660> sizes

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
you can see the differences in sizes

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.130 
you can see the differences in sizes
between<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:07.550> two<00:02:07.730> if<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.149> really<00:02:08.570> know<00:02:08.750> the

between the two if you really know the
