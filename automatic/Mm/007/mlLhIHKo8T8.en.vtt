00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
what I'm gonna put the variable two

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.200 
what I'm gonna put the variable two
variable<00:01:45.930> zoom<00:01:46.680> back<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.130> because<00:01:47.280> i<00:01:47.579> go

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
variable zoom back on because i go

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.670 
variable zoom back on because i go
through<00:01:48.420> phases<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.079> sometimes<00:01:49.530> I'll

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
through phases like sometimes I'll

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.139 
through phases like sometimes I'll
really<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> variable<00:01:50.729> zoom<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
really like the variable zoom for like a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.700 
really like the variable zoom for like a
month<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:51.689> I'll<00:01:51.869> hate<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> month

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
month and then I'll hate it for a month

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
month and then I'll hate it for a month
and<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.280> I'll<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.579> again<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.630> think

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and then I'll like it again and I think

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.840 
and then I'll like it again and I think
it's<00:01:54.960> coming<00:01:55.219> around<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.460> time<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.820> I

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it's coming around to the time that I

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.270 
it's coming around to the time that I
really<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> variable<00:01:57.810> zoom<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.079> again<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
really like the variable zoom I again so

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.060 
really like the variable zoom I again so

good I wasn't even trying to go for a
gameplay<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.730> was<00:02:48.239> just<00:02:48.269> messing<00:02:48.659> around

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
gameplay so I was just messing around

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.500 
gameplay so I was just messing around
doing<00:02:49.049> whatever<00:02:49.169> and<00:02:49.409> it<00:02:49.919> turned<00:02:50.129> out<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.459> a

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
doing whatever and it turned out to be a

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.569 
doing whatever and it turned out to be a
semi-decent<00:02:51.510> entertaining<00:02:52.169> match<00:02:52.349> no<00:02:53.189> scope

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
semi-decent entertaining match no scope

I'm in my opinion what I think that

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.289 
I'm in my opinion what I think that
should<00:03:44.129> do<00:03:44.310> with<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.579> knife<00:03:44.759> is<00:03:45.060> they<00:03:45.239> should

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
should do with the knife is they should

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.110 
should do with the knife is they should
either<00:03:45.599> make<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.799> secondary<00:03:47.280> weapon<00:03:47.669> like<00:03:47.849> a

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
either make it a secondary weapon like a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.030 
either make it a secondary weapon like a
secondary<00:03:48.989> weapon<00:03:49.409> that<00:03:49.500> everybody<00:03:49.859> has

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
secondary weapon that everybody has

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.219 
secondary weapon that everybody has
maybe<00:03:50.280> it's<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.759> know<00:03:50.879> down<00:03:51.239> on<00:03:51.479> the<00:03:51.599> d-pad<00:03:51.750> or

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
maybe it's you know down on the d-pad or

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:53.990 
maybe it's you know down on the d-pad or
whatever<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.799> get<00:03:52.979> to<00:03:53.519> pull<00:03:53.699> out<00:03:53.819> your

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
whatever and you get to pull out your

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.280 
whatever and you get to pull out your
knife<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.239> it's<00:03:54.419> a<00:03:54.479> one<00:03:54.629> hit<00:03:54.840> kill<00:03:54.870> all<00:03:55.169> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
knife and it's a one hit kill all the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.659 
knife and it's a one hit kill all the
time<00:03:55.470> it's<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.739> same<00:03:55.919> as<00:03:56.069> every<00:03:56.280> other<00:03:56.340> call

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
time it's the same as every other call

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.460 
time it's the same as every other call
of<00:03:56.819> duty<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.239> think<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.109> would<00:03:58.199> be<00:03:58.259> pretty

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
of duty I think that would be pretty

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.749 
of duty I think that would be pretty
cool<00:03:58.620> because<00:03:58.949> then<00:03:59.099> it<00:03:59.310> would<00:03:59.430> encourage

00:03:59.749 --> 00:03:59.759 
cool because then it would encourage

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.210 
cool because then it would encourage
people<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.120> not<00:04:00.419> really<00:04:00.659> life<00:04:00.900> maybe<00:04:01.229> focus

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
people to not really life maybe focus

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.649 
people to not really life maybe focus
more<00:04:02.519> on<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.699> gun<00:04:02.909> on<00:04:02.939> gun<00:04:03.299> you're<00:04:03.479> done

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
more on the gun on gun you're done

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.089 
more on the gun on gun you're done
action<00:04:04.199> because<00:04:04.409> it<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.680> first-person

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
action because it is a first-person

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.710 
action because it is a first-person
shooter<00:04:05.669> at<00:04:05.759> the<00:04:05.879> end<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.209> day<00:04:06.359> you<00:04:06.419> guys

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
shooter at the end of the day you guys

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.649 
shooter at the end of the day you guys
and<00:04:07.139> so<00:04:07.889> nothing<00:04:08.819> should<00:04:09.030> not<00:04:09.209> like<00:04:09.419> if<00:04:09.569> I

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
and so nothing should not like if I

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.710 
and so nothing should not like if I
shocking<00:04:10.109> somebody<00:04:11.030> if<00:04:12.030> I'm<00:04:12.180> using<00:04:12.329> a<00:04:12.540> shotgun

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
shocking somebody if I'm using a shotgun

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.179 
shocking somebody if I'm using a shotgun
and<00:04:12.989> somebody's<00:04:13.290> kind<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:13.680> close<00:04:13.829> to<00:04:13.859> me<00:04:14.040> like

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
and somebody's kind of close to me like

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.949 
and somebody's kind of close to me like
within<00:04:14.340> shotgun<00:04:14.790> range<00:04:14.879> there's<00:04:15.540> always<00:04:15.750> that

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
within shotgun range there's always that

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.539 
within shotgun range there's always that
fear<00:04:16.199> of<00:04:16.320> oh<00:04:16.530> they're<00:04:16.739> gonna<00:04:16.829> knife<00:04:17.099> me<00:04:17.310> and

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
fear of oh they're gonna knife me and

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.249 
fear of oh they're gonna knife me and
I'm<00:04:17.820> gonna<00:04:17.970> lose<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.269> ninety-five<00:04:18.900> percent<00:04:19.049> of

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
I'm gonna lose in ninety-five percent of

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.420 
I'm gonna lose in ninety-five percent of
the<00:04:19.320> time<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.560> happens<00:04:19.829> with<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.039> black<00:04:20.220> ops

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
the time that happens with the black ops

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.519 
the time that happens with the black ops
shotguns<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.779> that's<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.169> terrible

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:22.529 
shotguns and so that's a terrible

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.940 
shotguns and so that's a terrible
terrible<00:04:22.770> thing<00:04:23.010> when<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:24.330> knife<00:04:24.719> is<00:04:24.960> basically

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
terrible thing when a knife is basically

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.840 
terrible thing when a knife is basically
like<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.190> shocking

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
like a shocking

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.400 
like a shocking
how<00:04:26.910> does<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> shotgun<00:04:27.750> why<00:04:27.900> not<00:04:28.080> just<00:04:28.230> use<00:04:28.350> a

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
how does a shotgun why not just use a

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.980 
how does a shotgun why not just use a
knife<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:28.830> know<00:04:28.950> what<00:04:29.040> I<00:04:29.100> mean<00:04:29.540> so<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.570> think

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
knife you know what I mean so I think

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.960 
knife you know what I mean so I think
that<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.230> should<00:04:31.380> be<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.530> secondary<00:04:31.980> it<00:04:32.640> takes<00:04:32.880> a

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
that it should be a secondary it takes a

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.760 
that it should be a secondary it takes a
second<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.330> pull<00:04:33.510> out<00:04:33.690> maybe<00:04:33.870> maybe<00:04:34.290> just<00:04:34.620> you

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
second to pull out maybe maybe just you

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.020 
second to pull out maybe maybe just you
know<00:04:34.890> a<00:04:34.920> split<00:04:35.250> second<00:04:35.490> or<00:04:35.580> whatever<00:04:35.820> but<00:04:35.910> as

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
know a split second or whatever but as

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.030 
know a split second or whatever but as
long<00:04:36.210> as<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.480> takes<00:04:36.690> some<00:04:37.500> amount<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:37.860> time<00:04:38.010> to

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
long as it takes some amount of time to

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.890 
long as it takes some amount of time to
pull<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.370> out<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.640> knife<00:04:38.940> I<00:04:39.240> think<00:04:39.870> that

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
pull it out a knife I think that

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.250

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
they hit me with no lunge it's a the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.490 
they hit me with no lunge it's a the
swipe<00:05:14.460> of<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.820> night<00:05:15.030> so<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:15.870> mean<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.350> has<00:05:16.470> a

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
swipe of the night so I mean it has a

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.380 
swipe of the night so I mean it has a
pretty<00:05:16.830> big<00:05:17.130> range<00:05:17.310> in<00:05:17.580> that<00:05:17.730> sense<00:05:18.060> as<00:05:18.210> well

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
pretty big range in that sense as well

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.050 
pretty big range in that sense as well
so<00:05:18.600> it<00:05:18.750> there<00:05:19.260> was<00:05:19.410> no<00:05:19.560> lunge<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.220> just<00:05:20.820> that

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
so it there was no lunge and just that

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.610 
so it there was no lunge and just that
and<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.390> be<00:05:21.600> honestly<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.260> would<00:05:22.320> be<00:05:22.440> fine

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
and that be honestly that would be fine

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.020 
and that be honestly that would be fine
with<00:05:22.680> me<00:05:22.980> i<00:05:23.010> think<00:05:23.190> world<00:05:23.520> award<00:05:23.850> did

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
think about the knife you think that it

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.370

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
should be made into more than a one hit

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.920 
should be made into more than a one hit
like<00:05:43.590> it<00:05:44.310> should<00:05:45.000> take<00:05:45.150> more<00:05:45.360> hits<00:05:45.510> than<00:05:45.630> just

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
like it should take more hits than just
