something<00:00:05.879> that's<00:00:06.150> been<00:00:06.299> coming<00:00:06.390> up<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.690> lot<00:00:06.839> on

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
something that's been coming up a lot on

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.480 
something that's been coming up a lot on
the<00:00:07.080> whooping<00:00:07.290> live<00:00:07.440> show<00:00:07.710> lately<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.340> that

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
the whooping live show lately and that

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.509 
the whooping live show lately and that
is<00:00:08.790> how<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.570> do<00:00:09.929> transitions<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.889> whatnot<00:00:11.490> but

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
is how to do transitions and whatnot but

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.520 
is how to do transitions and whatnot but
I<00:00:11.849> figured<00:00:12.240> before<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:13.200> learn<00:00:13.349> about

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
I figured before we learn about

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.900 
I figured before we learn about
transitions<00:00:14.099> it's<00:00:14.309> really<00:00:14.490> good<00:00:14.790> to

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
transitions it's really good to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.820 
transitions it's really good to
understand<00:00:15.480> different<00:00:15.990> moves<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.560> can

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
understand different moves that you can

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.529 
understand different moves that you can
expand<00:00:17.580> upon<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.330> show<00:00:18.510> you

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
expand upon so I'm going to show you

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.410 
expand upon so I'm going to show you
about<00:00:19.529> ten<00:00:19.890> moves<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.609> really<00:00:20.880> great<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
about ten moves that are really great to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.509 
about ten moves that are really great to
learn<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.439> practice<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.010> your<00:00:23.100> own<00:00:23.279> way

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
learn and to practice in your own way

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.670 
learn and to practice in your own way
and<00:00:23.550> kind<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.180> put<00:00:24.720> your<00:00:24.900> own<00:00:24.990> twist<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.470> them

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
and kind of put your own twist on them

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.800 
and kind of put your own twist on them
so<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> first<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.789> want<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> talk<00:00:27.240> about<00:00:27.420> is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
so the first one I want to talk about is

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.169 
so the first one I want to talk about is
roles<00:00:28.470> roles<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.220> done<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.580> any<00:00:29.730> part<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
roles roles can be done on any part of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.330 
roles roles can be done on any part of
the<00:00:30.300> body<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.840> simple<00:00:31.230> role<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> front

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the body the simple role is in the front

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.190 
the body the simple role is in the front
of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.790> body<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.450> back<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> body

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
of the body and in the back of the body

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.229 
of the body and in the back of the body
you<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.680> make<00:00:34.950> roles<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.820> any<00:00:36.120> direction

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you can make roles go in any direction

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.780 
you can make roles go in any direction
and<00:00:37.160> therefore<00:00:38.160> you're<00:00:38.280> able<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.489> become<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and therefore you're able to become a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.090 
and therefore you're able to become a
lot<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.149> creative<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.809> them<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.680> second

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
lot more creative with them the second

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.360 
lot more creative with them the second
wine<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.670> isolations<00:00:42.450> isolations<00:00:43.350> are<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
wine is isolations isolations are one of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.670 
wine is isolations isolations are one of
the<00:00:44.460> fundamental<00:00:45.059> moves<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.570> hooping<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.530> can

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the fundamental moves of hooping you can

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.410 
the fundamental moves of hooping you can
put<00:00:46.890> these<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.039> any<00:00:47.340> part<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:47.910> body<00:00:47.969> use

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
them with pretty much anything so it's a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.160 
them with pretty much anything so it's a
great<00:00:50.820> move<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.239> understand<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.989> really

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
great move to understand to really

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.279 
great move to understand to really
expand<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.100> more<00:00:53.489> off<00:00:53.670> body<00:00:53.969> work<00:00:54.239> as<00:00:54.420> well<00:00:54.750> the

expand on more off body work as well the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.709 
expand on more off body work as well the
next<00:00:55.559> move<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.949> core<00:00:56.579> hooping<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.300> primarily

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
which is one of the things that we like

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.940 
which is one of the things that we like
to<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.220> dance<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.790> why<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.180> kind<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.950> put

to do is dance so why not kind of put

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.249 
to do is dance so why not kind of put
all<00:01:47.070> those<00:01:47.189> things<00:01:47.250> together<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.110> see<00:01:49.110> how

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
all those things together and see how

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.580 
all those things together and see how
they<00:01:49.409> match<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:49.860> music<00:01:51.590> apparently

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
they match up with music apparently

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.109 
they match up with music apparently
doing<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> help<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.970> my

explanations the next one is balancing

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.120 
explanations the next one is balancing
this<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.149> kind<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.540> knew<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.920> taught

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
this one is kind of knew it I was taught

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.830 
this one is kind of knew it I was taught
in<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> hoop<00:01:59.490> path<00:01:59.670> community<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.360> balancing

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
in the hoop path community but balancing

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.149 
in the hoop path community but balancing
can<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.140> taught<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.530> many<00:02:01.710> different<00:02:01.920> ways

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
can be taught in many different ways

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.490 
can be taught in many different ways
it's<00:02:02.850> pretty<00:02:03.119> much<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.329> bouncing<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> hoop

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
it's pretty much just bouncing the hoop

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.429 
it's pretty much just bouncing the hoop
on<00:02:04.740> any<00:02:05.310> point<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.149> body<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.719> as<00:02:06.899> long<00:02:07.380> as

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
on any point of the body for as long as

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.139 
on any point of the body for as long as
you're<00:02:07.710> able<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.429> long<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> want<00:02:09.060> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you're able to or as long as you want to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.279 
you're able to or as long as you want to
and

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.809 
and
when<00:02:10.439> you're<00:02:10.769> able<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.159> that<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.549> kind<00:02:11.700> of

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
when you're able to do that it kind of

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.130 
when you're able to do that it kind of
clears<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.360> body<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.870> other<00:02:13.049> things

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
clears up the body to do other things

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.440 
clears up the body to do other things
and<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:13.799> a<00:02:13.950> nice<00:02:14.280> trick<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.819> show<00:02:15.000> people

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
and it's a nice trick just show people

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.599 
and it's a nice trick just show people
and<00:02:15.719> it's<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.439> very<00:02:16.650> meditative<00:02:16.799> one<00:02:17.280> as<00:02:17.400> well

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
and it's a very meditative one as well

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.119 
and it's a very meditative one as well
so<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:18.540> kind<00:02:18.719> of<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.870> dual<00:02:19.079> thing<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.829> next

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
so it's kind of a dual thing the next

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.130 
so it's kind of a dual thing the next
one<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.670> part<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.299> core<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.780> hooping

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
one that is part of the core is hooping

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.440 
one that is part of the core is hooping
around<00:02:22.469> your<00:02:22.859> legs<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.549> can<00:02:23.579> hoop<00:02:23.939> anywhere

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
around your legs you can hoop anywhere

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.740 
around your legs you can hoop anywhere
on<00:02:24.659> your<00:02:24.689> legs<00:02:25.109> from<00:02:25.439> down<00:02:26.159> to<00:02:26.430> your<00:02:26.579> ankles<00:02:27.060> to

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
on your legs from down to your ankles to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.380 
on your legs from down to your ankles to
up<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:27.989> your<00:02:28.290> knees<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.220> your<00:02:29.430> thighs<00:02:29.700> you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
up to your knees and on your thighs you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.899 
up to your knees and on your thighs you
can<00:02:30.420> really<00:02:30.840> hoop<00:02:31.019> anywhere<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.950> legs<00:02:32.189> so

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
can really hoop anywhere on the legs so

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.880 
can really hoop anywhere on the legs so
if<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.209> kind<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.540> understand<00:02:34.109> that<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.709> in

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
if you kind of understand that and in

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.860 
if you kind of understand that and in
some<00:02:34.920> both<00:02:35.340> currents<00:02:35.879> you<00:02:36.269> can<00:02:36.420> do<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.599> lot<00:02:36.840> of

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
some both currents you can do a lot of

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.539 
some both currents you can do a lot of
different<00:02:37.319> stuff<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:37.709> switching<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.400> the

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
different stuff like switching up the

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.319 
different stuff like switching up the
hoop<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.939> whatnot<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:41.519> if<00:02:41.879> you're<00:02:42.090> able

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
hoop and whatnot and so if you're able

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.330 
hoop and whatnot and so if you're able
to<00:02:42.359> do<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.780> then<00:02:43.139> you<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.470> kind<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.859> free<00:02:44.189> up

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
to do that then you can kind of free up

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.670 
to do that then you can kind of free up
your<00:02:44.370> upper<00:02:44.879> body<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.840> when<00:02:46.079> you're<00:02:46.439> hooping

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
your upper body so when you're hooping

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.589 
your upper body so when you're hooping
around<00:02:47.280> your<00:02:47.519> legs<00:02:47.730> wherever<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.209> may<00:02:48.359> be

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
around your legs wherever that may be

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.869 
around your legs wherever that may be
you're<00:02:49.169> freeing<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.739> all<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.400> part<00:02:50.700> of

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
you're freeing up all of this part of

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.319 
you're freeing up all of this part of
your<00:02:51.030> body<00:02:51.239> therefore<00:02:52.079> making<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.799> more

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
your body therefore making it more

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.149 
your body therefore making it more
dancey<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:54.629> giving<00:02:55.409> your<00:02:55.500> upper<00:02:55.799> body<00:02:55.980> more

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
dancey and giving your upper body more

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.780 
dancey and giving your upper body more
freedom

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
freedom

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.970 
freedom
the<00:02:57.060> next<00:02:57.269> fundamental<00:02:57.689> move<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.139> stalling

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
the next fundamental move is stalling

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.949 
the next fundamental move is stalling
stalling<00:02:59.129> can<00:02:59.639> be<00:02:59.849> anything<00:03:00.540> where<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> hoop

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
stalling can be anything where the hoop

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.170 
stalling can be anything where the hoop
is<00:03:01.169> staying<00:03:01.409> in<00:03:01.560> one<00:03:01.799> space<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.639> can<00:03:03.030> be

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
is staying in one space it can be

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.770 
is staying in one space it can be
contacting<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.169> body<00:03:04.909> or<00:03:05.909> it<00:03:06.359> can<00:03:06.510> even<00:03:06.599> be

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
contacting the body or it can even be

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.170 
contacting the body or it can even be
off<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.319> body<00:03:07.530> which<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.489> is<00:03:08.639> a<00:03:08.669> very<00:03:08.939> well

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
off the body which this is a very well

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.899 
off the body which this is a very well
known<00:03:09.209> move<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.859> very<00:03:11.040> pretty<00:03:11.340> one<00:03:11.489> as<00:03:11.669> well

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
known move and a very pretty one as well

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.909 
known move and a very pretty one as well
so<00:03:12.180> kind<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.989> understanding<00:03:13.620> different

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
so kind of understanding different

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.319 
so kind of understanding different
points<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.370> stalling<00:03:14.729> a<00:03:14.970> lot<00:03:15.090> like<00:03:15.239> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
points of stalling a lot like the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.300 
points of stalling a lot like the
balancing<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.109> stall<00:03:16.409> at<00:03:16.620> any<00:03:16.799> point<00:03:17.129> of

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
balancing you can stall at any point of

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.849 
balancing you can stall at any point of
the<00:03:17.370> body<00:03:17.699> and<00:03:18.090> kind<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.109> just<00:03:19.290> hold<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.680> hoops

move to do when you're trying to make

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.149 
move to do when you're trying to make
something<00:03:27.840> very<00:03:28.139> graceful<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.919> kind<00:03:29.099> of

something very graceful and kind of

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.640 
something very graceful and kind of
whimsical<00:03:29.489> or<00:03:30.090> hardcore<00:03:30.840> however<00:03:31.379> you<00:03:31.500> want

whimsical or hardcore however you want

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.830 
whimsical or hardcore however you want
to<00:03:31.709> do<00:03:31.799> it<00:03:31.949> doesn't<00:03:32.549> really<00:03:32.639> matter<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:33.180> next

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
to do it doesn't really matter the next

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.050 
to do it doesn't really matter the next
one<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.139> a<00:03:34.169> basic<00:03:34.440> weave<00:03:34.909> understanding<00:03:35.909> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
one is a basic weave understanding the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.830 
one is a basic weave understanding the
basic<00:03:36.479> weave<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:37.199> get<00:03:37.349> you<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> lot<00:03:37.979> of<00:03:38.010> room<00:03:38.489> to

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
basic weave can get you a lot of room to

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.030 
basic weave can get you a lot of room to
transition<00:03:39.840> into<00:03:39.959> other<00:03:40.229> moves<00:03:40.560> such<00:03:40.829> as<00:03:40.859> a

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
transition into other moves such as a

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.879 
transition into other moves such as a
jump<00:03:41.400> through<00:03:41.669> or<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.599> can<00:03:42.750> even<00:03:43.079> weave<00:03:43.409> and

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
jump through or you can even weave and

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.009 
jump through or you can even weave and
go<00:03:44.069> into<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.400> toss<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.060> can<00:03:45.209> do<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.329> lot<00:03:45.599> of<00:03:45.629> stuff

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
go into a toss you can do a lot of stuff

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.199 
go into a toss you can do a lot of stuff
with<00:03:46.680> weaves<00:03:46.979> it's<00:03:47.250> kind<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.549> a<00:03:47.669> good<00:03:47.879> it's

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
with weaves it's kind of a good it's

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.819 
with weaves it's kind of a good it's
almost<00:03:48.389> like<00:03:48.569> isolations<00:03:49.290> where<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.590> kind<00:03:49.739> of

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
almost like isolations where it kind of

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.610 
almost like isolations where it kind of
brings<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.699> specific<00:03:51.479> point<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:52.440> move

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
brings you to a a specific point to move

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.879 
brings you to a a specific point to move
forward<00:03:53.159> into<00:03:53.310> your<00:03:53.609> dance<00:03:53.849> and<00:03:54.889> continuing

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
forward into your dance and continuing

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.530 
forward into your dance and continuing
into<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.459> jump<00:03:56.939> through<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.299> jump

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
into that is the jump through the jump

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.780 
into that is the jump through the jump
through<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:58.019> pretty<00:03:58.769> self-explanatory<00:03:59.099> and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
through is pretty self-explanatory and

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.429 
through is pretty self-explanatory and
it's<00:03:59.909> simply<00:04:00.239> just<00:04:00.269> jumping<00:04:00.900> through<00:04:01.229> the

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
it's simply just jumping through the

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.649 
it's simply just jumping through the
center<00:04:02.159> of<00:04:02.189> the<00:04:02.609> hoop<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.090> can<00:04:03.389> do<00:04:03.510> that

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
center of the hoop and you can do that

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.210 
center of the hoop and you can do that
in<00:04:03.780> so<00:04:04.049> many<00:04:04.169> different<00:04:04.349> ways<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.889> can<00:04:04.979> do<00:04:05.159> it

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
in so many different ways you can do it

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.800 
in so many different ways you can do it
with<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> hoop<00:04:05.549> and<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:06.239> vertical<00:04:06.479> or

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
with the hoop and a vertical or

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.689 
with the hoop and a vertical or
horizontal<00:04:06.840> axis<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:08.069> can<00:04:08.189> do<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.459> from<00:04:08.549> a

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
horizontal axis you can do it from a

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.280 
horizontal axis you can do it from a
toss<00:04:08.939> you<00:04:09.150> can<00:04:09.269> do<00:04:09.359> it<00:04:09.419> from<00:04:09.479> an<00:04:09.629> isolation

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
toss you can do it from an isolation

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.259 
toss you can do it from an isolation
you're<00:04:10.799> really<00:04:11.009> able<00:04:11.159> to<00:04:11.310> make<00:04:11.669> up<00:04:11.879> a<00:04:12.030> lot<00:04:12.239> of

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
you're really able to make up a lot of

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.030 
you're really able to make up a lot of
different<00:04:12.540> moves<00:04:12.959> understanding<00:04:13.680> all<00:04:13.799> these

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
different moves understanding all these

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.890 
different moves understanding all these
basics<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.669> putting<00:04:14.939> them<00:04:15.060> all<00:04:15.209> together<00:04:15.389> and

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
basics and putting them all together and

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.649 
basics and putting them all together and
like<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.289> said<00:04:16.349> isolations<00:04:17.159> are<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> really<00:04:17.820> core

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
like I said isolations are a really core

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.699 
like I said isolations are a really core
move<00:04:19.019> as<00:04:19.289> well<00:04:19.500> but<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.889> thing<00:04:19.919> is<00:04:20.370> with<00:04:20.760> ISOs

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
move as well but the thing is with ISOs

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.740 
move as well but the thing is with ISOs
you<00:04:21.859> can<00:04:22.009> do<00:04:22.160> things<00:04:22.310> such<00:04:22.580> as<00:04:22.610> ISO<00:04:23.090> Pop's<00:04:23.389> and

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
you can do things such as ISO Pop's and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.140 
you can do things such as ISO Pop's and
I<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:24.080> pops<00:04:24.410> might<00:04:25.070> say<00:04:25.280> something<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:25.789> is

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
I so pops might say something that is

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.870 
I so pops might say something that is
just<00:04:26.479> another<00:04:27.199> root<00:04:27.470> from<00:04:27.560> an<00:04:27.710> isolation<00:04:28.280> but

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
just another root from an isolation but

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.029 
just another root from an isolation but
an<00:04:29.030> ISO<00:04:29.419> pop<00:04:29.630> is<00:04:29.780> also<00:04:30.139> which<00:04:30.500> is<00:04:30.620> much<00:04:30.830> like

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
an ISO pop is also which is much like

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.460 
an ISO pop is also which is much like
the<00:04:31.190> weave<00:04:31.400> you<00:04:31.970> can<00:04:32.000> go<00:04:32.330> in<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.080> lot<00:04:33.320> of

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
the weave you can go in to a lot of

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.230 
the weave you can go in to a lot of
different<00:04:33.800> moves<00:04:33.949> from<00:04:34.160> an<00:04:34.280> ISO<00:04:34.639> pop<00:04:34.880> you<00:04:35.090> can

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
different moves from an ISO pop you can

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.930 
different moves from an ISO pop you can
do<00:04:35.389> an<00:04:35.509> ISO<00:04:35.900> pop<00:04:36.169> and<00:04:36.440> jump<00:04:37.340> through<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.729> hoop

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
do an ISO pop and jump through the hoop

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.540 
do an ISO pop and jump through the hoop
you<00:04:38.120> can<00:04:38.270> do<00:04:38.389> an<00:04:38.479> ISO<00:04:38.840> pop<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.410> toss<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.340> hoop

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
you can do an ISO pop and toss the hoop

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.340 
you can do an ISO pop and toss the hoop
so<00:04:41.060> it's<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.210> really<00:04:41.449> great<00:04:41.630> thing<00:04:41.870> to<00:04:41.930> kind<00:04:42.259> of

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
so it's a really great thing to kind of

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.550 
so it's a really great thing to kind of
bring<00:04:42.590> an<00:04:42.850> isolation<00:04:43.850> from<00:04:44.150> point<00:04:44.570> A<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:45.139> point

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
bring an isolation from point A to point

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.249 
bring an isolation from point A to point
B<00:04:45.889> so<00:04:46.340> it's<00:04:46.940> very<00:04:47.449> good<00:04:47.720> thing<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:48.080> work<00:04:48.110> with

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
B so it's very good thing to work with

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.010 
B so it's very good thing to work with
transitions<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.160> flow<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.870> practicing<00:04:50.870> all

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
transitions and flow and practicing all

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:36.370 
transitions and flow and practicing all
