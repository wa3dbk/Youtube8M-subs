00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
leaning on isn't the thorough it is a

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.420 
leaning on isn't the thorough it is a
sure<00:04:28.190> um<00:04:29.800> there<00:04:30.800> were<00:04:30.949> a<00:04:30.979> couple<00:04:31.039> of<00:04:31.280> these

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
sure um there were a couple of these

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.540 
sure um there were a couple of these
left<00:04:31.699> as<00:04:31.970> well<00:04:32.000> but<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:32.960> loved<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.500> zigzag<00:04:33.889> I<00:04:34.010> love

a<00:04:39.380> bathroom<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:39.979> actually<00:04:40.370> because<00:04:41.150> of<00:04:41.510> the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
a bathroom and actually because of the

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.439 
a bathroom and actually because of the
