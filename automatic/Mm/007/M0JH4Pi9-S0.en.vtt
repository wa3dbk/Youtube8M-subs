day the Volvo Penta propulsion this was

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.910 
day the Volvo Penta propulsion this was
the<00:02:46.639> first<00:02:47.200> debut<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.920> IPS<00:02:49.760> -<00:02:50.150> 950<00:02:51.049> s<00:02:51.109> -

in<00:02:54.590> my<00:02:54.680> opinion<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:55.790> boat<00:02:56.030> enable<00:02:56.599> us<00:02:56.660> to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
in my opinion for this boat enable us to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.960 
in my opinion for this boat enable us to
have<00:02:56.900> pod<00:02:57.470> drives<00:02:57.799> with<00:02:58.069> just<00:02:58.340> two<00:02:58.549> engines

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
have pod drives with just two engines

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.909 
have pod drives with just two engines
instead<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.359> three<00:02:59.540> opening<00:03:00.380> up<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.620> engine

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
instead of three opening up the engine

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.650 
instead of three opening up the engine
room<00:03:01.130> for<00:03:01.519> serviceability<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.329> that

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
room for serviceability and that

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.050 
room for serviceability and that
provided<00:03:03.109> plenty<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.530> torque<00:03:03.970> plenty<00:03:04.970> of

provided plenty of torque plenty of
acceleration<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.930> excellent<00:03:06.620> handling<00:03:07.130> I

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
acceleration and excellent handling I

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.339 
acceleration and excellent handling I
think<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.940> joystick<00:03:08.419> driving<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.109> one

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
think the joystick driving is the one

you first look at it you think I'm not
so<00:03:13.700> sure<00:03:13.910> about<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:15.440> then<00:03:15.680> when<00:03:15.889> you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
so sure about this but then when you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.339 
so sure about this but then when you
start<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.910> take<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.180> joystick<00:03:17.750> handle<00:03:17.900> and

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
start you take the joystick handle and

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.819 
start you take the joystick handle and
you<00:03:18.829> realize<00:03:19.609> that<00:03:19.639> small<00:03:20.299> inputs<00:03:20.870> deliver

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
you realize that small inputs deliver

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.199 
you realize that small inputs deliver
tremendous<00:03:22.609> impact<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:24.380> allows<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:26.000> make

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
tremendous impact it allows you to make

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.449
