little<00:02:13.830> tip<00:02:14.100> when<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.610> go<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.819> start<00:02:15.180> these<00:02:15.330> by

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
little tip when you go to start these by

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.110 
little tip when you go to start these by
hand<00:02:16.020> start<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> bottom<00:02:17.130> one<00:02:17.489> first<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
hand start with the bottom one first and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.820 
hand start with the bottom one first and
that<00:02:18.630> gives<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.959> little<00:02:19.140> extra<00:02:19.290> finger

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that gives you a little extra finger

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.410 
that gives you a little extra finger
space<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.610> start<00:02:20.819> with<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> top<00:02:21.180> one

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
space if you start with the top one

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.509 
space if you start with the top one
first<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.870> gets<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.080> little<00:02:22.170> snug<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.739> there<00:02:22.920> if

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
first it gets a little snug up there if

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.670 
first it gets a little snug up there if
you<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:24.600> trouble<00:02:24.959> getting<00:02:25.050> these<00:02:25.290> bolts

started<00:02:25.860> one<00:02:26.190> way<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.370> could<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.790> just

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
started one way you could do is just

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.240 
started one way you could do is just
take<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> socket<00:02:27.959> extension<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.860> put<00:02:29.100> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
take a socket extension and put the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.190 
take a socket extension and put the
socket<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:29.730> there<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.900> gives<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.170> a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
socket on there and it gives you a

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.660 
socket on there and it gives you a
little<00:02:31.410> extra<00:02:31.590> space<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.310> get<00:02:32.459> the
