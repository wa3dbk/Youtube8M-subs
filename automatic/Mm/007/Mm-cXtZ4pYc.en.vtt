00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.820
 of the pleiad more than ronaldinho the first 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.790
 player we're going to review about 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.710
 these from everyone on these pink cards 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.759
 after st curly this player 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.460
 legendary one of the strongest players 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:30.910
 of the last 20 years Brazilian now 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.239
 actually plays has gone from its own 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.710
 very little to fluminense but this card 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.350
 and in its version of the querÃ©taro 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.149
 then of the Mexican team in which 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.660
 we say he played in the last season 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.949
 votatissimo is included in the category 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.899
 of the men team we say in 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:56.289
 competition with many legends of the 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.589
 caliber of pirlo chavi lampard gerrard 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.780
 so really very great 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.320
 champions but in the end won the desire 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.840
 to see it in a stronger version 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.940
 then with great haste I wanted 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.100
 try it and I'm here to bring you this 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.710
 review of a player we leave 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.490
 from the assumption here we start from this 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.540
 what if you have waited for this period 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.820
 that is the fruits the fruits for doubt then 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.820
 let loose ronaldinho 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.640
 if you like to play 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.210
 long throw and pedaling is not a crime 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.330
 but if you like that kind of game 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.950
 don't take the ronaldinho if you like it 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.440
 also one a little bit to suffer 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.110
 let's still look for something more 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.119
 and more composed of more different also a 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.830
 times more spectacular then 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.580
 build a team back ronaldinho 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.880
 what kind of player is his speed 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.240
 it is absolutely not a pro it is not 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.810
 absolutely a feature from da 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.420
 however, praise to praise is not negative 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.700
 as we see if the statistics at 58 of 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.620
 52 speed acceleration click 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.610
 actually I have not noticed such values 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.620
 low 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.570
 certainly not a sprinter now 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.200
 added his percussion in attack 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.630
 when it was to be done I could do them 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.120
 let's say with a speed on 70 and not on 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.780
 58 so I didn't notice a value like that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.820
 bass 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.910
 but certainly I repeat it is not a 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.380
 great sprinter for what 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.330
 it's about shooting 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.110
 unfortunately it has really low values 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.140
 especially known the 75 of long shot that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.150
 it's a really low low value a little 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.790
 also true with respect to the big one 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.320
 story of this champion but I have to say 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.480
 not very true even compared to mine 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.450
 experience at stake because I did 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.299
 some really spectacular codock clogs 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.980
 most of which have gone 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.610
 in the door mirror 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.420
 one of these was phenomenal 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.319
 beautiful it went to the intersection of the 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.599
 you will see pali on the left 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.129
 in front of the TV so long shot too 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.109
 if they have a real value people 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.560
 low have a really low value 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:18.230
 acknowledgment that there are also pros 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.760
 only 77 shot power actually looks 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.489
 some little things more than higher 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.230
 obviously you have to arrive in front of the 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.430
 however it leads somehow to 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.700
 try it the best 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.000
 but I have to say that it's not so bad 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.639
 and then the 93 of throws around that a value 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.560
 very high but then actually instead 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:40.040
 I have not found so high so it is a 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.000
 as ambiguous as what then 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.870
 it concerns the passage obviously 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.150
 it should be its characteristic 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.459
 main after dribbling in fact 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.189
 it is 87 of long passages with 87 of 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.879
 Short passes behaves well as co 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.409
 c 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.109
 indeed you can use it in my opinion is 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.030
 just like c or c if you really want 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.579
 used as new money but me 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.049
 I found nestambiente very badly 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.659
 however the steps are really 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.989
 excellent so how cc is good is not 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.639
 perfect but it is acceptable therefore 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.560
 I admit only absolutely frey though 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.799
 then we go to the main tro that the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.380
 dribbling 90 on the card 91 in the 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.060
 in-game stats with 5 stars 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.159
 obvious skill 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.960
 and woe to them if they take away from the five 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.740
 stars skill a ronaldinho and case in which 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.880
 next year 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.349
 will be able to be on fifa 16 then there 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.070
 these are absolutely absolute skills 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:38.340
 he absolutely lived a sorry pardon 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.350
 the overlapping of dribbling words 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.590
 truly exceptional unfortunately absolute 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.630
 77 of agility therefore in the narrow spaces 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.530
 and maybe it's not really lethal though 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.110
 manages to get along well thanks to the 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.060
 Control 96 is worth its most value 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.920
 high in game statistics you can hear 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.540
 practically everything the ball is always 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.550
 glued to his feet practically 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.220
 all the steps are above all 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.880
 or medium-high ones let's say who 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.320
 consequently control 5 stars 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.630
 he writes are all things that I do 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.540
 I feel I ask are phenomenal is that 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.150
 make it a fun player I have to 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.860
 make a note unfortunately the 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.790
 I didn't like the finalization 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.410
 lot 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.120
 on the other hand , in general this is not the case 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.150
 have a great finalization a 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.580
 part those in top version in versions 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.260
 much enhanced however often e 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.810
 gladly I was wrong alcohol in front of the 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.600
 door with the phenomenal parades of the 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.020
 goalkeeper but in the end is of the 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.870
 all acceptable unfortunately we say the 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.000
 his main cons is not either 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.640
 the acceleration another are the four 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.790
 in fact he at a normal low of works 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.810
 what an asshole value so let me 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:55.290
 to say it because you really can't find it 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.970
 so so often in the position where 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.640
 that is, you would like a little further 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.870
 midfielders and a little behind 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.080
 of the attacker we say in the trocar 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.900
 real to play too many games 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.540
 sometimes went down to take the balloon a 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.380
 midfield and therefore you have to do 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.720
 20 30 meters to get to the door 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.730
 or to get to make passages is one 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.529
 something a bit complicated you need to know 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:26.039
 use were aldinio not 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:28.869
 don't expect trends and ronaldinho is 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:31.629
 win division 1 absolutely not 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:34.029
 you have to learn to use it in my opinion 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:36.639
 enjoy using it remember you 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:38.649
 that still a fifa video game 15 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.719
 therefore there is no need to 

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:42.399
 kill yourself was played by playing with a 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:45.459
 legendary player who got it 

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:47.439
 this card and we say in the forum we say 

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:48.969
 just because it was voted because 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:51.669
 otherwise he would never have obtained it 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:53.589
 because he hasn't played since 2009 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.689
 useless that we put ourselves in. See you in 

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:59.379
 lap plays practically high levels 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:01.089
 2009 2010 so it is already extraordinary 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:03.009
 have a player who does not play from 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:05.349
 a lot of time at great levels with one 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.859
 such card therefore absolutely a 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:11.439
 fun player to know how to use 

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:13.149
 in the pro omitted in the top 5 star skating 

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:16.419
 ball control throws all the passes 

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:19.149
 also the obvious 91 punishments there in 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:21.279
 functions then as acceleration flop and 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:23.769
 warcraft shutter speed is stamina 

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:26.769
 because unfortunately 43 towards the 

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:30.839
 seventieth gets tired and you must know 

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:33.189
 manage his energies however in 

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:36.039
 complexes from a 7.8 

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:37.719
 I can't stay here to tell you girls a 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.549
 phenomenal player a player 

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:42.129
 fantastic wonderful I can't 

00:07:39.549 --> 00:07:43.779
 teasing me is a player who 

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:45.999
 you need to know how to use if you know 

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:48.399
 use makes you as much as 

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:50.319
 using the player with 82 of oberon 

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:52.989
 with good statistics but is not a 

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:54.279
 player who shifts the balances into 

00:07:52.989 --> 00:07:56.349
 a normal team 

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:57.819
 so i hope this review will 

00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:59.319
 whether we see each other in the next 

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:01.979
 review in the next video beautiful 

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.979
 all by good
