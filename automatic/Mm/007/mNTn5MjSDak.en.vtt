00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.290
IT IS A FEELING THAT I HOPE

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.690
NO OTHER -- NO OTHER PARENT EVER

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.630
HAS TO FEEL.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.060
THE HOPELESSNESS WAS

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.700
OVERWHELMING.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.830
NEW AT NOON, THE

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.770
HEARTBREAKING PLEA FOR ANSWERS.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.870
THE MOTHER OF A TEEN WHO

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.870
COMMITTED SUICIDE INSIDE A

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.140
SEMINOLE COUNTY SCHOOL SPEAKS

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.710
OUT.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.010
GOOD AFTERNOON, I'M STEWART

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.740
MOORE.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.150
I'M JASON GUY.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.490
THE FAMILY OF LAMAR HAWKINS, III

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.490
THEY CALLED SHAQ DIED AS A

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.690
RESULT OF BULLYING.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.020
HIS PARENTS SAY HE WAS SENDING A

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.530
MESSAGE.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.400
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.700
OUR LIVES ARE FOREVER CHANGED.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.200
SHAQ IS GONE.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.400
HE WAS A 14-YEAR-OLD BOY, 8TH

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.240
GRADER IN LAKE MARY, A BOY KNOWN

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.910
AS SHAQ.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.940
HE WAS SMALL FOR HIS AGE, BUT

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.240
HIS PERSONALITY WAS LARGER THAN

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.280
LIFE.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.580
HIS GROWTH WAS STUNTED AS A

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.580
RESULT OF HEALTH COMPLICATIONS

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.220
EARLY IN LIFE.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.820
AS A RESULT, HE WAS A VERY SMALL

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.320
BOY FOR HIS AGE.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.260
WE BELIEVE THIS MADE HIM AN EASY

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.160
TARGET FOR BULLIES.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.330
BULLIES HIS MOTHER SAYS DROVE

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.660
HAWKINS TO TAKE A GUN ON TO

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.130
SCHOOL PROPERTY LAST WEDNESDAY.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.970
ONCE CLASSES WERE OVER AND AFTER

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.000
HOURS OF FRANTIC SEARCHING, HIS

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.070
BODY WAS FOUND AT 11:00 AT NIGHT

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.810
IN THE SCHOOL'S BOY'S BATHROOM.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.710
I BELIEVE HE TOOK HIS LIFE AT

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.140
SCHOOL TO SEND A MESSAGE TO

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.510
THESE BULLIES.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.750
IN BETWEEN TEARS, SHE SAID

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.510
SHE RELOCATED HER FAMILY FROM

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.250
NEW YORK TO FLORIDA, RUNNING

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.220
AWAY FROM THE BULLIES THAT

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.990
TAUNTED HER SON.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.520
HERE IN SEMINOLE COUNTY, SHE

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.850
SAYS SHE CONFRONTED SCHOOL

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.790
OFFICIALS ON THE HANDLING OF THE

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.990
VERY SAME TYPE OF BULLYING.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.760
THEY PUSHED HIM DOWNSTAIRS.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.300
KNOCKED HIM OUT OF HIS CHAIR IN

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.930
THE CAFETERIA, MOCKED HIM

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.770
BECAUSE OF HIS SIZE.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.300
THE SEMINOLE COUNTY PUBLIC

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.410
SCHOOLS IS CITING NO COMMENT.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.710
THE QUESTION ARISES IS HOW DID

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.280
THE TEENAGER GET HIS HANDS ON

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.280
THE GUN.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.480
MR. HAWKINS' FIREARM WAS

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.120
STORED IN FULL COMPLIANCES WITH

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.850
FLORIDA LAW.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.720
THREE WEEKS BEFORE HIS DEATH,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.590
THEY LOST THEIR LITTLE BABY AND

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.960
NOW THEY HAVE TO BURY THEIR

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.690
TEENAGER.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.060
THIS IS THE WORST PAIN A

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.360
PARENT CAN EXPERIENCE.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.430
HER MOTHER BLAMES BULLIES FOR

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.000
HER DAUGHTER'S DEATH, A REALITY

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.370
HARD TO ASSIMILATE FOR THESE

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.840
FAMILIES.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.130
HE NEVER LED US TO BELIEVE HE
