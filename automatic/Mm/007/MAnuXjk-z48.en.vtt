00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
so I can immediately submerge them stops

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
so I can immediately submerge them stops
the<00:01:33.780> cooking<00:01:33.930> make<00:01:34.800> sure<00:01:34.980> they<00:01:35.340> don't<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.640> too

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the cooking make sure they don't get too

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.930 
the cooking make sure they don't get too
mushy<00:01:36.120> on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.660> inside<00:01:36.870> before<00:01:37.760> they<00:01:38.760> cool

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
mushy on the inside before they cool

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.750 
mushy on the inside before they cool
down<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:40.010> that<00:01:41.010> we<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.280> pick<00:01:41.400> them<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
down and that we can pick them up and

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.300 
down and that we can pick them up and
peel<00:01:41.940> it<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.060> away<00:01:42.830> all<00:01:43.830> right<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.190> this

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
peel it right away all right so this

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.040 
peel it right away all right so this
one's<00:01:44.520> actually<00:01:44.700> already<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.600> by<00:01:45.750> itself

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
one's actually already going by itself

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.470 
one's actually already going by itself
so<00:01:46.290> I'm<00:01:46.350> gonna<00:01:46.500> drop<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.850> little<00:01:48.060> cowboy
