00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
you're required to have an outside

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.660 
you're required to have an outside
mirror<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.510> points<00:01:10.409> along<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.250> driver's

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
mirror that points along the driver's

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.300 
mirror that points along the driver's
side<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.299> 200<00:01:12.900> feet<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> rear<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.770> did

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
side and 200 feet to the rear I did

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.370 
side and 200 feet to the rear I did
originally<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.150> mirror<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
originally have this mirror here and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.310 
originally have this mirror here and
that<00:01:17.100> works<00:01:17.490> actually<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.630> still<00:01:18.960> makes<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that works actually it still makes a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929 
that works actually it still makes a
great<00:01:19.530> blind<00:01:19.950> spot<00:01:20.220> mirror<00:01:20.520> even<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
great blind spot mirror even with the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.690 
great blind spot mirror even with the
doors<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:22.170> problem<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:23.490> could<00:01:23.670> argue

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
doors on the problem is one could argue

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.609 
doors on the problem is one could argue
whether<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.420> not<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.750> meets<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> requirement

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
whether or not it meets the requirement

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
whether or not it meets the requirement
of<00:01:25.680> being<00:01:25.740> an<00:01:26.070> outside<00:01:26.520> mirror<00:01:26.880> which<00:01:27.420> this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
of being an outside mirror which this

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810 
of being an outside mirror which this
definitely<00:01:28.049> does<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.340> other<00:01:29.430> thing<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
definitely does the other thing is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.719 
definitely does the other thing is
nobody<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.290> from<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> outside<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.430> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
nobody can see it from the outside so I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.480 
nobody can see it from the outside so I
figure<00:01:33.380> rather<00:01:34.380> than<00:01:34.590> getting<00:01:34.829> harassed<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
figure rather than getting harassed I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.679 
figure rather than getting harassed I
figured<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> would<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.060> make<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.390> easy<00:01:36.540> on

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
figured I would just make it easy on

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.530 
figured I would just make it easy on
myself<00:01:37.490> anyway<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.909> actually<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
myself anyway and I actually like the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.160 
myself anyway and I actually like the
mirror<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.200> works<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.840> use<00:01:43.020> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
mirror it works really well and I use it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.490 
mirror it works really well and I use it
a<00:01:43.320> lot<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.710> than<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.920> thought<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
a lot more than I thought I would so

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.260 
a lot more than I thought I would so
that's<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.460> particular<00:01:47.670> mirror<00:01:48.090> that

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's it this particular mirror that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.819 
that's it this particular mirror that
I'm<00:01:48.390> using<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> said<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> motorcycle

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
I'm using like I said is a motorcycle

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.590 
I'm using like I said is a motorcycle
mirror<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.460> don't<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:50.970> kind<00:01:51.479> of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
mirror I don't know what kind of

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.850 
mirror I don't know what kind of
motorcycle<00:01:52.729> but<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.909> plastic<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.860> actually

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
motorcycle but it's plastic and actually

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.200 
motorcycle but it's plastic and actually
when<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.280> looking<00:01:56.460> at<00:01:56.610> mirrors<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.090> was

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
when I was looking at mirrors I was

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.410 
when I was looking at mirrors I was
looking<00:01:57.390> at<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.540> lot<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.719> black<00:01:58.110> metal<00:01:58.409> ones<00:01:59.420> but

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
looking at a lot of black metal ones but

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.880 
looking at a lot of black metal ones but
I<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:00.750> liked<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> plastic<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.860> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
I really liked the plastic because it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.880 
I really liked the plastic because it
matches<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> know<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.659> plastic<00:02:04.079> all<00:02:04.590> over

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
matches you know the plastic all over

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.510 
matches you know the plastic all over
this<00:02:05.009> thing<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.840> anyway<00:02:07.160> here's<00:02:08.160> how<00:02:08.340> it's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
this thing so anyway here's how it's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.369 
this thing so anyway here's how it's
mounted<00:02:08.910> I'm<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.569> using<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> hinge

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
mounted I'm just using it in the hinge

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.260 
mounted I'm just using it in the hinge
here<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:11.480> have<00:02:12.480> one<00:02:12.750> washer<00:02:13.020> way

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
here I have one washer way

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.120 
here I have one washer way
I'll<00:02:15.840> show<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.110> how<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.320> works<00:02:16.770> but<00:02:16.980> it's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
I'll show you how that works but it's

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.520 
I'll show you how that works but it's
basically<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.520> loose<00:02:17.700> washer<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.450> when<00:02:19.110> when

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
basically a loose washer that when when

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.050 
basically a loose washer that when when
I<00:02:19.560> tightened<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:19.950> down<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.490> compresses

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
I tightened it down it just compresses

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.680 
I tightened it down it just compresses
and<00:02:21.330> keeps<00:02:21.630> everything<00:02:21.900> centered<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.850> then

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
and keeps everything centered and then

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.410 
and keeps everything centered and then
this<00:02:26.870> actually<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:27.960> just<00:02:28.020> hand<00:02:28.410> tight<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> this

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
this actually is just hand tight so this

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.290 
this actually is just hand tight so this
is<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:34.070> adjustment<00:02:35.070> nut<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.760> came<00:02:35.970> with<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
is the adjustment nut that came with the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.910 
is the adjustment nut that came with the
mirror<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.140> standard<00:02:43.440> mirror<00:02:43.680> let<00:02:43.860> me

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
mirror so just a standard mirror let me

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.590 
mirror so just a standard mirror let me
take<00:02:44.100> off<00:02:44.250> well<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.580> washers<00:02:45.060> now<00:02:45.210> pretty

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
take off well that washers now pretty

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.010 
take off well that washers now pretty
much<00:02:45.690> stuck<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:47.060> which<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.240> good<00:02:48.450> fine

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
much stuck on there which is good fine

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.520 
much stuck on there which is good fine
for<00:02:49.260> me

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
for me

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.390 
for me
however<00:02:49.980> there<00:02:50.130> we<00:02:50.190> go<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.860> anyway<00:02:53.160> when<00:02:53.370> I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
however there we go so anyway when I

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:03.710 
however there we go so anyway when I
found<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.820> mirror<00:02:59.180> it<00:03:00.180> actually<00:03:02.630> looked<00:03:03.630> like

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
found the mirror it actually looked like

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.750 
found the mirror it actually looked like
that<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:06.030> did<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.300> lot<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.570> googling<00:03:07.760> looking

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
that and I did a lot of googling looking

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.640 
that and I did a lot of googling looking
for<00:03:08.910> mirrors<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.959> didn't<00:03:10.170> look<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.320> any

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
for mirrors and it didn't look like any

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.630 
for mirrors and it didn't look like any
of<00:03:10.770> them<00:03:10.860> we're<00:03:11.010> going<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> long

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
of them we're going to have a long

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.320 
of them we're going to have a long
enough<00:03:11.790> post<00:03:13.550> but<00:03:14.550> what<00:03:14.700> I'm<00:03:14.820> finding<00:03:15.030> is

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
enough post but what I'm finding is

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.600 
enough post but what I'm finding is
these<00:03:15.660> are<00:03:15.810> almost<00:03:15.959> all<00:03:16.380> adjustable<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.430> when

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
these are almost all adjustable so when

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.449 
these are almost all adjustable so when
you<00:03:17.730> remove<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.300> adjustment<00:03:19.100> what<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.250> need

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
you remove this adjustment what you need

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.420 
you remove this adjustment what you need
to<00:03:20.580> make<00:03:20.760> sure<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.209> that<00:03:21.239> this<00:03:21.870> section<00:03:22.430> all

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
to make sure is that this section all

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.150 
to make sure is that this section all
the<00:03:23.489> way<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.120> bend<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.660> long<00:03:24.989> enough<00:03:25.350> to

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
the way to the bend is long enough to

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.850 
the way to the bend is long enough to
reach<00:03:26.600> through<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:28.110> hinge<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.650> case

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
reach through the hinge and in this case

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.500 
reach through the hinge and in this case
it<00:03:32.130> just<00:03:32.160> barely<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.820> which<00:03:33.120> works<00:03:33.330> out

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
it just barely is which works out

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
it just barely is which works out
perfect<00:03:35.090> okay

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
perfect okay

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.670 
perfect okay
harley-davidson<00:03:38.450> mirrors<00:03:39.450> work<00:03:40.110> well<00:03:40.380> as<00:03:40.650> a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
harley-davidson mirrors work well as a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.770 
harley-davidson mirrors work well as a
matter<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.920> fact<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:44.250> OEM<00:03:44.700> style<00:03:45.120> mirrors

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
matter of fact the the OEM style mirrors

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
matter of fact the the OEM style mirrors
have<00:03:46.700> even<00:03:47.700> longer<00:03:47.910> threads<00:03:48.420> but<00:03:49.140> all<00:03:49.260> out<00:03:49.709> of

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
have even longer threads but all out of

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.530 
have even longer threads but all out of
the<00:03:49.860> pictures<00:03:50.190> you'll<00:03:50.430> see<00:03:50.730> where<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.360> looks

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
the pictures you'll see where it looks

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.810 
the pictures you'll see where it looks
like<00:03:51.600> just<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.959> small<00:03:52.200> amount<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.560> threads<00:03:52.830> but

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
like just a small amount of threads but

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.100 
like just a small amount of threads but
the<00:03:53.940> reality<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.600> there's<00:03:54.930> some

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
the reality of it is there's some

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.560 
the reality of it is there's some
spacers<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.860> nuts<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.220> washers<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.940> are<00:03:57.450> on

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
spacers and nuts and washers that are on

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.320 
spacers and nuts and washers that are on
there<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.019> can<00:03:58.140> be<00:03:58.260> removed<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.330> liked

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
there that can be removed so I liked

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.270 
there that can be removed so I liked
this<00:04:00.540> because<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.930> could<00:04:01.230> turn<00:04:01.470> this

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
this because I could turn this

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.360 
this because I could turn this
adjustment<00:04:02.910> nut<00:04:03.060> around<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:04.040> use<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:08.130> kind

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
adjustment nut around and use it to kind

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.539 
adjustment nut around and use it to kind
of<00:04:08.459> Center<00:04:08.910> self-center<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:10.500> mirror<00:04:10.860> post<00:04:11.190> in

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
of Center self-center the mirror post in

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.120 
of Center self-center the mirror post in
the<00:04:12.239> hinge<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:14.130> that's<00:04:14.340> what<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:14.549> did<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:16.130> one

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
the hinge and that's what I did so one

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.900 
the hinge and that's what I did so one
more<00:04:17.310> time<00:04:17.510> I'm<00:04:18.510> just<00:04:18.750> using<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:19.140> washer<00:04:19.590> here

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
more time I'm just using a washer here

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.690 
more time I'm just using a washer here
just<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.950> keep<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.100> centered<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.550> and

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
just to keep it centered and and

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.880 
just to keep it centered and and
whenever<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.660> tighten<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.080> down<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.470> presses

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
whenever I tighten it down it presses

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.370 
whenever I tighten it down it presses
flat<00:04:26.220> on<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.640> top

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
flat on the top

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.500 
flat on the top
of<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.210> hinge<00:04:30.460> but<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.820> thought<00:04:32.390> about

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
of the of the hinge but I thought about

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.600 
of the of the hinge but I thought about
using<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.990> nylon<00:04:33.410> washer<00:04:33.950> or<00:04:34.190> something

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
using a nylon washer or something

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.250 
using a nylon washer or something
underneath<00:04:34.820> but<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:35.390> far<00:04:35.540> I<00:04:35.600> haven't<00:04:36.020> done<00:04:36.110> it

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
underneath but so far I haven't done it

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.110 
underneath but so far I haven't done it
just<00:04:36.770> trying<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:36.980> keep<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.190> simple<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:37.670> even

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
just trying to keep it simple I even

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.750 
just trying to keep it simple I even
thought<00:04:38.240> about<00:04:38.420> maybe<00:04:38.690> spot<00:04:39.050> welding<00:04:39.500> or

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
thought about maybe spot welding or

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.670 
thought about maybe spot welding or
putting<00:04:40.760> a<00:04:40.880> bit<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.120> jb<00:04:41.420> weld<00:04:41.600> on<00:04:41.840> this<00:04:42.080> just<00:04:42.620> to

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
putting a bit of jb weld on this just to

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.350 
putting a bit of jb weld on this just to
hold<00:04:42.890> that<00:04:43.040> in<00:04:43.220> place<00:04:43.340> but<00:04:43.730> so<00:04:43.910> far<00:04:44.090> like<00:04:44.330> I

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
hold that in place but so far like I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.610 
hold that in place but so far like I
said<00:04:44.570> I<00:04:44.600> don't<00:04:44.750> really<00:04:44.930> feel<00:04:45.170> like<00:04:45.230> I<00:04:45.410> need<00:04:45.590> to

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
said I don't really feel like I need to

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.120 
said I don't really feel like I need to
so<00:04:46.040> I<00:04:46.910> will<00:04:47.360> go<00:04:47.450> through<00:04:47.480> putting<00:04:48.200> this<00:04:48.260> on<00:04:48.440> so

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
so I will go through putting this on so

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.840 
so I will go through putting this on so
you<00:04:49.190> pull<00:04:49.400> your<00:04:49.520> doors<00:04:49.700> off<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.270> quite<00:04:51.230> simply

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
you pull your doors off and quite simply

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.150 
you pull your doors off and quite simply
mirror<00:04:52.850> drops<00:04:53.180> in<00:04:53.500> using<00:04:54.500> this<00:04:54.590> backwards

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
mirror drops in using this backwards

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.380 
mirror drops in using this backwards
from<00:04:55.430> how<00:04:55.580> it<00:04:55.700> was<00:04:55.730> designed

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
from how it was designed

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:04.240 
from how it was designed
and<00:04:57.370> it<00:04:58.370> basically<00:04:58.570> threads<00:04:59.570> on<00:05:00.670> and<00:05:02.920> then<00:05:03.920> I

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
and it basically threads on and then I

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:11.800 
and it basically threads on and then I
turn<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.150> mirror<00:05:05.480> in<00:05:05.720> all<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.320> way<00:05:09.550> and<00:05:10.810> then

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
turn the mirror in all the way and then

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.190 
turn the mirror in all the way and then
get<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:12.170> finger<00:05:12.410> tight<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:14.780> then<00:05:14.960> when<00:05:15.080> I'm

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
get it finger tight and then when I'm

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.340 
get it finger tight and then when I'm
done<00:05:15.230> I<00:05:16.270> just<00:05:17.270> spin<00:05:17.510> it<00:05:17.660> out<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.200> holds

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
done I just spin it out and it holds

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.910 
done I just spin it out and it holds
fairly<00:05:18.800> well<00:05:20.380> so<00:05:21.380> that's<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:23.590> it's<00:05:24.590> been

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
fairly well so that's it it's been

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.240 
fairly well so that's it it's been
successful<00:05:25.580> in<00:05:25.850> highway<00:05:26.450> speeds<00:05:27.040> every<00:05:28.040> once

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
successful in highway speeds every once

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.290 
successful in highway speeds every once
in<00:05:28.370> a<00:05:28.430> while<00:05:28.460> if<00:05:28.670> I<00:05:28.760> don't<00:05:28.910> have<00:05:29.030> it<00:05:29.150> tight

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
in a while if I don't have it tight

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.990 
in a while if I don't have it tight
enough<00:05:29.570> it'll<00:05:30.200> fold<00:05:30.530> over<00:05:30.920> with<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.190> wind<00:05:31.400> and

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
enough it'll fold over with the wind and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.140 
enough it'll fold over with the wind and
all<00:05:32.150> I<00:05:32.180> do<00:05:32.360> is<00:05:33.250> retighten<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.340> kind<00:05:34.850> of<00:05:34.910> wiggle

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
all I do is retighten it kind of wiggle

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.850 
all I do is retighten it kind of wiggle
it<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:35.360> tighten<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:35.780> and<00:05:35.900> then<00:05:35.960> pull<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.830> back

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
it and tighten it and then pull it back

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.000 
it and tighten it and then pull it back
out<00:05:37.190> again<00:05:37.220> and<00:05:37.730> it<00:05:38.540> retains<00:05:38.870> itself<00:05:39.320> and<00:05:39.500> you

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
out again and it retains itself and you

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
out again and it retains itself and you
know<00:05:40.100> that's<00:05:40.250> with<00:05:40.400> no<00:05:40.430> tools<00:05:40.730> you<00:05:40.910> can

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
know that's with no tools you can

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.170 
know that's with no tools you can
obviously<00:05:41.330> put<00:05:41.960> a<00:05:42.020> wrench<00:05:42.230> on<00:05:42.410> this<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:43.180> it'll

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
obviously put a wrench on this and it'll

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.270 
obviously put a wrench on this and it'll
tighten<00:05:44.360> up<00:05:44.570> nicely<00:05:44.810> but<00:05:45.170> for<00:05:45.680> no<00:05:45.800> tools<00:05:46.010> that

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
tighten up nicely but for no tools that

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.460 
tighten up nicely but for no tools that
works<00:05:46.460> out<00:05:46.610> fairly<00:05:47.240> easily<00:05:47.480> so<00:05:48.110> anyway<00:05:48.350> that's

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
works out fairly easily so anyway that's

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.530 
works out fairly easily so anyway that's
it<00:05:48.740> good<00:05:49.580> luck<00:05:49.760> with<00:05:49.910> your<00:05:50.030> search<00:05:50.210> for

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
it good luck with your search for

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.440 
it good luck with your search for
motorcycle<00:05:51.110> mirrors<00:05:51.760> it's<00:05:52.760> actually<00:05:53.090> easier

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
motorcycle mirrors it's actually easier

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.850 
motorcycle mirrors it's actually easier
than<00:05:53.720> I<00:05:54.020> thought<00:05:54.170> it<00:05:54.320> was<00:05:54.380> going<00:05:54.530> to<00:05:54.620> be<00:05:54.710> to

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
than I thought it was going to be to

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.950 
than I thought it was going to be to
find<00:05:54.980> one<00:05:55.100> that<00:05:55.310> would<00:05:55.430> fit<00:05:55.640> so<00:05:56.480> do<00:05:56.750> what<00:05:56.840> I<00:05:56.900> did

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
find one that would fit so do what I did

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.620 
find one that would fit so do what I did
go<00:05:57.230> to<00:05:57.260> a<00:05:57.580> aftermarket<00:05:58.580> motorcycle<00:05:59.120> shop<00:05:59.330> and

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
go to a aftermarket motorcycle shop and

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.840 
go to a aftermarket motorcycle shop and
see<00:06:00.560> if<00:06:00.650> they<00:06:00.710> have<00:06:00.860> any<00:06:01.040> use<00:06:01.220> mirrors<00:06:01.610> laying

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
see if they have any use mirrors laying

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.660 
see if they have any use mirrors laying
around<00:06:01.970> or<00:06:02.650> or<00:06:03.650> even<00:06:03.710> some<00:06:04.130> new<00:06:04.250> ones<00:06:04.430> but

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
there's a lot of a lot of black metal

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.680 
there's a lot of a lot of black metal
mirrors<00:06:08.740> on<00:06:09.740> the<00:06:09.980> Harley<00:06:10.280> side<00:06:10.520> but<00:06:11.270> I<00:06:11.510> don't

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
mirrors on the Harley side but I don't

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.090 
mirrors on the Harley side but I don't
know<00:06:11.810> I<00:06:12.170> don't<00:06:12.350> know<00:06:12.440> who<00:06:12.620> makes<00:06:12.800> these

know I don't know who makes these

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.910 
know I don't know who makes these
plastic<00:06:13.730> mirrors<00:06:14.090> but<00:06:14.330> I<00:06:14.780> liked<00:06:15.350> it<00:06:15.470> better<00:06:15.560> so
