00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.249 
way and then I'll chiney put another
sign<00:02:07.649> then<00:02:08.179> which<00:02:09.179> I'll<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.420> later<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.929> now<00:02:10.229> I

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
sign then which I'll do later and now I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.720 
sign then which I'll do later and now I
don't<00:02:10.530> know<00:02:10.739> what<00:02:10.860> these<00:02:10.979> guys<00:02:11.160> are<00:02:11.220> doing<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
don't know what these guys are doing and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.460 
don't know what these guys are doing and
then<00:02:12.480> next<00:02:12.660> right<00:02:13.080> here

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
then next right here

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.450 
then next right here
and<00:02:13.620> see<00:02:13.800> there's<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.070> sign<00:02:14.250> right<00:02:14.280> there

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
and see there's a sign right there

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.990 
and see there's a sign right there
points<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.120> exit<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.050> then<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.890> one<00:02:17.000> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
points to exit and then this one and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.840 
points to exit and then this one and
then<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:19.080> keep<00:02:19.350> on<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.770> path<00:02:19.830> way<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.550> might

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
then you keep on this path way I might

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.490 
then you keep on this path way I might
put<00:02:21.060> another<00:02:21.270> sign<00:02:21.600> just<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:21.960> case<00:02:22.170> someone

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
put another sign just in case someone

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.790 
put another sign just in case someone
starts<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:23.180> wander<00:02:24.290> then<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.620> keep

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
starts to wander then you just keep

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.260 
starts to wander then you just keep
going<00:02:26.040> keep<00:02:26.820> going<00:02:27.060> keep<00:02:27.360> going<00:02:27.840> keep<00:02:28.260> going

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
going keep going keep going keep going

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.570 
going keep going keep going keep going
its<00:02:30.270> pretty<00:02:30.540> long<00:02:30.660> wait<00:02:31.020> but<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:32.160> exit

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
its pretty long wait but and the exit

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:42.680 
its pretty long wait but and the exit
and<00:02:33.590> bridge<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:40.550> then<00:02:41.550> this<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.030> exit<00:02:42.600> and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
and bridge and then this is the exit and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.600 
and bridge and then this is the exit and
the<00:02:42.810> F<00:02:43.020> map<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.770> then<00:02:44.400> see<00:02:44.700> one<00:02:45.090> almost<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
the F map and then see one almost to the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.820 
the F map and then see one almost to the
war<00:02:47.610> zone<00:02:48.060> which<00:02:48.660> most<00:02:48.930> factions<00:02:49.410> do<00:02:49.620> see

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
war zone which most factions do see

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.270 
war zone which most factions do see
there's<00:02:50.040> war<00:02:50.220> zone<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.790> then<00:02:51.650> we'll<00:02:52.650> try<00:02:53.220> to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
there's war zone and then we'll try to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.300 
there's war zone and then we'll try to
cast<00:02:54.140> action<00:02:56.780> on<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.170> wilderness<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.040> then

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
cast action on the wilderness and then

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.460 
cast action on the wilderness and then
yeah<00:02:59.520> okay<00:02:59.670> let's<00:03:00.120> get<00:03:00.270> into<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> tutorial

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
yeah okay let's get into the tutorial

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.930 
yeah okay let's get into the tutorial
now<00:03:01.650> once<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.100> get<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.310> till<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.459> wilderness

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
now once you get in till the wilderness

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.520 
now once you get in till the wilderness
as<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.420> see<00:03:03.630> there's<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.050> wilderness

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
as you can see there's the wilderness

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.750 
as you can see there's the wilderness
and<00:03:05.420> then<00:03:06.420> like<00:03:07.110> see<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.440> see<00:03:08.220> how<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.580> says

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
and then like see I see how it says

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.630 
and then like see I see how it says
right<00:03:09.060> there<00:03:09.780> Pilate<00:03:10.680> cast<00:03:10.950> let<00:03:11.130> me<00:03:11.220> draw<00:03:11.430> in

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
right there Pilate cast let me draw in

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.040 
right there Pilate cast let me draw in
land<00:03:12.240> apply<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.750> cast<00:03:13.080> so<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> F<00:03:14.070> map<00:03:14.600> see<00:03:15.600> that

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
land apply to cast so to F map see that

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.530 
land apply to cast so to F map see that
says<00:03:16.530> what<00:03:16.890> land<00:03:17.160> you're<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.790> then<00:03:18.390> it

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
says what land you're in and then it

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.229 
says what land you're in and then it
shows<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.290> right<00:03:19.530> there<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.209> then<00:03:21.209> red<00:03:21.600> ones

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
shows you right there and then red ones

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.850 
shows you right there and then red ones
warzone<00:03:24.239> yellow<00:03:24.720> safe<00:03:25.019> zone<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.500> then<00:03:25.650> those

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
warzone yellow safe zone and then those

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.860 
warzone yellow safe zone and then those
are<00:03:26.310> all<00:03:26.519> factions<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.510> can<00:03:27.660> see<00:03:27.840> right

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
are all factions and you can see right

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.860 
are all factions and you can see right

mark and then an son ninjaboys platy

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.390 
mark and then an son ninjaboys platy
cast<00:03:41.459> equal<00:03:41.940> sign<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.890> yeah<00:03:43.890> that's<00:03:44.250> how

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
cast equal sign so yeah that's how

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.190 
cast equal sign so yeah that's how
affections<00:03:44.910> oh<00:03:45.180> wait<00:03:45.420> there's<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.930> question
