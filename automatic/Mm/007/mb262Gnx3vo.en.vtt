their youth system I don't actually mind
that<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.380> I'd<00:03:25.380> say<00:03:25.680> lannis<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.430> probably<00:03:26.790> my

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that so I'd say lannis is probably my

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.770 
that so I'd say lannis is probably my
best<00:03:27.390> option<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:27.959> far<00:03:28.670> branch<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.060> mean<00:03:30.600> I'm

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
best option so far branch in I mean I'm

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.840 
best option so far branch in I mean I'm
I<00:03:31.140> know<00:03:31.410> second<00:03:32.130> division<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.549> Scottish

football<00:03:33.150> isn't<00:03:33.360> too<00:03:33.720> great<00:03:33.950> as<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.070> see

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280

football isn't too great as you see
semi-professional<00:03:36.060> team<00:03:36.269> so<00:03:36.480> basically<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.840> be

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
semi-professional team so basically I be

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.660 
semi-professional team so basically I be
offering<00:03:37.260> part-time<00:03:37.709> contract<00:03:38.250> stuff<00:03:38.430> like

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
that generally they predicted fourth

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.210 
that generally they predicted fourth
which<00:03:41.400> isn't<00:03:41.730> too<00:03:41.850> bad<00:03:42.000> i<00:03:42.060> mean<00:03:43.010> was<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.130> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
which isn't too bad i mean was in the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.590 
which isn't too bad i mean was in the
second<00:03:44.430> division<00:03:44.549> one<00:03:44.820> team<00:03:45.000> goes<00:03:45.150> up<00:03:45.360> another

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
second division one team goes up another

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.110 
second division one team goes up another
team<00:03:45.780> goes<00:03:45.930> up<00:03:46.080> through<00:03:46.110> playoffs<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:47.120> yep

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
team goes up through playoffs is it yep

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.390 
team goes up through playoffs is it yep
then<00:03:48.330> free<00:03:48.570> play<00:03:49.230> off<00:03:49.380> with<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.980> team<00:03:50.160> who<00:03:50.370> are

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
then free play off with the team who are

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.759 
then free play off with the team who are
bottom<00:03:51.360> in<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.690> first<00:03:51.930> division<00:03:52.140> were<00:03:52.500> second

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
bottom in the first division were second

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.920 
bottom in the first division were second
bomb<00:03:52.890> in<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.070> third<00:03:53.250> division<00:03:53.700> first<00:03:54.239> so

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
bomb in the third division first so

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.810 
bomb in the third division first so
division<00:03:55.350> where<00:03:55.830> Patrick<00:03:56.190> this'll<00:03:56.519> all<00:03:56.610> right

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
division where Patrick this'll all right

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.270 
division where Patrick this'll all right
now<00:03:57.320> they<00:03:58.320> all<00:03:58.440> play<00:03:58.620> off<00:03:58.769> one<00:03:58.980> team<00:03:59.160> will

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
now they all play off one team will

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.920 
now they all play off one team will
either<00:03:59.370> go<00:03:59.549> up<00:03:59.580> or<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.330> team<00:04:00.510> will<00:04:00.660> stay<00:04:00.810> in

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
either go up or the team will stay in

either go up or the team will stay in
their<00:04:01.019> current<00:04:01.140> division<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.769> mean<00:04:02.310> it's<00:04:02.430> not

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
their current division I mean it's not

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.130 
their current division I mean it's not

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
a pretty to just to scrape it i mean i

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.800 
a pretty to just to scrape it i mean i
could<00:04:05.610> probably<00:04:05.910> over<00:04:06.180> achieve<00:04:06.480> with<00:04:06.660> them

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
could probably over achieve with them

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.750 
could probably over achieve with them
maybe<00:04:07.040> depending<00:04:08.040> on<00:04:08.130> how<00:04:08.220> good<00:04:08.430> their<00:04:08.549> actual

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
maybe depending on how good their actual

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.080 
maybe depending on how good their actual
team<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.980> we<00:04:10.980> media<00:04:11.250> petitions<00:04:11.640> one<00:04:11.790> thing<00:04:12.000> but

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
team is we media petitions one thing but

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.420 
team is we media petitions one thing but
depends<00:04:12.390> are<00:04:12.480> well<00:04:12.630> i<00:04:12.660> can<00:04:12.900> play<00:04:13.049> them<00:04:13.430> their

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
depends are well i can play them their

depends are well i can play them their
facilities<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:15.000> course<00:04:15.180> Antony<00:04:15.570> is<00:04:15.750> good

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
facilities of course Antony is good

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.810 
facilities of course Antony is good
adequate<00:04:16.560> training<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.220> basic<00:04:17.669> you

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
adequate training to the basic you

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.569 
adequate training to the basic you
fairly<00:04:18.150> basic<00:04:18.329> corporate<00:04:19.340> basic<00:04:20.340> junior

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
fairly basic corporate basic junior

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.190 
fairly basic corporate basic junior
coats<00:04:20.790> in<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.060> fairly<00:04:21.299> basic<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.780> four<00:04:21.930> crewmen

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
coats in a fairly basic you four crewmen

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.390 
coats in a fairly basic you four crewmen
so<00:04:22.349> I'd<00:04:22.440> say<00:04:22.680> they're<00:04:22.860> probably<00:04:23.039> equivalent

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
so I'd say they're probably equivalent

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.060 
so I'd say they're probably equivalent
to<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.789> Blue<00:04:24.570> Square<00:04:24.599> Bet<00:04:24.840> team<00:04:25.289> of<00:04:25.500> English

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
to a Blue Square Bet team of English

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.110 
to a Blue Square Bet team of English
football

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
football

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.480 
football
so<00:04:27.300> although<00:04:27.660> maybe<00:04:28.139> they're<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.740> good<00:04:28.979> team<00:04:29.010> it

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
so although maybe they're a good team it

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.830 
so although maybe they're a good team it
would<00:04:29.550> be<00:04:29.699> interesting<00:04:30.090> to<00:04:30.120> stop<00:04:30.360> maybe<00:04:30.600> kind

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
would be interesting to stop maybe kind

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.780 
would be interesting to stop maybe kind

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
of low as well so of course there's one

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.540 
of low as well so of course there's one
of<00:04:32.880> your<00:04:32.970> options<00:04:33.090> there<00:04:34.070> then<00:04:35.070> we<00:04:35.160> got<00:04:35.280> quill

probably<00:04:43.620> recommend<00:04:43.800> do<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.250> but<00:04:44.400> they

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
probably recommend do that but they

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.890 
probably recommend do that but they

good<00:05:05.190> at<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.580> average<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.180> above<00:05:06.930> average<00:05:07.080> so

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
good at the average and above average so

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.800 
good at the average and above average so
again<00:05:07.949> they're<00:05:08.130> not<00:05:08.280> as<00:05:08.400> big<00:05:08.610> as<00:05:08.789> Lana<00:05:09.479> spadoni

again they're not as big as Lana spadoni
and<00:05:10.050> I'm<00:05:10.470> surprised<00:05:10.860> I<00:05:10.889> even<00:05:11.010> got<00:05:11.370> that<00:05:11.430> bid

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
and I'm surprised I even got that bid

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.540 
and I'm surprised I even got that bid
coming<00:05:12.539> for<00:05:12.720> me<00:05:13.160> anybody<00:05:14.160> where<00:05:14.400> would<00:05:14.490> they

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
coming for me anybody where would they

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.760 
coming for me anybody where would they
put<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.789> is<00:05:14.910> actually<00:05:15.030> 17<00:05:15.600> fours<00:05:15.780> it<00:05:15.870> so<00:05:16.620> they

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
put it is actually 17 fours it so they

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.529 
put it is actually 17 fours it so they
predicted<00:05:17.130> 17th<00:05:17.610> in<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:18.000> Premier<00:05:18.330> Division

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
predicted 17th in the Premier Division

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.050 
predicted 17th in the Premier Division
where<00:05:18.870> is<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.199> I<00:05:19.470> mean<00:05:20.430> that's<00:05:20.550> quite<00:05:20.850> low

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
where is that I mean that's quite low

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.540 
where is that I mean that's quite low
I'm<00:05:21.360> not<00:05:21.479> sure<00:05:21.740> overall<00:05:22.740> who<00:05:23.070> goes<00:05:23.250> up<00:05:23.430> who

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
I'm not sure overall who goes up who

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.870 
I'm not sure overall who goes up who
goes<00:05:23.699> down<00:05:23.910> I'm<00:05:24.750> not<00:05:25.080> too<00:05:25.289> sure<00:05:25.669> like<00:05:26.669> I<00:05:26.699> said

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
goes down I'm not too sure like I said

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.340 
goes down I'm not too sure like I said
I'm<00:05:27.030> right<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:27.810> that's<00:05:27.930> have<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.080> look<00:05:28.199> at<00:05:28.289> this

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
I'm right and that's have a look at this

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.689 
I'm right and that's have a look at this
I<00:05:28.500> should<00:05:28.680> go<00:05:28.770> on<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.010> rules<00:05:29.250> who<00:05:29.430> goes<00:05:29.580> up

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
I should go on the rules who goes up

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.420 
I should go on the rules who goes up
because<00:05:29.789> down<00:05:30.349> and<00:05:31.349> bought<00:05:31.919> free<00:05:32.099> teams<00:05:32.310> in

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
because down and bought free teams in

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.950 
because down and bought free teams in
the<00:05:32.490> average<00:05:32.639> points<00:05:32.940> table<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:33.479> relegated<00:05:33.900> to

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
the average points table I relegated to

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.810 
the average points table I relegated to
the<00:05:33.990> second<00:05:34.320> division<00:05:34.349> so<00:05:34.800> bottom<00:05:35.610> three

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
the second division so bottom three

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.879 
the second division so bottom three
teams<00:05:36.090> will<00:05:36.330> start<00:05:36.510> now<00:05:36.720> 20th<00:05:37.229> so<00:05:37.650> it's<00:05:37.800> like

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
teams will start now 20th so it's like

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.650 
teams will start now 20th so it's like
the<00:05:37.950> Premier<00:05:38.250> League<00:05:38.280> really<00:05:38.700> ball<00:05:39.270> free<00:05:39.479> team

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
the Premier League really ball free team

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.839 
the Premier League really ball free team
goes<00:05:39.870> down<00:05:40.110> so<00:05:40.740> we're<00:05:40.919> just<00:05:40.950> expected<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.580> just

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
goes down so we're just expected to just

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.460 
goes down so we're just expected to just
survive<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.419> again<00:05:42.660> I'm<00:05:42.780> not<00:05:43.020> attracted<00:05:43.260> to

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
survive so again I'm not attracted to

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.900 
survive so again I'm not attracted to
that<00:05:43.650> team<00:05:43.950> because<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.370> don't<00:05:44.580> really<00:05:44.610> want<00:05:44.880> a

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
that team because I don't really want a

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.060 
that team because I don't really want a
relegation<00:05:45.150> scrap<00:05:45.419> to<00:05:46.260> start<00:05:46.500> off<00:05:46.590> my<00:05:46.740> career

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
relegation scrap to start off my career

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.060 
relegation scrap to start off my career

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
look at that side anyway so as you can

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.920 
look at that side anyway so as you can
see<00:06:08.610> a<00:06:08.639> single<00:06:08.970> then<00:06:09.210> they<00:06:09.300> got<00:06:09.449> their<00:06:09.660> only<00:06:09.780> up

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930
