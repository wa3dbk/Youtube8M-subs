really<00:00:41.760> cool<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.180> me<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.390> honestly<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.140> thing

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
really cool to me but honestly the thing

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
really cool to me but honestly the thing
that<00:00:43.440> drew<00:00:43.620> me<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.890> most<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> art<00:00:44.940> style

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450

that drew me and most was the art style
of<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.170> seems<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.770> very<00:00:47.039> graphic<00:00:47.309> very

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

she's been Miss Marvel which means

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560

Miss Marvel got upgraded to Captain

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.520 
Miss Marvel got upgraded to Captain
Marvel<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:51.270> something<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.380> now

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
Marvel or something like that like now

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.899 
Marvel or something like that like now
she's<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.920> an<00:01:53.040> outerspace<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.670> really

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
she's like an outerspace what really

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.999 
she's like an outerspace what really
intrigued<00:01:54.180> me<00:01:54.479> about<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.560> it

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
intrigued me about this is that it

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.130 
intrigued me about this is that it
centers<00:01:56.310> are<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> young<00:01:56.670> Muslim<00:01:57.540> American

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
centers are on a young Muslim American

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.550 
centers are on a young Muslim American
girl<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> woman<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> color<00:01:59.520> and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
girl so it's like a woman of color and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.990 
girl so it's like a woman of color and
in<00:02:01.560> America<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.850> a

in America which I just think it's a
rarity<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.930> grab<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> comic<00:02:04.740> books<00:02:04.920> from
