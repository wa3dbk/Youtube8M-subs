00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
start with ultra HD which we've seen a

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.790 
start with ultra HD which we've seen a
little<00:00:21.699> bit<00:00:21.880> of<00:00:21.940> this<00:00:22.449> year<00:00:22.660> so<00:00:22.869> far<00:00:23.050> next<00:00:23.650> year

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
little bit of this year so far next year

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.500 
little bit of this year so far next year
we're<00:00:23.949> expecting<00:00:24.400> to<00:00:24.490> see<00:00:24.640> more<00:00:24.850> brands<00:00:25.359> in

we're expecting to see more brands in

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.870 
we're expecting to see more brands in
the<00:00:25.930> market<00:00:26.080> with<00:00:26.350> ultra<00:00:26.619> HD<00:00:27.039> probably<00:00:27.730> lower

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
the market with ultra HD probably lower

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.120 
the market with ultra HD probably lower
price<00:00:28.210> points<00:00:28.689> and<00:00:28.869> also<00:00:29.199> more<00:00:29.410> screen<00:00:29.800> sizes

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
price points and also more screen sizes

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.439 
price points and also more screen sizes
so<00:00:30.490> people<00:00:30.760> will<00:00:30.849> have<00:00:31.000> a<00:00:31.029> little<00:00:31.210> bit<00:00:31.330> more

their first OLED TVs but we don't expect
prices<00:00:41.199> to<00:00:41.379> drop<00:00:41.499> I<00:00:41.920> mean<00:00:42.069> we<00:00:42.159> saw<00:00:42.309> them<00:00:42.460> around

prices to drop I mean we saw them around
nine<00:00:42.940> ten<00:00:43.239> thousand<00:00:43.659> dollars<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.170> it's<00:00:44.620> going

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
nine ten thousand dollars and it's going

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.110 
nine ten thousand dollars and it's going

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
to take a long time before those prices

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.149 
to take a long time before those prices
drop<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.749> more<00:00:46.989> ordinary<00:00:47.260> TV<00:00:47.769> pricing

drop to a more ordinary TV pricing
another<00:00:49.030> innovation<00:00:49.420> we<00:00:49.659> saw<00:00:49.809> in<00:00:49.929> the<00:00:49.959> labs

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
another innovation we saw in the labs

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.049 
another innovation we saw in the labs
this<00:00:50.440> year<00:00:50.679> was<00:00:50.859> televisions<00:00:51.609> with<00:00:51.699> curved

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
this year was televisions with curved

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.779 
this year was televisions with curved
screens<00:00:52.649> yeah<00:00:53.649> you<00:00:53.709> know<00:00:53.949> we<00:00:54.039> saw<00:00:54.219> two<00:00:54.280> oled

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
screens yeah you know we saw two oled

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.489 
screens yeah you know we saw two oled
tvs<00:00:55.149> this<00:00:55.359> year<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.659> head<00:00:55.780> curved<00:00:56.079> screens

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
tvs this year the head curved screens

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:58.169 
tvs this year the head curved screens
but<00:00:57.039> at<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.190> very<00:00:57.219> end<00:00:57.489> of<00:00:57.639> the<00:00:57.729> year<00:00:57.879> Sony

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
but at the very end of the year Sony

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.689 
but at the very end of the year Sony
came<00:00:58.510> out<00:00:58.690> with<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:58.839> regular<00:00:59.199> LCD<00:00:59.679> TV<00:01:00.069> that<00:01:00.519> had

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
came out with a regular LCD TV that had

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.489 
came out with a regular LCD TV that had
a<00:01:00.729> curved<00:01:01.059> screen<00:01:01.389> and<00:01:01.659> we<00:01:01.959> think<00:01:02.139> that<00:01:02.260> we

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
a curved screen and we think that we

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:03.779 
a curved screen and we think that we
probably<00:01:02.529> at<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.039> show<00:01:03.190> will<00:01:03.369> see<00:01:03.519> a<00:01:03.549> couple

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
probably at the show will see a couple

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.969 
probably at the show will see a couple
more<00:01:04.089> of<00:01:04.150> them<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.869> it<00:01:05.019> more<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.229> a<00:01:05.409> gimmick<00:01:05.799> or

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
more of them is it more of a gimmick or

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.649 
more of them is it more of a gimmick or
does<00:01:06.159> it<00:01:06.189> actually<00:01:06.490> change<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.420> viewing

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
does it actually change the viewing

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.050 
does it actually change the viewing
experience<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.890> think<00:01:09.159> that<00:01:09.219> maybe<00:01:09.609> when<00:01:09.939> you

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
experience we think that maybe when you

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.719 
experience we think that maybe when you
get<00:01:10.180> into<00:01:10.329> the<00:01:10.539> ultra<00:01:10.960> large<00:01:11.170> size<00:01:11.590> TVs<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:12.399> may

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
get into the ultra large size TVs it may

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.490 
get into the ultra large size TVs it may
do<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.030> in<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.390> TVs<00:01:13.689> we've<00:01:13.869> seen<00:01:14.109> it<00:01:14.289> really

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
do that in the TVs we've seen it really

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.230 
do that in the TVs we've seen it really
hasn't<00:01:14.740> done<00:01:15.009> anything<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.759> terms<00:01:15.939> of<00:01:16.090> making

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
hasn't done anything in terms of making

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.849 
hasn't done anything in terms of making
it<00:01:16.390> seem<00:01:16.600> like<00:01:16.719> it's<00:01:16.869> a<00:01:16.929> bigger<00:01:17.109> TV<00:01:17.320> than<00:01:17.619> it<00:01:17.740> is

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
it seem like it's a bigger TV than it is

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.130 
it seem like it's a bigger TV than it is
but<00:01:18.310> again<00:01:18.579> it<00:01:18.789> stylistically<00:01:19.630> it<00:01:19.840> just<00:01:19.990> makes

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
but again it stylistically it just makes

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.719 
but again it stylistically it just makes
you<00:01:20.259> look<00:01:20.439> at<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:20.679> it's<00:01:20.950> something<00:01:21.310> different

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
you look at it it's something different

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.520 
you look at it it's something different
and<00:01:22.000> I<00:01:22.149> think<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.570> know<00:01:22.600> manufactures<00:01:23.229> really

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
and I think you know manufactures really

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.690 
and I think you know manufactures really
looking<00:01:23.890> for<00:01:24.070> ways<00:01:24.250> that<00:01:24.579> they<00:01:24.670> can

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
looking for ways that they can

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700 
looking for ways that they can
differentiate<00:01:25.210> one<00:01:25.719> type<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.200> product<00:01:26.590> from

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
differentiate one type of product from

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.919 
differentiate one type of product from
another<00:01:26.979> so<00:01:27.490> let's<00:01:27.700> talk<00:01:27.880> about<00:01:27.939> plasma<00:01:28.420> is

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
another so let's talk about plasma is

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.319 
another so let's talk about plasma is
plasma<00:01:29.590> dead<00:01:29.829> as<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.130> technology<00:01:30.820> we're

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
plasma dead as a technology we're

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.319

thing<00:01:38.950> at<00:01:39.189> CES<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.670> we'll<00:01:39.820> be<00:01:39.909> trying<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.149> see

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
thing at CES is we'll be trying to see

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.819 
thing at CES is we'll be trying to see
where<00:01:40.450> they<00:01:40.600> positioning<00:01:41.229> them<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.740> know

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
where they positioning them you know

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:42.749 
where they positioning them you know
because<00:01:42.009> typically<00:01:42.310> they've<00:01:42.579> been

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
because typically they've been

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.099 
because typically they've been
higher-end<00:01:43.210> products<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.780> all<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:43.990> we're

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
higher-end products and all and we're

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.690 
higher-end products and all and we're
wondering<00:01:44.229> now<00:01:44.590> do<00:01:44.649> they<00:01:44.890> become<00:01:45.039> price<00:01:45.399> point

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
wondering now do they become price point

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.580 
wondering now do they become price point
pieces<00:01:46.179> that<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.899> know<00:01:46.990> allow<00:01:47.170> them<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.469> hit

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
pieces that you know allow them to hit

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.109 
pieces that you know allow them to hit
certain<00:01:47.920> price<00:01:48.159> points<00:01:48.579> but<00:01:48.909> they're<00:01:49.030> not

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
certain price points but they're not

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.669 
certain price points but they're not
putting<00:01:49.359> a<00:01:49.539> lot<00:01:49.689> of<00:01:49.719> new<00:01:49.960> innovation<00:01:50.499> new

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
putting a lot of new innovation new

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.410 
putting a lot of new innovation new
technologies<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.520> kind<00:01:51.759> of<00:01:51.819> stuff<00:01:52.030> into<00:01:52.210> it

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
technologies that kind of stuff into it

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.819 
technologies that kind of stuff into it
and<00:01:52.659> what<00:01:52.990> about<00:01:53.079> for<00:01:53.319> people<00:01:53.560> who<00:01:53.679> aren't

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
and what about for people who aren't

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.319 
and what about for people who aren't
necessarily<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.759> market<00:01:55.090> for<00:01:55.119> the

necessarily in the market for the

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.270 
necessarily in the market for the
absolute<00:01:55.719> latest<00:01:55.990> technology<00:01:56.859> is<00:01:57.100> there

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
absolute latest technology is there

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.739 
absolute latest technology is there
going<00:01:57.399> to<00:01:57.460> be<00:01:57.549> stuff<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.299> you're<00:01:58.600> going<00:01:58.689> to

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749

so<00:02:01.149> one<00:02:01.299> of<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.450> big<00:02:01.479> trends<00:02:01.689> that<00:02:01.869> we've<00:02:02.049> seen

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
so one of the big trends that we've seen

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.499 
so one of the big trends that we've seen
is<00:02:02.499> you<00:02:02.590> know<00:02:02.710> smart<00:02:03.009> TV<00:02:03.280> platforms<00:02:03.939> I<00:02:04.119> think

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
is you know smart TV platforms I think

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:05.910 
is you know smart TV platforms I think
they're<00:02:04.630> still<00:02:04.840> struggling<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.560> try<00:02:05.829> to

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
they're still struggling to try to

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.379 
they're still struggling to try to
figure<00:02:06.130> out<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.310> best<00:02:06.520> way<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.789> present<00:02:07.030> all

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:07.389 
figure out the best way to present all

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:08.999 
figure out the best way to present all
that<00:02:07.569> material<00:02:07.689> to<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.830> other<00:02:08.950> thing

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
that material to you and the other thing

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.589 
that material to you and the other thing
that<00:02:09.190> we're<00:02:09.340> seeing<00:02:09.459> is<00:02:09.640> interaction<00:02:10.299> between

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
that we're seeing is interaction between

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.360 
that we're seeing is interaction between
TVs<00:02:11.049> and<00:02:11.230> mobile<00:02:11.560> devices<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.159> you<00:02:12.250> have

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
TVs and mobile devices so you have

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.520 
TVs and mobile devices so you have
second<00:02:12.760> screen<00:02:13.000> apps<00:02:13.239> all<00:02:13.480> these<00:02:13.930> wireless

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
second screen apps all these wireless

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.250 
second screen apps all these wireless
technologies<00:02:15.069> like<00:02:15.340> miracast<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.240> NFC<00:02:16.540> that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
technologies like miracast and NFC that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.480 
technologies like miracast and NFC that
are<00:02:17.380> making<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.740> easy<00:02:17.890> for<00:02:18.069> people<00:02:18.220> to
