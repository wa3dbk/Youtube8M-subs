flagship<00:00:13.139> folio<00:00:13.620> now<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> wanted<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.610> show<00:00:14.759> you

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
flagship folio now I wanted to show you

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.609 
flagship folio now I wanted to show you
it<00:00:15.000> top<00:00:15.240> down<00:00:15.509> first<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.990> all<00:00:16.080> just<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.500> get

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
it top down first of all just so you get

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.890 
it top down first of all just so you get
to<00:00:16.770> see<00:00:16.800> how<00:00:17.130> everything<00:00:17.550> works<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.240> will<00:00:18.750> also

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
to see how everything works I will also

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.929 
to see how everything works I will also
show<00:00:19.109> some<00:00:19.529> different<00:00:19.830> angles<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.820> can

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
show some different angles so you can

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.480 
show some different angles so you can
see<00:00:21.150> how<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> stand<00:00:21.930> feature<00:00:22.230> works<00:00:22.590> now<00:00:23.279> this

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
see how the stand feature works now this

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.790 
see how the stand feature works now this
is<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.699> front<00:00:24.689> cover<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.740> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
is the front cover and this is going to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.259 
is the front cover and this is going to
be<00:00:25.920> against<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.519> scream<00:00:26.849> when<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.119> in

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
be against you scream when it's in

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.210 
be against you scream when it's in
closed<00:00:27.599> position<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.529> does<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.099> auto

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
closed position it does have the auto

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.740 
closed position it does have the auto
wake<00:00:29.609> feature<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.269> as<00:00:30.330> well<00:00:30.480> which<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
wake feature on it as well which is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.479 
wake feature on it as well which is
really<00:00:30.900> nice<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> nice<00:00:32.160> soft

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
really nice but this is a nice soft

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.209 
really nice but this is a nice soft
material<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.079> these<00:00:34.320> ridges<00:00:34.980> on

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
material and you can see these ridges on

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.940 
material and you can see these ridges on
the<00:00:36.149> front<00:00:36.420> cover<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> very<00:00:37.800> very

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the front cover and this is very very

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.910 
the front cover and this is very very
rigid<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:38.879> well<00:00:39.149> now<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.200> what<00:00:40.469> achieved

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
rigid as well now this is what achieved

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.560 
rigid as well now this is what achieved
the<00:00:41.129> different<00:00:41.399> angles<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.180> sit<00:00:42.450> this

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the different angles so you can sit this

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.319 
the different angles so you can sit this
on<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.620> sort<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> front<00:00:44.219> cover<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.550> really

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
on the sort of front cover a really

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.779 
on the sort of front cover a really
upright<00:00:45.840> position<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.440> then<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.430> lower

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
upright position and then you can lower

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.000 
upright position and then you can lower
it<00:00:47.910> down<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> varian<00:00:49.110> different<00:00:49.649> angles

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
it down into the varian different angles

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.729 
it down into the varian different angles
and<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.420> lowest<00:00:51.809> angle<00:00:52.199> actually

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and then the lowest angle actually

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.650 
and then the lowest angle actually
offers<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> really<00:00:53.640> nice<00:00:53.789> angle<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.480> you're

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
offers a really nice angle for if you're

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.619 
offers a really nice angle for if you're
using<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.590> typing<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.610> iPad<00:00:57.030> now<00:00:57.600> I

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
using this for typing on your iPad now I

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.900 
using this for typing on your iPad now I
will<00:00:57.960> show<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.350> again<00:00:58.500> from<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.399> side<00:00:59.670> on

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
will show you that again from a side on

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.549 
will show you that again from a side on
view<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.449> get<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> see<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> angles

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
view so you get to see all of the angles

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
view so you get to see all of the angles
that<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.129> case<00:01:02.460> actually<00:01:02.760> offers<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.989> it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that this case actually offers but it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.830 
that this case actually offers but it
just<00:01:04.260> works<00:01:04.500> extremely<00:01:04.979> well<00:01:05.450> now<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.479> want<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
just works extremely well now I want to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.630 
just works extremely well now I want to
also<00:01:06.990> show<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.860> actual<00:01:08.010> hinge<00:01:08.430> mechanism

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
also show you the actual hinge mechanism

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.359 
also show you the actual hinge mechanism
so<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.450> go<00:01:09.600> back<00:01:09.630> round<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.159> see

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
so if we go back round here you can see

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.370 
so if we go back round here you can see
the<00:01:11.490> inside<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.299> hinge<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the inside of the hinge and this is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.840 
the inside of the hinge and this is
connected<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> portion<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.610> case

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
connected to this portion of the case

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.550 
connected to this portion of the case
the<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.240> that's<00:01:15.270> holding<00:01:15.900> your<00:01:16.020> iPad<00:01:16.439> in

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the bit that's holding your iPad in

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.280 
the bit that's holding your iPad in
place<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.759> metal<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.420> very<00:01:19.049> very

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
place and this is metal is very very

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.050 
place and this is metal is very very
nicely<00:01:19.590> engineered<00:01:19.950> one<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> best<00:01:20.850> I've

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
nicely engineered one of the best I've

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.480 
nicely engineered one of the best I've
seen<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.650> actually<00:01:22.950> close<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
seen and then if we actually close the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
seen and then if we actually close the
case<00:01:23.670> you'll<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.810> when<00:01:24.930> you're<00:01:25.080> closing

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
case you'll see that when you're closing

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.429 
case you'll see that when you're closing
it<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.430> bit<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:26.750> actually<00:01:27.750> grips

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
it like so this bit here actually grips

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.399 
it like so this bit here actually grips
on<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> side<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.240> iPad<00:01:30.689> now<00:01:30.900> this

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
on to the side of your iPad now this

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.870 
on to the side of your iPad now this
concerns<00:01:31.829> me<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> little<00:01:32.220> bit<00:01:32.430> because<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.700> don't

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
concerns me a little bit because I don't

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
concerns me a little bit because I don't
like<00:01:33.060> marking<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:33.780> iPads<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.860> close<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
like marking my iPads up so do close it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.609 
like marking my iPads up so do close it
quite<00:01:35.520> carefully<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.810> ease<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.320> closed

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
quite carefully so just ease it closed

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.609 
quite carefully so just ease it closed
like<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.180> has<00:01:39.329> its<00:01:39.509> benefits<00:01:39.659> because

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
like so now it has its benefits because

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.219 
like so now it has its benefits because
once<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.400> closed<00:01:41.790> unlike<00:01:42.450> some<00:01:42.750> cases

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
once this is closed unlike some cases

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.020 
once this is closed unlike some cases
where<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.950> front<00:01:44.189> cover<00:01:44.340> actually<00:01:44.759> moves

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
where the front cover actually moves

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.690 
where the front cover actually moves
around<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.710> place<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.340> not<00:01:47.490> going

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
around this is in place it's not going
