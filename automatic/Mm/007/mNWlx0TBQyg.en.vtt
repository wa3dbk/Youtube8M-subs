00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 people with me it is right back into 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.429
 water faster i mean today 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.889
 third training plan before will be back 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.660
 a general basic training with 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.030
 a little bit of speed elements 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.330
 today more emphasis on the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.920
 einschlag stop here briefly the plan 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.140
 it just happens to you 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.900
 can take pictures or so still break 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.439
 push something open you can 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.779
 recognize 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.700
 So, once again, four 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.760
 kilometers were even exactly four kilometers 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.260
 I start swimming in with 500 meters 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.340
 It combines a bit of technology 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.050
 Exercise after that come six times 500 but 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.809
 not on the piece but I share 500th 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.550
 on 50 100 150 all the 50 for me 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.280
 always in the stroke of 100 and 200 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.129
 I always change trains and the 150 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.770
 are in full the 150 in between 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.780
 my whole life around the change 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.409
 He actually moved over the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.450
 leg impact always flat flat 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.850
 just orientates that with a whole situation 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.540
 to switch between 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.070
 the whole six times fan with gray then 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.990
 the second main camp the third 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.450
 move back the fourth major position 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.580
 fifth again crawl and insects again 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.750
 I assume that I am in the main position 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.270
 still additional finger panels 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.000
 just a little bit over there 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.140
 To train impulse just a bit 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.780
 more pressure on the arm to track down 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.170
 and breaks I will always be in the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.829
 make a single 510 seconds and after 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.780
 will a 530-second break after 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.149
 I still have eight times 50 intermediate sprints 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.430
 doing intermediate sprints are like me 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.500
 already over 50 meters with a departure 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.049
 time of one minute or 115 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.420
 depending on how much I now time degree 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.340
 want to do and switch somewhere 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:06.030
 Any 10 12 meters somehow 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.099
 it somehow springs from it at the beginning 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.590
 then times and as in Finnish or times 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.670
 a turn of five to five meters 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.270
 After the turn it just like 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.140
 because of the loose area without 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.910
 somehow an adjustment phase right in 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.130
 fast area also just the footprint 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.800
 to feel the water there 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.690
 to train and then to 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.420
 I'm still 100 meters loose from swimming 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.370
 So you see it again 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.380
 basic training with a few small ones 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.950
 speed elements in there today 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.650
 focus beinschlag the change is the train 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.110
 very pitched oriented need 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.290
 regular leg impact that you just 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.040
 gets a good water condition and then 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.739
 just to change with ordinary 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.560
 Impulsive schooling can be strenuous exercise 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.430
 to it the sun is gone not so 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.709
 warm in here 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.330
 That's why I'm looking for that 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.670
 Break times really do as they do 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.680
 I do not lose any time on it 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.630
 go into the water your values â€‹â€‹after a few 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.920
 get exercise clips and we 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.920
 see you later again ciao 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Yes 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.430
 third unit in the week so already 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.319
 almost done a weekly job has become 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.040
 Feeling good is getting better and better 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.290
 in shot 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.930
 the feeling comes back the water situation 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.940
 is getting better 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.310
 I'm getting cold now 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.310
 faster my name is shower and stays 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.290
 first half an hour and then 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.019
 home diner 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.739
 I hope it looks the same now 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:25.450
 and in the end that will pay off 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.450
 Let's see you again louder
