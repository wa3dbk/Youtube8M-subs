00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.780
 welcome to 20minutes that could do we will see in this video 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.620
 how to simply reduce power consumption your 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.620
 computer through windows xp functions 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.239
 first I wanted to talk about the 2012 plug-ins 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.460
 and by the waste 2010 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.529
 click on the tab tremblay 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.529
 then on power management 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.589
 once in the food field let's define how windows to 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.020
 manage the power saving of your computer 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.110
 select minimal innovation session more and more great utility 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.110
 of this function 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.820
 now at the activation of the hibernation 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.730
 this just click will be issued abroad then check the box 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.830
 enable hibernation 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.970
 also check that had enough disk space available 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.970
 to enable it 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.580
 back in the game 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.550
 food mission 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.440
 a new option appeared 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.980
 this speeds up the hibernation after a certain 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.540
 period of inactivity 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.640
 selected about 30 minutes 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 then for the setting in effect if selected about 15 minutes 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 for stopping hard drives if the Senegalese 15 minutes 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.620
 then for ministry extension five minutes should be enough 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.750
 in training not that these options in terms of energy saving 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.439
 animal feed management 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.389
 right now allows since 2004 about assets and economy mode 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:12.949
 processor energy 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:16.289
 after the colette flows at amd 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:17.289
 or village 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.659
 chessboard 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.900
 use these operating powers when it is not 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.199
 sought 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.619
 and then relaxed power according to the workload that asked him 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.159
 the gard in terms of energy saving 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.159
 up to more than 100 watts 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.529
 but to put off much of computer equipment such as 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.239
 that screen the hard drives the gap very high and many more 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.599
 equipment without being completely computer 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.599
 it is therefore recommended to use this function only for conventions 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.849
 absence of not more than about 10 minutes 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.849
 because the computer still consumes energy 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.250
 because of longer innocence 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.739
 it is recommended to enable hibernation 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.909
 because at the base of the friends and classic 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.230
 this one can completely turn off the computer and cut 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.339
 his diet 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.669
 while maintaining the state of offices for a dose as it was left 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.769
 for example if a Bordeaux application 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.429
 it was started when hibernation 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:26.909
 this one back to its original state you have to tell them to restart 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.909
 moreover the restart of the computer will be much faster 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.399
 he had been simply stop without 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.399
 go through hibernation 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.189
 a petanque computer is not necessarily in business that does not 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.639
 consume nothing in our case here the computer continues despite everything from 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.019
 keep about 5 watts 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.819
 because the block and power components of the computer are not 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.819
 never completely turned off as the power was not cut off 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.339
 so we are dealing with an outright failure of the wonders 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.069
 these greenhouses to cut off power either through the power strip 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.750
 its pressing the club button power supply usually located 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:07.749
 behind the computer 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.530
 this strong increase in energy and import of energies strongly 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.280
 emitting greenhouse gases it is therefore everyone's duty to 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.669
 implement to reduce the impact of the accident 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.370
 any particular and you park officials and administrators 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.270
 data processing 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.900
 to make every effort to implement the recommendations of 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.949
 sutter thorel 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.759
 thank you and see you soon for new videos on the net that will do
