00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.679
 the largest animal and operates must be 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:14.219
 instead of and yes click tips are up 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.199
 new to the new europe yes you can 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.990
 certainly this very reason in the spot 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.790
 which already have a lot of profi 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.200
 skater no threatened if posted 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.250
 also a right done he was 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.490
 such a cool box here 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.260
 certainly knows so so and there here 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.510
 could blow with it and one 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.390
 there he was posted though 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.910
 I could try to adjust it 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.820
 very professional was about how 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.260
 high because about as high could there 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.500
 I wanted now 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.820
 bullet holes and he tells me the spot 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.430
 we take you away you can not 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 more has the coast but the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.000
 Factor as smart as this capsule 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.320
 Again, my name is jesus smogs 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.090
 Trying out the power is complete 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.370
 differently has found out how the cool 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.260
 he had with the video discs without him 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.930
 receive but the server of the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.300
 Collectively, he himself is guilty of it 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.769
 so how it works so one or 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.650
 team gets back on it 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.549
 I'll show you old cars right away 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.900
 just on it and then you see 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.540
 my bullet holes so in this 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.369
 whole area here is down again 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.450
 not so the plan said you can you 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.650
 can not move a bit 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.760
 can get up because I know jump 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.280
 I have to move a bit, be patient 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.560
 playmate and then you see the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.680
 bullet holes and this area here 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 Can you you that was there you can 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.479
 the benches and zack one dead 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.520
 did you put your trading you see that 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.930
 well then you just think then and then 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.580
 There are thick things here that is 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.290
 if you hurry this is the first one 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.810
 you can win the ts here 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.630
 running up the pack so do a couple 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.060
 seconds at the start 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.840
 I'll show you that, too 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.009
 Unfortunately, bot actually wants to complete 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.500
 simply you do not have to comply anymore 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.670
 so you walk you see you are running and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.470
 then it stays on the hang here 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.110
 Make a job run automatically 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.150
 it's easy to hang and where to go 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.549
 just duck and then come 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.020
 your mate and looking forward to her 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.450
 then only up to there maximum run 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.150
 no further than you are there that's great 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.439
 easy 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.609
 push zack and 1 gb with that is 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.760
 relatively easy I'll show you this 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:27.980
 once you have everything bond the round starts 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.049
 begins the now zack already I'm 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.239
 here and there you were on it and came off 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.920
 and then they get out of there 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.239
 We used to be the last match 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.250
 Do not try it but I can 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.569
 assure that you're up to it all 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.340
 because it is not different 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.750
 At that time, the push sport you put on here 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.189
 This cool box you could do this 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.489
 cool russian team has made year 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:51.340

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.340
