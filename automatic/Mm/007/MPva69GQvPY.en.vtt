Unreal Engine and they may be until we
started<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.610> publicity<00:02:53.880> for<00:02:54.269> UT<00:02:54.600> three<00:02:54.989> maybe

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.140 
started the publicity for UT three maybe
didn't<00:02:56.040> really<00:02:56.250> associate<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.850> two<00:02:57.000> together

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
didn't really associate the two together

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.550 
didn't really associate the two together
because<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.810> wasn't<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.140> their<00:02:58.290> sphere<00:02:58.530> of

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
because it wasn't in their sphere of

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.009 
because it wasn't in their sphere of
influence<00:02:58.769> they<00:02:59.220> may<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.459> console<00:03:00.390> users<00:03:00.810> and

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
influence they may be console users and

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.449 
influence they may be console users and
so<00:03:01.140> they<00:03:01.230> don't<00:03:01.380> care<00:03:01.620> or<00:03:01.769> listen<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.130> games

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
so they don't care or listen to games

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.850 
so they don't care or listen to games
