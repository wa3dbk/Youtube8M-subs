 black colors we can see and also 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.900
 Somali red coloring cooperation 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.550
 red is better with the white model a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.780
 part that still covers it all for 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.410
 there are no major differences 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.870
 as you can see very beautiful we have 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.320
 beautiful effect in the back we have this 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.910
 glitter effect very cute a lot 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.800
 protective among other things I will go to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.890
 see how it works let's go to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.010
 slip it on this side before we push 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.699
 and let's close it as you can see 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.269
 the phone remains well covered all 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.399
 its sides laterally below remains 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.040
 but we still found here 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.440
 cover that goes flush 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.450
 if we open as you can see it is active e 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.410
 ours is activated directly 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.750
 window 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.979
 now let's close it and see what 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.189
 It happens 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.829
 this watch appears we can switch 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.000
 areas laterally and we have the reader 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.920
 musical or we have the weather there 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.140
 like this watch is not a problem 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.049
 we can switch to the standard clock 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.280
 or we have similar quartz we say 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.020
 old watches in various colors such as 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.290
 you can see we have this watch 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.130
 I am the most beautiful of all 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.649
 this one is very elegant or 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.920
 back to the standard clock let's see 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.280
 what happens if we receive a call 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.570
 a second only that we go to register 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.000
 call ok let's go and call us 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.420
 paying close attention to hiding the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.420
 number 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.470
 now the call comes as you can 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.080
 see obviously if you receive the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.110
 call of a friend you may not have 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.820
 the private number you will see the photo 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.960
 what you have and your friend's number 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.870
 up here we can decide to 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.850
 to answer or to close the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.090
 call this way you can't 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.980
 see a lot and very functional as well 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.260
 on the other hand, let's close a moment 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.890
 the call as you have actually seen 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.160
 very very beautiful and functional per se 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.050
 you don't want to open the door for 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.230
 wake it up just double tap and vi 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.150
 will appear at the watch you have chosen 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.950
 this likes this very much 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.600
 even more if you are lovers we say 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.970
 from the back you can use the watch 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.520
 quartz colo cole joe watch 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.940
 choose you always have the option of 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.250
 switch areas from one side to the other 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.020
 and so I go to turn off the display 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.720
 however I repeat cover a lot 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.390
 beautiful original red and black colors 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.380
 find it in our shop a nice record 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.269
 70 was a point at a price really 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.700
 aggressive of 16 euros 90 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.790
 I repeat the product and original in the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.910
 king is not a mockery nor anything for 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.239
 to take it off we say is quite simple 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.269
 I suggest then so sorry I 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.570
 I'm wrong up here 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.730
 I advise you to leverage 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.640
 mostly on this side and go 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.940
 to pick up the phone doing so not 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.610
 you risk of 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.310
 to ruin and then go to extract 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.840
 or do you also derive from this part 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.670
 and go take it out 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.430
 how then do you see the poor but you can 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.620
 really close a lot very nice 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.080
 protective other protective covers that 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.970
 we have are those in tpu that in this one 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.410
 moment I do not have available or 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.650
 the one I'm using in this one 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.800
 moment for practicality and it is a cover 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.040
 stiff that he finds now by making our own 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.710
 shop at 8 euros and 90 is really very much 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.890
 beautiful this is really tailor-made 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.930
 in fact when you go to hook it 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.330
 you have to do a lot of pressure to 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.850
 hook it perfectly now 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.859
 I think I also put it in reverse 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.209
 so I'm a fool ever seen sorry 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.640
 go close it and make a nice one 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.040
 pressure to close it perfectly 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.200
 how you feel it goes to engage and 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.580
 adheres perfectly to the smartphone 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.590
 from this effect 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.260
 we say velvety on the back that 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.420
 also gives an excellent grip 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.350
 as usual both with niall quinn 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.870
 than with sides more than with the rigid cover 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.480
 in free the film now the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.130

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.350

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.690
