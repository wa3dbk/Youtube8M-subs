00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
going to be using the up and down arrows

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.710 
going to be using the up and down arrows
to<00:01:28.020> enter<00:01:28.440> 2<00:01:28.650> 7<00:01:29.280> 8<00:01:29.460> 3<00:01:29.940> as<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.570> done

to enter 2 7 8 3 as we have done

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.250 
to enter 2 7 8 3 as we have done
previously

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
previously

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:39.520 
previously
here<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.800> go<00:01:34.310> 2

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:52.390 

seven<00:01:44.710> eight<00:01:45.710> three<00:01:51.010> now<00:01:52.010> as<00:01:52.160> you<00:01:52.250> can<00:01:52.340> see

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
seven eight three now as you can see

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.090 
seven eight three now as you can see
after<00:01:52.760> purge<00:01:53.390> we've<00:01:53.750> just<00:01:53.960> got<00:01:54.110> zeros<00:01:54.470> now<00:01:54.680> so

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
after purge we've just got zeros now so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.410 
after purge we've just got zeros now so
we<00:01:55.190> know<00:01:55.310> that<00:01:55.340> that's<00:01:55.550> been<00:01:55.729> accepted<00:01:56.300> and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
we know that that's been accepted and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.570 
we know that that's been accepted and
the<00:01:56.990> printer<00:01:57.530> now<00:01:57.650> thinks<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.040> sponge<00:01:58.310> in<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
the printer now thinks the sponge in the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.520 
the printer now thinks the sponge in the
bottom<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.030> printer<00:01:59.450> has<00:01:59.930> been<00:01:59.990> changed

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
bottom of the printer has been changed

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.850 
bottom of the printer has been changed
so<00:02:01.190> we're<00:02:01.340> going<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.490> press<00:02:01.700> stop<00:02:01.970> exit<00:02:02.860> to

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
so we're going to press stop exit to

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.070 
so we're going to press stop exit to
quit<00:02:04.070> this<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.550> now<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:05.630> get<00:02:05.780> out<00:02:05.900> of

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
quit this and now to get out of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.420 
quit this and now to get out of
maintenance<00:02:06.530> mode<00:02:06.710> we're<00:02:07.100> going<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.280> need<00:02:07.369> to

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
maintenance mode we're going to need to

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.300 
maintenance mode we're going to need to
enter<00:02:07.700> nine<00:02:07.940> nine<00:02:08.560> using<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.649> same<00:02:09.890> method

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
enter nine nine using the same method

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:19.990 
enter nine nine using the same method
we've<00:02:10.520> done<00:02:11.090> already<00:02:11.840> nine<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:16.989> nine<00:02:19.000> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
we've done already nine and nine the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.190 
we've done already nine and nine the
printer<00:02:20.270> will<00:02:20.390> now<00:02:20.420> take<00:02:20.540> itself<00:02:20.959> out<00:02:21.140> of

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
printer will now take itself out of

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:30.410 
printer will now take itself out of
maintenance<00:02:21.470> mode

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.060

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
and with the purge counter reset you can

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.280 
and with the purge counter reset you can
now<00:02:33.190> continue<00:02:33.490> printing<00:02:34.000> now<00:02:34.750> it's<00:02:34.900> important

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
now continue printing now it's important

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.320 
now continue printing now it's important
to<00:02:35.380> note<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.620> doing<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.370> reset<00:02:36.730> code<00:02:37.030> won't

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
to note that doing this reset code won't

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.030 
to note that doing this reset code won't
actually<00:02:37.780> remove<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.320> ink<00:02:38.500> from<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.770> bottom

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
actually remove the ink from the bottom

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.840 
actually remove the ink from the bottom
of<00:02:39.160> your<00:02:39.280> printer

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
of your printer

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.030 
of your printer
so<00:02:40.450> that'll<00:02:40.870> need<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.050> be<00:02:41.230> done<00:02:41.380> at<00:02:41.500> some<00:02:41.530> point

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
so that'll need to be done at some point

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.310 
so that'll need to be done at some point
or<00:02:42.250> alternatively<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.810> can<00:02:43.930> always<00:02:44.080> just

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
ink begins to overflow

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.780 
ink begins to overflow
you<00:02:47.080> know<00:02:47.200> it's<00:02:47.350> ink<00:02:47.470> on<00:02:47.590> your<00:02:47.710> prints<00:02:48.070> or<00:02:48.220> even
