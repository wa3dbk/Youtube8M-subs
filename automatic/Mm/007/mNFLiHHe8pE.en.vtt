00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.300
 hello everyone today let's make fake 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.220
 rice three delights and now you will see 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.380
 what do I say false but let's go 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.529
 step by step these are the ingredients 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.290
 that we are going to use 400 grams of 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.030
 vegetables cut me in this case and 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.910
 used ones that had frozen and are 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.270
 red pepper green pepper champignons 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.670
 leek courgette and carrot a little bit 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.750
 of turkey cut two eggs to make 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.699
 a tortilla pepper salt a cauliflower 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.579
 medium our papillote we are going to 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.560
 need what the wok and the spoons and 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.660
 in my case I used peanut oil 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.130
 instead of olive oil but if not 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.230
 you have no problem with that 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.230
 you use the olive oil but the oil 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.940
 of peanut gives it that oriental touch 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.940
 characteristic let's go with the first step 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.320
 as I said the first step is to separate 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.509
 the cauliflower in saplings and in a 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.060
 processor at home chop it until we 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.020
 be a texture as they seem 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.049
 rice granites 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.000
 if you have the thermomix then at speed 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.030
 5 or 6 for 23 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.119
 nothing else is necessary in agreement then to 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.740
 we keep explaining all the cauliflower 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.659
 with the cauliflower already chopped we passed it to 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.490
 papillote with a little salt and pepper 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.470
 and we're going to stuff it in the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.289
 microwave at full power during 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.509
 eight minutes the grace is that we want 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.159
 that is al dente and not pastoso because 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.159
 we want you to simulate rice 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.680
 while our cauliflower finishes 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.750
 To make it we put in the pan the 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.250
 vegetables as they are already frozen not yet 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.500
 I'm going to pour the peanut oil 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.300
 let's wait a little temple that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.280
 At the same time, I'm going to do the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.390
 tortilla for our three false rice 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.100
 delicacies we already have practically the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.690
 vegetables I will add the turkey and 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.550
 we also have the tortilla that later 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.550
 I'll cut and also add to this mix 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.940
 At this point we add the cabbage 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.890
 that we had reserved in the papillote and 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.250
 a tablespoon of oil 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.350
 peanut stir we see already has a pint 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.940
 of rice three delicacies but we still 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.670
 missing a little we will keep moving 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.700
 this idea of replacing rice with 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.520
 chopped cauliflower taught me laura 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.520
 gabriela dÃ¡vila so send a kiss 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.560
 beautiful and many thanks as you can see 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.900
 It added the omelette and we only 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.120
 is to stir a little more and serve 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.710
 you can enjoy this great dish 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.340
 with a little soy and it will be a dish 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.340
 perfect 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.840
 Well, here we have our fake 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.890
 Three delicious rice with a recipe 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:04.020
 satiating easy and very light I hope that 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.020
