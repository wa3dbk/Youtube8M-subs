00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.630 
me that in the next few days and I think
I<00:02:32.959> was<00:02:33.080> out<00:02:33.290> anything<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.040> was<00:02:34.190> interesting

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
I was out anything that was interesting

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.449 
I was out anything that was interesting
that<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:34.819> realize<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.599> she<00:02:36.459> had

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
that I realize is that she had

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.309 
that I realize is that she had
distinctions<00:02:38.030> between<00:02:40.630> paprika<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.019> cayenne

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
distinctions between paprika and cayenne

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.850 
distinctions between paprika and cayenne
Cayenne<00:02:43.069> okay<00:02:43.880> but<00:02:44.239> red<00:02:44.480> pepper<00:02:44.860> inflammation

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
Cayenne okay but red pepper inflammation

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.289 
Cayenne okay but red pepper inflammation
