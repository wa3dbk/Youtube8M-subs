00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.869
 the last place what we try 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.779
 avoiding to the maximum our patients who 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.080
 always a very big invasion and the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.750
 myocardial revascularization surgery 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.029
 that there is an open heart 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.210
 It is an image of respect and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.370
 Extra body movement required 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.010
 we see here a circulation machine 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.260
 extracorporeal, so the whole situation of the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.170
 patient is done and all working is 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.170
 made by this machine without this machine 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.110
 it would not be possible to have surgery 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.850
 of myocardial revascularization 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.219
 I'll go into details of how this 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.469
 machine works but her role is 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.780
 always be keeping the blood in 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.899
 circulation with the heart stopped for 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.159
 surgery then becomes the heart. 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.750
 of this individual and the lung at the same time 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.060
 then she does she deflects blood 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.580
 Venous right to act or armholes 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.979
 a circuit with oxygen to the pain and a 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.250
 pump ferial order to maintain the supply 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.840
 oxygen to the tissues throughout the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.009
 time that his heart was 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.900
 is paralyzed so that the surgeon can 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.460
 make the suture do his surgery with 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.290
 tranquility 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.250
 this takes two three sometimes four 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.009
 areas 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.470
 so we have some examples that the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.689
 called will go to the coronary garden 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.299
 This partner from his garden is 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.570
 here his right coronary as 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.700
 obstruction as we can see and here 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.439
 was placed an ox passes a bridge that 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.710
 a piece of law is taken from that slit 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.439
 in the leg that is stitched there in the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.659
 until after the obstruction the name goes 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.060
 pass the coronary garden 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.350
 then this patient improves greatly with 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.659
 this procedure is this patient already has 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.700
 graft to see this crevice and he has 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.799
 another perception in the descending 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.300
 that has been corrected through a 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.370
 neighborhood passes from a graft of a 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.129
 internal mammary artery 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.250
 this artery arising from the subclavian was 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.280
 then you will start to irrigate not the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.370
 musculature maria marrafa saiga artery 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.260
 coronary artery and it has a very long 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.120
 better does not work much better than 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.450
 a chief of the extinct venous 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.599
 nowadays besides using artery 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.970
 as the arterial option 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.349
 a good arterial option we still have to 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:44.400
 radial artery that it is withdrawn is 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:47.790
 our wrist and is also placed from the garden 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.860
 have another obstructed artery 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.010
 so in this case we have a patient 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.340
 as the saphenous bridge of ideas with a 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.680
 arterial graft of the internal mark and 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:05.280
 a graft of a radial artery there and a 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.380
 vision of true tac in the saphenous vein 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.290
 displayed on the image, this does not 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.690
 can also visualize the graft 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.350
 of the radial artery and a graft of a 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.540
 breast artery one time 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.940
 It is clear that the patient is a 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.769
 female then if this happens 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.290
 a woman much worse than she is going to stay 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.709
 with a scar on his leg a scar 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.560
 on the arm and a scar on the chest 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.459
 this one then took two arteries 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.519
 radial 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.880
 so this is not a wonder to 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.480
 nobody is left with these sequels is the 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.650
 verse of life especially women 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.989
 so this is what I wanted 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.970
 the first step on the 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.400
 coronary artery disease 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.200
 We will do this in one 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.900
 second phase of myocardial 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.900
 myocardial revascularization or reperfusion 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.900
 thank you
