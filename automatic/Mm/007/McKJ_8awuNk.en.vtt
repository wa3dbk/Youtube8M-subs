kind of an interesting problem I just

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.690 
kind of an interesting problem I just
ran<00:00:02.730> into<00:00:02.909> I'll<00:00:03.600> show<00:00:03.810> you<00:00:03.870> how<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.080> fixed<00:00:04.230> it

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:04.700 
ran into I'll show you how I fixed it

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.519 
ran into I'll show you how I fixed it
well<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.790> has<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.089> do<00:00:06.210> with<00:00:06.240> my<00:00:06.480> diesel<00:00:06.960> Caravan

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
well it has to do with my diesel Caravan

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.370 
well it has to do with my diesel Caravan
so<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.189> kind<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.460> an<00:00:08.580> update<00:00:08.910> on<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.380> it's

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
so this is kind of an update on it it's

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.820 
so this is kind of an update on it it's
August<00:00:10.950> 17th<00:00:12.080> 2010<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.410> been<00:00:13.530> four

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
August 17th 2010 and it's been four

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.919 
August 17th 2010 and it's been four
months<00:00:13.860> or<00:00:14.790> more<00:00:14.940> than<00:00:15.089> four<00:00:15.330> months<00:00:15.570> since<00:00:15.780> I

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
months or more than four months since I

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.720 
months or more than four months since I
put<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.289> diesel<00:00:16.740> motor<00:00:16.949> conversion<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.609> it

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
put that diesel motor conversion in it

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.849 
put that diesel motor conversion in it
and<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.270> finally<00:00:18.539> had<00:00:18.779> my<00:00:18.810> very<00:00:19.199> first<00:00:19.560> problem

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
and I finally had my very first problem

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.620 
and I finally had my very first problem
only<00:00:20.310> other<00:00:20.490> thing<00:00:20.699> I'd<00:00:20.820> done<00:00:21.000> was<00:00:21.240> three<00:00:21.480> oil

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
only other thing I'd done was three oil

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.220 
only other thing I'd done was three oil
changes<00:00:22.490> well<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.760> problem<00:00:24.060> was<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:25.050> had<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
changes well this problem was it had a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.830 
changes well this problem was it had a
bad<00:00:25.439> alternator<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.029> got<00:00:27.630> done

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
bad alternator so I just got done

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.810 
bad alternator so I just got done
swapping<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.439> out<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.890> ran<00:00:29.130> into<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.400> unique

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
swapping it out and ran into a unique

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.370 
swapping it out and ran into a unique
problem<00:00:30.090> although<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> new<00:00:31.050> alternator

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
problem although the new alternator

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.389 
problem although the new alternator
works<00:00:31.650> great<00:00:32.300> there's<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.780> VW

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
works great there's that little VW

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.270 
works great there's that little VW
diesel<00:00:35.399> stuffed<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.910> there<00:00:36.180> there's<00:00:36.930> my<00:00:37.280> new

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
diesel stuffed in there there's my new

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
diesel stuffed in there there's my new
shiny<00:00:38.730> rebuilt<00:00:39.239> alternator<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.020> didn't

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
shiny rebuilt alternator that I didn't

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.049 
shiny rebuilt alternator that I didn't
pay<00:00:40.469> nothing<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:40.829> because<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.520> got<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
pay nothing for because I got it from a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.940 
pay nothing for because I got it from a
parts<00:00:42.360> car<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> was<00:00:42.960> only<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.170> couple<00:00:43.440> weeks<00:00:43.559> old

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
parts car it was only a couple weeks old

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.510 
parts car it was only a couple weeks old
and<00:00:44.420> I<00:00:45.420> put<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> vehicle<00:00:46.950> started<00:00:47.399> her

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and I put it in the vehicle started her

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.290 
and I put it in the vehicle started her
up<00:00:48.200> tested<00:00:49.200> my<00:00:49.350> voltage<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.039> voltage<00:00:50.940> was

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
up tested my voltage and voltage was

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.779 
up tested my voltage and voltage was
perfect<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> hopped<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.219> my<00:00:53.250> vehicle<00:00:53.699> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
perfect so I hopped in my vehicle and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.930 
perfect so I hopped in my vehicle and
drove<00:00:54.390> home<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.930> farm<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.850> noticed<00:00:56.850> uh

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
drove home from the farm and noticed uh

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.910 
drove home from the farm and noticed uh
light<00:00:57.719> bit<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.020> rain<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> windshield<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
light bit of rain on the windshield the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.840 
light bit of rain on the windshield the
other<00:00:59.010> day<00:00:59.989> my<00:01:00.989> wipers<00:01:01.410> didn't<00:01:01.649> work<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
other day my wipers didn't work what the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.719 
other day my wipers didn't work what the
hell<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.149> I'd<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.729> well

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
hell but I'd have to do with that well

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.039 
hell but I'd have to do with that well
if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.939> remember<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.299> video<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.659> made<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.930> while

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
if you remember a video I made a while

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.260 
if you remember a video I made a while
back<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:07.650> how<00:01:07.890> alternators<00:01:08.610> work<00:01:08.820> well

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
back about how alternators work well

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.940 
back about how alternators work well
they<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.479> work<00:01:09.659> basically<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.140> same<00:01:10.260> way<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
they all work basically the same way and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010 
they all work basically the same way and
they<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.670> an<00:01:11.880> extra<00:01:12.390> lead<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.810> them

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
they all have an extra lead on them

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020 
they all have an extra lead on them
which<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> small<00:01:14.130> positive<00:01:14.880> lead

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
which is just a small positive lead

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.609 
which is just a small positive lead
that's<00:01:15.270> called<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> exciter<00:01:15.990> wire<00:01:16.229> when<00:01:16.530> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that's called the exciter wire when you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.050 
that's called the exciter wire when you
turn<00:01:16.830> your<00:01:16.950> key<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.549> power<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.909> your

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
turn your key on and power up your

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.870 
turn your key on and power up your
vehicle<00:01:18.770> voltage<00:01:19.770> goes<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.369> small<00:01:20.640> wire

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
vehicle voltage goes to this small wire

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.520 
vehicle voltage goes to this small wire
on<00:01:21.060> your<00:01:21.150> alternator<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> output<00:01:22.290> wire

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
on your alternator not the output wire

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.219 
on your alternator not the output wire
which<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.340> big<00:01:23.580> one<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.970> excites<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
which is the big one and excites the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.350 
which is the big one and excites the
magnet<00:01:26.070> or<00:01:26.340> electromagnet<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
magnet or electromagnet for just a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.310 
magnet or electromagnet for just a
second<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:27.990> starts<00:01:28.200> producing

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
second so it starts producing

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.249 
second so it starts producing
electricity<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.790> my<00:01:29.970> alternator<00:01:30.479> that's

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
electricity so in my alternator that's

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.200 
electricity so in my alternator that's
the<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> big<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the one and this is the big one that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.450 
the one and this is the big one that
goes<00:01:33.360> through<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> battery<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.020> charge<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.460> so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
goes through the battery to charge it so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.880 
goes through the battery to charge it so
it<00:01:35.640> follows<00:01:35.820> around<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:37.710> it's

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it follows around and right now it's

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.460 
it follows around and right now it's
unconnected<00:01:38.729> I'll<00:01:38.909> show<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.150> why<00:01:39.420> well<00:01:40.170> since

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
unconnected I'll show you why well since

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.920 
unconnected I'll show you why well since
this<00:01:40.590> vehicle<00:01:40.799> sort<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.340> redneck<00:01:41.729> wired<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.360> had

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this vehicle sort of redneck wired I had

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.920 
this vehicle sort of redneck wired I had
it<00:01:43.079> wired<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.790> blue<00:01:44.790> wire<00:01:45.030> which<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
it wired to this blue wire which is the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.530 
it wired to this blue wire which is the
constant<00:01:46.470> positive<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.159> goes<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
constant positive that goes to the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.389 
constant positive that goes to the
windshield<00:01:48.930> wiper<00:01:49.110> motor<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.829> parks<00:01:50.220> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
windshield wiper motor that parks it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.999 
windshield wiper motor that parks it
whenever<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.790> turn<00:01:51.329> your<00:01:51.509> wipers<00:01:51.810> off<00:01:52.020> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
whenever you turn your wipers off so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.010 
whenever you turn your wipers off so
that<00:01:53.220> would<00:01:53.369> give<00:01:53.549> me<00:01:53.729> switch<00:01:54.210> positive<00:01:54.840> so

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
that would give me switch positive so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.389 
that would give me switch positive so
that<00:01:55.110> every<00:01:55.290> time<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.530> turn<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> key<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.040> my

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that every time I turn the key on my

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.620 
that every time I turn the key on my
alternator<00:01:56.850> would<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.060> excited<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:59.630> that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
alternator would be excited and that

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.200 
alternator would be excited and that
worked<00:02:00.869> fine<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.549> was<00:02:02.729> here<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.060> this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
worked fine that that was here on this

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.289 
worked fine that that was here on this
alternator<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.649> now<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:04.979> some<00:02:05.189> reason<00:02:05.369> that

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
alternator but now for some reason that

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.749 
alternator but now for some reason that
blew<00:02:06.570> my<00:02:06.780> wiper<00:02:07.110> fuse<00:02:07.530> every<00:02:08.069> time<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.429> put<00:02:08.610> one

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
blew my wiper fuse every time I put one

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.699 
blew my wiper fuse every time I put one
in<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.300> not<00:02:09.450> when<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> car<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:10.020> turned<00:02:10.530> off

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
in but not when the car was turned off

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.320 
in but not when the car was turned off
the<00:02:10.920> wipers<00:02:11.220> work<00:02:11.400> great<00:02:11.610> start<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> car<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the wipers work great start the car the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.760 
the wipers work great start the car the
wiper<00:02:12.569> fuses<00:02:12.930> blow

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
wiper fuses blow

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
wiper fuses blow
every<00:02:13.980> time<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.250> start<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.580> crafter<00:02:14.940> changing

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
every time I start the crafter changing

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.900 
every time I start the crafter changing
the<00:02:15.960> fuse<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:17.070> alternator<00:02:17.430> still<00:02:17.700> worked

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
the fuse the alternator still worked

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.590 
the fuse the alternator still worked
perfect

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600

seven<00:02:20.340> nine<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.810> every<00:02:22.020> time<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.320> started<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
seven nine so every time I started the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.220 
seven nine so every time I started the
vehicle<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.670> sent<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.150> quick<00:02:24.450> pulse<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.960> 12

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
vehicle it sent a quick pulse of 12

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.650 
vehicle it sent a quick pulse of 12
volts<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.790> alternator<00:02:26.790> which<00:02:27.060> excited<00:02:27.450> it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
volts to the alternator which excited it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.510 
volts to the alternator which excited it
then<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.260> kept<00:02:28.470> working<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.250> then<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
then it just kept working but then the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.580 
then it just kept working but then the
circuit<00:02:29.850> would<00:02:29.940> blow<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:31.170> wipers

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
circuit would blow and the wipers

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.900 
circuit would blow and the wipers
wouldn't<00:02:31.890> work<00:02:32.010> these<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.280> fuse<00:02:32.610> would<00:02:32.760> be

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
wouldn't work these a fuse would be

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.810 
wouldn't work these a fuse would be
blown<00:02:33.290> but<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.920> don't<00:02:35.070> need<00:02:35.220> any<00:02:35.370> more<00:02:35.580> power

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
blown but you don't need any more power

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.280 
blown but you don't need any more power
once<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.180> excited<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.780> would<00:02:36.990> just<00:02:37.170> keep

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
once it's excited so it would just keep

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.540 
once it's excited so it would just keep
working<00:02:37.650> as<00:02:37.740> long<00:02:37.890> as<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.100> drove<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.430> vehicle

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
working as long as you drove the vehicle

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.250 
working as long as you drove the vehicle
then<00:02:38.970> next<00:02:39.210> time<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.420> go<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.570> start<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.140> of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
then next time you go to start it you of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.440 
then next time you go to start it you of
course<00:02:40.470> know<00:02:40.740> wipers<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.880> discharging

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
course know wipers and it's discharging

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.840 
course know wipers and it's discharging
so<00:02:43.230> then<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.500> took<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.860> exciter<00:02:44.280> wire<00:02:44.550> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
so then I took that exciter wire and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.580 
so then I took that exciter wire and
touched<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.960> positive<00:02:46.140> what<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
touched it to the positive what the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.830 
touched it to the positive what the
vehicle<00:02:46.740> turned<00:02:47.100> off<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.510> doing

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
vehicle turned off and like this doing

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.810 
vehicle turned off and like this doing
now<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.110> just<00:02:49.320> makes<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.740> tiny<00:02:50.010> spark<00:02:50.400> which<00:02:50.670> is

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
now it just makes a tiny spark which is

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.760 
now it just makes a tiny spark which is
normal<00:02:51.210> but<00:02:51.780> when<00:02:51.960> I<00:02:51.990> started<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> vehicle

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
normal but when I started the vehicle

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.240 
normal but when I started the vehicle
and<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.760> touch<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.180> here<00:02:54.450> makes<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.380> huge<00:02:55.800> spark

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
and I touch it here makes a huge spark

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.790 
and I touch it here makes a huge spark
and<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:57.300> wire<00:02:57.450> gets<00:02:57.660> very<00:02:57.990> hot<00:02:58.290> very<00:02:58.320> quick

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
and the wire gets very hot very quick

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.070 
and the wire gets very hot very quick
you<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.100> let<00:02:59.250> go<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.600> measured

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
you have to let go of it so I measured

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.420 
you have to let go of it so I measured
the<00:03:01.230> voltage<00:03:01.380> it's<00:03:01.800> like<00:03:01.920> there<00:03:02.070> was<00:03:02.190> power

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
the voltage it's like there was power

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.980 
the voltage it's like there was power
coming<00:03:02.790> out<00:03:02.940> here<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.420> measured<00:03:03.780> six

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
coming out here and it measured six

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.530 
coming out here and it measured six
point<00:03:04.260> three<00:03:04.470> eight<00:03:04.500> volts<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.330> this<00:03:06.330> was

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
point three eight volts and this was

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.240 
point three eight volts and this was
trying<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.870> put<00:03:07.050> 12<00:03:07.320> volts<00:03:07.590> into<00:03:07.740> it<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
trying to put 12 volts into it and the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.610 
trying to put 12 volts into it and the
two<00:03:08.400> voltages<00:03:08.820> were<00:03:08.970> interfering<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.810> that

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
two voltages were interfering and that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.170 
two voltages were interfering and that
was<00:03:10.800> cooking<00:03:11.190> something<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.790> knew<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.060> with

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
was cooking something so I knew it with

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.430 
was cooking something so I knew it with
I<00:03:12.300> would<00:03:12.480> have<00:03:12.600> left<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.900> connected<00:03:13.260> directly

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
I would have left it connected directly

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.680 
I would have left it connected directly
probably<00:03:14.160> would<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.370> fried<00:03:14.580> something<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
probably would have fried something the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.360 
probably would have fried something the
changed<00:03:16.050> if<00:03:16.140> used<00:03:16.380> for<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.620> wipers<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.280> then

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
changed if used for the wipers and then

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.190 
changed if used for the wipers and then
they<00:03:17.520> just<00:03:17.760> kept<00:03:18.000> working<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:18.630> long<00:03:18.780> as<00:03:18.990> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
they just kept working so long as the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.500 
they just kept working so long as the
exciter<00:03:19.530> wire<00:03:19.740> wasn't<00:03:20.130> connected<00:03:20.520> there<00:03:20.700> well

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
exciter wire wasn't connected there well

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.449 
exciter wire wasn't connected there well
as<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.780> may<00:03:21.959> know<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.230> can<00:03:22.590> fix<00:03:22.800> anything<00:03:23.010> to

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
as you may know I can fix anything to

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.150 
as you may know I can fix anything to

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
cut mechanical electronical diesel

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.130 
cut mechanical electronical diesel
refrigeration<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.360> doesn't<00:03:27.690> matter<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.110> I

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
refrigeration it doesn't matter and I

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.010 
refrigeration it doesn't matter and I
used<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.440> be<00:03:28.590> also<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.310> TV<00:03:29.580> technician<00:03:30.360> though

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
used to be also a TV technician though

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.290 
used to be also a TV technician though
I've<00:03:31.230> still<00:03:31.530> got<00:03:31.709> TVs<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.400> TV<00:03:32.760> parts<00:03:33.120> thing

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
I've still got TVs and TV parts thing

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.330 
I've still got TVs and TV parts thing
around<00:03:33.570> because<00:03:33.810> I'm<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> hoarder<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:35.310> I

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
around because I'm a hoarder so I

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.610 
around because I'm a hoarder so I
thought<00:03:35.640> maybe<00:03:35.880> if<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.209> pull<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.510> power<00:03:37.350> supply

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
thought maybe if I pull a power supply

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.370 
thought maybe if I pull a power supply
diode<00:03:38.250> out<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:38.940> hooked<00:03:39.270> that<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.690> my<00:03:39.870> circuit

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
diode out and hooked that to my circuit

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.980 
diode out and hooked that to my circuit
it<00:03:41.310> wouldn't<00:03:41.610> cause<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.820> two<00:03:42.480> voltages<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
it wouldn't cause the two voltages to

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.780 
it wouldn't cause the two voltages to
interfere<00:03:43.620> because<00:03:43.800> a<00:03:43.980> diode<00:03:44.340> only<00:03:44.430> allows

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
interfere because a diode only allows

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.940 
interfere because a diode only allows
electricity<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.420> flow<00:03:45.450> one<00:03:45.840> way<00:03:46.050> but<00:03:46.770> that

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
electricity to flow one way but that

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.220 
electricity to flow one way but that
didn't<00:03:47.280> work<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:48.090> one<00:03:48.300> way<00:03:48.510> when<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.990> biased

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
didn't work the one way when you biased

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.080 
didn't work the one way when you biased
it<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.740> didn't<00:03:50.040> allow<00:03:50.190> enough<00:03:50.520> voltage<00:03:50.820> true

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
it it didn't allow enough voltage true

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.460 
it it didn't allow enough voltage true
to<00:03:51.240> excite<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.660> alternator<00:03:52.020> when<00:03:52.350> you

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
to excite the alternator when you

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.930 
to excite the alternator when you
flipped<00:03:52.740> it<00:03:52.860> over<00:03:53.160> because<00:03:53.310> they<00:03:53.610> work<00:03:53.760> like

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
flipped it over because they work like

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.360 
flipped it over because they work like
one-way<00:03:54.180> valves<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:55.740> worked<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.160> like<00:03:56.250> a

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
one-way valves it worked just like a

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.949 
one-way valves it worked just like a
piece<00:03:56.640> of<00:03:56.790> wire<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.270> allowed<00:03:57.450> all<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.780> power

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
piece of wire and allowed all the power

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.420 
piece of wire and allowed all the power
to<00:03:58.080> go<00:03:58.200> through<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.680> immediately<00:03:58.830> got<00:03:59.160> so

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
to go through and it immediately got so

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.330 
to go through and it immediately got so
hot<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.820> burned<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.209> out<00:04:00.830> screw<00:04:01.830> that

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
hot it burned it out screw that

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.210 
hot it burned it out screw that
so<00:04:02.880> then<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.150> took<00:04:03.209> out<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> 1001<00:04:04.500> resistor<00:04:05.010> and

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
so then I took out a 1001 resistor and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.760 
so then I took out a 1001 resistor and
put<00:04:05.730> that<00:04:05.850> in<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.150> circuit<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.290> positive

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
put that in a circuit to the positive

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.470 
put that in a circuit to the positive
well<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.430> didn't<00:04:08.670> allow<00:04:08.760> enough<00:04:09.120> voltage

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
well that didn't allow enough voltage

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.420 
well that didn't allow enough voltage
through<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.200> didn't<00:04:10.530> fire<00:04:11.160> up<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
through so it didn't fire up the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.820 
through so it didn't fire up the
alternator<00:04:11.959> so<00:04:12.959> then<00:04:13.110> I<00:04:13.200> took<00:04:13.260> out<00:04:13.560> another

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
alternator so then I took out another

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.620 
alternator so then I took out another
resistor<00:04:14.430> from<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.790> power<00:04:14.970> supply<00:04:15.150> area

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
resistor from the power supply area

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.530 
resistor from the power supply area
which<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:15.930> 10<00:04:16.260> ohms<00:04:16.470> tried<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.549> well<00:04:18.510> that

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
which is 10 ohms tried that well that

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.240 
which is 10 ohms tried that well that
seemed<00:04:19.080> to<00:04:19.200> make<00:04:19.320> everything<00:04:19.620> work<00:04:19.950> with<00:04:20.160> the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
seemed to make everything work with the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.460 
seemed to make everything work with the
resistor<00:04:20.669> sure<00:04:21.030> got<00:04:21.390> hot<00:04:21.660> after<00:04:22.020> running<00:04:22.229> for

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
resistor sure got hot after running for

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.870 
resistor sure got hot after running for
a<00:04:22.560> while<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.040> knew<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.430> wouldn't<00:04:23.640> last

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
a while so I knew that wouldn't last

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.880 
a while so I knew that wouldn't last
long<00:04:24.060> well<00:04:24.960> there's<00:04:25.260> another<00:04:25.500> kind<00:04:25.770> of

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
long well there's another kind of

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.530 
long well there's another kind of
resistor<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.520> was<00:04:26.640> right<00:04:26.820> in<00:04:26.850> that<00:04:26.970> circuit

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
resistor that was right in that circuit

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.620 
resistor that was right in that circuit
right<00:04:27.900> there<00:04:28.880> it's<00:04:29.880> called<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.210> thermistor

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
right there it's called a thermistor

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.140 
right there it's called a thermistor
that<00:04:31.470> means<00:04:31.680> when<00:04:31.950> it<00:04:32.070> gets<00:04:32.250> hot<00:04:32.460> it<00:04:32.640> loses<00:04:33.000> its

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
that means when it gets hot it loses its

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.600 
that means when it gets hot it loses its
conduct<00:04:33.540> conductivity<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.650> has<00:04:35.370> more

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
conduct conductivity and has more

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.250 
conduct conductivity and has more
resistance<00:04:35.760> when<00:04:36.240> it's<00:04:36.360> cold<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.810> has<00:04:36.990> almost

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
resistance when it's cold it has almost

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.590 
resistance when it's cold it has almost
no<00:04:37.380> resistance<00:04:38.010> where<00:04:38.490> they're<00:04:38.700> used<00:04:39.030> for<00:04:39.240> on

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
no resistance where they're used for on

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.690 
no resistance where they're used for on

steel grid that aligns all the colors so
I've<00:05:05.310> got<00:05:05.520> my<00:05:05.700> two<00:05:05.760> test<00:05:06.330> lead<00:05:06.570> probes<00:05:06.960> on<00:05:07.200> it

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
I've got my two test lead probes on it

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.770 
I've got my two test lead probes on it
right<00:05:07.500> now<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.920> it's<00:05:08.760> showing<00:05:09.030> ten<00:05:09.450> point

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
right now and it's showing ten point

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.470 
right now and it's showing ten point
three<00:05:10.020> ohms<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:11.430> now<00:05:11.610> my<00:05:11.790> exciter<00:05:12.180> wires

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
three ohms so now my exciter wires

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.500 
three ohms so now my exciter wires
hooked<00:05:13.290> to<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:13.790> varistor<00:05:14.790> and<00:05:17.240> they<00:05:18.240> touch

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
hooked to that varistor and they touch

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.990 
hooked to that varistor and they touch
it<00:05:18.690> here<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.890> can<00:05:19.920> hear<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.430> it's<00:05:20.580> sending<00:05:20.940> a

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
it here you can hear that it's sending a

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.990 
it here you can hear that it's sending a
little<00:05:21.150> bit<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.480> power<00:05:21.690> to<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.590> alternator<00:05:23.040> so

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
little bit of power to the alternator so

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.270 
little bit of power to the alternator so
now<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.210> vehicle<00:05:24.510> is<00:05:24.840> running<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:26.130> the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
now the vehicle is running and the

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.120 
now the vehicle is running and the
voltage<00:05:26.640> is<00:05:26.820> twelve<00:05:27.120> point<00:05:27.330> seven<00:05:27.630> eight

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.159 

there's<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:33.850> exciter<00:05:34.270> wire

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
there's the exciter wire

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.070 
there's the exciter wire

positive

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.810 
positive
and<00:05:41.540> here<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:41.780> slight<00:05:42.050> change<00:05:42.320> in<00:05:42.500> rpm<00:05:43.250> of

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
and here a slight change in rpm of

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.779 
and here a slight change in rpm of
course<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.210> voltage<00:05:44.510> is<00:05:44.630> rising<00:05:45.080> now

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
course the voltage is rising now

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.749 
course the voltage is rising now
now<00:05:47.210> if<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.449> leave<00:05:47.659> it<00:05:47.689> connected<00:05:48.289> there<00:05:48.759> it

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
now if I leave it connected there it

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.439 
now if I leave it connected there it
doesn't<00:05:50.300> even<00:05:50.360> make<00:05:50.599> any<00:05:50.809> difference

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
doesn't even make any difference

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:53.999 
doesn't even make any difference
but<00:05:52.990> of<00:05:53.110> course<00:05:53.139> things<00:05:53.559> that<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:53.740> want<00:05:53.949> to

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
but of course things that I want to

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.309 
but of course things that I want to
leave<00:05:54.159> this<00:05:54.340> in<00:05:54.639> circuit

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.059 

when<00:05:57.529> I'm<00:05:57.649> using<00:05:57.830> my<00:05:58.129> vehicle<00:05:59.349> so<00:06:00.349> now<00:06:00.529> it's<00:06:00.770> in

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
when I'm using my vehicle so now it's in

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.999 
when I'm using my vehicle so now it's in
circuit<00:06:01.580> on<00:06:01.759> that<00:06:02.029> park<00:06:02.330> wire<00:06:02.710> which<00:06:03.710> is<00:06:03.740> on

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
circuit on that park wire which is on

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.100 
circuit on that park wire which is on
the<00:06:04.129> wiper<00:06:04.309> motor<00:06:04.490> and<00:06:05.149> now<00:06:05.300> it's<00:06:05.479> warming<00:06:05.930> up

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
the wiper motor and now it's warming up

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.379 
the wiper motor and now it's warming up
now<00:06:06.529> let's<00:06:06.770> go<00:06:06.949> either<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.729> lifting<00:06:08.180> for<00:06:08.330> the

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
now let's go either the lifting for the

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.629 
now let's go either the lifting for the
moment

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
moment

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.459 
moment
so<00:06:11.180> I'll<00:06:11.300> turn<00:06:11.539> the<00:06:11.659> vehicle<00:06:11.810> off<00:06:12.169> and<00:06:12.379> we'll

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
so I'll turn the vehicle off and we'll

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:14.909 
so I'll turn the vehicle off and we'll
check<00:06:12.710> now<00:06:13.310> if<00:06:13.460> I<00:06:13.550> touch<00:06:13.789> it<00:06:13.819> it's<00:06:14.120> pretty<00:06:14.389> hot

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
check now if I touch it it's pretty hot

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.260 
check now if I touch it it's pretty hot
but<00:06:15.919> I<00:06:15.979> bet<00:06:16.189> you<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:16.400> resistance<00:06:16.909> is<00:06:17.030> quite

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
but I bet you the resistance is quite

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.439 
but I bet you the resistance is quite
different<00:06:17.509> we'll<00:06:18.020> test<00:06:18.319> well

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
different we'll test well

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.170 
different we'll test well
the<00:06:20.449> resistance<00:06:20.979> did<00:06:21.979> start<00:06:22.310> off<00:06:22.430> at<00:06:22.610> like<00:06:22.759> 48

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
the resistance did start off at like 48

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.360 
the resistance did start off at like 48
but<00:06:23.569> now<00:06:23.689> as<00:06:23.900> it's<00:06:24.080> cooling<00:06:24.349> the<00:06:24.949> resistance

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
but now as it's cooling the resistance

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.879 
but now as it's cooling the resistance
is<00:06:25.460> becoming<00:06:25.789> lower<00:06:26.060> again<00:06:26.500> so<00:06:27.500> that<00:06:27.680> works

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889 
is becoming lower again so that works

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.800 
is becoming lower again so that works
out<00:06:28.069> perfect<00:06:28.520> for<00:06:28.550> me<00:06:28.849> I<00:06:29.000> don't<00:06:29.120> have<00:06:29.419> to<00:06:29.629> put

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
out perfect for me I don't have to put

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.809 
out perfect for me I don't have to put
another<00:06:29.900> alternator<00:06:30.620> in<00:06:30.860> and<00:06:31.400> actually<00:06:31.699> have

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:31.819 
another alternator in and actually have

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.339 
another alternator in and actually have
to<00:06:31.939> spend<00:06:32.210> some<00:06:32.389> money<00:06:32.509> because<00:06:32.840> I<00:06:32.930> got<00:06:33.169> this

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
to spend some money because I got this

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:35.950 
to spend some money because I got this
one<00:06:33.560> for<00:06:33.740> free<00:06:33.889> and<00:06:34.159> it<00:06:34.219> is<00:06:34.250> rebuilt<00:06:34.789> so<00:06:35.780> every

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
one for free and it is rebuilt so every

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.600 
one for free and it is rebuilt so every
time<00:06:36.110> I<00:06:36.139> start<00:06:36.469> the<00:06:36.560> vehicle<00:06:36.919> I<00:06:37.069> get<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:37.400> full

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
time I start the vehicle I get the full

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.459 
time I start the vehicle I get the full
12-volt<00:06:38.150> pulse<00:06:38.389> or<00:06:38.659> almost<00:06:39.020> that<00:06:39.199> to<00:06:39.379> the

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:39.469 
12-volt pulse or almost that to the

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:41.379 
12-volt pulse or almost that to the
alternator<00:06:39.800> and<00:06:39.860> it<00:06:40.069> fires<00:06:40.310> it<00:06:40.490> rate<00:06:40.669> up<00:06:40.849> and

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
alternator and it fires it rate up and

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.909 
alternator and it fires it rate up and
then<00:06:41.689> it<00:06:41.840> immediately<00:06:42.050> starts<00:06:42.590> to<00:06:42.710> heat<00:06:42.889> up

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
then it immediately starts to heat up

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.010 
then it immediately starts to heat up
and<00:06:43.340> what's<00:06:43.789> the<00:06:44.029> resistance<00:06:44.300> actually<00:06:44.870> when

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
and what's the resistance actually when

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.749 
and what's the resistance actually when
I<00:06:45.050> tested<00:06:45.409> it<00:06:45.469> earlier<00:06:45.770> it<00:06:45.860> gets<00:06:46.039> up<00:06:46.219> to<00:06:46.370> 90

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
I tested it earlier it gets up to 90

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.629 
I tested it earlier it gets up to 90
homes<00:06:47.389> resistance<00:06:48.139> so<00:06:49.129> now<00:06:49.279> it's<00:06:49.460> no<00:06:49.610> longer

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
homes resistance so now it's no longer

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.029 
homes resistance so now it's no longer
showing<00:06:50.180> anything<00:06:50.599> out<00:06:50.930> which<00:06:51.590> won't<00:06:51.800> damage

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 
showing anything out which won't damage

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:53.740 
showing anything out which won't damage
the<00:06:52.129> alternator<00:06:52.550> won't<00:06:52.849> blow<00:06:53.029> any<00:06:53.150> fuses<00:06:53.599> and

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
the alternator won't blow any fuses and

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.409 
the alternator won't blow any fuses and
I<00:06:53.840> can<00:06:54.020> leave<00:06:54.139> it<00:06:54.289> connected<00:06:54.439> to<00:06:54.949> my<00:06:55.669> park

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
I can leave it connected to my park

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.959 
I can leave it connected to my park
system<00:06:56.840> for<00:06:57.379> the<00:06:57.469> wipers<00:06:57.830> and<00:06:58.250> everything's

00:06:58.959 --> 00:06:58.969 
system for the wipers and everything's

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:59.830 
system for the wipers and everything's
back<00:06:59.150> to<00:06:59.180> normal

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
back to normal

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.409 
back to normal
sweet<00:07:00.520> so<00:07:01.520> now<00:07:01.699> I'll<00:07:01.849> just<00:07:01.879> leave<00:07:02.270> it

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
sweet so now I'll just leave it

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:05.110 
sweet so now I'll just leave it
connected<00:07:02.539> forever<00:07:03.139> and<00:07:03.409> problem<00:07:04.189> solved<00:07:04.610> and

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
connected forever and problem solved and
