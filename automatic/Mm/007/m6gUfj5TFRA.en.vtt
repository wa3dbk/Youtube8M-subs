 fall on background 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.659
 but in general, I heard that for example 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.999
 alone with cats or search ready game 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.759
 it is better not to leave them antes yes they are very 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:22.979
 love the cult of cats and so on basically 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.649
 with a few grows up specifically this they 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.689
 perceived as family members and yes if 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.539
 some kind of immediate cat well your 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.979
 sad not even hunters hunters but 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.319
 despite this to people they are very 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.240
 positive about them no aggression at all 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.859

 used as a nanny directly 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:52.740
 I think they were attached to narts but 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.380
 this is not and ride it too much 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.300

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.410
 how to shoot 4 dogs with news 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.910

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.810
 played a man in front of you 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.580
 I see strong strong healthy such but 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.200
 In general, I understand that they already 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.420
 here came up with shedding wool or 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.430
 no because if where they live 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.780
 there is always cold not adapted 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.810
 gradually, that is, they are not immediately 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.820

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.950
 north america through alaska gradually 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.540
 natural adapted in the summer as they 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.540
 were heavy so they walked for a long time 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.250
 photo shoots probably your dog 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.240
 plot because I saw somewhere 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.780
 Yaroslavl poster in my opinion beautiful 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.000
 Husky dog 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.650
 there is such a thing to have we participate 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 active photo shoots and in principle 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.690

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.150
 shout it with on posters my journal here 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.320
 this is a star family for whom they fear 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.390
 they are afraid as you can see absolutely 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:04.150
 calm themselves are not torn anywhere 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:07.000
 you sit like that at all be like they live 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.500
 in the simple in the world let's say it does 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.780
 ideal to keep large aviaries 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.900
 chord they will run necessary 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.250
 run and doggy still published 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.170
 throw out energy in their apartment 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.360
 hard in the apartment can be kept at 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.130
 Provided if people are athletes 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.690
 ready to run the dog either let's say 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.850
 many walk order there three four 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.130
 hours and the second point is correct 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.600
 parenting as much energy if not 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.720
 will you and throw out the right track 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.940
 she will fall into the unnecessary homeless them better 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.770
 do not leave if you bring up 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.780
 I love a dog, you can bring up 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.660
 many hold apartments but as I understand it 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.750
 what if as we watched today there is 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.850
 an umbrella yes some exercises here if 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.580
 started a husky then you want you don't want to charge 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.320
 Boo charge in the morning comes out 6 am and run 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.100
 to the TV channel for example from husky 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.180
 you tie yogi to the porch you go 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.819
 transfer then back 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.290
 I think it will definitely change at 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.879
 the better 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.950
 forget about computers will be more on 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.250

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:15.500
 live let out and they run for everything 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.350

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.039
 are brought in but you are a dog breeder or 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.560

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:26.810
 well i have a ride for some 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.820

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.410

 Russia here they are content for example 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.169
 more expensive than there is something basically a dog is not 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.500
 cheap ie cost is indecent 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.860
 go off and on nutrition someone will come 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.349

 the planets to understand some things yes 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.440
 that is, it is necessary to budget option 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.139
 to be prepared not only to 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.490

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.509
 Deal those dogs who live for a gift 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.630
 houses of mine can't because them 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.490
 defined as

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.420
 snow 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.860
 the first with him was not happy they sleep 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.370
 the book is strange that they are warm 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.420
 hooters

 they fall asleep pouring snow and actually 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.310
 there you have to get up some kind of there so 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.410
 there in the winter there is a bathhouse before we rise 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.850

 We buy now, that is, they cost a bath 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.980
 they have a shower aviary so decision 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.560
 mortgage problems 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.570

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.810
 mortgage of apartments housing 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.850
 generally great to be honest when dogs 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.970
 came on the air I was really afraid because 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:54.840
