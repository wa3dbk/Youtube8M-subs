00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.730
 when it comes to fast food there are 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.269
 many myths 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.509
 So let's go in Brazil, 90% of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.690
 population does not eat the recommended dose of 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.769
 vegetables fruits and vegetables per day 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.830
 The truth is that Brazilians eat less 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.640
 grams of fruit vegetables by 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.699
 day 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.529
 much lower than recommended with it 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.829
 is more likely to have a series of 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.000
 diseases such as obesity and hypertension 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.879
 asthma 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.360
 now our second great myth about faith 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.450
 diet coolant can be taken at 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.469
 No, they do not have sugar. 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.239
 truth or lie lie the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.969
 eads soft drinks in addition to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.879
 preservatives and additives used therein. 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.910
 contains large amount of sodium 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.260
 Believe me if you want but a can is 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.629
 full of salt 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.930
 excess sodium can raise blood pressure 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.130
 and overload the kidneys 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.510
 even so more than 70% of Brazilians 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.049
 consume more sodium than is tolerated 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.390
 by the body then attention in galera and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.380
 refrigerant even from the ti area does not 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.439
 can be taken at will and now ours 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.320
 first great myth about fast food the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.030
 Facebook has the same impact on the liver 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.020
 that a hepatitis 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.210
 truth or true lie that's right 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.000
 American studies show that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.479
 eating fast food can regularly 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.590
 cause serious damage to the liver as a 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.990
 hepatitis 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.750
 puhdys feet besides salt and fat 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.329
 Use sugar to make that crunchy 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.299
 browned on that list is crisp 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.240
 the biggest villain followed by the fried chicken and 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.659
 those onion rings then 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.659
 call 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.860
 today I 'm preparing the bugs of 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.820
 chicken with super-specialty ingredients 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.680
 consist of buffalo tomato mince 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.290
 basil a salad to garnish 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.670
 integral that even those people who 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.710
 cracked in fast food will not 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.950
 resist the people now will ride the 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.470
 hamburger beat 80 grams of chicken 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.830
 ground a tablespoon of onion 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.070
 grated one teaspoon of garlic one 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.680
 There's a dash of oregano there with you, right? 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.700
 the amount the jump is also the minimum 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.550
 possible and a little bit of pepper in 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.040
 which can be milled between the pain 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.310
 pepper has capsaicin which is a 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.430
 highly anti oxidant substance that 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.640
 is currently being super-spoken in the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.290
 Most of the studies that are done 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.180
 cancer prevention 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:08.910
 whole wheat flour just for people 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:12.470
 as little as possible a teaspoon use 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.800
 a cumbuca to cut the hamburger 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.250
 right 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:21.540
 the garlic is the family of onion and 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.140
 also has antioxidant substances 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.080
 the chicken meat I suggest to you 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.850
 buy ground chicken breast because 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.150
 many chicken burgers that 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.570
 people buying frozen are not made 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.370
 chicken breast to abuse them 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.720
 garlic tomato because it is precisely 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.930
 which has fiber and that will promote 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.050
 society 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.720
 the hamburger already tattooed state 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.330
 we'll see if the bread tapas while 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.510
 may be a little bit more now I 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.480
 I will put over hamburger 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.570
 buffalo mozzarella with her own 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.570
 Heat the hamburger it will melt 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.690
 here is beet and tomato lettuce in 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.750
 that just to spice up the deal who 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.310
 You are wanting to lose weight using this without 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.949
 olive oil now whoever 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.859
 concerned only to make a transformation 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:24.889
 your food and do not have the 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.500
 balance concerns what's left over 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.540
 tasty because after all to 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.919
 compete with offers theft in which 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.060
 delicious, right 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:39.370
 So what's hotter and you? 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:43.370
 this season in the fascination that will 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.360
 to decorate the dish is to temper it with the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.419
 green to be able to compete with a flavor 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.470
 anyone who is accustomed to fast food does not 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:57.080
 I want to give it up, I already made the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.970
 gay bread ideal is it to be bread 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.740
 100% full 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.650
 now we put a little bit of 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.639
 beet the beet does not need to 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:11.229
 I like sweet milk because his case is 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:16.660
 tasty even without olive oil 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.660
 Now we'll get the hamburgers. 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.669
 places 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.749
 the top of each slice of bread and for 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.069
 last 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:31.519
 You decorate with the cherry tomato 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:34.809
 which is already pre-tempered with 

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:34.809
 magical olive oil
