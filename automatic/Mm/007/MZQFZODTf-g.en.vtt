welcome back Wolfpack ver Lasserre and

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.980 
welcome back Wolfpack ver Lasserre and
this<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:01.770> how<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.010> use<00:00:02.220> Leafeon<00:00:02.879> after<00:00:03.480> going

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
this is how to use Leafeon after going

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.240 
this is how to use Leafeon after going
through<00:00:04.140> some<00:00:04.319> Leafeon<00:00:04.589> strategies<00:00:05.069> and

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
through some Leafeon strategies and

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.260 
through some Leafeon strategies and
coming<00:00:05.490> up<00:00:05.580> with<00:00:05.700> ideas

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
coming up with ideas

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.990 
coming up with ideas
I<00:00:06.299> don't<00:00:06.720> think<00:00:06.839> Leafeon<00:00:07.340> is<00:00:08.340> played<00:00:08.700> enough

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
I don't think Leafeon is played enough

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.400 
I don't think Leafeon is played enough
that<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.300> think<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:09.719> should<00:00:09.870> be<00:00:09.929> used<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.230> bit

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
that I think it should be used a bit

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.749 
that I think it should be used a bit
more<00:00:10.440> compared<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.010> what's<00:00:11.190> being<00:00:11.370> currently

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
more compared to what's being currently

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.549 
more compared to what's being currently
used<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.150> when<00:00:12.570> we<00:00:12.660> look<00:00:12.870> at<00:00:12.929> stats<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.469> know

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
used that when we look at stats you know

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.369 
used that when we look at stats you know
it<00:00:13.650> has<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> 110<00:00:14.639> attack<00:00:14.910> with<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> 95<00:00:16.049> speed

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
it has a 110 attack with a 95 speed

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.810 
it has a 110 attack with a 95 speed
that's<00:00:16.590> better<00:00:17.010> than<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> lot<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.430> Pokemon

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
that's better than a lot of Pokemon

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.040 
that's better than a lot of Pokemon
we've<00:00:17.970> seen<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.480> point<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.960> I've

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
we've seen up to this point that I've

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.779 
we've seen up to this point that I've
tried<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.260> pass<00:00:19.500> off<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.740> sweepers<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.400> you

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
tried to pass off the sweepers and you

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.580 
tried to pass off the sweepers and you
have<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> 130<00:00:21.630> defense<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.199> give<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.410> some

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
have a 130 defense to give you some

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.099 
have a 130 defense to give you some
natural<00:00:22.890> bulk<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.310> well<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.000> also<00:00:24.600> Leafeon

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
natural bulk as well and also Leafeon

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.480 
natural bulk as well and also Leafeon
has<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> lot<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.650> other<00:00:25.800> things<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.279> sleeve

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
has a lot of other things up and sleeve

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.040 
has a lot of other things up and sleeve
that<00:00:26.640> make<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.970> work<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.390> think<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
that make it work I think that the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.359 
that make it work I think that the
biggest<00:00:28.289> thing<00:00:28.470> holding<00:00:28.800> Leafeon<00:00:29.130> back

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
biggest thing holding Leafeon back

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.700 
biggest thing holding Leafeon back
though<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:30.060> typing<00:00:30.660> unfortunately<00:00:31.590> it's

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
though is it's typing unfortunately it's

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.650 
though is it's typing unfortunately it's
a<00:00:31.800> pure<00:00:32.009> grass<00:00:32.250> type<00:00:32.520> which<00:00:32.969> gives<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> lot

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
a pure grass type which gives you a lot

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.240 
a pure grass type which gives you a lot
of<00:00:33.809> weaknesses<00:00:33.960> which<00:00:34.410> makes<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.710> hard<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.130> be

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of weaknesses which makes it hard to be

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.340 
of weaknesses which makes it hard to be
kind<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.700> speedy<00:00:36.540> kind<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.930> ball<00:00:37.110> or

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
kind of like a speedy kind of ball or

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.440 
kind of like a speedy kind of ball or
mix<00:00:37.710> bulky<00:00:38.129> sweeper<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> try

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
mix bulky sweeper that I'm going to try

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.260 
mix bulky sweeper that I'm going to try
to<00:00:39.510> make<00:00:39.719> Leafeon<00:00:40.050> into<00:00:40.469> later<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.000> hard

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to make Leafeon into later so it is hard

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
to make Leafeon into later so it is hard
on<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> lot<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.379> fairly

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
on that that you have a lot of fairly

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.400 
on that that you have a lot of fairly
common<00:00:44.190> weaknesses<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.760> well<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.629> overall

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
common weaknesses as well and overall

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
common weaknesses as well and overall
your<00:00:46.649> stab<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.399> resisted<00:00:47.910> by<00:00:48.030> quite<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
your stab you get resisted by quite a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.060 
your stab you get resisted by quite a
bit<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.809> hit<00:00:48.989> rock<00:00:49.260> water<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> ground

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
bit you do hit rock water and ground

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.400 
bit you do hit rock water and ground
super<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:51.059> overall<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.110> kind

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
super but overall it's going to be kind

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.479 
super but overall it's going to be kind
of<00:00:52.440> tough<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.800> make<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.070> work

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
of tough to make it work

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.549 
of tough to make it work
hopping<00:00:54.210> into<00:00:54.329> Pokemon<00:00:54.870> showdown<00:00:54.899> though<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
hopping into Pokemon showdown though I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.189 
hopping into Pokemon showdown though I
think<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.920> Leafeon<00:00:56.370> had<00:00:56.789> some<00:00:57.199> incredibly

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
think that Leafeon had some incredibly

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.139 
think that Leafeon had some incredibly
strong<00:00:58.920> potential<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.489> if<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.730> look<00:00:59.879> at<00:01:00.030> it

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
strong potential that if we look at it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.389 
strong potential that if we look at it
my<00:01:00.600> idea<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.289> chlorophyll<00:01:01.800> sweeper<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
my idea here is chlorophyll sweeper that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.009 
my idea here is chlorophyll sweeper that
you<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.940> dedicate<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.480> good<00:01:03.750> amount<00:01:03.899> of

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you do have to dedicate a good amount of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899 
you do have to dedicate a good amount of
resources<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.530> making<00:01:04.830> Leafeon<00:01:05.129> work<00:01:05.369> once

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
resources to making Leafeon work once

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.670 
resources to making Leafeon work once
you<00:01:06.000> get<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.240> set<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.350> pretty<00:01:07.590> much

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
you get it set up you can pretty much

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.130 
you get it set up you can pretty much
into<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.189> opponent's<00:01:08.610> day<00:01:09.140> relatively

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
into your opponent's day relatively

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
into your opponent's day relatively
easily<00:01:10.290> by<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.010> bringing<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.580> Leafeon<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
easily by just bringing out Leafeon that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.330 
easily by just bringing out Leafeon that
what<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.720> thinking<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.010> set<00:01:14.310> up

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
what I was thinking is that you set up

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.770 
what I was thinking is that you set up
chlorophyll<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.180> some<00:01:15.390> Pokemon<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
chlorophyll you know some Pokemon a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
chlorophyll you know some Pokemon a
sunny<00:01:16.049> day<00:01:16.290> or<00:01:16.320> drought<00:01:16.830> ability<00:01:17.250> give<00:01:17.670> them<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
sunny day or drought ability give them a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.190 
sunny day or drought ability give them a
heat<00:01:18.060> rock<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.600> many<00:01:18.750> turns<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
heat rock so you have many turns of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870 
heat rock so you have many turns of
sweeping<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.490> roll<00:01:20.700> from

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
sweeping and then you just roll from

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.730 
sweeping and then you just roll from
there<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> hit<00:01:21.509> points<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.680> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
there that the hit points is going to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.050 
there that the hit points is going to

stab leaf blade knock off an X's roof I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.340 
stab leaf blade knock off an X's roof I
think<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.659> score<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> lot<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.170> chaos

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
think it's going to score a lot of chaos

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.840 
think it's going to score a lot of chaos
and<00:01:52.619> life<00:01:52.770> orb<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.369> secure<00:01:53.670> that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and life orb is going to secure that

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.789 
and life orb is going to secure that
also<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> very

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
also I think this is one of the very

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.160 
also I think this is one of the very
very<00:01:56.759> rare<00:01:57.119> times<00:01:57.420> where<00:01:57.659> shell<00:01:57.840> doll<00:01:57.990> can

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
very rare times where shell doll can

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.959 
very rare times where shell doll can
work<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.280> thing<00:01:59.430> about<00:01:59.460> shell<00:01:59.820> bail

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
work because the thing about shell bail

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.969 
work because the thing about shell bail
is<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.960> don't<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.439> hit<00:02:01.560> ko<00:02:01.740> your

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
is if you don't want hit ko your

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.770 
is if you don't want hit ko your
opponent<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> same<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.030> leftovers<00:02:03.360> that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
opponent it's the same as leftovers that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.959 
opponent it's the same as leftovers that
um<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.340> you're<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.909> able

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
um so with this you're going to be able

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.730 
um so with this you're going to be able
to<00:02:06.060> one-hit<00:02:06.360> ko<00:02:06.479> your<00:02:06.689> opponent<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.290> idea<00:02:07.590> is
