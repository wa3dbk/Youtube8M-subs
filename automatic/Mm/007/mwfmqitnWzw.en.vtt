00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
well the reason for this to happen is

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.529 
well the reason for this to happen is
that<00:00:25.890> you've<00:00:26.070> probably<00:00:26.310> badly<00:00:26.970> modified<00:00:27.359> your

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
hosts file and this just creates certain

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.729 
hosts file and this just creates certain
