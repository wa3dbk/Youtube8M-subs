00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 intel looked at us many years ago 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.030
 learned that is much better than 3 so 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.130
 and how much better 2001 - oh so 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.290
 that the windows 2000 professional 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.870
 pack an update 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.490
 even the later version of 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.710
 In the year 2000 1990 there was always one 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.039
 difference also applies this update 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.510
 the update function of windows 95 98 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.300
 and the older version is limited 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.730
 has to advertise that one of and work 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 station 351 or 40 should cover 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.610
 yes that's to see that windows 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.500
 logo in a square pattern with a 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.129
 shaded thom springer or something 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 we seem an artistic one 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.230
 interpretation of lightness or me 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.739
 jump out the window i know it for 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.829
 some yes otherwise very big - 2000 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.620
 on it and the editions professional it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.140
 was for end customers the only edition 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.970
 In the end the Neptune project had become 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.470
 not enforced and your as claim 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.880
 the reliable operation team for 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.380
 desktop and laptop computer in the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.890
 so do the same 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.180
 state that it is more for 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.590
 company calculator than for the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.000
 Parents what a wonderful maybe 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.340
 Price of 4 500 d mark lay laptop too 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.280
 even underlined at nt 4.0 the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.560
 I rather moderate on laptops alone 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.790
 active support and of which 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:42.180
 at that time a plug moderately yes in the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.970
 difference to the 90s version had 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.869
 2008 on the side no real 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.340
 Certificate on the top of the page 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.399
 back will be windows 2000 times again 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.630
 compared with the marketers and that of the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.100
 private customer smi we should use 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.070
 at the nineties version 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.719
 accordingly windows 98se jansons 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.480
 still the system requirements at the 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.140
 page 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.470
 33 as a pension as it starts with 60 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.730
 megawatt further you can do it 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.030
 Not exactly with the service packs 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.340
 need windows 2000 significantly more 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.490
 memory one else advertised that 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.050
 also 2000 package and of course the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.230
 windows 2000 server 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.150
 because only with the server makes windows 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.220
 2000 professional are correct 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.960
 before some companies because first time 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.370
 the active directory is supported 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.290
 and really the illustration 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:45.220
 it will be easier to see what's inside 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.080
 As always it is green carton off and on 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.850
 is printed 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.850
 inside are world 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.640
 For example, it was faster 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.070
 getting in at the is also very well known 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.510
 at the oem version that seems 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.330
 but really only the later 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.270
 packages from 2000 to serve or still 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.980
 later even at here a product normal 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.780
 from 2001 is called the pack itself 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:20.650
 is very fast really rose from 2004 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.209
 narrowly here's address is all 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.290
 not the first step, too 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.040
 past 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.739
 that is in principle the same only on real 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.220
 easy paper may be reprinted 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.450
 sometimes a tick in more detail but 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.040
 really worth it to do it 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.020
 I'm sorry as always from adress list 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.050
 the addresses of the microsoft branch 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:49.360
 and the cd as so often are the ones with one 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.760
 provided with a whole flat hologram 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.060
 This version contains the service pack 4 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.269
 Maybe you can do it 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.060
 There were also many different ones 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.609
 version of the hologram this now 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.230
 as I said a very late naturopath 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:10.269
 and design industry colors keep the 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:15.389
 earlier ones had a silver existence 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:17.470
 the atx is on the back 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.530
 and that's it again 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:25.199
 no one but no others 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.199
 call such accessories
