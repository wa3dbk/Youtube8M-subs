different everyone else is streaming it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.670 
different everyone else is streaming it
it's<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.170> those<00:00:58.230> things<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.559> was

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.709 
like well I figure I figured my time
would<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.190> better<00:01:02.460> spent<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:03.149> figuring<00:01:03.660> out

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
would be better spent in figuring out

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.600 
would be better spent in figuring out
the<00:01:03.930> things<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> can't<00:01:04.890> show<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.189> because

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to show off the gameplay is pretty much

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.130 
to show off the gameplay is pretty much
the<00:01:26.310> same<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.150> much<00:01:27.299> changes<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.960> nine

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the same not that much changes in nine

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.280 
the same not that much changes in nine
levels<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.650> wildstar<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:30.509> NBA<00:01:30.750> got<00:01:31.049> raised

different<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.920> would<00:01:34.979> say<00:01:35.570> but<00:01:36.570> uh<00:01:37.369> yeah<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.900> was

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
different I would say but uh yeah I was

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.649 
different I would say but uh yeah I was
going<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.909> not<00:01:41.909> much<00:01:42.030> has<00:01:42.090> changed<00:01:42.210> its

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
going with that not much has changed its

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.270 
going with that not much has changed its
nine<00:01:42.840> levels<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.409> don't<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.710> many<00:01:43.860> amps

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
other MMO does the game really change

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.190 
other MMO does the game really change
that<00:01:51.299> much<00:01:51.360> from<00:01:51.990> levels<00:01:52.320> fifteen<00:01:52.740> through<00:01:53.399> 29

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
that much from levels fifteen through 29

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200 
that much from levels fifteen through 29
not<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> figured<00:01:56.729> my<00:01:56.850> time<00:01:56.880> is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
not really so I figured my time is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.510 
not really so I figured my time is
better<00:01:57.329> spent<00:01:57.450> figuring<00:01:58.439> out<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> game<00:01:59.159> at

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
better spent figuring out the game at

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.789 
better spent figuring out the game at
higher<00:02:00.180> levels<00:02:00.479> which<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.140> can't<00:02:01.320> talk<00:02:01.500> about

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
higher levels which I can't talk about

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.810 
higher levels which I can't talk about
and<00:02:03.590> yeah<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.920> try<00:02:05.070> not<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.310> burn<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.640> you
