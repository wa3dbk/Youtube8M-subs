 Hello everyone, today I show you how you can 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.900
 make a braid with bows 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.789
 first we separate the frontal area 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 of the hair of the rest of the hair that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.650
 we will harvest in a French braid a 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.179
 this we add sections of hair 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.179
 both from above and from below 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.770
 he calls it a track with an elastic band 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.810
 now we use the help of one 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.299
 we insert hairpin inside the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.790
 track took a section of hair 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:02.100
 of the frontal area and create a bow 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.100
 let's proceed like this for the whole track 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.700
 and this is the final result one 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.470
 particular braid very indicated 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.500
