I think particularly I don't necessarily

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.749 
I think particularly I don't necessarily
mean<00:01:31.619> by<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> way<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:34.020> classical

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
mean by the way you know classical

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.969

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
approach to the beat nothing wrong with

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.620 
approach to the beat nothing wrong with
that<00:01:55.290> that's<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:57.600> don't

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
that that's just what it is and we don't

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.599 
that that's just what it is and we don't
have<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.860> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.670> field

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:26.710 

in<00:02:07.609> our<00:02:08.330> music<00:02:08.840> we<00:02:09.440> have<00:02:23.019> now<00:02:25.360> what<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.390> want<00:02:26.629> to

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
in our music we have now what I want to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.920 
in our music we have now what I want to
get<00:02:26.870> at<00:02:27.019> is<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.200> if<00:02:27.879> I<00:02:28.879> have<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.239> write<00:02:29.569> this

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
get at is that if I have to write this

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.120 
get at is that if I have to write this
out<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:35.410> still<00:02:36.410> have<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.650> write<00:02:36.829> it<00:02:37.010> as

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
out I still have to write it as

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.819 
out I still have to write it as
sixteenth<00:02:37.640> notes<00:02:38.049> but<00:02:39.049> it<00:02:39.200> certainly<00:02:39.590> doesn't

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
sixteenth notes but it certainly doesn't

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:47.740 
sixteenth notes but it certainly doesn't
sound<00:02:40.250> like<00:02:42.880> does<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.420> different<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.420> a

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
sound like does it it's different so a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.479 
sound like does it it's different so a
lot<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.140> people<00:02:48.379> have<00:02:48.680> been<00:02:48.799> writing<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.250> the

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
lot of people have been writing to the

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.759 
lot of people have been writing to the
site<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.910> asking<00:02:50.360> if<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.569> would<00:02:50.629> just<00:02:50.930> try<00:02:51.739> to

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
site and asking if I would just try to

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.300 
site and asking if I would just try to
talk<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:52.129> little<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.519> bit<00:02:53.060> about<00:02:53.269> this<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.310> I

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
talk a little a bit about this so I

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.110 
talk a little a bit about this so I
thought<00:02:55.879> I<00:02:55.910> would<00:02:57.459> try<00:02:58.459> in<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.790> couple<00:02:59.060> of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
thought I would try in a couple of

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.420 
thought I would try in a couple of
different<00:02:59.450> ways<00:02:59.599> to<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:01.040> explain<00:03:03.190> how<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.220> think

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430
