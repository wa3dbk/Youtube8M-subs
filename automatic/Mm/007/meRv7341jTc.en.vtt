much<00:00:55.910> in<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.300> sense<00:00:56.540> that<00:00:56.690> it<00:00:57.230> was<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.500> last

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
much in the sense that it was the last

much in the sense that it was the last
day<00:00:59.950> we<00:01:00.950> already<00:01:01.280> felt<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:01.670> was<00:01:01.760> going<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:01.970> be

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
day we already felt it was going to be

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.370 
day we already felt it was going to be
difficult<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.720> awkward<00:01:03.080> I<00:01:04.720> know<00:01:05.720> it's<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.200> very

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
difficult and awkward I know it's a very

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.040 
difficult and awkward I know it's a very
strange<00:01:06.800> notion<00:01:07.340> in<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.180> morning<00:01:08.540> itself<00:01:08.810> was

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
strange notion in the morning itself was

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.530 
strange notion in the morning itself was
quite<00:01:09.200> tense<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:10.190> I<00:01:10.310> just<00:01:10.580> felt<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:11.150> best<00:01:11.330> way

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
quite tense and I just felt the best way

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.880 
quite tense and I just felt the best way
to<00:01:11.570> deal<00:01:11.869> with<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.170> was<00:01:12.259> get<00:01:12.470> through<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:12.800> as

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
to deal with it was get through it as

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.550 
to deal with it was get through it as
quickly<00:01:13.130> as<00:01:13.310> possible<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:14.270> not<00:01:14.660> labor<00:01:15.080> and

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
quickly as possible and not labor and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.520 
quickly as possible and not labor and
not<00:01:15.590> doing<00:01:15.890> loads<00:01:16.369> of<00:01:16.520> Tanks<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.149> just<00:01:17.869> get<00:01:18.320> to

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
not doing loads of Tanks and just get to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.630 
not doing loads of Tanks and just get to
the<00:01:18.619> moment<00:01:18.800> where<00:01:19.130> we<00:01:19.160> could<00:01:19.369> say<00:01:19.490> that's

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
the moment where we could say that's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.840 
the moment where we could say that's
about

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.999 

I<00:01:26.909> feel<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.869> I've<00:01:27.990> blocked<00:01:28.260> out<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> memory

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
I feel like I've blocked out the memory

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.530 
I feel like I've blocked out the memory
because<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.460> almost<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.030> was<00:01:30.060> always<00:01:30.360> like

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
because it's almost it was always like
