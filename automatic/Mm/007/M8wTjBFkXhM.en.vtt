00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.390
 hello my name is Oscar and I work as 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.039
 workshop technician in connor today we're going 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.109
 to teach to change your camera 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.270
 bicycle for it we will use some 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.860
 a camera can be removed and we're going to 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.630
 puff up 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.220
 as you see here we have our wheel 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.890
 punctured and the first thing we would have to 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.560
 do is release the brake to be able to 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.450
 take out the wheel easily the following 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.150
 What we do is release the quick release 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.870
 of the wheel then we open and so that 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.310
 leave the wheel 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.840
 let's loosen the nut on the side 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.840
 otherwise until the wheel comes out 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.350
 and we would have it 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.900
 The next thing we do is move a 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.610
 little cover because sometimes it stays 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.950
 stays stuck to the cover of the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.890
 tire and so it will be easier to take 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.070
 the camera then with the detachable 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.070
 getting in 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.600
 and we are opening what is the cover 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.750
 and with the demountable we open all the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.750
 cover 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.860
 Now the cover is open 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.610
 we have to do is already take our 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.610
 punctured camera 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.470
 and we take out 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.870
 The valve 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.220
 Now the next thing we will do is 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.770
 Check that our cover does not have 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.970
 nothing nailed and so we will avoid that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.800
 click again the new camera 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.460
 let's place and let's go by hand 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.380
 inside 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.500
 and when we make sure it does not have 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.000
 nothing we will put the ones of the new camera 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.010
 The next thing we will do is catch 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.570
 our new camera and we put a 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.190
 little air so that when it comes to 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.920
 put it on the wheel is easier to 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.190
 put in and avoid pinching we choose the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.190
 bomb 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.560
 and we swell a little 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.860
 Now the next thing we will do is 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.860
 place the valve in its hole 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.720
 We are already placing the camera in the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.720
 cover 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.850
 and little by little we are closing the deck 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.700
 and there we have 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.409
 once we have our cover 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.020
 well placed camera and we return to 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:58.290
 place the wheel on the fork 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.000
 and we go tightening the nut and testing 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.310
 with the closure until we fit 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.310
 There's no need to go too far 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.240
 there we would have it almost well 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.190
 wheel in the fork and we already closed and what 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.490
 next would be to close our 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.490
 Brake 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.560
 and finally we would only have 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.560
 put air to our wheel 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.780
 as you have seen it is very easy to change 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.040
 the camera of your bicycle I hope 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.319
 that this video has helped you 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.790
 we keep in touch on our website well 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.569
 and on social networks 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.569
 until next time
