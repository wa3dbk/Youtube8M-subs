motorsports that's pretty easy now i
know<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.560> concept<00:00:26.099> open<00:00:26.490> MRI<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.240> an

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
know that the concept open MRI is an

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.849 
know that the concept open MRI is an
interesting<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:28.080> there's<00:00:28.410> also<00:00:28.590> another

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and that's called open air MRI of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.610 
and that's called open air MRI of

let's<00:00:37.829> talk<00:00:38.190> about<00:00:38.250> open<00:00:39.180> MRI<00:00:39.420> because<00:00:39.809> that's

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
let's talk about open MRI because that's

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.450 
let's talk about open MRI because that's
where<00:00:40.379> we're<00:00:40.500> sitting<00:00:40.649> right<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.219> Phil's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
where we're sitting right here in Phil's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
where we're sitting right here in Phil's
burg<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.170> tell<00:00:43.170> us<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.350> bit<00:00:43.379> about<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.860> from

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
burg and tell us a bit about it from

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.650 
burg and tell us a bit about it from
your<00:00:44.129> perspective<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.969> means<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> people

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
your perspective what it means to people

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
your perspective what it means to people
because<00:00:45.840> maybe<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:46.710> don't<00:00:46.829> all<00:00:46.980> understand

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
because maybe they don't all understand

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.420 
because maybe they don't all understand
exactly<00:00:47.730> how<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.510> benefit<00:00:48.920> open<00:00:49.920> MRI<00:00:50.129> was

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
exactly how it can benefit open MRI was

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.060 
exactly how it can benefit open MRI was
developed<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.410> accommodate<00:00:52.410> patients<00:00:52.890> that

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
developed to accommodate patients that

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.430 
developed to accommodate patients that
had<00:00:53.309> claustrophobia<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.570> larger<00:00:55.020> patients

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
had claustrophobia or larger patients

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.750 
had claustrophobia or larger patients
that<00:00:55.590> really<00:00:55.829> couldn't<00:00:56.100> fit<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that really couldn't fit in the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.090 
that really couldn't fit in the
traditional<00:00:57.210> tube<00:00:57.480> type<00:00:57.780> MRI<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.890> what's

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
traditional tube type MRI but what's

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.040 
traditional tube type MRI but what's
happened<00:00:59.489> over<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.730> last<00:00:59.760> few<00:01:00.090> years<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
happened over the last few years is the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.349 
happened over the last few years is the
technology<00:01:01.440> has<00:01:02.100> advanced<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.730> much<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
technology has advanced so much that the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.950 
technology has advanced so much that the
open<00:01:03.690> MRIs<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.409> equal<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.000> closed<00:01:06.479> L<00:01:06.689> then

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
open MRIs are equal to the closed L then

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.289 
open MRIs are equal to the closed L then
you<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> closed<00:01:07.740> MRIs<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.460> fact<00:01:09.030> what

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
you know the closed MRIs in fact what

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.060 
you know the closed MRIs in fact what
we've<00:01:09.479> done<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.840> our<00:01:09.960> facilities<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.740> we've

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
we've done in our facilities is we've

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.100 
we've done in our facilities is we've
brought<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.610> top<00:01:11.850> technology<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.689> open<00:01:12.869> MRI

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
brought the top technology and open MRI

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.200 
brought the top technology and open MRI
into<00:01:13.650> these<00:01:13.740> facilities<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.490> we've<00:01:14.939> gotten

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
into these facilities and we've gotten

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.999 
into these facilities and we've gotten
our<00:01:15.299> facilities<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> accredited<00:01:16.830> by<00:01:16.979> the

that we're producing the top images in
our<00:01:21.150> field<00:01:21.450> well<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.380> stands<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> reason<00:01:22.920> as

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
our field well it stands to reason as

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.789 
our field well it stands to reason as
technology<00:01:23.939> advances<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.140> does<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.590> right

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
technology advances so does it right

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.520 
technology advances so does it right
here<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.729> mean<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.360> seems<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.869> me<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
here and I mean it seems to me and you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.050 
here and I mean it seems to me and you
correct<00:01:28.890> me<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.280> wrong<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.880> had<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
correct me if I'm wrong but if you had a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.569 
correct me if I'm wrong but if you had a
choice<00:01:30.360> between<00:01:30.420> open<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.380> closed<00:01:31.710> most

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
choice between open and closed most

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.399 
choice between open and closed most
people<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.299> open<00:01:33.600> concept<00:01:33.630> don't<00:01:34.259> they

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
people like the open concept don't they

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.380 
people like the open concept don't they
absolutely<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.729> loud<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
absolutely it's not as loud as the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.240 
absolutely it's not as loud as the
closed<00:01:36.630> units<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.619> lay<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.009> can

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
closed units you can lay there you can

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.249 
closed units you can lay there you can
bring<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> CD<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.750> music<00:01:40.140> or

image well what we've done also is we've

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.460 
image well what we've done also is we've
become<00:02:45.340> digital<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.940> what<00:02:46.780> we've<00:02:46.930> done<00:02:47.140> is

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
become digital and what we've done is

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.740 
become digital and what we've done is
we're<00:02:48.210> connected<00:02:49.210> through<00:02:49.330> what<00:02:49.450> they<00:02:49.570> call

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
we're connected through what they call

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.290 
we're connected through what they call
PAC<00:02:50.050> system<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.710> a<00:02:50.770> risk<00:02:50.980> system<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.820> from

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
PAC system and a risk system so from

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.790 
PAC system and a risk system so from
when<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> patient<00:02:52.990> first<00:02:53.170> comes<00:02:53.500> into<00:02:53.770> our
