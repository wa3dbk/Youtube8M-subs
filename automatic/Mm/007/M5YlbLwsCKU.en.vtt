they did but I think twas the last 10 of
10<00:02:51.810> minutes<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.319> her<00:02:52.470> first<00:02:52.739> up<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.100> was<00:02:53.640> very

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
10 minutes of her first up so was very

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.160 
10 minutes of her first up so was very

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
disappointed because we keep on losing

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.020 
disappointed because we keep on losing
the<00:02:55.440> ball<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.920> inner<00:02:56.190> taking<00:02:56.700> thur<00:02:56.850> so

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the ball in the inner taking thur so

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.550 
the ball in the inner taking thur so
when<00:02:57.600> you're<00:02:57.720> losing<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.110> ball<00:02:58.290> ball
