got<00:00:33.270> all<00:00:33.510> 88-millimeter<00:00:34.170> setup<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
got all 88-millimeter setup so it's a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.400 
got all 88-millimeter setup so it's a
straight<00:00:35.520> frame<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.750> frame<00:00:37.079> which<00:00:37.380> is

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
straight frame and this frame which is

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.130 
straight frame and this frame which is
made<00:00:37.860> by<00:00:37.890> labayda<00:00:38.460> was<00:00:39.090> strategically<00:00:39.750> built

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
made by labayda was strategically built

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.410 
made by labayda was strategically built
for<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.440> boot<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:41.250> looking<00:00:41.640> at<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> outsole

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
for this boot now looking at the outsole

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.119 
for this boot now looking at the outsole
you<00:00:42.450> could<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.170> second<00:00:43.710> wheel<00:00:43.860> from

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you could see how that second wheel from

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
you could see how that second wheel from
the<00:00:44.250> toes<00:00:44.489> recessed<00:00:45.030> into<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.510> outsole<00:00:45.899> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the toes recessed into that outsole and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
the toes recessed into that outsole and
that's<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:46.890> alkaline<00:00:47.399> labayda<00:00:47.820> teamed

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that's because alkaline labayda teamed

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.630 
that's because alkaline labayda teamed
up<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:48.719> wanted<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> bring<00:00:49.890> down<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.370> center

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
up they wanted to bring down the center

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
up they wanted to bring down the center
of<00:00:50.730> gravity<00:00:50.879> or<00:00:51.210> kind<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.480> lower<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
of gravity or kind of lower it get the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.889 
of gravity or kind of lower it get the
player<00:00:52.980> closer<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> ground<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
player closer to the ground and then it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.150 
player closer to the ground and then it
also<00:00:55.050> gives<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.500> player<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> lot<00:00:55.980> more

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
also gives a player a lot more

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.279 
also gives a player a lot more
aggressive<00:00:56.460> turning<00:00:57.149> radius<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
aggressive turning radius and then it

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.840 
aggressive turning radius and then it
gives<00:00:58.410> them<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.710> better<00:00:58.980> overall<00:00:59.370> balanced

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
gives them a better overall balanced

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.840 
gives them a better overall balanced
feel<00:01:00.210> when<00:01:00.480> you're<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.780> skating<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.440> stride

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
feel when you're just skating and stride

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.100 
feel when you're just skating and stride
also<00:01:02.850> looking<00:01:03.120> at<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.329> outsole<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:03.930> going

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
also looking at that outsole it's going

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.039 
also looking at that outsole it's going
to<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.260> an<00:01:04.350> injected<00:01:04.830> TPR<00:01:05.250> plastic<00:01:05.960> getting<00:01:06.960> up

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
to be an injected TPR plastic getting up

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.600 
to be an injected TPR plastic getting up
into<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> quarter<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.189> where<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.430> see

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
into the quarter this is where we see

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.910 
into the quarter this is where we see
the<00:01:08.640> big<00:01:09.030> performance<00:01:09.450> upgrades<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.680> see

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the big performance upgrades you can see

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.380 
the big performance upgrades you can see
there's<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> huge<00:01:11.640> jump<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.090> stiffness

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
there's a huge jump and stiffness

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.960 
there's a huge jump and stiffness
compared<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.260> model<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.130> below<00:01:14.729> this

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
compared to that model right below this

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.480 
compared to that model right below this
has<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:16.350> great<00:01:16.530> heat<00:01:16.799> mouldability

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
has really great heat mouldability

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.530 
has really great heat mouldability
that's<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.270> pride<00:01:18.509> themselves

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that's really what they pride themselves

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660 
that's really what they pride themselves
on<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.350> because<00:01:19.890> they<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.220> offer<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
on here because they don't offer a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.270 
on here because they don't offer a
double<00:01:21.360> e<00:01:21.600> boot<00:01:21.869> what<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.740> does<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
double e boot what this does is that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.740 
double e boot what this does is that
when<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.640> bake<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> nine<00:01:24.450> minutes

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
when you bake it for the nine minutes

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.420 
when you bake it for the nine minutes
gives<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> really<00:01:25.470> true<00:01:25.710> custom<00:01:26.159> fit<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
gives you a really true custom fit and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.460 
gives you a really true custom fit and
can<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.150> expand<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> wide<00:01:27.960> foot<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
can really expand to a wide foot and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.260 
can really expand to a wide foot and
it's<00:01:28.979> still<00:01:29.189> perfect<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> guys<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.119> the

narrower foot you can see and included
some<00:01:33.090> nice<00:01:33.240> durability<00:01:34.280> aspects<00:01:35.280> here<00:01:35.610> just

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
some nice durability aspects here just

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.850 
some nice durability aspects here just
gonna<00:01:36.210> help<00:01:36.450> extend<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> life<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> skate

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
gonna help extend the life of the skate

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.160
