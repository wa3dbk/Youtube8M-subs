00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
those just to kind of create that you

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.510 
those just to kind of create that you
know<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.810> little<00:05:08.050> swoop<00:05:08.650> effect<00:05:09.040> or<00:05:09.220> whatever

know the little swoop effect or whatever

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.300

and<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:10.330> hair<00:05:10.540> still<00:05:10.900> feels<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:11.320> same<00:05:11.620> now<00:05:12.280> I

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
and the hair still feels the same now I

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.990 
and the hair still feels the same now I
would<00:05:12.730> say<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.390> need<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.600> go<00:05:14.350> about

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000

maybe<00:05:16.000> like<00:05:16.270> 325<00:05:17.169> I<00:05:17.410> wouldn't<00:05:17.680> go<00:05:17.740> over<00:05:17.770> 325<00:05:18.540> so
