00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
alright let's get started alright so we

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.209 
alright let's get started alright so we
have<00:00:12.599> blank<00:00:12.960> page<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.469> then<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.799> start<00:00:14.009> drawing

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
have blank page and then I start drawing

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.950 
have blank page and then I start drawing
a<00:00:14.280> face<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:15.150> then<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.299> realized<00:00:15.599> maybe<00:00:15.780> this

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
a face and then I realized maybe this

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.269 
a face and then I realized maybe this
face<00:00:16.109> should<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.289> running<00:00:16.770> somewhere<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
face should be running somewhere and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.700 
face should be running somewhere and
then<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.400> got<00:00:17.580> legs<00:00:17.940> I'm<00:00:18.240> got<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> motion<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.590> it

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
then I got legs I'm got a motion to it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.810 
then I got legs I'm got a motion to it
so<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.920> looked<00:00:20.100> like<00:00:20.130> she's<00:00:20.400> running<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
so it looked like she's running to the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.340 
so it looked like she's running to the
left<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:21.810> gonna<00:00:21.900> put<00:00:21.990> her<00:00:22.140> arm

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
left and I was gonna put her arm

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.870 
left and I was gonna put her arm
straight<00:00:22.800> backwards<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> realized<00:00:23.789> that

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
straight backwards and I realized that

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.700 
straight backwards and I realized that
really<00:00:24.330> didn't<00:00:24.570> work<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.779> then<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.199> put<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> arm

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
really didn't work so then I put the arm

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.349 
really didn't work so then I put the arm
up<00:00:26.189> forward<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> little<00:00:26.760> bit<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:26.939> she's<00:00:27.210> mean

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
up forward a little bit so she's mean

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.890 
up forward a little bit so she's mean
like<00:00:27.510> using<00:00:28.640> waterbending<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.510> arm

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
like using waterbending and the arm

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.750 
like using waterbending and the arm
closer<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.470> her<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:32.160> us<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.090> left<00:00:33.270> arm<00:00:34.730> yay

elements<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.410> once

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
elements at once

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.990 
elements at once
cuz<00:00:47.340> there's<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.410> barely<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.309> even<00:00:50.430> do

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
cuz there's I can barely I can even do

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.520 
cuz there's I can barely I can even do
two<00:00:51.329> things<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.660> once<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
two things at once I'm not really a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.740 
two things at once I'm not really a
multitasker<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.670> how<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> heck<00:00:54.149> does<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
multitasker so how the heck does the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.069 
multitasker so how the heck does the
avatar<00:00:55.250> Bend<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.760> elements<00:00:57.210> at<00:00:57.300> once<00:00:57.329> because

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
avatar Bend for elements at once because

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.930 
avatar Bend for elements at once because
I've<00:00:58.170> never<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.559> seen<00:00:58.829> her<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.579> in

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I've never really seen her do it like in

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.299 
I've never really seen her do it like in
this<00:01:00.750> series<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.379> always<00:01:01.590> art<00:01:01.829> where<00:01:02.160> it's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
this series it's always art where it's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.070 
this series it's always art where it's
happening<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.879> took<00:01:03.600> some<00:01:03.750> artistic

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
happening so took some artistic

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.260 
happening so took some artistic
liberties<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.610> know<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.060> works<00:01:08.150> if<00:01:09.150> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
liberties you know it works if you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.929 
liberties you know it works if you
realize<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.170> how<00:01:10.290> pointless<00:01:11.100> commentary<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
realize just how pointless commentary is

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.120 
realize just how pointless commentary is
on<00:01:12.090> most<00:01:12.240> art<00:01:12.630> videos<00:01:12.930> especially<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:14.010> mine

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
on most art videos especially for mine

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
on most art videos especially for mine
cuz<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.939> nothing<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
cuz I like have nothing to do with the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.710 
cuz I like have nothing to do with the
actual<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.369> I'm<00:01:17.610> drawing<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.270> just

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
actual thing that I'm drawing that just

actual thing that I'm drawing that just
ends<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.409> random<00:01:19.979> rant<00:01:20.250> about

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
ends up going on this random rant about

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.050 
ends up going on this random rant about
something<00:01:21.180> completely<00:01:22.140> different<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:23.060> mean

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
something completely different I mean

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
something completely different I mean
yeah<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> was<00:01:24.479> kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> talking<00:01:24.990> about<00:01:25.200> avatars

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
yeah I was kind of talking about avatars

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and stuff so that makes sense but like

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.550 
and stuff so that makes sense but like
in<00:01:28.140> general<00:01:29.509> why<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.170> feel<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.770> need<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:33.560> put

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
in general why do I feel the need to put

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.480 
in general why do I feel the need to put
commentary<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.130> my<00:01:35.250> videos<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:36.380> mean<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.860> me<00:01:38.070> I

bored<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.049> music<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.430> end<00:01:44.549> up

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
bored if it's just music so I end up

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.639 
bored if it's just music so I end up
skipping<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.149> end<00:01:45.350> but<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:46.439> there's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
skipping to the end but if there's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.069 
skipping to the end but if there's
commentary<00:01:47.280> then<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.119> feel<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.930> they're

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
commentary then I I feel like they're

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.170 
commentary then I I feel like they're
talking<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.500> me<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.070> showing<00:01:50.399> me<00:01:50.579> other

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
I'm drawing so here for the

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.720 
I'm drawing so here for the
earth-bending<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:20.019> put<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.380> motion<00:03:20.620> blur<00:03:20.889> on<00:03:21.250> the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
earth-bending I put a motion blur on the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.860 
earth-bending I put a motion blur on the
rocks<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.150> make<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.420> look<00:03:22.510> like<00:03:22.660> they're

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
rocks to make it look like they're

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.340 
rocks to make it look like they're
moving<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.470> didn't<00:03:24.069> draw<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.519> all<00:03:24.790> those<00:03:24.970> little

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
moving I didn't draw in all those little

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.800 
moving I didn't draw in all those little
foggy<00:03:26.350> parts<00:03:26.859> that's<00:03:27.760> actually<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:28.450> the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
foggy parts that's actually just the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.819 
foggy parts that's actually just the
motion<00:03:28.959> blur<00:03:29.200> effect<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.799> Photoshop<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:32.380> for

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
motion blur effect in Photoshop and for

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.690 
motion blur effect in Photoshop and for
the<00:03:32.889> water<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.549> use<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.709> selection<00:03:35.709> tool<00:03:35.920> this

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
the water I use the selection tool this

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.150 
the water I use the selection tool this
gives<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.060> much<00:03:37.180> sharper<00:03:37.569> edge<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.650> this

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
gives it a much sharper edge and this

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.949 
gives it a much sharper edge and this
allows<00:03:39.579> me<00:03:39.609> to<00:03:39.880> make<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.180> more<00:03:40.389> curved<00:03:40.810> you

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
allows me to make it more curved you

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.120 
allows me to make it more curved you
lurking<00:03:41.760> lurking<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:43.560> did<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.650> also<00:03:44.799> for<00:03:45.069> the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
lurking lurking I did that also for the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.759 
lurking lurking I did that also for the
fire<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.569> used<00:03:46.989> like<00:03:47.910> this<00:03:49.049> it's<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.319> lasso

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
fire so I used like this it's the lasso

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.819 
fire so I used like this it's the lasso
selection<00:03:51.160> tool<00:03:51.579> and<00:03:51.930> then<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.260> just<00:03:53.440> colored

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
selection tool and then I just colored

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.710 
selection tool and then I just colored
it<00:03:53.950> after<00:03:54.340> it's<00:03:54.430> me<00:03:54.579> after<00:03:55.299> I've<00:03:55.389> made<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.569> full

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
it after it's me after I've made a full

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.259 
it after it's me after I've made a full
selection<00:03:55.989> with<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.500> one<00:03:56.650> color<00:03:56.859> and<00:03:57.459> that's

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
selection with the one color and that's

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.159 
selection with the one color and that's
what<00:03:58.599> makes<00:03:59.319> it<00:03:59.500> look<00:03:59.769> so<00:04:00.000> perfect<00:04:01.169> perfect

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
what makes it look so perfect perfect

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.140 
what makes it look so perfect perfect
probably<00:04:02.470> not<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.680> word<00:04:02.829> you<00:04:03.700> know<00:04:03.819> I'll<00:04:04.000> go

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
probably not the word you know I'll go

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.250 
probably not the word you know I'll go
with<00:04:04.299> that

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
with that

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.130 
with that
here<00:04:05.920> I'm<00:04:06.069> using<00:04:06.099> the<00:04:06.459> layer<00:04:06.790> mask<00:04:07.060> tool<00:04:07.450> to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
here I'm using the layer mask tool to

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.030 
here I'm using the layer mask tool to
remove<00:04:09.099> parts<00:04:09.730> of<00:04:09.939> the<00:04:10.209> water<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:11.799> make<00:04:11.920> it

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
remove parts of the water to make it

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.860 
remove parts of the water to make it
look<00:04:12.159> like<00:04:12.250> her<00:04:12.430> hand<00:04:12.730> is<00:04:13.060> within<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.659> water

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
look like her hand is within the water

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.990 
look like her hand is within the water
instead<00:04:14.409> of<00:04:14.470> just<00:04:14.829> in<00:04:15.370> front<00:04:15.549> of<00:04:15.640> it<00:04:15.730> or<00:04:15.909> behind

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
instead of just in front of it or behind

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.080 
instead of just in front of it or behind
it<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.769> then<00:04:18.669> here<00:04:19.419> I'm<00:04:19.660> adding<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:21.090> slight

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
it and then here I'm adding a slight

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.180 
it and then here I'm adding a slight
gradient<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:22.960> background<00:04:23.410> just<00:04:23.889> so<00:04:24.010> that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
gradient to the background just so that

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.040 
gradient to the background just so that
it's<00:04:24.370> harder<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.729> pull<00:04:24.910> her<00:04:25.000> out<00:04:25.060> of<00:04:25.449> the<00:04:25.780> image

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
it's harder to pull her out of the image

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.510 
it's harder to pull her out of the image
behind<00:04:26.229> so<00:04:26.770> it's<00:04:26.889> harder<00:04:27.070> for<00:04:27.100> them<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.310> steal

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
behind so it's harder for them to steal

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.010 
behind so it's harder for them to steal
it<00:04:27.699> and<00:04:27.850> then<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:27.970> add<00:04:28.150> some<00:04:28.330> water<00:04:28.600> or

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
it and then I add some water or

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.260 
it and then I add some water or
airbending<00:04:29.949> because<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:31.000> was<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.150> only

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
airbending because I was the only

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.540 
airbending because I was the only
element<00:04:31.930> missing<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.770> with<00:04:32.919> that<00:04:33.070> I<00:04:33.100> have

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
element missing and with that I have

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.300 
element missing and with that I have
finished<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.150> image<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:36.130> want<00:04:36.250> to

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
finished the image and I just want to

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.590 
finished the image and I just want to
