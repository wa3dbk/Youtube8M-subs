00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello friends with you elena 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.600
 krasovskaya consider now processing 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.900
 zippers 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.660
 stitches with offset from the fold of the fabric in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.049
 In this case, the clasp can be processed 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.619
 this way when 1 fold of fabric 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.960
 located near the tape links 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.359
 zipper closure and provides free 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.730
 passage of the fastener lock and the second fold 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.650
 Cloth closes two rows of zipper links 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.090
 in this case, you need to impose 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.180
 zipper 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.880
 in this way and scribble 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.140
 there is another way that we 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.590
 consider now 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.620
 to do the processing we need 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.300
 ordinary spiral braid zipper and 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.910
 social foot for stitching 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.550
 lightning she can be different look 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.420
 your sewing machine and so for processing 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.360
 fasteners 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.160
 First you need to stitch the product cuts 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.649
 put in an open area for 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.899
 stitching the fastener then sweep over the cut 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.129
 or process it in some other way. 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.330
 It is important to note that allowances for cut 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.659
 the fasteners must be at least 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.770
 two centimeters two two and a half 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.659
 centimeter 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.380
 further neatly smoothing the reforging 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.080
 our you they can first sweep the seam 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.299
 Later you will come when you start and if 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.189
 the fabric responds well to you 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.100
 sure your neck skills can 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.360
 do without this stage 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.540
 the seams we already accurately define the line 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.270
 fold the fabric to process 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.360
 fold-away zipper 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.130
 fabrics accordingly need 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.800
 iron out or sweep the back 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.020
 side seam allowance 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.590
 cut so that the edges 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.190
 the cut went about 35 or meters 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.200
 over the mid- fold line like this 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.620
 the way the zipper in the finished product will be 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.530
 imperceptibly from the front 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.100
 continue to serve dinner and cut put 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.580
 and pin the tape zipper can 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.739
 tack preliminary so that fold 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.630
 the fabric was about to ring the tape 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.730
 without closing them provided free 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.840
 passage lock fastener 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.600
 using a special foot for 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.530
 stitching in zipper 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.650
 noticeable fastener for this open 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.790
 lock and start making the line reaching 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.299
 dogs gently to raise the foot 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:41.410
 bring the doggie lock to the other side 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:43.570
 and continue the line like this 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.270
 not forgetting the end did not start the point 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.530
 we set the clips 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.020
 aligning the line on the middle of the pride of 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.750
 the second side of the cut pin to 2 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.060
 stay away from mom do n't grab 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.060
 we fasten fabric 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.250
 zip to allowance depending 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.210
 You can skip this step from the product but 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.190
 for clarity, I'll show it 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.940
 I tack the first line and 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:18.490
 line up close to the braid 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.140
 mummies do not grab him link 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.230
 place a second line of mop-up 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.770
 letter and zipper and otstrochit it by 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.510
 mark the line on this line 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.780
 You can for example using a non-log soap 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.680
 or 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.680
 basting line also start line 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.310
 need to open the braid zipper started 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.450
 stitches to make a bolster and then reaching 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.880
 to the castle dog 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.680
 also lift up foot translate 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.520
 the other side debugging dogs 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.290
 continue making a markup point 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.740
 below cut to make a line either 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.709
 diagonally or at right angles 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:05.140
 fasten allowance for fastener processing 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.770
 zippers located in the seams 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.560
 offset from the fold of the fabric can 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.360
 take it all good with you 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.360
