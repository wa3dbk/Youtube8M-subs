everything and then I just threw the

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.109 
everything and then I just threw the
idea<00:01:43.899> out<00:01:44.170> there<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:45.159> maybe<00:01:45.520> somehow<00:01:45.969> we

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
idea out there that maybe somehow we

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.330 
idea out there that maybe somehow we
could<00:01:46.420> change<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.899> colors<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.530> flag<00:01:47.770> to

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
could change the colors of the flag to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.789 
could change the colors of the flag to
red<00:01:48.549> white<00:01:48.819> and<00:01:49.060> green<00:01:49.409> well<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.590> know<00:01:50.679> the

kind<00:01:56.379> of<00:01:56.500> likes<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:56.860> idea<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.429> guys<00:01:58.060> this

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.050 
kind of likes the idea and guys this
thing<00:01:58.420> could<00:01:58.959> happen<00:01:59.289> and<00:01:59.739> the<00:02:00.369> reason<00:02:00.610> it

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
thing could happen and the reason it

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.389 
thing could happen and the reason it
could<00:02:01.329> happen<00:02:01.569> is<00:02:01.959> because<00:02:02.349> the<00:02:02.679> Jets<00:02:03.099> are

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
could happen is because the Jets are

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:11.990 
could happen is because the Jets are
america's<00:02:04.299> team

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.240
