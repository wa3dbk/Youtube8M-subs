going vegan so why vegan there are three
main<00:00:55.350> blocks<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.770> reasons<00:00:56.160> why<00:00:56.250> someone<00:00:56.489> would

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
main blocks of reasons why someone would

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.250

choose a vegan diet the first one

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.930 
choose a vegan diet the first one

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
obviously is that they don't want to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.060 
obviously is that they don't want to
exploit<00:01:00.390> animals

I<00:03:57.590> happen<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.250> live<00:03:58.459> in<00:03:58.519> a<00:03:58.670> city<00:03:58.850> where<00:03:59.180> there

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
I happen to live in a city where there

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.570 
I happen to live in a city where there
are<00:03:59.810> many<00:03:59.989> vegetarians<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:00.860> vegans<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:01.459> do
