gameplay<00:01:53.479> actually<00:01:54.020> turn<00:01:54.260> off<00:01:54.410> the

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
gameplay actually turn off the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.770 
gameplay actually turn off the
connectivity<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:57.380> turned<00:01:57.560> out<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.740> offline

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
connectivity it turned out to offline

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.210 
connectivity it turned out to offline
because<00:01:59.780> this<00:02:00.020> makes<00:02:00.229> it<00:02:00.619> makes<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.130> little

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
because this makes it makes it a little

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.260 
because this makes it makes it a little
faster<00:02:01.520> for<00:02:02.170> when<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.440> rest<00:02:04.369> because<00:02:04.790> when

faster for when you rest because when

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.630 
faster for when you rest because when
you<00:02:05.360> rest<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.200> know<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.560> server<00:02:07.100> syncs<00:02:07.490> up

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
you rest you know the server syncs up

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.140 
you rest you know the server syncs up
and<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.390> takes<00:02:08.630> an<00:02:08.750> extra<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.110> few<00:02:09.440> seconds<00:02:10.150> so

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
and it takes an extra a few seconds so

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.290 
and it takes an extra a few seconds so
with<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.840> off<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:13.160> know<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.370> say<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:13.880> shave
