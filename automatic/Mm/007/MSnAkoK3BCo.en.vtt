00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 youtube friends this time 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.990
 I bring a mega texture pack to 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.860
 minecraft because of editing 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.860
 I give the credits to mlg jonathan that 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:19.570
 It was from where I am passing these 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.390
 these textures I will also leave you the 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.730
 mode for 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.410
 to remove the animations from the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.260
 textures 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.779
 they already know nothing more to install the mod 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.400
 they go to the little key that is in this 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.870
 application called blog launcher that 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.140
 I will also leave you in the description of 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.140
 video 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.960
 here we go to where it says 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.960
 manage patches we give in import 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.280
 and look where they have saved 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.930
 the texture packet mode that already 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.920
 I have it here is 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.110
 is this call no an email texture 0.7 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.420
 point 5 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.440
 and the textures since they come in a 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.230
 RAR point file that weighs 99 points 28 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.810
 megas it seems to me if it is very heavy but 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.110
 do not complain are the best textures 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.259
 to install this they are only going to have 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.880
 to go where he gave the little key 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.009
 launcher options 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.950
 activate where it says use package 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.220
 textures and below where it says package 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.979
 textures give you look for where they have 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.020

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.350
