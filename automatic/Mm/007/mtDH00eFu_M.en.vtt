now<00:02:58.489> obviously<00:02:58.940> we<00:02:59.180> wouldn't<00:02:59.390> attempt<00:02:59.870> to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
now obviously we wouldn't attempt to

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.510 
now obviously we wouldn't attempt to
assess<00:03:00.379> the<00:03:00.620> road<00:03:00.890> though<00:03:01.129> being<00:03:01.370> and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
assess the road though being and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.520 
assess the road though being and
handling<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.090> such<00:03:02.269> big<00:03:02.569> cars<00:03:02.810> on<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.170> public

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.960 
handling of such big cars on the public
roads<00:03:03.739> that's<00:03:03.980> why<00:03:04.160> we've<00:03:04.370> come<00:03:04.580> here<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.940> the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
roads that's why we've come here to the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.180 
roads that's why we've come here to the
test<00:03:05.599> track<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.840> see<00:03:06.110> how<00:03:06.260> these<00:03:06.410> cars<00:03:06.709> perform

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.820 
test track to see how these cars perform
in<00:03:07.550> extremis<00:03:08.269> now<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.810> may<00:03:09.110> argue<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:09.739> you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
in extremis now you may argue that you

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.589 
in extremis now you may argue that you
wouldn't<00:03:10.099> drive<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.400> car<00:03:10.580> like<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.790> anyway

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
wouldn't drive the car like that anyway

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.240 
wouldn't drive the car like that anyway
but<00:03:11.660> there's<00:03:12.050> always<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.290> situation<00:03:13.040> that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
but there's always that situation that

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.979 
but there's always that situation that
may<00:03:13.459> arise<00:03:13.519> where<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.569> need<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.870> take

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
may arise where you need to take

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.020 
may arise where you need to take
emergency<00:03:15.319> avoiding<00:03:16.040> action<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.760> that's

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
emergency avoiding action and that's

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.260 
emergency avoiding action and that's
when<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.330> want<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.569> know<00:03:17.780> how<00:03:18.349> a<00:03:18.380> car<00:03:18.709> performs

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.330 

but<00:03:25.200> as<00:03:25.290> soon<00:03:25.500> as<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.740> get<00:03:25.890> underway<00:03:26.310> you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
but as soon as you get underway you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.210 
but as soon as you get underway you
realize<00:03:26.940> this<00:03:27.210> is<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.590> seriously<00:03:28.590> quick<00:03:28.860> car<00:03:29.190> a

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
realize this is a seriously quick car a

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.210 
realize this is a seriously quick car a
maximum<00:03:29.850> speed<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.120> around<00:03:30.620> 126<00:03:31.620> miles<00:03:31.950> an

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
maximum speed of around 126 miles an

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.040 
maximum speed of around 126 miles an
hour<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.670> it's<00:03:33.180> got<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.690> have<00:03:33.870> the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
hour so it's got to have the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.930 
hour so it's got to have the
road-holding<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.920> braking<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.580> cope

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
road-holding and the braking to cope

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.450 
road-holding and the braking to cope
with<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:37.320> as<00:03:37.500> you'd<00:03:37.680> expect<00:03:38.190> from<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
with that and as you'd expect from the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.220 
with that and as you'd expect from the
escorts<00:03:39.060> performance<00:03:39.600> heritage<00:03:40.020> it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
escorts performance heritage it

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.410 
escorts performance heritage it
certainly<00:03:40.590> does<00:03:40.860> violent<00:03:41.490> lane<00:03:41.700> changes<00:03:42.270> are

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
certainly does violent lane changes are

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.630 
certainly does violent lane changes are
handled<00:03:42.750> with<00:03:42.810> poise<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.680> stability<00:03:43.920> and

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.460

there's no traps for the unwary if there

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.500
