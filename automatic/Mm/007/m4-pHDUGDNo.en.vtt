hi<00:00:04.680> my<00:00:04.830> name<00:00:04.980> is<00:00:05.100> Laura<00:00:05.400> I'm<00:00:05.670> an<00:00:05.819> artist<00:00:06.120> and

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
hi my name is Laura I'm an artist and

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.940 
hi my name is Laura I'm an artist and
I'm<00:00:06.390> going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.660> talk<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.230> about<00:00:07.440> how<00:00:07.890> to

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
I'm going to talk to you about how to

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.839 
I'm going to talk to you about how to
work<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.250> fimo<00:00:08.849> or<00:00:09.120> sculpey<00:00:09.690> clay<00:00:09.830> so<00:00:10.849> fimo

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
work with fimo or sculpey clay so fimo

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.189 
work with fimo or sculpey clay so fimo
or<00:00:12.150> sculpey<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> specialized<00:00:13.769> kind<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.190> clay

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
or sculpey is a specialized kind of clay

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.650 
or sculpey is a specialized kind of clay
made<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.529> polymer<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.250> has<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> different

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
made out of polymer that has a different

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.880 
made out of polymer that has a different
consistency<00:00:19.080> from<00:00:20.070> let's<00:00:20.699> say<00:00:20.820> ceramic<00:00:21.359> clay

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
consistency from let's say ceramic clay

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.769 
consistency from let's say ceramic clay
and<00:00:23.090> so<00:00:24.090> polymer<00:00:24.840> has<00:00:26.150> certain<00:00:27.150> things<00:00:27.480> there

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
and so polymer has certain things there

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.359 
and so polymer has certain things there
are<00:00:27.810> certain<00:00:27.869> rules<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> working<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
are certain rules to working with it

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.400 
are certain rules to working with it
that<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.849> need<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> keep<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.510> mind<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:31.380> is

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that you need to keep in mind one is

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.470 
that you need to keep in mind one is
that<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.890> want<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> minimize<00:00:32.610> air<00:00:33.059> pockets

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
that you want to minimize air pockets

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.180 
that you want to minimize air pockets
similar<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.020> ceramic<00:00:34.290> clay<00:00:34.530> because<00:00:34.800> this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
similar to ceramic clay because this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.560 
similar to ceramic clay because this
will<00:00:35.489> take

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
will take

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.139 
will take
it'll<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.500> these<00:00:37.710> little<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.399> white<00:00:38.670> lines

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
it'll get these little like white lines

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.080 
it'll get these little like white lines
and<00:00:39.600> increases<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.829> if<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.370> get<00:00:41.879> air

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
and increases in it if you get air

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.450 
and increases in it if you get air
bubbles<00:00:42.420> stuck<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.250> you're<00:00:44.340> gonna

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
bubbles stuck in it so what you're gonna

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.220 
bubbles stuck in it so what you're gonna
want<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.969> when<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.480> start<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.989> need

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
want to do is when you start you need

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.180 
want to do is when you start you need
your<00:00:46.440> clay<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:47.430> knead<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.789> by<00:00:48.469> like<00:00:49.469> pinching

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
your clay but knead it by like pinching

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.850 
your clay but knead it by like pinching
and<00:00:50.399> pulling<00:00:50.570> rather<00:00:51.570> than<00:00:51.840> folding<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and pulling rather than folding on to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.470 
and pulling rather than folding on to
itself<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.489> don't<00:00:53.730> ever<00:00:53.940> want<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> do

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
itself you don't ever want to do

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.010 
itself you don't ever want to do
anything<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:55.010> like<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.840> when<00:00:57.840> you're

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
anything like like this when you're

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840 
anything like like this when you're
kneading<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> big<00:00:59.670> air

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
kneading because now you have a big air

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.520 
kneading because now you have a big air
bubble<00:01:00.030> stuck<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.320> might

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
bubble stuck in there and that might

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.329 
bubble stuck in there and that might
lead<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.550> compromised<00:01:03.239> final<00:01:03.750> product<00:01:04.339> so

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
lead to a compromised final product so

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.200 
lead to a compromised final product so
just<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.540> things<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.290> pinch<00:01:08.100> pull<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
just do things like this pinch pull and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.590 
just do things like this pinch pull and
squeeze<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.770> try<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> keep<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> air<00:01:12.330> bubbles

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
squeeze but try to keep the air bubbles

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.249 
squeeze but try to keep the air bubbles
out<00:01:12.860> another<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:14.159> about<00:01:14.630> FEMA<00:01:15.630> or<00:01:15.810> sculpey

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
out another thing about FEMA or sculpey

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.899 
out another thing about FEMA or sculpey
is<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> don't<00:01:16.979> want<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.520> more

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
is that you don't want it to be more

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.880 
is that you don't want it to be more
than<00:01:17.970> an<00:01:18.210> inch<00:01:18.450> thick<00:01:18.869> or<00:01:19.259> else<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.770> might

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
than an inch thick or else it might

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
than an inch thick or else it might
crack<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.850> oven<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.479> don't<00:01:21.630> want

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
crack in the oven and you don't want

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170 
crack in the oven and you don't want
that<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.680> something<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.460> helps<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that so something that helps with that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.999 
that so something that helps with that
is<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:27.619> can<00:01:28.619> make<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.270> model

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
is that you can make make your model

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
is that you can make make your model
base<00:01:32.009> sort<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.030> skeleton<00:01:33.479> out<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:34.490> foil<00:01:35.750> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
base sort of skeleton out of foil and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.999 
base sort of skeleton out of foil and
then<00:01:37.290> work<00:01:37.829> around<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.049> I'll<00:01:40.680> show<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
then work around that so I'll show you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.740 
then work around that so I'll show you
how<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:41.909> made<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.360> ball<00:01:43.399> out<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
how to do that I just made a ball out of

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.710 
how to do that I just made a ball out of
tin<00:01:45.750> foil<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.939> now<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.060> I'm<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.810> is

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
tin foil and now what I'm going to do is

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.530 
tin foil and now what I'm going to do is
flatten<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.930> my<00:01:52.079> sculpey<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.329> wrap<00:01:54.329> it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
flatten out my sculpey and wrap it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.840 
flatten out my sculpey and wrap it
around<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:55.409> ball<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:57.110> now<00:01:58.219> I'll<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.340> cover

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
around this ball and now I'll just cover

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.130 
around this ball and now I'll just cover
all<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.210> sides<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.909> doesn't<00:02:03.630> look<00:02:03.719> very<00:02:03.750> ball

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
all the sides it doesn't look very ball

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.950 
all the sides it doesn't look very ball
like<00:02:04.380> right<00:02:04.619> now<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:06.630> is

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
like right now but what I can do now is

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.050 
like right now but what I can do now is
work<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> normal<00:02:08.520> ball<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.879> clay

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
work with it like a normal ball of clay

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.280 
work with it like a normal ball of clay
until<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.209> shape

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
until I get the shape

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.009 
until I get the shape
and<00:02:15.349> like<00:02:16.349> texture<00:02:17.189> that<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.730> want<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.659> that's

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
and like texture that I want and that's

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.349 
and like texture that I want and that's
another<00:02:19.290> thing<00:02:19.590> about<00:02:19.650> modeling<00:02:20.579> with<00:02:20.849> fimo

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
another thing about modeling with fimo

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:27.319 
another thing about modeling with fimo
or<00:02:21.599> sculpey<00:02:21.989> clay<00:02:22.019> is<00:02:22.469> that<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:27.120> can

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329

it's<00:02:49.799> not<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.069> huge<00:02:50.370> deal<00:02:50.609> because<00:02:50.879> I<00:02:51.090> can

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
it's not a huge deal because I can

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.979 
it's not a huge deal because I can
always<00:02:51.450> stand<00:02:51.689> it<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:51.989> off<00:02:52.200> later<00:02:53.569> so<00:02:54.569> once

want to check those because they know

best

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
best

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.960 
best
also<00:03:11.970> remember<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.659> your<00:03:13.650> model<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.579> your

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
also remember that your model and your

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.210 
also remember that your model and your
clay<00:03:15.150> will<00:03:15.599> get<00:03:15.959> softer<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.799> oven<00:03:17.040> before

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
clay will get softer in the oven before

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.099 
clay will get softer in the oven before
it<00:03:17.549> gets<00:03:17.729> harder<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.599> you<00:03:18.629> want<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.959> make<00:03:19.079> sure

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
it gets harder so you want to make sure

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.319 
it gets harder so you want to make sure
that<00:03:19.409> your<00:03:19.590> structure<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.220> sound<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.150> not

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
that your structure is sound and not

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.770 
that your structure is sound and not
going<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.629> melt<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.049> collapse<00:03:22.829> onto<00:03:23.129> itself

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
going to melt and collapse onto itself

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.219 
going to melt and collapse onto itself
so<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:26.609> is<00:03:26.970> how<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.239> make<00:03:27.599> a<00:03:27.629> model<00:03:27.930> with

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
so that is how you make a model with

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.469 
so that is how you make a model with
sculpey<00:03:28.650> or<00:03:28.739> fimo<00:03:29.159> I'm<00:03:29.400> Laura<00:03:29.790> thanks<00:03:30.359> for
