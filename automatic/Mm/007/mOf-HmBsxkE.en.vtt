00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
then got a clear phone case and I just

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.420 
then got a clear phone case and I just
laid<00:00:50.320> them<00:00:50.500> all<00:00:50.620> on<00:00:50.739> backwards

laid them all on backwards

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.189 
laid them all on backwards
so<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.909> colored<00:00:52.210> side<00:00:52.390> was<00:00:52.690> showing<00:00:53.019> through

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
so the colored side was showing through

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.410 
so the colored side was showing through
the<00:00:53.290> front<00:00:53.650> of<00:00:53.799> the<00:00:53.890> phone<00:00:54.070> case<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.670> I<00:00:55.390> just

the front of the phone case and I just

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.119 
the front of the phone case and I just
laid<00:00:55.720> them<00:00:55.869> all<00:00:55.989> on<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.409> I<00:00:56.470> absolutely<00:00:56.650> loved

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
laid them all on and I absolutely loved

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.680 
laid them all on and I absolutely loved
the<00:00:57.250> turnout<00:00:57.580> of<00:00:57.610> this<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.269> then<00:00:58.510> just

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
the turnout of this and then just

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:08.610 
the turnout of this and then just
slotted<00:00:58.869> my<00:00:59.140> phone<00:00:59.350> on<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.830> it<00:01:00.070> looks<00:01:00.280> amazing

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.780 

the<00:01:09.620> good<00:01:09.830> thing<00:01:09.979> about<00:01:10.070> this<00:01:10.370> is<00:01:10.550> you<00:01:10.670> don't

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
the good thing about this is you don't

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.760 
the good thing about this is you don't
stick<00:01:11.120> them<00:01:11.300> down<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:11.750> can<00:01:11.900> easily<00:01:12.110> remake

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
stick them down so you can easily remake

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.670 
stick them down so you can easily remake
them<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:13.250> have<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.550> however<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:13.970> want<00:01:14.210> and

found out Disney Princess pictures where

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.810 
found out Disney Princess pictures where
they<00:01:24.530> look<00:01:24.710> like<00:01:24.890> they're<00:01:25.130> holding<00:01:25.340> something

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
they look like they're holding something

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.940 
they look like they're holding something
and<00:01:26.509> I<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:26.660> printed<00:01:27.110> them<00:01:27.259> out<00:01:27.350> laid<00:01:27.650> them<00:01:27.890> on

popular cases but they're actually quite

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.499 
popular cases but they're actually quite
expensive<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:33.920> this<00:01:34.040> is<00:01:34.160> such<00:01:34.400> a<00:01:34.759> better<00:01:35.180> way

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
expensive so this is such a better way
