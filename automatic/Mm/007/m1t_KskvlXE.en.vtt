pretty basic looked pretty pretty basic
mode<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.820> guess<00:01:30.210> we'll<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.479> ahead<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.630> oh

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
mode so I guess we'll go ahead and oh

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.490 
mode so I guess we'll go ahead and oh
the<00:01:31.110> life<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.770> life<00:01:32.400> mech<00:01:33.000> live<00:01:33.210> feature<00:01:33.500> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the life a life mech live feature that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.749 
the life a life mech live feature that
thing<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> twist<00:01:35.520> his

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
thing right there when you twist his

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.539 
thing right there when you twist his
little<00:01:36.060> little<00:01:36.720> Paula<00:01:36.930> Deen<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:38.250> little

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
little little Paula Deen that little

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.010 
little little Paula Deen that little
gear<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.820> hand<00:01:39.000> moves<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.689> guess<00:01:39.840> that

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
gear in hand moves and then I guess that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.230 
gear in hand moves and then I guess that
tab<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> back<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.100> mouth<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.700> guess

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
tab on the back in the mouth I guess

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.740 
tab on the back in the mouth I guess
that<00:01:42.390> counts<00:01:42.540> too<00:01:43.340> um<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.909> yeah<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.479> guess

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that counts too um but yeah I guess

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.819 
that counts too um but yeah I guess
we'll<00:01:45.899> go<00:01:46.259> ahead<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
we'll go ahead and get to the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.380 
we'll go ahead and get to the
transformation<00:01:47.549> which<00:01:47.729> isn't<00:01:48.030> even<00:01:48.090> worth

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
transformation which isn't even worth

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.080 
transformation which isn't even worth
its<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.680> let's<00:01:50.070> go<00:01:50.369> ahead<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.909> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
its so let's go ahead and get to it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.600 
its so let's go ahead and get to it
we'll<00:01:52.049> go<00:01:52.170> ahead<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.439> close<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.799> pause<00:01:53.040> right

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
we'll go ahead and close the pause right

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
we'll go ahead and close the pause right
here<00:01:53.990> can<00:01:54.990> be<00:01:55.020> tough<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.649> really

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
here can be tough because it really

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.429 
here can be tough because it really
tight<00:01:56.070> ooh<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:58.200> hurts<00:01:58.530> oh<00:01:59.030> that<00:02:00.030> hurt<00:02:00.439> then

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
tight ooh that hurts oh that hurt then

we<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:01.860> ahead<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:03.590> covers<00:02:04.590> face

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
we can go ahead and like covers face

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.730 
we can go ahead and like covers face
seed<00:02:05.340> um<00:02:05.640> he's<00:02:06.329> kind<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.600> points<00:02:07.560> right<00:02:07.710> there

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
seed um he's kind of points right there

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740 
seed um he's kind of points right there
it'll<00:02:08.550> go<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.819> said<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.390> hole<00:02:09.660> right

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
it'll go and said I like that hole right

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.110

you can do something with these guns I'm
not<00:03:26.940> exactly<00:03:27.299> sure<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.799> that<00:03:28.980> or

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
not exactly sure just like that or

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.670 
not exactly sure just like that or
something<00:03:29.540> maybe<00:03:30.540> fold<00:03:30.870> them<00:03:31.019> up<00:03:31.109> so<00:03:31.560> they're

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
something maybe fold them up so they're

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.080 
something maybe fold them up so they're
higher<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:33.690> cereal<00:03:34.680> seriously<00:03:35.579> is<00:03:35.880> like

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
higher that cereal seriously is like

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.870 
higher that cereal seriously is like
basically<00:03:36.510> it's<00:03:36.930> transforming<00:03:37.650> him<00:03:37.880> maybe

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
basically it's transforming him maybe

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.300 
basically it's transforming him maybe
I'm<00:03:39.060> doing<00:03:39.180> something<00:03:39.299> wrong<00:03:39.630> cuz<00:03:39.900> I'm<00:03:40.889> stupid
