 to stick to the previous ones 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.980

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.540

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.310

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.640
 The windows were on it this time 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.130

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.920

 already a very personal songs 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.770
 I'm going to assume 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.490
 My song is to your father 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.230
 what was important to them so what 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.460
 her feelings to her father, so to speak 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.729
 have set to music 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.640
 It was important to me that it was nice words 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.280
 I want to find the text for this text 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.650
 I think so I have predefined mine 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.820
 lyrics my life story tells how 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.530
 I mean father to many 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.240
 have searched for and over again 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.340
 tried to contact him 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.410
 but unfortunately it is not 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.720
 succeeded and meanwhile is easy 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.370
 storm many many years ago 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.810
 and that's why I have these too 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.610
 decision made this album 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.100
 to ask my father 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.580
 because it was important to me to have a souvenir 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.709
 my father and thank the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.959
 have experienced pain to open up 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.970
 need for this song and this 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.520
 to relive the memory 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.350
 it was not direct for me 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.200
 painful I have my whole 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.880
 my whole life story is packed 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.250
 How I felt in time 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.900
 where was looking for and for me it was 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.580
 Now just like home I come 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.620
 I arrived at the end of the way 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.989
 That's why this number is called also on 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.760
 The end of my search has come to the end 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.860
 of course not found days 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.910
 unfortunate circumstances he is like 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.010
 said died 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.510
 but I can be reassured against 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.310
 so that you do not complete it 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.549
 need to look more and have certainty 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.549
 that it happened that way is another 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.470
 Song is a chapter in the diary 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.470
 that's what they have kept a diary 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.510
 the processed happen in everyday life 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.060
 so i would not write it in the diary 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.860
 today's time where you have computer and 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.910
 Mobile phones can pronounce everything like 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.760
 I do not have a diary 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.230
 the safety of the swiss child has 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.880
 such books diligently books 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.040
 written or has everything 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.940
 written down nice memories 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.960
 But I think I have a diary 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.730
 not written and I think it is 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.040
 beautiful theme that you again today 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.770
 should write a lot more because of it 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.740
 everything only via e-mail etc about 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.480
 one of those sms goes via whatsapp and 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.360
 while I have taken up this title 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.920
 because it's just nice when you look 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.600
 certain old ones can come back 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.790
 look back at our diary 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.990
 unpack and can read what 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.250
 Everything is so described 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.740
 and that's what we have 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.420
 a story that one's diary 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.090
 again dug up on the attic floor 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.620
 now in it leafs and a chapter 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.410
 find what you are holding then very much 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.790
 judged or a meeting 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.610
 they are now in the darn seventh 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.740
 year in the beating why does it work too 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.930
 in the darn seventh year so well 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.910
 So I hope it works well 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.190
 As I said there is a number that has one 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.690
 big meaning for me and for me 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.090
 should these seven just see where I am 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.840
 see that I wish that with me 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.310

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.390

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.390
 Huge luck came
