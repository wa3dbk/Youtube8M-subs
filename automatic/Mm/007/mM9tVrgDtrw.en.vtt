biggest issue we see with snowblowers
coming<00:00:18.390> into<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.689> shop<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.320> most<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.460> them

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
coming into the shop is most of them

coming into the shop is most of them
won't<00:00:20.699> start<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.710> reason<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
won't start the reason for that is the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.620 
won't start the reason for that is the
fuel<00:00:25.349> that's<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:25.949> most<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> time<00:00:27.300> has

fuel that's in them most of the time has

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.150 
fuel that's in them most of the time has
been<00:00:27.660> sitting<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.320> them<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.070> couple<00:00:29.789> years

been sitting in them for a couple years

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.830 
been sitting in them for a couple years
just<00:00:32.160> because<00:00:32.550> they<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.880> used<00:00:33.270> very<00:00:33.390> little

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
just because they get used very little

of fuel that you could buy five years
ago<00:01:44.249> it's<00:01:44.729> basically<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.240> pure<00:01:45.569> fuel<00:01:45.899> there's

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
ago it's basically a pure fuel there's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.889 
ago it's basically a pure fuel there's
no<00:01:46.409> filler<00:01:46.710> there's<00:01:47.100> no<00:01:47.509> ethanol<00:01:48.509> blended

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.830 
no filler there's no ethanol blended
into<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.609> and<00:01:50.609> it's<00:01:50.819> gonna<00:01:50.969> react<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.539> same<00:01:51.780> as

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
into it and it's gonna react the same as

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.510 
into it and it's gonna react the same as
the<00:01:52.850> fuel<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.999> could<00:01:54.179> buy<00:01:54.920> five<00:01:55.920> plus<00:01:56.280> years

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the fuel you could buy five plus years

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.849 
the fuel you could buy five plus years
ago<00:01:56.850> did<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.960> could<00:01:58.109> leave<00:01:58.319> that<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.740> a

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
ago did you could leave that in a

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.590 
ago did you could leave that in a
machine<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.459> a<00:01:59.549> couple<00:01:59.850> years<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.299> pull<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
machine for a couple years and pull the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.499 
machine for a couple years and pull the
machine<00:02:00.899> out<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.229> start<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.560> right<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:02.509> this

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
machine out and start it right up this

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.149 
machine out and start it right up this
stuff<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.990> good<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.469> twenty<00:02:04.770> four<00:02:04.950> months

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
stuff is good for twenty four months

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.090 
stuff is good for twenty four months
after<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.819> opened<00:02:06.469> so<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.740> basically

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.440 

store<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.280> unit<00:02:11.490> for<00:02:11.640> two<00:02:11.760> years<00:02:11.970> pull<00:02:12.210> it<00:02:12.300> out

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
store the unit for two years pull it out

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.010 
store the unit for two years pull it out
and<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.630> shouldn't<00:02:12.900> start<00:02:13.140> fine

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
and it shouldn't start fine

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.300 
and it shouldn't start fine
