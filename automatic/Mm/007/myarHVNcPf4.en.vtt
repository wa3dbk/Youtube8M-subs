I created a digital painting in adobe
photoshop<00:00:13.200> cs3<00:00:15.619> before<00:00:16.619> we<00:00:16.740> get<00:00:16.859> started<00:00:16.920> I

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
photoshop cs3 before we get started I

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.920 
photoshop cs3 before we get started I
want<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.850> talk<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> little<00:00:18.420> bit<00:00:18.660> about

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
want to talk a little bit about

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.769 
want to talk a little bit about
preparation<00:00:19.619> as<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.699> notice<00:00:21.000> I've<00:00:21.210> used<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
preparation as you notice I've used a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.679 
preparation as you notice I've used a
grid<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.260> my<00:00:22.680> canvas<00:00:23.000> now<00:00:24.000> some<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.510> might

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
grid on my canvas now some of you might

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.089 
grid on my canvas now some of you might
not<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:24.930> using<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.529> grit<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.920> that's

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
not like using a grit and that's

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429 
not like using a grit and that's
perfectly<00:00:26.519> fine<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.750> encourage<00:00:28.170> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
perfectly fine but I do encourage it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.380 
perfectly fine but I do encourage it
especially<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.220> beginner<00:00:29.519> because<00:00:29.849> it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
especially for the beginner because it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.799 
especially for the beginner because it
helps<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.289> proportions<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.329> helps<00:00:33.630> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
helps with proportions and it helps you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.959 
helps with proportions and it helps you
to<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.290> accurate<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:34.829> possible<00:00:34.890> which<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
to be it's accurate as possible which is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.549 
to be it's accurate as possible which is
very<00:00:36.149> important<00:00:36.660> especially<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:37.440> you're

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
very important especially when you're

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.720 
very important especially when you're
doing<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.010> portrait<00:00:39.860> all<00:00:40.860> right<00:00:41.100> now<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.670> you

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
doing a portrait all right now that you

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.639 
doing a portrait all right now that you
have<00:00:41.760> your<00:00:41.910> canvas<00:00:42.329> prepared<00:00:42.690> let's<00:00:43.469> begin

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
have your canvas prepared let's begin

have your canvas prepared let's begin
the<00:00:44.040> digital<00:00:44.399> portrait<00:00:48.620> now<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.129> tell

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the digital portrait now as you can tell

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.819 
the digital portrait now as you can tell
I'm<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.180> blogging<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.719> shapes<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.350> getting

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
I'm just blogging in shapes just getting

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.479 
I'm just blogging in shapes just getting
a<00:00:52.890> general<00:00:53.250> sense<00:00:53.460> adding<00:00:54.239> some<00:00:54.510> color<00:00:55.489> I'm

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
a general sense adding some color I'm

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.160 
a general sense adding some color I'm
not<00:00:56.640> too<00:00:56.940> overly<00:00:57.210> concerned<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.719> details

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
not too overly concerned with details

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.580 
not too overly concerned with details
will<00:00:58.649> come<00:00:58.800> later<00:00:59.780> this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.989> probably<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
will come later this is probably one of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410 
will come later this is probably one of
the<00:01:01.710> finest<00:01:02.010> parts<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.120> can

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the finest parts of it because I can

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.359 
the finest parts of it because I can
just<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.750> play<00:01:04.080> around<00:01:04.110> play<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.010> colors

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
just really play around play with colors

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.910 
just really play around play with colors
total<00:01:06.240> composition<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> general

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
total composition just get the general

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.380 
total composition just get the general
feeling<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> want<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> make

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.030 

a<00:01:12.450> lot<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> time<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.890> happens

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
a lot of the time what happens

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.160 
a lot of the time what happens
especially<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:15.150> beginners<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.020> they

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
especially for beginners is that they

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
especially for beginners is that they
work<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.560> chunks<00:01:17.010> so<00:01:17.729> choose<00:01:18.030> their<00:01:18.240> favorite

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
work in chunks so choose their favorite

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
work in chunks so choose their favorite
spot<00:01:18.780> such<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> face<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.010> I'll<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.640> keep

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
spot such as the face and I'll just keep

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.320 
spot such as the face and I'll just keep
working<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.479> until<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.900> done<00:01:22.940> this<00:01:23.940> isn't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
working on it until it's done this isn't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.149 
working on it until it's done this isn't
the<00:01:24.420> right<00:01:24.450> approach<00:01:24.810> at<00:01:25.050> all<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.920> what

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
the right approach at all because what

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.640 
the right approach at all because what
can<00:01:26.280> easily<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.940> most<00:01:27.300> often<00:01:27.510> does<00:01:27.900> happen<00:01:28.290> is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
can easily and most often does happen is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.430 
can easily and most often does happen is
that<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.220> work<00:01:29.400> themselves<00:01:29.820> into<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.300> corner

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
that they work themselves into a corner

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.710 
that they work themselves into a corner
so<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.740> work<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.160> hand<00:01:32.580> or<00:01:32.940> phase<00:01:33.300> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
so the work on a hand or phase and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.690 
so the work on a hand or phase and
they'll<00:01:33.900> notice<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.979> completely<00:01:35.430> out

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
they'll notice that it's completely out

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.749 
they'll notice that it's completely out
of<00:01:35.729> proportion<00:01:35.940> with<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.570> rest<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.759> piece

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
of proportion with the rest of the piece

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.300 
of proportion with the rest of the piece
so<00:01:39.360> they've<00:01:39.540> already<00:01:39.750> committed<00:01:40.409> probably<00:01:41.159> an

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
so they've already committed probably an

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.389 
so they've already committed probably an
hour<00:01:41.540> 45<00:01:42.540> minutes<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:43.530> spot<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
hour 45 minutes to this one spot that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.800 
hour 45 minutes to this one spot that
just<00:01:44.700> doesn't<00:01:44.850> work<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.570> entire

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
just doesn't work for the entire

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050 
just doesn't work for the entire
portrait<00:01:46.289> so<00:01:46.680> they<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:47.039> to<00:01:47.160> go<00:01:47.280> back<00:01:47.490> erase

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
portrait so they have to go back erase

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.210 
portrait so they have to go back erase
it<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.390> redo<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.810> again<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.070> takes

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it and redo it again and that just takes

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.760 
it and redo it again and that just takes
more<00:01:50.759> time<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.030> more<00:01:51.450> energy<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.560> very

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
more time and more energy and it's very

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.210 
more time and more energy and it's very
and<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.310> very<00:01:53.369> discouraging<00:01:55.220> so

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
and it can be very discouraging so

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.600 
and it can be very discouraging so
basically<00:01:56.910> this<00:01:56.970> all<00:01:57.270> means<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:58.369> just<00:01:59.369> start

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
basically this all means is just start

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.210 
basically this all means is just start
big<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.090> work<00:02:00.270> small<00:02:00.830> don't<00:02:01.830> be<00:02:01.950> able<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
big and work small don't be able to

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.520 
big and work small don't be able to
concern<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.640> details<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.660> have<00:02:03.810> fun<00:02:04.080> stay

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
concern with details just have fun stay
