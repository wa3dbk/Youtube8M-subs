00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.069 
think it looks pretty nice so very cool
and<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.850> think<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> other<00:01:54.360> building<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.869> got

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and I think the other building we got

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.190 
and I think the other building we got
was<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:57.509> burns<00:01:58.409> penitentiary<00:02:00.200> it's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
was this the burns penitentiary it's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810 
was this the burns penitentiary it's
kind<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.979> kind<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.219> big<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.670> don't

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
kind of it was kind of big and I don't

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340 
kind of it was kind of big and I don't
really<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.149> much<00:02:03.420> room<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.750> go<00:02:04.110> all<00:02:04.320> out

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
really have that much room to go all out

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.139 
really have that much room to go all out
on<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.770> building<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.549> think<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.030> pretty

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
on this building but I think it's pretty

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.680 
on this building but I think it's pretty
nice<00:02:06.360> where<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.659> put<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.509> pretty

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
nice where I put it so so it's pretty

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.839 
nice where I put it so so it's pretty
cool<00:02:09.899> building<00:02:10.349> it's<00:02:10.500> got<00:02:10.679> some<00:02:11.580> shrubbery

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
cool building it's got some shrubbery

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.980 
cool building it's got some shrubbery
around<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
around it and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.710 
around it and
it<00:02:13.440> kind<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.830> decorate<00:02:14.190> itself<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.600> a

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
it kind of decorate itself as in in a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.090 
it kind of decorate itself as in in a
way<00:02:15.870> because<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.290> already<00:02:16.710> got<00:02:16.920> some

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
way because it's already got some

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.560 
way because it's already got some
fencing<00:02:17.490> around<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.910> stuff<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.450> don't

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
fencing around and stuff so you don't

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.090 
fencing around and stuff so you don't
really<00:02:18.660> need<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.020> do<00:02:19.140> much<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> exterior

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
really need to do much to the exterior

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.020 
really need to do much to the exterior
but<00:02:20.820> it's<00:02:21.600> very<00:02:21.780> cool<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:23.670> also<00:02:23.850> one

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
but it's very cool and that's also one

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.220 
but it's very cool and that's also one
of<00:02:24.060> my<00:02:24.180> favorite<00:02:24.480> buildings<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.900> we<00:02:25.050> got

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
that there wasn't that many starting off

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.890 
that there wasn't that many starting off
but<00:03:13.380> there<00:03:14.100> was<00:03:14.460> eventually<00:03:14.760> does<00:03:15.690> eventually

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
but there was eventually does eventually

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.290 
but there was eventually does eventually
going<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.350> be<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.500> lot<00:03:16.710> more<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.460> there's<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.150> lot

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
going to be a lot more so there's a lot

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.660 
going to be a lot more so there's a lot
that<00:03:18.360> are<00:03:18.630> sitting<00:03:18.960> in<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.680> files<00:03:20.160> waiting<00:03:20.430> to

really feel like I am because there was

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.720 
really feel like I am because there was
definitely<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.090> lot<00:03:39.240> more<00:03:40.160> stuff<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:41.580> don't
