Mac minis stacked on top of each other
there's<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.140> gigabit<00:01:28.500> switch<00:01:28.619> down<00:01:28.979> there

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
there's a gigabit switch down there

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.710 
there's a gigabit switch down there
there's<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> KVM<00:01:29.880> switch<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:30.509> two

things that are even powered up on that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.469 
things that are even powered up on that
shelf<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.130> Intel<00:01:44.729> Mac<00:01:44.909> Mini<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.420> the

shelf are the Intel Mac Mini and the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.929 
shelf are the Intel Mac Mini and the
gigabit<00:01:46.380> switch<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> briefly<00:01:47.640> touched

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
gigabit switch now I briefly touched

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.000 
is not plugged in the Rooter is plugged
in<00:02:15.420> my<00:02:15.540> wireless<00:02:15.750> router<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.590> get<00:02:16.739> into

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
in my wireless router so that get into

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.470 
in my wireless router so that get into
access<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.640> all<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.849> good<00:02:18.030> stuff

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
access and all that good stuff

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.180 
access and all that good stuff
I<00:02:18.510> used<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.110> gigabit<00:02:19.440> switch<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:20.010> really

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
I used the gigabit switch to get really

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.339 
I used the gigabit switch to get really
fast<00:02:20.459> communication<00:02:21.170> basically<00:02:22.170> at<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
fast communication basically at the

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.309 
fast communication basically at the
moment<00:02:22.380> between<00:02:23.010> my<00:02:23.160> Mac<00:02:23.790> Pro<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.450> my<00:02:25.080> Mac

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
moment between my Mac Pro and my Mac

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.170 
moment between my Mac Pro and my Mac
Mini<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.340> can<00:02:26.489> transfer<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.970> video

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
Mini so that I can transfer the video

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.120 
Mini so that I can transfer the video
files<00:02:27.480> nice<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.989> quickly<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:28.770> have<00:02:29.100> a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
files nice and quickly so I do have a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.340 
files nice and quickly so I do have a
lot<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.459> future<00:02:29.880> plans<00:02:30.150> for<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.750> system<00:02:31.140> but

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
lot of future plans for this system but

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.590 
lot of future plans for this system but
at<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.680> moment<00:02:31.830> basically<00:02:32.310> all<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.910> is<00:02:33.270> use

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
at the moment basically all I do is use

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.250 
at the moment basically all I do is use
the<00:02:33.750> built-in<00:02:34.170> Apple<00:02:35.300> file<00:02:36.300> sharing<00:02:36.690> to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the built-in Apple file sharing to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.220 
the built-in Apple file sharing to
transfer<00:02:37.890> my<00:02:38.130> final<00:02:38.850> video<00:02:39.300> exports<00:02:40.080> that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
transfer my final video exports that

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.620 
transfer my final video exports that
come<00:02:40.410> out<00:02:40.560> handbrake<00:02:41.130> along<00:02:41.819> with<00:02:42.000> my<00:02:42.120> final

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
come out handbrake along with my final

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.020 
come out handbrake along with my final
JPEG<00:02:43.200> thumbnails<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.310> pretty<00:02:44.519> much<00:02:44.610> paste

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
JPEG thumbnails and I pretty much paste

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.180 
JPEG thumbnails and I pretty much paste
them<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.450> Mac<00:02:45.630> minis<00:02:45.959> desktop<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.739> then

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
them to the Mac minis desktop and then

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.370 
them to the Mac minis desktop and then
from<00:02:47.519> there<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.880> use<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.390> Mac<00:02:48.600> Mini<00:02:48.630> with

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
from there I use the Mac Mini with

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.039 
from there I use the Mac Mini with
Google<00:02:49.830> Chrome<00:02:50.069> as<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.310> web<00:02:50.519> browser<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:51.450> upload

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
Google Chrome as a web browser to upload

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.960 
Google Chrome as a web browser to upload
the<00:02:52.260> videos<00:02:52.650> now<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.160> don't<00:02:53.400> have<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.580> display<00:02:53.940> or

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the videos now I don't have a display or

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.850 
the videos now I don't have a display or
anything<00:02:54.450> connected<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.230> Mac<00:02:55.380> Mini<00:02:55.410> at

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
anything connected to the Mac Mini at

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.220 
anything connected to the Mac Mini at
the<00:02:56.040> moment<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.549> simply<00:02:57.239> use<00:02:57.390> screen<00:02:57.840> sharing

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
the moment I simply use screen sharing

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.559 
the moment I simply use screen sharing
on<00:02:58.319> my<00:02:58.440> macbook<00:02:58.830> pro<00:02:58.860> drag<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.850> video<00:03:00.090> file<00:03:00.330> in

description and tags and everything on
another<00:03:08.850> system<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.420> don't<00:03:09.690> do<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.200> the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
another system I don't do that on the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.410 
another system I don't do that on the
Mac<00:03:10.590> Mini<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.370> at<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.670> moment<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:12.090> guys<00:03:12.209> can

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
Mac Mini so at the moment you guys can

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.030 
Mac Mini so at the moment you guys can
probably<00:03:12.540> tell<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:13.170> not<00:03:13.350> much<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.769> server

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
probably tell it's not much of a server

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.370 
probably tell it's not much of a server
basically<00:03:14.430> all<00:03:14.880> it's<00:03:15.120> doing<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.600> being<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
basically all it's doing is being a

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.470 
basically all it's doing is being a
slave<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.980> uploading<00:03:17.549> my<00:03:17.670> YouTube<00:03:18.180> videos

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
slave and uploading my YouTube videos

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.630 
slave and uploading my YouTube videos
overnight<00:03:19.170> or<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:19.769> worse<00:03:19.980> comes<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.310> worst

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
overnight or if worse comes to worst

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.610 
overnight or if worse comes to worst
during<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.570> day<00:03:21.750> if<00:03:21.989> I've<00:03:22.109> had<00:03:22.260> some<00:03:22.470> home

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
during the day if I've had some home

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.620 
during the day if I've had some home
delay<00:03:22.950> for<00:03:23.220> whatever<00:03:23.370> reason<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.269> do<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.600> a

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
delay for whatever reason so I do have a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.880 
delay for whatever reason so I do have a
lot<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.900> future<00:03:25.200> plans<00:03:25.440> for<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.709> Mac<00:03:25.859> Mini

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
lot of future plans for the Mac Mini

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.890 
lot of future plans for the Mac Mini
there<00:03:26.579> are<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.760> couple<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.269> external<00:03:27.660> hard

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
there are a couple of external hard

know cooling down and all this but you

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.340 
know cooling down and all this but you
know<00:04:15.150> that's<00:04:15.540> debatable

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350
