00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.240
 and developed time of rotterdam 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.310
 together with building almost 15 years 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.390
 So you already knew that something was whole 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.390
 special in is very special 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.480
 the concept of koolhaas is the concept 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.730
 from the vertical position 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.769
 That means it is very small 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.820
 area you very many different 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.519
 functions 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.460
 integrated into the building 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.199
 naturally a lot of quality 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.460
 anyway its place by the architecture 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:44.500
 but also by the finish of the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.049
 apartments are city they people you 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.750
 know how to appreciate quality and that 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:51.309
 has not so much to do with money 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.510
 my life to do my honor with how you 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.510
 in life 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.699
 smallest apartment in the rotterdam 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.650
 60 square meters two rooms and we 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.090
 have actually challenged ourselves to 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.070
 turn this into a 5-room apartment 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.740
 There are of course accustomed to Netherlands 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.800
 think of rooms and square meters 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.909
 while in practice, not entirely 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.939
 is needed 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.009
 a space saving furniture contribute to 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.270
 being able to use multiple ways 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.270
 of rooms 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.320
 it is furniture that is small 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.320
 undergoes a metamorphosis 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.810
 what a couch is during the day or a 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.160
 workplace then in bed in the evening 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.050
 in the living room 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.380
 we have a couch with a bed over it 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.760
 from customer we have a dresser with 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.580
 chairs that we can put on the wall 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.430
 hang out and have a bedroom with one 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.500
 workplace where also a bed out and clap and 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.670
 that way we can get to 60 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.740
 square meter 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.770
 work and sleep normally and 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.770
 to dine 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.920
 Of course it's the best thing to do 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.140
 show what in a small apartment 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.180
 you can do it all but you can 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.330
 hence a large apartment so 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.790
 share that you are in a room and workplace and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.830
 guest spot and so the room and closet 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.660
 design with must look nice 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.600
 it must also be comfortable 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.880
 and it must work well so it 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.710
 must be technically so innovative and 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.500
 Be ingenious with the whole 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.560
 easily converted 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.560
 to become
