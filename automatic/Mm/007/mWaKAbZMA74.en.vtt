00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.809 
why they had to bump it out here for the
email<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:14.319> next<00:02:14.590> six<00:02:14.800> is<00:02:14.950> just<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.220> bigger<00:02:15.430> it's

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
email the next six is just a bigger it's

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.590 
email the next six is just a bigger it's
a<00:02:15.940> wider<00:02:16.209> overall<00:02:16.840> camera<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:17.890> flush

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
a wider overall camera so this is flush

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.150 
a wider overall camera so this is flush
so<00:02:19.600> that's<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.930> guess<00:02:19.989> why<00:02:20.320> they<00:02:20.500> did<00:02:20.980> why<00:02:21.130> they

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
so that's I guess why they did why they

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.860 
so that's I guess why they did why they
did<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.489> they<00:02:21.820> went<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.239> smallest<00:02:22.540> form

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
did that they went for the smallest form

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.540 
did that they went for the smallest form
factor<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.410> lightest<00:02:23.739> weight<00:02:23.890> possible<00:02:24.430> at

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
factor the lightest weight possible at

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.699 
factor the lightest weight possible at
the<00:02:24.700> next<00:02:25.060> five<00:02:25.209> are<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.959> can<00:02:26.080> see<00:02:26.260> how<00:02:26.380> thin

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
the next five are you can see how thin

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.290 
the next five are you can see how thin
it<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.900> adjust<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.350> camera<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.769> little<00:02:29.830> bit

email lenses or forty nine millimeters
which<00:03:16.390> makes<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:16.780> great<00:03:16.989> if<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.320> have<00:03:17.500> a

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
which makes it great if you have a

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.520 
which makes it great if you have a
polarizer<00:03:18.310> or<00:03:18.549> something<00:03:18.820> like<00:03:18.940> that<00:03:19.530> also

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
polarizer or something like that also

polarizer or something like that also
this<00:03:20.650> lens<00:03:20.860> is<00:03:20.980> quite<00:03:21.250> light<00:03:21.549> it<00:03:21.760> only<00:03:21.880> weighs

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
this lens is quite light it only weighs

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.740 
this lens is quite light it only weighs
5.5<00:03:22.470> ounces<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:24.790> was<00:03:25.030> quite<00:03:25.269> surprised<00:03:25.630> I

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
5.5 ounces and I was quite surprised I

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.520 
5.5 ounces and I was quite surprised I
thought<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:25.930> was<00:03:26.019> gonna<00:03:26.079> be<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.260> little<00:03:26.380> bit

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
thought I was gonna be a little bit

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.500 
thought I was gonna be a little bit
heavier<00:03:26.829> than<00:03:26.890> that<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:28.299> other<00:03:28.329> thing

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
heavier than that and the other thing

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.210 
heavier than that and the other thing
that's<00:03:28.690> important<00:03:29.200> about<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.530> lens<00:03:29.799> is<00:03:29.980> when

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
that's important about this lens is when

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.750 
that's important about this lens is when
you<00:03:30.310> factor<00:03:30.850> in<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> crop<00:03:31.510> factor<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:32.560> 15<00:03:32.950> the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
you factor in the crop factor of 15 the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.530 
you factor in the crop factor of 15 the
actual<00:03:34.359> focal<00:03:34.720> length<00:03:34.930> works<00:03:35.230> out<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.609> 50<00:03:36.609> 2.5

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
actual focal length works out to 50 2.5

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.020 
actual focal length works out to 50 2.5
millimeter<00:03:38.079> equivalent<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:39.400> it's<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.940> great

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
millimeter equivalent so it's a great

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.000 
millimeter equivalent so it's a great
focal<00:03:40.720> length<00:03:40.870> for<00:03:41.109> portraits<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.890> know

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
focal length for portraits you know

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.580 
focal length for portraits you know
inside<00:03:42.489> low<00:03:42.850> light<00:03:43.090> good<00:03:43.690> for<00:03:43.900> kids<00:03:43.930> things

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
inside low light good for kids things

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.520 
inside low light good for kids things
like<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:44.769> yeah<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.579> there<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.030> can<00:03:46.180> see<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
like that yeah so there you can see the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.470 
like that yeah so there you can see the
large<00:03:47.920> glass<00:03:48.310> elements<00:03:48.820> required<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.359> get

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
large glass elements required to get

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.740 
large glass elements required to get
that<00:03:49.660> f-18<00:03:50.500> you<00:03:51.370> could<00:03:51.519> see<00:03:51.760> how<00:03:51.940> big<00:03:52.150> glass<00:03:52.450> is

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
that f-18 you could see how big glass is

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.890 
that f-18 you could see how big glass is
very<00:03:53.140> nice<00:03:53.410> very<00:03:53.889> nice<00:03:54.389> i'm<00:03:55.389> using<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.720> kit

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
very nice very nice i'm using the kit

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.300 
very nice very nice i'm using the kit
lens<00:03:55.930> by<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.380> way<00:03:56.560> on<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.799> next<00:03:57.040> six<00:03:57.250> to

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
lens by the way on the next six to

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.960 
lens by the way on the next six to
record<00:03:57.699> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
record the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.930 
record the
so<00:03:58.810> that's<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.140> 35<00:03:59.560> millimeter<00:04:00.070> f1<00:04:00.640> not<00:04:00.790> 80

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
so that's the 35 millimeter f1 not 80

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.940 
so that's the 35 millimeter f1 not 80
here<00:04:01.180> we<00:04:01.270> got<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.540> wide<00:04:01.720> angle<00:04:01.960> the<00:04:02.620> ultra

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
here we got the wide angle the ultra

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.650 
here we got the wide angle the ultra
wide<00:04:03.130> angle<00:04:03.160> i<00:04:03.430> should<00:04:03.640> say<00:04:03.850> 10<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.270> 18

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
wide angle i should say 10 to 18

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.430 
wide angle i should say 10 to 18

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.300 
important to know about this lens is the
filter<00:04:10.210> size<00:04:10.390> is<00:04:10.600> large<00:04:10.900> it's<00:04:11.200> 62<00:04:11.590> millimeters

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
filter size is large it's 62 millimeters

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.770 
filter size is large it's 62 millimeters
as<00:04:12.460> you'll<00:04:12.610> see<00:04:12.790> as<00:04:12.820> it<00:04:13.030> comes<00:04:13.210> around<00:04:13.360> here

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
as you'll see as it comes around here

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.430 
as you'll see as it comes around here
the<00:04:14.290> front<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.950> very<00:04:15.370> big<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:17.019> lens<00:04:17.230> hood

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
the front is very big and the lens hood

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.860 
the front is very big and the lens hood
is<00:04:17.590> also<00:04:17.890> big<00:04:18.100> here's<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.489> lens<00:04:18.670> hood<00:04:18.910> it's<00:04:19.660> an

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
is also big here's the lens hood it's an

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.380 
is also big here's the lens hood it's an
F<00:04:20.019> for<00:04:20.280> maximum<00:04:21.280> aperture<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.030> it's<00:04:22.210> not<00:04:22.330> the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
F for maximum aperture so it's not the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.150 
F for maximum aperture so it's not the
fastest<00:04:22.960> but<00:04:23.170> it's<00:04:23.290> okay<00:04:23.590> in<00:04:23.770> my<00:04:23.890> opinion

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
fastest but it's okay in my opinion

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.710 
fastest but it's okay in my opinion
because<00:04:24.340> it's<00:04:24.580> an<00:04:24.670> ultra<00:04:24.910> wide<00:04:25.090> angle<00:04:25.120> so

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
because it's an ultra wide angle so

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.480 
because it's an ultra wide angle so
going<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.170> be<00:04:26.290> using<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.620> for<00:04:26.770> landscapes<00:04:27.250> and

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
going to be using it for landscapes and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.850 
going to be using it for landscapes and
things<00:04:27.640> like<00:04:27.790> that<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.870> aperture<00:04:29.410> speed

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
things like that so the aperture speed

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.590 
things like that so the aperture speed
isn't<00:04:30.190> necessarily<00:04:30.790> that<00:04:31.030> important<00:04:31.480> on<00:04:31.570> a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
isn't necessarily that important on a

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.170 
isn't necessarily that important on a
lens<00:04:31.810> like<00:04:31.900> this<00:04:32.020> in<00:04:32.410> my<00:04:32.920> opinion<00:04:33.040> but<00:04:33.910> what's

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
lens like this in my opinion but what's

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.850 
lens like this in my opinion but what's
also<00:04:34.360> nice<00:04:34.630> about<00:04:34.690> this<00:04:35.110> lens<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.530> it<00:04:35.680> has

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
also nice about this lens is it has

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.750 
also nice about this lens is it has
optical<00:04:36.430> steadyshot<00:04:36.790> great<00:04:37.780> feature<00:04:38.050> and

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
optical steadyshot great feature and

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.060 
optical steadyshot great feature and
it's<00:04:39.760> actually<00:04:39.910> eight<00:04:40.330> ounces<00:04:41.050> so<00:04:41.440> it's<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.890> few

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
it's actually eight ounces so it's a few

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.950 
it's actually eight ounces so it's a few
ounces<00:04:42.190> heavier<00:04:42.580> than<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:43.060> 35<00:04:43.480> millimeter

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
ounces heavier than the 35 millimeter

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.130 
ounces heavier than the 35 millimeter
lens<00:04:44.230> that<00:04:45.220> we<00:04:45.340> just<00:04:45.640> looked<00:04:45.820> at<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.570> there<00:04:47.050> it

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
lens that we just looked at and there it

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.530 
lens that we just looked at and there it
is<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:48.310> that's<00:04:48.490> what<00:04:48.640> it<00:04:48.670> looks<00:04:48.880> like<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.270> the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
is so that's what it looks like on the

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
is so that's what it looks like on the
next<00:04:49.900> five<00:04:50.080> are<00:04:51.870> pretty<00:04:52.870> mean-looking<00:04:53.080> lens

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
next five are pretty mean-looking lens

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.740 
next five are pretty mean-looking lens
it's<00:04:53.770> got<00:04:53.919> like<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.130> big<00:04:54.610> front<00:04:54.850> on<00:04:55.180> it<00:04:55.360> well<00:04:55.630> in

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
it's got like a big front on it well in

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.570 
it's got like a big front on it well in
so<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:55.990> actually<00:04:56.140> overlaps<00:04:56.980> a<00:04:57.190> little<00:04:57.430> bit

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
so it actually overlaps a little bit

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.080 
so it actually overlaps a little bit
when<00:04:57.730> you<00:04:57.820> put<00:04:58.000> it<00:04:58.120> on<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:59.190> kind<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.310> goes<00:05:00.640> over

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
when you put it on it kind of goes over

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.940 
when you put it on it kind of goes over
the<00:05:01.210> lens<00:05:01.390> like<00:05:01.690> a<00:05:01.720> sock<00:05:02.169> and<00:05:02.440> then<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:02.740> turns

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
the lens like a sock and then it turns

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.880 
the lens like a sock and then it turns
on<00:05:03.450> it's<00:05:04.450> a<00:05:04.480> nice<00:05:04.600> overlapping<00:05:05.140> design<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:05.530> like

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
on it's a nice overlapping design I like

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.890 
on it's a nice overlapping design I like
it<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.190> there's<00:05:07.150> plenty<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.419> room<00:05:07.510> in<00:05:07.720> there

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
it and there's plenty of room in there

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.990 
it and there's plenty of room in there
for<00:05:07.960> a<00:05:08.169> filter<00:05:08.590> excuse<00:05:09.430> me<00:05:09.580> so<00:05:09.669> you<00:05:09.760> can<00:05:09.820> still

for a filter excuse me so you can still

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.909 
for a filter excuse me so you can still
get<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.150> 62<00:05:10.840> millimeter<00:05:11.230> filter<00:05:11.530> on<00:05:11.680> there

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
get a 62 millimeter filter on there

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.790 
get a 62 millimeter filter on there
which<00:05:12.460> is<00:05:12.490> nice<00:05:13.050> alright<00:05:14.050> guys<00:05:14.229> so<00:05:14.410> it<00:05:14.650> should

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
special tests or anything like that I'll

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.150 
special tests or anything like that I'll
have<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:22.840> stuff<00:05:23.050> for<00:05:23.080> about<00:05:23.320> 20<00:05:23.620> days<00:05:23.740> or<00:05:23.950> so

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
have the stuff for about 20 days or so

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.630 
have the stuff for about 20 days or so
and<00:05:24.600> it's<00:05:25.600> going<00:05:25.720> to<00:05:25.780> be<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:25.900> rolling<00:05:26.530> review<00:05:26.919> so

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
and it's going to be a rolling review so

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.409 
and it's going to be a rolling review so
it's<00:05:27.820> just<00:05:27.940> going<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.090> be<00:05:28.150> one<00:05:28.300> of<00:05:28.330> those

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
it's just going to be one of those

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.180 
it's just going to be one of those
continuous<00:05:28.990> styles<00:05:29.380> which<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:29.710> you<00:05:30.070> know<00:05:30.100> I

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
continuous styles which is you know I

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.860 
continuous styles which is you know I
don't<00:05:30.700> know<00:05:30.850> I<00:05:30.880> think<00:05:31.000> it's<00:05:31.210> more<00:05:31.240> interactive

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
don't know I think it's more interactive

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.230 
don't know I think it's more interactive
and<00:05:31.960> more<00:05:32.169> fun<00:05:32.440> all<00:05:33.010> right<00:05:33.160> take<00:05:33.340> care
