00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.840
 to the girls and guys welcome another 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.970
 my good day I have decided to channel 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.820
 do this video since in my video 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.430
 previous or previous to another because I do not know 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.699
 In what order will I upload you have asked me 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:20.720
 than with the new iron that I have with 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.489
 the a-7 made waves want to know how 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.230
 waves are made with a plate so wide and 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.440
 Well the truth is that it is quite easy 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.630
 so good 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.100
 I thank you in the room that 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.650
 I'm recording now, as much as I 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.340
 I complained that it's not like where I was 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.140
 before I have a pretty close plug and 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.750
 as the cable is very long I can 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.460
 record them the video so great and nothing 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.070
 I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.629
 smoothed a little more the side where 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.550
 the I'll do for you to see how 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.230
 it does and it's very simple simply 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.230
 you have to take a lock 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.430
 we press it rotate and in this way and 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.430
 let's go down slowly 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.390
 and let's go and there we have our deep 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.510
 and well this is the problem they give 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.700
 these plates that you get that line and 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.000
 marked but what I do is what 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.440
 next from where I made the curl 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.409
 go back smoothly to remove 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.020
 a little bit that mark 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.470
 the scale mark for my opinion is that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.950
 you practically do not notice 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.210
 I'm going to take another lock to show you 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.960
 one simply because as with other 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.290
 plates we take and quickly we go 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.290
 going down 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.810
 and we jump and we have a very 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.810
 soft 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.270
 I what I do that the first system 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.479
 he is marked 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.640
 the plate but the other times I do not know 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.229
 has been marked is because when I 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 I'm going down I'm going to go over my extension 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.340
 for you to see 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.170
 I took the iron here and here 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.150
 I'm not squeezing the iron like 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.300
 You can see how I could squeeze it 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.000
 more but in gustre squeezing then 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.640
 marks the curl but do not remain those 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.540
 those brands so ugly that they tend to 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.340
 pull with with wide plates 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.349
 let's see what used another lock cited 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.349
 although I think it's pretty simple 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.860
 we rotate but without pressing 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.980
 and as you can see, this was almost 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.740
 it has been better because it has not been 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.630
 no type of brand 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.630
 It is very easy 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.720
 As you can see, the iron is a bit 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.930
 open and the aura a little bit and let the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.680
 hair slips and that's why it makes the wave 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.680
 so soft 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.630
 and well, I think that more or less 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.910
 the idea has been clear too 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.190
 for do 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.400
 the tips out simply 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.480
 we go down a little and as you see 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.810
 directly, the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.700
 tip is very easy and the truth is that 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.790
 since I have the iron, what is it 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.360
 for just a few days this end of 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.580
 week right in a state at home and 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.690
 always took me to the pincer and the 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.850
 iron because I like it always 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.180
 perform certain parts of my hair and 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.820
 others and make me curls and I've only 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.370
 taken to the plate and general because I 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.960
 I have been able to comb well without any type of 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.320
 problem 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.700
 and with just one device so nothing 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.770
 we see in the next video I hope that 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.770
 you liked the background a kiss
