00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.980
 product in particular that I am trying 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.770
 already for a long time and of which I am 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.860

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.160
 the prairie is of the brand I don't know if yes 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.559
 Law is fine because completely mirrored the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.769
 prairie and below you read switzerland 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.289
 because it is a Swiss brand it is a 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.800
 expensive brand 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.800
 I'll tell you right away and find it here in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.480
 Italy in the beauty points the jolie the organic 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.929
 of luxury bones are those that deal 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.370
 skin ker of high brands as precisely 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:07.650
 I would have re dior chanel and also sisley 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:14.430
 the product in question will tell you immediately 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.380
 it costs 54 euros and what's special about it 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.619
 then we're talking about a detergent 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.020
 in cream a cream detergent that is 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.530
 suitable for all skin types below 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.270
 the board 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.729
 review fourth game because i'm 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.200
 reading I wish it didn't escape me 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.329
 nothing for all skin types and I have it 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.310
 found particularly effective on 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.570
 mine that as you know well is a skin 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.890
 dried a type of dry skin has of the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.850
 anti aging properties inside and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.090
 soothing hydrates purifies decongest 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.159
 calms and relieves the signs of stress 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.299
 but not just because it just goes 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.859
 decongest all that is i 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.020
 Aggressive factors for our skin 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.820
 it can't be cold or just it 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.060
 stress all the rednesses that there is 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.550
 found in the face of an action I repeat 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.780
 smoothing therefore it goes to clean 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:16.080
 and to eliminate dead cells but the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.170
 emollient feeling that leaves already from 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.080
 first use and you will see it if you have 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.520
 way to try it is something 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.560
 spectacular also give it how 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.530
 cleanser to remove makeup but me 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.290
 I definitely recommend you 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.250
 use it mainly for the rest 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.990
 of the face 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.960
 I suggest you go and use the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.000
 your usual eye makeup remover 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.440
 because it doesn't really go to eliminate 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.810
 all the makeup even more 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.810
 resistant 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.760
 dedicate yourself first to cleaning and cleaning 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.200
 eye storage then passed 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.090
 to this on the whole face for how much 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.920
 concerns foundation and all the things that 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.660
 you have on your face 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.730
 if you have a light make-up I repeat it 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.210
 it goes to remove but in my opinion it is one 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.090
 waste use it to remove make-up here 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.920
 this is an advice I give you 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.350
 we remember the natural institutions inside 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.340
 both of plant origin and origin 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.750
 animal 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.670
 unlike the sisley that makes them 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.180
 only of vegetable origin we give 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.760
 nothing inside and it is precisely one 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.720
 water-soluble creamy sauce 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.480
 and I also tell you how I use it 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.150
 I will show you how to do it in the meantime 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.010
 presents the product is a creamy sauce 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.439
 precisely white 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.489
 here it is girls really enough 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:40.799
 little and a 200 ml tube of tula 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.629
 I came here quite reaches 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.420
 of water is ending and I tell you immediately 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.510
 that I will buy it back immediately 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.430
 here it is and you wet your face and 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.140
 go just to apply the cream 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.709
 massage it well with your fingertips 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.620
 then what I do and go do 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.420
 massaging action using the 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.579
 sephora silicone disk this 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.650
 sephora sells make it so many types 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.090
 You also found on ebay short ones 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.599
 with the pongolini that are particularly 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.540
 I go for a nice massage 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.850
 vigorous because in fact more than to delegate 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.150
 the face to eliminate dead cells does 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.060
 yes we give the institutions inside three 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.690
 penetrate optimally precisely 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.310
 in the skin after making the diskette 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.210
 after having passed and massaged the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.720
 diskette 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.550
 leaves it in place even five minutes e 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.570
 girls feeling at the time of 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.479
 rinsing is like the one that will seem to you 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.280
 to have also passed the moisturizer 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.650
 leaves you the skin of a soft that is 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.910
 a phenomenal thing I'm addressing 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.710
 all the girls they have 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.580
 especially dry skin and have 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.080
 problems precisely of chapped parts 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.470
 this really helps you 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.820
 an action on the skin that is really the 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.349
 end of the world I would not be here at 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:08.159
 talk about it because it is really all worth 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:10.630
 money you spend what you have 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.790
 advice is to go precisely and not 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.120
 luxury beauty point to make you give a 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.680
 small tester to try it vi 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.470
 you will definitely notice that the first one 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.740
 use had already left the skin 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.870
 ultra soft ultra clean brighter 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.410
 since I really use it for me 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.050
 a world has opened up a world of 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.720
 because I never found a cleaner 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.660
 that has these properties tips 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.520
 I repeat emollienti is also good for the 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.380
 oily skin because it is still alive 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.140
 balancing action but at the same 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.500
 time does not go to attack your skin but 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.540
 the fabulous feeling hydrates you and 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.730
 for this reason I feel like doing a review 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.760
 dedicated among other things I read one 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.580
 halley make up review where it 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.350
 it gave precisely with an ideal detergent 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.720
 for all those appliances 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.520
 facial cleansing like the clari sonic 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:09.490
 and the like is a cleaner but you have seen 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.280
 full-bodied does not make foam remains this 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.020
 white cream but girls I repeat to you 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.620
 that feeling at the time of 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.060
 rinsing is something fabulous 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.250
 so I really feel like 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.250
 recommend this product and 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.280
 use it exactly as I hate you 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.810
 explained not simply 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.790
 massaging it with fingertips 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.820
 but going to do an action a little bit 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.560
 more decisive precisely to ensure that 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.610
 emollient properties inside 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:43.420
 they can really give their best 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:46.260
 then I don't know what to tell you the tube and 200 ml 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.760
 I see again with a cost of 54 euros but 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.580
 really if you have the opportunity to 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.500
 try this I strap rhinestones between 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.280
 otherwise I would not recommend staying here a 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.720
 talk about it I recommend let me know if 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.460
 you have tried it 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.420
 if you have tried other things of the 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.620
 the prairie brand and nothing is enough 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.720
 review ends here 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.370
 I hope I have been useful remain a 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.370
 kiss and the next video
