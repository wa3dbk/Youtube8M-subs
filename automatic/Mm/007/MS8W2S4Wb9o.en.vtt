00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello to all guys from spaceshames are 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.190
 doctor mir 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.519
 today we are back with analysis of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.610
 Titan full weapons taking you into this 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.840
 new weapon case for pilots am 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.980
 talking about the gun 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.680
 smart mk5 then a pistol we can say 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.160
 automatic leakage almost apart from the rate 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.560
 of fire that will allow you to 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.359
 easily juggled against the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.730
 your enemies 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.099
 so let's start immediately as usual from 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.230
 damage of the gun that has damage that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.660
 strangely, he has neither a minimum nor a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.730
 maximum whatever the range I have 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.540
 seen will be able to admire the damage will be 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.050
 always of 67 therefore independently 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.360
 from the repeated distance it will be 67 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.520
 obviously however there is a limit in the sense 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.030
 of without it can be any however 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.190
 must be between 20 and 28 58 meters 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.020
 so this is actually a bit strange 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.579
 what because however to the detriment of the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.379
 gun does not change but there is still a 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.990
 distance at which this obviously does 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.900
 after we say after 67 it continues to go down 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.490
 so the best thing in my opinion 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
 starts to be the damage that starts at 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.330
 create when it's twenty meters 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.500
 I could explain the thing this way 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.390
 best to do in my opinion this e 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.180
 explain to you that when we are at twenty meters 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.150
 from the beginning slightly to decrease while 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.890
 when they are 28.58 meters not a weapon 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.840
 will be able to take more aim 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.229
 automatic in we should be us a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.420
 shoot our opponents and this does 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.900
 lose a lot of utility that it has 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.360
 the weapon itself what to say first 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.880
 on the rate of fire that the first thing that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.619
 we notice when we shoot that it is low 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.229
 because obviously like all guns 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.420
 it takes speed on the trigger of the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.390
 your controller or mouse 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.549
 of your keyboard and you need one 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.890
 quick enough for anyway 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.380
 irate of fire is quite low 480 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.659
 rpm so faster and you will succeed in 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.159
 move your finger on the trigger 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.420
 so to be able to shoot and more 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.879
 then you will easily eliminate the enemies 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.090
 67 I repeat the damage of the weapon against it 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.590
 pilots that against burgundy 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.110
 obviously to kill the bots is enough 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.849
 two shots or if you went aiming 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.069
 automatic one shot 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.890
 while the pilots will need three 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.810
 four hits because if not 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.620
 they are hard to find 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.269
 won in close-ups fire fire 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.830
 what I don't like about the gun though 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.690
 I'll tell you right away the fact that anyway 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.830
 for pilots they require a coupling 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.060
 very very long so if for the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.459
 spectre for the usual simple there is a 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.930
 very fast coupling so not 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.239
 it happens for the pilots because you have to 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.780
 wait three times than the weapon 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.680
 make an appointment on the enemy then 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.540
 it's not the best 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.370
 many cases he has a rifle anyway 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.530
 an automatic escape weapon then 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.660
 fully automatic as one 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.849
 machine gun as a euro mga ad 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.250
 example, however, he will have won it in a manner 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.510
 very very easy we talk now about the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.239
 damage against the titans which varies between 40 and 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.790
 10 therefore not really a weapon with which 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.340
 you would go against a titan while if 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.530
 go in rodeo mode and very good 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.440
 because in fact it is very good and excellent 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.480
 it is very good, if you go 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.030
 against the titans in rodeo mode is 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.040
 excellent because we will have a damage of 200 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.170
 therefore much much higher than 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.980
 example a rifle r101 with the others 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.829
 machine gun for example a car 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.750
 all.re 97 compact what to say about 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.730
 Greek time really fast 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.530
 they were used to the fairly obvious times 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.700
 however a little bit important for 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.829
 regarding the rifles and 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.450
 machine gun ll mg 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.849
 here we go on the short time for which 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.290
 we will go with 1.45 seconds if we have 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.040
 still a blow in the barrel in the magazine 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.739
 and 1.49 seconds if we have a soccer player 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.040
 sky so pretty much the same thing 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.290
 what to say about the shots we have 12 of 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.480
 charger can extend can be there 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.190
 useful no but this is up to you to choose 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.030
 why prefer an accessory in the evening 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.950
 such as the improved aiming that 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.900
 increase the distance within the can 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.410
 being able to take your enemies 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.780
 then hook them automatically vi 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.070
 I said 12 shots in the magazine 120 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.500
 total you bring with you then 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.260
 another 10 refills what to say for 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.130
 regarding the accuracy of the weapon 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.960
 when you shoot in bursts there will be 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.210
 I could not stand where it poured anyway 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.420
 about 20 percent of your shots 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.710
 will miss the target 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.840
 you must be me is enough 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.010
 more than precise because rare though 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.560
 you have the sight pointed at the enemy 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.120
 you will easily take it so here it is 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.490
 all invite you to go through my channel 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.830
 person you find in description like 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.590
 and as always thank you always 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.480
 subscribers while for this video there is 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.980
 I suggest you leave me a comment indeed 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.720
 I ask you to leave me a comment for 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.940
 the next weapon 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.240
 now there are not many pistols left 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.980
 or in any case weapons dedicated to pilots 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.590
 I thought I'd bring you in this case 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.260
 They are then return to their guns 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.880
 of assault that we miss precisely this 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.560
 rome for this category 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.000
 let him know with a comment you make 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.560
 to know even if the idea is fine 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.780
 so bring you that come in the next 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.430
 episode and is still Dr. mir ai 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.690
 coming where on gay and space games

 greetings to all bye
