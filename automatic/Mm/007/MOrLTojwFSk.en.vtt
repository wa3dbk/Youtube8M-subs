00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.180 
its back end because the snake likes to
eat<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.210> headfirst<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:07.649> important

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
eat it headfirst and that's important

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.249 
eat it headfirst and that's important
especially<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.270> food<00:02:09.479> items<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:10.050> bigger

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
especially as the food items get bigger

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.520 
especially as the food items get bigger
because<00:02:11.069> if<00:02:11.700> they<00:02:12.660> eat

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
because if they eat

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.300 
because if they eat
food<00:02:13.880> backends<00:02:14.880> first<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.959> arms<00:02:16.830> stick<00:02:17.130> out

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
food backends first the arms stick out

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.010 
food backends first the arms stick out
and<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.970> lot<00:02:18.150> more<00:02:18.270> difficult<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:18.870> them

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
and it's a lot more difficult for them

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.809 
and it's a lot more difficult for them
to<00:02:19.140> swallow<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.770> sometimes<00:02:20.520> they'll<00:02:20.670> even

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
to swallow and sometimes they'll even

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.240 
to swallow and sometimes they'll even
spit<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.270> out<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.690> start<00:02:22.020> over<00:02:22.170> with<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.950> head

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
spit it out and start over with the head

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.630 
spit it out and start over with the head
once<00:02:24.060> they<00:02:24.270> swallow<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:25.050> prey<00:02:25.319> they'll<00:02:26.250> start

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
once they swallow the prey they'll start

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.290 
once they swallow the prey they'll start
to<00:02:26.790> move<00:02:26.970> their<00:02:27.270> body<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:28.740> move<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.819> food<00:02:30.060> once

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
to move their body to move the food once

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.840 
to move their body to move the food once
it's<00:02:30.510> inside<00:02:30.930> down<00:02:31.620> into<00:02:32.069> their<00:02:32.220> stomach<00:02:32.640> and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
it's inside down into their stomach and

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.170 
it's inside down into their stomach and
they<00:02:33.390> do<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.750> by<00:02:34.430> turning<00:02:35.430> from<00:02:35.850> side<00:02:36.150> to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
they do that by turning from side to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.590 
they do that by turning from side to
side<00:02:36.410> next<00:02:37.410> we're<00:02:37.620> going<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.770> talk<00:02:38.010> about
