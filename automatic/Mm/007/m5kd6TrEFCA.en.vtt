00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.009
 Hello everyone my name is rose.it and I am the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.469
 fourth generation of a family of 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.930
 The coachbuilders have already been there for several years 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.149
 manufacturers have replaced the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.449
 transparent part the projector a 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.860
 called plastic material 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.769
 polycarbonate this material however yes 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.739
 opacifies es yellowing with the sun and 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.680
 the atmospheric agents lose so much 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.979
 transparency and light intensity 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.350
 I remind you that the light intensity 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:00.720
 is measured in lux is a beacon for 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 to be efficient must have one 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.320
 measurement ranging between 3,750 and 90,000 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.680
 lux at a distance method for headlights 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.530
 low beam and between 20 thousand and 150 thousand 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 lux increase in distance for the headlights 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.409
 brights 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.810
 it is an aesthetic factor but 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.700
 especially your safety 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.600
 I often hear that the only solution 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.710
 is the replacement of the projector 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.100
 we consider that in average an 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.970
 one car course projector from the 200s 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.310
 to the 400 euros each so it would be one 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.850
 costly expense to sustain 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.790
 I also saw abrasive pastes or kits from 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.240
 insert any of in the house 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.150
 these, however, give an excellent result 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.729
 here thanks to the latest technologies 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.850
 always relying on professionals 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.460
 we will have the perfect result as you have 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.680
 seen from the video the technician has provided 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.330
 to completely disassemble the bumper 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.570
 front of the vehicle 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.670
 this to allow you to extract 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.110
 both projectors are recommended 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.090
 provide for the removal of the headlights for 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.549
 avoid the presence of gaskets 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.540
 around the transparent plastic part 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.730
 of the lighthouse 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.189
 you could indeed risk it 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.680
 paint the lighthouse creating a 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.470
 depression of the paint for a long time 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.740
 going could also peel like 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.680
 you see once the projector is disassembled 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.740
 proceed with complete sanding 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.100
 of the projector with various disks 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.970
 abrasives from 15 to 15 outside 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.800
 this to allow for polishing 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.650
 completely the transparent part of the 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.460
 I am making the passages with the diskette 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.020
 five starting from a weight of 240 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.930
 to get to a diskette 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.300
 sponged once polished 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.180
 completely the lighthouse will pass us 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.160
 to the second phase which is that of 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.380
 painting before moving to 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.660
 painting will have to go with 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.510
 the anti-water silicone remover 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.820
 the electrostaticity and degrease the whole 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.650
 transparent part of the projector 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.840
 then let's mask our own 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.060
 projectors trying to stay a lot 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.570
 be careful at the edges of the part 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.570
 transparent 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.820
 so here we are ready to paint the 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.190
 our projector the master 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.490
 painter will then pass two hands of 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:51.720
 painting with in three time a half 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:53.850
 drying and paint used is 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.760
 an acrylic paint for plastics of 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.580
 polycarbonate with a barrera filter 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.100
 against UV rays once expected 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.170
 paint drying time 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.560
 we can move on to unmask the 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:12.300
 so we are ready projectors 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:15.390
 reassemble everything there are other aspects 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.239
 not to underestimate the risk of not 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.730
 pass the car overhaul and 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.550
 risk of getting a fine if you come 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.040
 stop the assessing agent can 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.630
 distinguish application cases with 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:34.800
 the articles 71 72 78 and 79 therefore the 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.850
 fine can vary from 80 to 318 euros e 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.370
 some points deducted from the license 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.410
 once the projectors are installed 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.940
 we will pass to the verifications of the 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.940
 functionality of the bulbs 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.190
 I therefore remind you that it is mandatory 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.280
 always switch on the low beam lights 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.430
 the position lights and that of the 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:17.240
 license plate in any extraurban road e 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:20.000
 on the highway we will notice all day 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.200
 so the big difference between a 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.570
 refurbished projector and projector 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.970
 opacified I hope this tutorial there 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.970
 whether the next hello is waiting for you 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.350
 the word
