00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.259
 the capable arc is the place that the metric 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.100
 of two vertices from all angles 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.560
 whose sides pass through two points 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.310
 in other words at the time happens is 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.750
 an arc of a circle that determines 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.930
 all the points from which 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.690
 we will see with a certain angle the 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.450
 distance between point do 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.140
 in today's video we are going to discuss the 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.040
 capable of 30 degrees of a segment to 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.170
 p 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.910
 that is, we will mark a bow that 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.210
 will determine all points from the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.300
 which will see this segment with 30 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.350
 degrees we start with the diaz drawing and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.520
 we will see more clearly what 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.150
 means something capable and how it is 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.160
 this is our bird segment to which 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.710
 we want to treat you the arc capable of 30 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.170
 degrees to determine all the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.230
 points from which they could leave 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.840
 angles with vertices of 30 degrees and 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.970
 whose sides pass through there and by me what 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.270
 first we will do will be to draw the average 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.549
 segment segment ab 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.009
 you already know with a measure superior to 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.710
 half of the bird segment we draw arcs 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.320
 that are corrected in a point and we join them 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.659
 with a line that must be perpendicular 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.870
 and divide the paper segment into two 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.920
 equal parts 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.880
 then 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.100
 under segment ap and starting from 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.100
 one of those points in this case from 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.759
 from there we will draw an angle of 30 grain 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.509
 whose vertex is in the point to mark 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.509
 the 30 degrees 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.820
 and we draw the side that we are missing 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.000
 to have that angle of 30 degrees 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 under the bird segment 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.270
 now starting from that red line that 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.270
 we have drawn with the 30 degrees 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.270
 we will place 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.909
 90 degrees in the opposite direction 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.340
 we have drawn 30 jobs and 90 now in 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.340
 the opposite direction up 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.460
 in that sense of agreement starting from 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.060
 the red line from the bottom up 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:32.270
 we see that the line we have drawn 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.270
 last cut to pediatrics was a point 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.550
 that point will be the center of the arc capable 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:44.350
 from the efe point 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.950
 now we go to the compass we do center in 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.950
 the point c 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.640
 we open it to any of the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.420
 points 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.420
 does not matter 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.910
 and we try 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.020
 the arc capable in this case we have a 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.770
 little bit of the video but good 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.110
 would be our arc capable of 30 degrees 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.180
 the bird segment this means that 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.550
 from any point from this arch 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.640
 from the point that we take any 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.920
 we can see with 90 degree angle 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.620
 the segment has to be seen any 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.700
 we could draw angles of 30 degrees 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.780
 passing through the point b as see 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.050
 we are drawing angles with vertices in 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.730
 the arch and that its sides pass now and 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.680
 to see 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.739
 and all these angles have 30 degrees 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.180
 from any point of the arch could be 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.180
 trace an angle of 30 degrees 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.370
 Needless to say, under the segment 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.570
 have there been another capable arch that also 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.080
 would determine point with which 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.270
 we would see the segment ap with angle of 30 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.030
 degrees to treat them only 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.640
 we will have to do everything we have 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.180
 said of this video but in the sense 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.640
 opposite down well this is the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.310
 capable arc and traced that at the beginning 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.800
 it may be something valuable but that 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.560
 I assure you it is very useful for problems 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.970
 more complex geometry then to everything and 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.970
 see you in the next video
