00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
you know feel ballplayer and you have to

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.979 
you know feel ballplayer and you have to
rely<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.220> other<00:02:17.370> people<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.730> go<00:02:18.630> get<00:02:18.840> your

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
shots so say he doesn't need that I mean

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.350 
shots so say he doesn't need that I mean
he<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.100> work<00:02:23.280> hard<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.700> get<00:02:23.790> his<00:02:23.940> own<00:02:24.090> thing

he can work hard to get his own thing

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.789 
he can work hard to get his own thing
because<00:02:24.720> he<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.049> ball<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:25.530> well<00:02:25.650> and
