 How about friends I hope you are very well 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.580
 this time I share a 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.559
 application to play our 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.150
 games go to foot redundancy 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:16.480
 speed I also share a page in 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.669
 this page we will find most of 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.759
 the foot games pib and for about 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.440
 decent servers and good without more than 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:30.160
 say then let's start 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:34.360
 [Music] 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.980
 the page is mu desk the link I will leave 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.290
 in the description of the video as always 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.260
 and good when entering the page as 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.200
 will give account is a list with order 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.090
 alphabetical in them we will find 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.850
 the different games according to the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.920
 name this we can do also 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.019
 from the cell phone browser but I 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.960
 I sincerely recommend more from a 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:59.890
 browser on the computer since 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.600
 we will avoid a lot of good publicity now 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.100
 if we focus on the page it can be 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.550
 they will realize that everything is ordered 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.340
 alphabetically and we can go sailing 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.020
 either by selecting the letter to which 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.190
 we want to go or just action of 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.470
 scroll down in my case then I 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.720
 I'm going to find a game that I like for 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.080
 to see how it is downloaded 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.350
 [Music] 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.350
 Y 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.420
 [Music] 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.700
 i 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.150
 good the game that I chose is the ipyc 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.930
 planet how can you tell after 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.710
 of the name comes the version in this case 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.159
 is European or American and followed by the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.170
 server that is hosted and good to 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.659
 The user is shown below 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.490
 the game went up 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.759
 once we select the game that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.860
 we want to open another tab and in 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.490
 she will come the game data the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.960
 format the weight and download link 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.560
 how can you account for this game 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.890
 weighs a giga and a half almost and good we 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.769
 let's go to the download link will open 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.769
 another tab more and we'll have to wait 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.850
 to make our download to 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.940
 then the game is in mega in the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.890
 mega server and just enough to give it 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.650
 click to download button to 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.200
 then depending on the width 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.530
 of our internet band will be 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.360
 the time it will take to download 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.460
 sometimes the games come 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.770
 parts simply with unzipping a 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.870
 part of it and of course they ask us 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.300
 password verify in the post what is 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.710
 the password once this is done 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.500
 we can decompress the game in 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.900
 any part of the computer in my 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.510
 case is the desk we just drag and 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.060
 alone is going to decompress and good 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.190
 now it's all left to copy the game 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.440
 downloaded to any folder of the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.440
 phone and open it with the application 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.700
 and good friend and it only remains to look for the 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.570
 game on the route where they saved it and already 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.070
 the emulator will do all the rest 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.670
 obviously, the more powerful the 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.160
 cellphone in clear quotes will be better 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.770
 its execution of the game it is possible to say that no 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.990
 all games will be fluid and everything 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.620
 it depends on the phone and also if the 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.540
 programmer or the developer rather 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.690
 optimized that game well it seems to me that 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.940
 there is a list of optimized games 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.460
 If so, I will leave the list in the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.040
 Video description along with everything 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.690
 necessary and good friends without more than 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.420
 tell them then I hope you have them 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.560

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.970
 subscribe that they should like to comment and 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.510

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.510

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.650
 you do not have 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.340
 [Music] 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.340
