well the first movie was an origin story
of<00:00:09.030> these<00:00:09.179> characters<00:00:09.929> coming<00:00:10.260> together<00:00:10.490> and

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
of these characters coming together and

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.669 
of these characters coming together and
there<00:00:12.120> are<00:00:12.240> real<00:00:12.450> advantages<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:13.380> doing<00:00:13.469> an

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
there are real advantages to doing an

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.670 
there are real advantages to doing an
origin<00:00:14.130> story<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:15.150> movie<00:00:15.360> begins<00:00:15.929> with<00:00:16.230> this

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
origin story this movie begins with this

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.920 
origin story this movie begins with this
group<00:00:16.980> already<00:00:17.460> together<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.720> not

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
group already together and it's not

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.390 
group already together and it's not
meant<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:19.410> people<00:00:19.650> who've<00:00:19.890> seen<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> first

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
meant for people who've seen the first

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.010 
meant for people who've seen the first
film<00:00:20.609> either<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:21.359> don't<00:00:21.510> need<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.840> seen

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
film either you don't need to have seen

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.140 
film either you don't need to have seen
any<00:00:22.230> Star<00:00:22.470> Trek<00:00:22.680> before<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.580> see<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.880> movie

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
any Star Trek before to see this movie

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.179 
any Star Trek before to see this movie
but<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> idea<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.830> group<00:00:26.039> of

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
but the idea is that it's this group of

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.800 
but the idea is that it's this group of
people<00:00:26.310> who<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:26.670> being<00:00:26.910> tested<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.720> way

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
people who are being tested in a way

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.019 
people who are being tested in a way
they<00:00:27.930> don't<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.170> been<00:00:28.260> tested<00:00:28.529> before

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
they don't have been tested before

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.209 
they don't have been tested before
especially<00:00:30.349> one<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> main<00:00:31.830> character

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
especially one of the main character

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.190 
especially one of the main character
played<00:00:32.250> by<00:00:32.399> Chris<00:00:32.700> Pine<00:00:32.910> who<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.960> has<00:00:34.079> to

studio sort of required us to shoot in
3d<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.260> said<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:51.030> the

3d they said we have to do that for the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.959 
3d they said we have to do that for the
economics<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.500> know<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.520> really

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
economics of it you know so I was really

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.459 
economics of it you know so I was really
bummed<00:00:54.149> because<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.629> I'm<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> huge<00:00:55.260> fan<00:00:55.289> of

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
bummed because I I'm not a huge fan of

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.330 
bummed because I I'm not a huge fan of
3d<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:56.070> all

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
3d at all

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.000 
3d at all
so<00:00:56.969> approaching<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.480> thing<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.050> went<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.829> very

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
so approaching this thing I went in very

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.700 
so approaching this thing I went in very
cynically<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.699> I<00:01:00.359> knew<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.320> wanted<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.620> shoot

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
cynically and I knew I wanted to shoot

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.410 
cynically and I knew I wanted to shoot
the<00:01:01.800> movie<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.219> film<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.030> knew<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> wanted<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the movie on film and I knew I wanted to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.620 
the movie on film and I knew I wanted to
shoot<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.979> anamorphic<00:01:04.979> Lee<00:01:05.240> which<00:01:06.240> means<00:01:06.450> we

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
shoot it anamorphic Lee which means we

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.140 
shoot it anamorphic Lee which means we
couldn't<00:01:07.049> shoot<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.320> native<00:01:07.830> 3d<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> wanted

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
couldn't shoot it native 3d but I wanted

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.190 
couldn't shoot it native 3d but I wanted
to<00:01:09.210> make<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> version<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> movie<00:01:10.080> that

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
to make the version of the movie that

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
to make the version of the movie that
was<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.979> version<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.340> wanted<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> 2d

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
was the version I wanted to make in 2d

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
was the version I wanted to make in 2d
and<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.960> thought<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.409> augment<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and I thought if we can augment it and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.240 
and I thought if we can augment it and
make<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.280> even<00:01:14.430> cooler<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:15.150> 3d<00:01:15.540> great<00:01:16.250> well

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
make it even cooler in 3d great well

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.530 
make it even cooler in 3d great well
luckily<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:17.939> working<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.240> an<00:01:18.330> amazing

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
luckily we're working with an amazing

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.560 
luckily we're working with an amazing
stereo<00:01:19.259> firm<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.770> 3d<00:01:20.430> crew<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> we've<00:01:21.420> been

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
stereo firm and 3d crew and we've been

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.510 
stereo firm and 3d crew and we've been
doing<00:01:22.140> work<00:01:22.320> converting<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> movie<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
doing work converting the movie and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399 
doing work converting the movie and
there's<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.909> myth<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> movie

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
there's this myth that if you do a movie

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.740 
there's this myth that if you do a movie
that's<00:01:26.009> not<00:01:26.310> shot<00:01:26.670> natively<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.210> 3d<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> can't

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that's not shot natively in 3d it can't

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.999 
that's not shot natively in 3d it can't
look<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.020> good<00:01:28.140> which<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.409> absolutely<00:01:28.860> not

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
look as good which is absolutely not

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.490 
look as good which is absolutely not
true<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:30.299> look<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> movie<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.380> there

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
true the look of the movie I think there

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.660 
true the look of the movie I think there
are<00:01:31.530> some<00:01:31.650> tricks<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.100> techniques<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.610> are

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
are some tricks and techniques that are

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.679 
are some tricks and techniques that are
being<00:01:32.790> used<00:01:32.880> they've<00:01:33.270> never<00:01:33.450> been<00:01:33.570> used

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
being used they've never been used

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.140 
being used they've never been used
before<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.470> look<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.009> 3d<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.030> know

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
before and look at this 3d is you know

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.690 
before and look at this 3d is you know
is<00:01:36.570> beyond<00:01:37.350> what<00:01:37.650> we've<00:01:37.920> seen<00:01:38.100> before<00:01:38.460> is

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
is beyond what we've seen before is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.270 
is beyond what we've seen before is
especially<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> IMAX<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.040> frame

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
especially because of the IMAX the frame

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.859 
especially because of the IMAX the frame
of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.460> IMAX<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.180> much<00:01:42.329> bigger<00:01:42.600> than<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
of the IMAX is so much bigger than the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.200 
of the IMAX is so much bigger than the
frame<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.439> 35-millimeter<00:01:44.130> frame<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.060> the

think<00:05:00.150> these<00:05:00.390> two<00:05:00.570> characters<00:05:01.020> naturally

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
think these two characters naturally

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.350 
think these two characters naturally
operate<00:05:03.060> from<00:05:03.330> very<00:05:03.650> differing<00:05:05.030> places<00:05:06.030> and

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
operate from very differing places and

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.080 
operate from very differing places and
this<00:05:07.110> movie<00:05:07.560> there's<00:05:07.800> no<00:05:07.950> exception<00:05:08.460> it's

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
this movie there's no exception it's

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.370 
this movie there's no exception it's
just<00:05:09.360> an<00:05:09.510> undercurrent<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:10.110> who<00:05:10.260> these

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
just an undercurrent of who these

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.280 
just an undercurrent of who these
characters<00:05:10.830> are<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.880> think<00:05:12.300> in<00:05:12.750> this<00:05:12.990> movie

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
characters are and I think in this movie

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.990 
characters are and I think in this movie
in<00:05:13.380> particular<00:05:13.500> each<00:05:14.160> of<00:05:14.340> these<00:05:14.460> characters

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
in particular each of these characters

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.860 
in particular each of these characters
learns<00:05:15.360> from<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.260> other<00:05:16.380> one<00:05:16.880> about<00:05:17.880> how<00:05:18.360> more

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
learns from the other one about how more

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.620 
learns from the other one about how more
fully<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.740> be<00:05:20.550> effective<00:05:21.000> in<00:05:21.090> their<00:05:21.180> job<00:05:21.420> and

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
fully to be effective in their job and

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.680 
fully to be effective in their job and
in<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.810> live<00:05:22.100> live<00:05:23.100> so<00:05:23.550> yeah<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.240> think<00:05:24.570> that's

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
in the live live so yeah I think that's

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.320 
in the live live so yeah I think that's
a<00:05:24.780> big<00:05:24.990> part<00:05:25.800> of<00:05:25.920> who<00:05:26.070> these<00:05:26.220> characters<00:05:26.460> are

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.110 

JJ's<00:05:30.330> uh<00:05:30.950> he<00:05:31.950> just<00:05:31.980> always<00:05:32.310> seemed<00:05:32.610> so<00:05:32.880> happy

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
JJ's uh he just always seemed so happy
