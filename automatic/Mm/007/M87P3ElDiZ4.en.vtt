the planet today and it's still very

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.710 
the planet today and it's still very
flexible<00:01:32.659> okay<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:34.490> also<00:01:34.700> has<00:01:35.150> a<00:01:35.180> lower

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
flexible okay it also has a lower

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.700 
flexible okay it also has a lower
coefficient<00:01:36.439> of<00:01:37.159> friction<00:01:37.270> than<00:01:38.270> just<00:01:38.780> the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
coefficient of friction than just the

coefficient of friction than just the
kangaroo<00:01:40.189> leather<00:01:40.250> will<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:40.880> for<00:01:41.659> most<00:01:41.750> of<00:01:41.930> us

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
kangaroo leather will so for most of us

in the palm area it has a tendency to

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.390 
in the palm area it has a tendency to
crack<00:01:53.030> okay<00:01:53.960> when<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.380> perhaps<00:01:54.560> can<00:01:55.070> sending

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
crack okay when it perhaps can sending

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
to prevent the tumbling which is really

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.630 
to prevent the tumbling which is really
key<00:02:16.670> as<00:02:16.820> well<00:02:17.500> also<00:02:18.500> keeps<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.340> glove

together<00:02:20.239> alright<00:02:20.930> because<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.470> doesn't<00:02:21.769> pull

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
together alright because it doesn't pull

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.190 
together alright because it doesn't pull
very<00:02:22.160> hard<00:02:22.370> on<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.640> seams<00:02:23.019> underneath<00:02:24.019> the

between soft and hard it's kind of

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.370 
between soft and hard it's kind of
medium<00:04:35.210> density<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:35.690> there's<00:04:35.870> plenty<00:04:36.110> of

here<00:06:17.270> at<00:06:17.539> a<00:06:17.570> pair<00:06:17.780> that<00:06:17.960> i<00:06:17.990> wore<00:06:18.289> a<00:06:18.560> robe<00:06:19.220> nice

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
here at a pair that i wore a robe nice

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.370 
here at a pair that i wore a robe nice
for<00:06:19.639> anything<00:06:19.849> no<00:06:20.120> i<00:06:20.389> think<00:06:20.449> three<00:06:20.840> seasons<00:06:21.260> or

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
for anything no i think three seasons or

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.409 
for anything no i think three seasons or
so<00:06:21.560> i<00:06:21.860> believe<00:06:22.430> i<00:06:22.520> crashed<00:06:22.820> in<00:06:23.030> them<00:06:23.120> four

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
so i believe i crashed in them four
