and<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.810> multi-touch

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and what that is is it's a multi-touch

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.740 
and what that is is it's a multi-touch
touchscreen<00:02:11.099> interface<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.360> see<00:02:12.569> this
