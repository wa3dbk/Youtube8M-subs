around 20 miles in this now got a few

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.780 
around 20 miles in this now got a few
more<00:00:30.660> miles<00:00:30.810> doing<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.199> yet<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:32.250> it's

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
more miles doing it yet but it's

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.720 
more miles doing it yet but it's
performed<00:00:33.300> superbly<00:00:33.899> actually<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:35.579> way<00:00:35.670> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
performed superbly actually the way you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.680 
performed superbly actually the way you
expect<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.239> decent<00:00:36.710> decent<00:00:37.710> GTO<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.700> one

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
expect a decent decent GTO to do one

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.080 
expect a decent decent GTO to do one
thing<00:00:39.719> i<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.170> say<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.790> seems

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
thing i can say with this one it seems

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.670 
thing i can say with this one it seems
to<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.300> completely<00:00:42.510> mechanically<00:00:43.079> standard

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
to be completely mechanically standard

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.500 
to be completely mechanically standard
and<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.309> last<00:00:44.610> owner<00:00:44.850> said<00:00:45.120> he<00:00:45.210> looked<00:00:45.390> long

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
and the last owner said he looked long

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.660 
and the last owner said he looked long
and<00:00:45.539> hard<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.289> hadn't<00:00:46.530> been<00:00:46.670> messed

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and hard for one that hadn't been messed

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.479 
and hard for one that hadn't been messed
with<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.090> dump<00:00:48.600> valves<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.280> rated<00:00:50.280> boost

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
with with dump valves and rated boost

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.340 
with with dump valves and rated boost
controllers<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.180> things<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.539> because

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
controllers and things like that because

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.139 
controllers and things like that because
of<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.280> really<00:00:53.460> smooth<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.910> drive

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
of that is really really smooth to drive

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
of that is really really smooth to drive
still<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.840> stonking<00:00:55.800> performance<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.489> it's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
still got stonking performance but it's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.529 
still got stonking performance but it's
not<00:00:58.399> by<00:00:59.399> having<00:00:59.579> an<00:00:59.730> on-off<00:00:59.940> switch<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> way

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
not by having an on-off switch the way

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.479 
not by having an on-off switch the way
that<00:01:00.719> some<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> when<00:01:01.500> they've<00:01:01.649> got<00:01:02.250> dump

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that some of the when they've got dump

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.789 
that some of the when they've got dump
valves<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.030> those<00:01:04.019> controllers<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
valves and those controllers on that

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.280 
valves and those controllers on that
they<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.280> say<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.290> mark

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
they can do and as I say it is a mark

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.780 
they can do and as I say it is a mark
too<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> six-speed<00:01:11.760> manual

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
too so it's got the six-speed manual

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.050 
too so it's got the six-speed manual
gearbox<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.520> facelifted

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
still showing in kilometers as well that

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.719 
still showing in kilometers as well that
hasn't<00:01:24.880> been<00:01:25.090> changed<00:01:25.689> but<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.320> say<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:27.430> seems

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
hasn't been changed but to say it seems

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.429 
hasn't been changed but to say it seems
to<00:01:27.850> be<00:01:27.909> a<00:01:27.939> completely<00:01:28.390> standard<00:01:28.960> on<00:01:29.049> mess<00:01:29.259> with

to be a completely standard on mess with
vehicle<00:01:29.830> around<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:33.899> just<00:01:34.899> performs<00:01:35.350> really

temperature gauge is sitting exactly on
the<00:01:43.479> halfway<00:01:43.689> point<00:01:43.899> we<00:01:44.350> just<00:01:44.380> come<00:01:44.680> through

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
the halfway point we just come through

00:01:44.890 --> 00:02:00.610 
the halfway point we just come through
