00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
was for me is in infant position in a

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.479 
was for me is in infant position in a
it's<00:00:41.260> in<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.440> key<00:00:41.589> of<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:41.860> I<00:00:42.100> was<00:00:42.220> really

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
it's in the key of a so I was really

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.060 
it's in the key of a so I was really
used<00:00:42.699> when<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:42.970> was<00:00:43.180> learning<00:00:43.329> I<00:00:43.659> was<00:00:44.079> really

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
used when I was learning I was really

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.530 
used when I was learning I was really
used<00:00:45.250> to<00:00:45.339> hearing<00:00:45.579> that<00:00:45.670> stuff<00:00:45.940> in<00:00:46.089> a<00:00:46.180> so<00:00:46.239> when

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
used to hearing that stuff in a so when

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.910 
used to hearing that stuff in a so when
somebody<00:00:46.870> actually<00:00:47.019> taught<00:00:47.379> me<00:00:47.530> that<00:00:47.649> I<00:00:47.710> could

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
somebody actually taught me that I could

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.220 
somebody actually taught me that I could
move<00:00:48.100> that<00:00:48.159> scale<00:00:48.609> around<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.899> totally

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
move that scale around was totally

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.279 
move that scale around was totally
floored<00:00:50.500> so<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:52.480> exactly<00:00:52.809> what<00:00:53.019> I'm<00:00:53.260> doing

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
floored so that's exactly what I'm doing

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.200 
floored so that's exactly what I'm doing
today<00:00:53.679> is<00:00:53.800> I'm<00:00:53.980> just<00:00:54.100> basically<00:00:54.579> taking<00:00:55.089> this

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
today is I'm just basically taking this

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.770 
today is I'm just basically taking this
pentatonic<00:00:55.960> or<00:00:56.920> blues<00:00:57.339> pattern<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:58.239> that's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
pentatonic or blues pattern a that's

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.400 
pentatonic or blues pattern a that's
that's<00:00:59.190> commonly<00:01:00.190> placed<00:01:00.579> there<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.539> we're

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
that's commonly placed there and we're

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.509 
that's commonly placed there and we're
just<00:01:02.440> going<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.710> shift<00:01:02.890> that<00:01:03.070> guy<00:01:03.249> down<00:01:03.489> here

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
just going to shift that guy down here

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.760 
just going to shift that guy down here
into<00:01:03.969> open<00:01:04.330> position<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:04.750> we<00:01:04.989> can<00:01:05.019> use<00:01:05.530> some<00:01:05.740> of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
into open position so we can use some of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.380 
into open position so we can use some of
these<00:01:06.390> open<00:01:07.390> strings<00:01:07.780> okay<00:01:08.259> so<00:01:09.240> let's<00:01:10.240> get

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
these open strings okay so let's get
