00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.440
 I'm back that seems bonnie 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.179
 strange with her appearance at the new 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.340
 Faces Award in Berlin 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.230
 one month after the marriage-out of her 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.120
 and fashion blogger Jacob is best known 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.920
 was the model revived 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.390
 the red carpet and shines anyway 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.820
 happy as long as not 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.980
 Bunte de talked to her about her new life 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.880
 single life and the dispute with her ex 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.630
 which ultimately led to the break 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.830
 Maybe so I thought so much 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.240
 long that we married really long 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.500
 I've been driving for over a year 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.700
 again only one month voluntarily 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.079
 So stay tuned for me 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.760
 nevertheless, a great success is so long 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.350
 but actually I was together 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.550
 he does not suit me and I do not pass 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.899
 to him and that's why we often have 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.399
 argued and if you are so often 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.010
 go as we do then you have to 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.300
 at some point say okay we are 27 29 that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.039
 and not when you're ten 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.660
 years together and children then has 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.370
 would despite strikes on but remain 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.520
 with us without fucking new then again 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.449
 okay packages we prefer to go alone yes 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.680
 that was a boost 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.910
 but what I have in practice 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.530
 Just married because I am very happy 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.410
 and you never have to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 believed that it is forever some 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.500
 We believed it and some days 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 part of it so do not think there is one 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.470
 really if you like the couch 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.270
 put everything so beautiful jerk ten 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.380
 filming people with babies in the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.479
 we think here yes we will together 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.950
 everything is getting old but nowadays it is 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.390
 it is so difficult to find someone 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.430
 the world is changing all the time 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.930
 on environment is changing and it has now 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.490
 Today one knows new job has mine 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.570
 appetite and then you change yourself 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.619
 itself very fast and then 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.180
 At some point it will not fit anymore 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.880
 believes that it is difficult to say who 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.280
 unfortunately you still have contact 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.509
 sometimes sometimes worse 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.950
 sometimes better and we are now 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.780
 two months not only together and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.180
 answered publicly or one had 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.979
 and yes, sometimes we write 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.030
 still and everything is okay as with all 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.450
 others also mate and sometimes 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.250
 let's write that is one 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.049
 normal as everybody else's 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.399
 You are also relatively fast than you 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.140
 you drew the line 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.549
 He was, I think extended or virum 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.259
 I've moved out now I live alone 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.340
 and it also made me warm house together 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.200
 I had not started from the beginning 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.759
 Of course I love this house and if we are 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.719
 I'm the one who separates us mountains 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.610
 we talked about even before 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.960
 over it and what they do then and that 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.300
 our point of contention also still has to be 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.980
 the rent and none 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.980
 So the contract and he the key 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.450
 he shares that as well as a bit 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.830
 difficult in the wardrobe is then 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.240
 probably no wedding dress yet 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.340
 you also had what are you doing 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.350
 In any case, now I will keep 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.700
 Guess what I am like when I am a person 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.230
 would say okay they totally stupid 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.420
 crazy but or stupid or something 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.270
 but I will be so often 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.160
 marry secretly would that I love 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.930
 Wedding gowns and I love getting married 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.100
 be and I love just fallen in love when 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.270
 I think I just do not last long 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.290
 with the man I'm really very 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.460
 bored quickly i am actually 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.380
 do not miss a guy I'm really 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.520
 Like a guy , if someone is great and 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.600
 then I am in love and then leaves 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.150
 that's over for quite a while 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:47.090
 years i love being married 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.500
 that you're the next liz taylor yes 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.240
 so maybe I'm not so 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.890
 bad 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.330
 I think men do that too, why 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.370
 women are not likely to turn 50 today 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.500
 1 have 20 year old boyfriend and no 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.270
 idea and me so I'm just you I 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.010
 love life we live only once and 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.170
 why then decide who 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.280
 in fact, this criticism is me too 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.630
 it was said okay have this 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.310
 Wedding only for publicity purposes 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.220
 somehow made each other 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.570
 push what do you say to something I find 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.220
 of course, it was a lot in the stupid 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.390
 press and everything but I think so 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.770
 i made it out with up to date 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.270
 I would have tried any one 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.770
 American star still to marry 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.360
 not a little fashion blogger 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.739
 hamburg from therefore if the people that 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.720
 say they say no matter what 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.970
 say today, therefore, I know it for 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.140
 me whether it is like this or not and so 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.140
 long me that's because it 's all good
