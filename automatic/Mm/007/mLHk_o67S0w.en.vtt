mat<00:02:30.799> instead<00:02:31.129> of<00:02:31.459> putting<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.819> blanket<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.329> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.690 
mat instead of putting a blanket on the
floor<00:02:32.510> because<00:02:33.170> as<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:34.010> can<00:02:34.040> see<00:02:34.220> with

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
floor because as you can see with

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.089 
floor because as you can see with
hardwood<00:02:35.150> floors<00:02:35.209> like<00:02:35.959> it's<00:02:36.230> tend<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.709> slip

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
hardwood floors like it's tend to slip

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.220 
hardwood floors like it's tend to slip
and<00:02:37.280> she<00:02:37.430> doesn't<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:37.879> much<00:02:38.060> grip<00:02:38.480> so

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
and she doesn't have as much grip so

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.050 
and she doesn't have as much grip so
with<00:02:39.799> a<00:02:39.829> like<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.670> rubber<00:02:42.129> plane<00:02:43.129> that<00:02:43.340> she'd<00:02:43.940> be

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
with a like a rubber plane that she'd be

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.649 
with a like a rubber plane that she'd be
able<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.750> be<00:02:45.409> on<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.680> floor<00:02:46.659> strengthen

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
able to just be on the floor strengthen

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.589 
able to just be on the floor strengthen
those<00:02:47.810> muscles<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:48.440> little<00:02:48.470> bit<00:02:48.859> and<00:02:49.599> crawl
