normally<00:00:00.539> for<00:00:00.690> a<00:00:00.719> car<00:00:00.930> bar<00:00:01.140> review<00:00:01.469> I'd<00:00:01.589> talk

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
normally for a car bar review I'd talk

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.740 
normally for a car bar review I'd talk
about<00:00:01.800> cars<00:00:02.220> good<00:00:02.460> points<00:00:02.850> followed<00:00:03.419> by<00:00:03.570> its

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
about cars good points followed by its

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.930 
about cars good points followed by its
bad<00:00:03.990> points<00:00:04.470> but<00:00:04.650> for<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.890> new<00:00:05.009> Sal<00:00:05.279> ham<00:00:05.609> bro<00:00:05.790> I

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
bad points but for the new Sal ham bro I

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.490 
bad points but for the new Sal ham bro I
thought<00:00:06.120> I'd<00:00:06.240> do<00:00:06.390> things<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:07.200> other<00:00:07.319> way

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
thought I'd do things the other way

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.120 
thought I'd do things the other way
around

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
around

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.060 
around
so<00:00:08.340> then<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.970> negatives<00:00:09.630> well<00:00:10.080> being<00:00:10.440> an<00:00:10.559> MPV

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
so then the negatives well being an MPV

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.669 
so then the negatives well being an MPV
it's<00:00:11.490> not<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.910> exciting<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:13.259> sheer<00:00:13.469> size

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
it's not that exciting the sheer size

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.350 
it's not that exciting the sheer size
makes<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> little<00:00:14.219> bit<00:00:14.429> tricky<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.000> navigate

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
makes it a little bit tricky to navigate

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.500 
makes it a little bit tricky to navigate
round<00:00:15.929> town<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.830> quite<00:00:17.100> expensive<00:00:17.490> when<00:00:18.390> it

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
round town it's quite expensive when it

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.620 
round town it's quite expensive when it
comes<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.810> driving<00:00:19.050> dynamics<00:00:19.650> Ford<00:00:20.250> s-max

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.029 

that's<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.840> then<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.199> now<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.439> can<00:00:28.650> crack<00:00:28.859> on

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that's that then so now we can crack on

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.470 
that's that then so now we can crack on
with<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.310> Alhambra<00:00:29.789> positives<00:00:30.300> because

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
with the Alhambra positives because

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.060 
with the Alhambra positives because
there's<00:00:30.630> quite<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.050> talk<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.260> such

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
there's quite a lot to talk about such
