00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
and modify their behavior which is

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.030 
and modify their behavior which is
essentially<00:01:19.270> what<00:01:19.540> learning<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:19.960> about

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
essentially what learning is about

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.800 
essentially what learning is about

for<00:01:23.410> example<00:01:23.770> if<00:01:23.920> you're<00:01:24.130> then<00:01:24.310> explained

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
for example if you're then explained

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.430 
for example if you're then explained
piano<00:01:25.030> you're<00:01:25.450> likely<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.780> keep<00:01:25.990> hitting<00:01:26.260> bum
