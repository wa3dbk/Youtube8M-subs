00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:06.060
 Hello everyone, today I propose the videorecensione of virtualguitar pro un 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:09.890
 very nice application available in the app store at a cost of 59 euros 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.499
 in struggling an application that will allow us to have a guitar d 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:17.550
 italy obviously is 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.029
 let us say not distorted that with distorted sound 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:24.960
 contest see 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.039
 the screen is composed of six natural strings 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.739
 and reduced some parts 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.039
 which include the individual agreements 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.130
 it is possible to set individual agreements 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.130
 let's say positioned in the various keys so as to have 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.090
 our custom scale of agreements we want 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.690
 every time you play 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.550
 then now onwards volume 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
 to make me feel the sound quality 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.180
 touching 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.180
 on individual agreements we can change continuously 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.000
 the sound 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.550
 . it is as if we were putting our fingers on the individual and removed the bridge of the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.370
 guitar 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.370
 selecting different agreements 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.869
 echo from the point of view of authentication I must say that it is really excellent 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.509
 compared to others present for free or otherwise 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.130
 booklet modelle cementi fower than 79 cents I must say that this is it 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.560
 much better 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.619
 from the point of view of sleep quality 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.630
 eeeh actually very faithful to the real counterpart in the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.900
 acoustic or electric guitar 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.640
 then i can see the pub on the low 1 with distorted expo glass cleaners unit 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.680
 we select via e-mail are classical guitar 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.680
 if I select distorted 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.500
 we will have the distorted sound of Umbria thermal solar agreements 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.650
 while I'm opus using it once taking the patch for once 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.270
 his that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.270
 we are just nando for example 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.459
 see if I press the stop button instantly 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.079
 the sound produced by the selected chord will be 30 rock 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.079
 immediately 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.159
 that's how you can feel 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.539
 I send is the it button then for the inter formation 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.009
 and we can see 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.009
 a link with other developer ios applications 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:36.110
 We can 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.959
 view a guide 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.279
 very well done and I have to say let's visualize it 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.479
 sorry 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.929
 they are the real ones 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:49.819
 which is the nomenclature of the agreements we say then American English 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.519
 xd katy perry sole solo corresponds to the exit 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.159
 the cd aldo 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.479
 the god halo 3 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.539
 la ei first 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.969
 excel file already I only come up with this you can also find 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.069
 suburban looking. they missed the English agreements 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.860
 On the other hand, let's say a short theory lessons you fear course 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.200
 ver explains how to play the guitar how to set the various chords 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.649
 in short, and explain that it is possible to set as said but if this 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.409
 practice of agreements 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.739
 arrival immediately see this setting 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.739
 the automatic sequence of agreements or understanding 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:28.869
 as you can see 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.499
 we can configure the loop 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:35.689
 and we can decide how many coli includes that provides sustenon 4 co 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.599
 4 frame 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.269
 married a tweet 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.079
 4 agreements 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.420
 lara started a light brown lighter this bar with 4 chords then 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.609
 every time I go to get this button the ones I will select with a 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:51.510
 green dot 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.069
 one of the most and agreements without going to select the other relatives 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.960
 on the left that dark green number 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.149
 so I can play 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.149
 every time I see contacts it doesn't change the background 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.109
 however it is possible to have personnel as I voted before 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.479
 to whom one flies by finger pressure 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.020
 seems inconvenient but actually quite comfortable as an operating system 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.699
 niche we say something because it is very appealing therefore 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.699
 plastal is one of the most common names 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.879
 to change things instantly 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.379
 here you can select and configure individual agreements then for 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.379
 example kicks precisely 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.360
 believe this here 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.719
 pay 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:54.490
 the cd that we will apply here I can speak can be a bro 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.530
 normal d elite I still can put once in one sol another 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.249
 Note 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:04.349
 that hahaha. correspond to the rate selected at this time pd 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.220
 we can completely customize it 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.020
 this one but 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.050
 these data 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.039
 we can see how you save and load 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.210
 but up to 2 I think 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.349
 who 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.110
 let's say huntik 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.050
 preset patterno 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.349
 d chords we can select the guitar then the string position 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.719
 because for left handed operator sol 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:34.179
 and then we say that the elections are over here we can see precisely or the 

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:38.120
 the official website usurper producer the version we can share 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.680
 this information on feisbucco on twitter 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.939
 here's the whole replication here for the rest 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.660
 and the audio quality said that it is very good 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.430
 % 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.560
 ebay it would take ticketone + 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.669
 but 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.949
 complete em 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.080
 made better 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.520
 compared to the many numerous applications present on the app store that 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.280
 provide 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.310
 in the use of a guitar 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.690
 digital that can acoustic electric producing import quality 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.680
 let's say about this application 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.990
 I remember a bit called virtual guitar pro 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.990
 it is present on the app store at the cost of one euro 59 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.120
