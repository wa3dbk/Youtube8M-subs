00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.250
 but 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.560
 running increases the chances of the heart and 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.939
 vascular training occurs 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.400
 directly to the heart muscle itself 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.009
 that means the heart is getting stronger 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.070
 oxygen capacity rises more strongly 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.120
 blood to all tissues and organs comes 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.769
 more blood 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.620
 enriched with oxygen and nutrient 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.019
 substances an excellent means of struggle 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.940
 against nervous tension stress and 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.620
 fatigue accumulate in the body in 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.379
 throughout the day decay products 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.150
 This is the cause of fatigue to 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.010
 need to get rid of fatigue 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.570
 should sweat during 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.000
 prolonged blood load 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.340
 hormone endorphin and hormone are released 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.230
 happiness when the concentration of endorphins 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.760
 the right person grows up 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.340
 light feeling of euphoria 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.100
 depression evaporates rises 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.020
 mental activity while jogging 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.330
 often the decision comes to itself 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.210
 any problem or task 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.670
 blood is saturated with oxygen rises 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.899
 metabolism more actively 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.830
 central nervous function 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.440
 system 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.720
 which means brain systematic training 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.959
 run to increase immunity 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.330
 due to the increase in blood red blood cells and 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:30.759
 hemoglobin in the process of running loads 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.429
 decreases cholesterol in the blood decreases 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.210
 hunger improves motility 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.620
 intestinal its aggregate 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.710
 on things to taste it leads to 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.479
 normalization of body weight 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.590
 run at any time of the day because of 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.050
 in the morning when blood is high 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 the amount of hormone bex will be 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.450
 natural means to defuse what 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.310
 will help the body to return to harmony 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.659
 if you run after a hard day in the evening 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.810
 then you take the stress off

 wonderful with us research scientists 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.360
 show that partial 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.850
 liver tissue regeneration occurs 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.920
 positive effects on the kidneys during 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.210
 running off of them for the load that 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.910
 leads to an improvement in their functionary 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.770
 they are regularly running loads also 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.020
 have a positive effect on 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.940
 musculoskeletal system for people 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.770
 older people like training 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.290
 especially useful as they are 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.940
 impede degenerative change 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.640
 joints and muscle tissue 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.560
