00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
and I put a pencil line on your deck I

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.980 
and I put a pencil line on your deck I
now<00:00:17.430> measure<00:00:17.699> two<00:00:18.029> foot<00:00:18.270> five<00:00:18.480> inches<00:00:18.510> back

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
height of the column and I've simply cut

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.760 
height of the column and I've simply cut
it<00:02:23.760> with<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> circular<00:02:24.540> saw<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.989> now<00:02:25.560> we're
