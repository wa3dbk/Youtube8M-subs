00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.680
 Hi, I'm Anna Sauro 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.420
 dietician-nutritionist of feeds and I go 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.189
 to respond to a query on the web 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.470
 eat or not eat where they tell us what 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.210
 next I read that the gels 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.029
 sports serve to increase the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.980
 performance in the mentioned article is 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.410
 I consulted the experts and each one 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.119
 he said something different one said that if 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.369
 they served to increase performance and 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.840
 the other that not scientifically just 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.690
 the effectiveness of the 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.489
 caffeine, carnitine and creatine and not 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.870
 most properties with 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.870
 that many of these gels are advertised 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.699
 with what opinion should I stay 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.309
 sports supplements like drinks 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.530
 isotonic gels gummy bars 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.420
 recuperators are products that help 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.820
 meet the energy demands of 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.040
 organism before and after the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.199
 exercise this type of supplementation 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.670
 is accepted and is recommended by the 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.159
 Most nutrition experts 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.869
 sports during exercises 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.850
 average intensity that are prolonged in the 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.310
 time like the half marathon or the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.320
 marathon the organism uses as a source 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.290
 of energy, carbohydrates and 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.600
 fats 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.280
 in the body there is a certain amount of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.710
 glycogen reserve that during the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.890
 Exercise breaks down and generates glucose to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.660
 can be used during the exercise 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.550
 there is also a warehouse in the liver 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.170
 of glycogen to be used once 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.140
 muscle glucose has been spent 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.880
 but these reserves are limited as well 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.220
 that during the prolonged exercises 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.900
 you must consume foods rich in 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.970
 carbohydrates or supplements 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.760
 sports that contain them as 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.800
 Gels the bars or jellybeans 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.890
 otherwise you could reduce the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.630
 performance and have a pair of gels 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.190
 are usually the supplement of choice of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.450
 the majority of athletes in the background 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.900
 because of the ease for 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.030
 transport them and consume them helps 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.710
 ergogenic nutritional products are 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.020
 that help increase the capacity of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.600
 play a physical job or increase 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.310
 the yield contain nutrients u 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.320
 other food components in 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.930
 amounts greater than the recommendations 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.149
 of daily intakes propose an effect 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.920
 positive about performance only in 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.230
 are backed by theories not 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.580
 scientific and usually are not 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.140
 backed by the majority of 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.330
 sports nutritionists 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.090
 except if the ergogenic effect is 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.340
 scientifically proven in the case of 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.650
 Caffeine has been shown to stimulate 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.050
 the central nervous system favoring 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.200
 Work capacity reduces the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.490
 perception of effort and pain 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.160
 increases the alertness and the 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.840
 reaction time also increases the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.880
 use of fats as a source of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.620
 energy during the exercise what 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.560
 reduces the use of glycogen 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.270
 muscle and delays fatigue can be 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.190
 use in exercises that are prolonged 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.989
 in time and it has been seen that it gives 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.330
 better results in people 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.040
 trained the l-carnitine is a 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.350
 protein widely used in supplements 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.750
 current dietetics with the aim of 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.700
 facilitate the reduction of fats together 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.620
 with a hypocaloric diet but it has not 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.959
 demonstrated its ergogenic effect and the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.820
 European authority efsa has not given the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.010
 okay to promote it with these 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.019
 uses in terms of creatine has 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.209
 proven to have an important role in 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.010
 the synthesis of proteins what favors 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.500
 the increase in strength and mass 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.970
 Lean is the most ergogenic supplement 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.130
 cash for high sports 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.380
 intensity and short duration as 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.570
 sprinters or lifted 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.760
 and sports of repetitions of effort 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.730
 of high intensity as in football 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.459
 basketball or combat sports 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.840
 there are multiple genes on the market 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.569
 that may contain some of the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.400
 products previously mentioned 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.799
 the somewhat genetic effect that you can get 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.330
 will depend on the type the intensity and 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.640
 the duration of the physical exercise that 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.280
 perform I hope that this response 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.230
 has been useful and if you have any 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.129
 consult more do not hesitate to send it to the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.129
