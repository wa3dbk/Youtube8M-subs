00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:11.930
 is my gift cost me 999 pesos and it's 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.340
 editing like us who had 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.630
 there were editions of the same type I said 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.970
 I'm really going to buy the edition of 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.970
 same says though and see if it focuses 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.860
 but I do not know how to focus totally on 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.440
 Spanish the silver you keep the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.530

 list we're going to see it has has not 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.430
 the record that I'm doing is very father 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.430
 disc looks like a saw 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.600
 today it's fine 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.180
 it is fine thin the disc is 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.970
 it's not weird either, it's like very 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.230
 no I do not feel it as hard with stiff as 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.760
 a disc but disc of dead rising 3 cap 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.620
 with is very father the person disc 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.270
 closes then in fact here that suddenly 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.890
 come the disks that are all yes 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.140
 silver and normal says dead rising no 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.830
 then also an ugly that this is 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.520
 Let's see 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.810
 this changes your live xbox code 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.000
 be 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.280
 completely, I do not know what xbox says 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.780
 live 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.959
 this is not two days or what do I know if I 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.180
 what's left the comments are if that xbox 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.830
 live gold that they tell me and I know 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.440
 I put then in the description I do not know 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.760
 gift in some other video or on facebook 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.940
 or somewhere not because I'm good 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.750
 turns so that this one keep it here 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.900
 has another code to not look at this is the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.250
 three days of golf 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.260
 the teams here exchange what I say no 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.510
 it matters that you do not walk 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.370
 does not focus well this mother does not matter 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.470
 that is not from xbox one or that does not have 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.540
 xbox band 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.890
 not the one who can not appreciate this 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.890
 from here to see greeting to put here 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.450
 and I hope they have been able to redeem it 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.500
 proof of whether they are three days of golf and not 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.240
 they do not have to have that they can 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.310
 redeem in an xbox 360 and it's the same 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.590
 then the only thing that brings the album 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.989
 special edition this I do not know if it is this 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.790
 the tlc I think it is then the east 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.050
 from taiwan that brings here cellular and I do not know 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.840
 why discs are now coming from this 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.540
 side or open the premium is not right look 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.730
 you open it and the disc also on this side 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.970
 instead of coming here a strange change 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.760
 since it has as some spots 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.129
 I'll be playing racing people 3 be 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.590
 already on the channel and I think you can spend 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.270
 the campaign and I will try to record a 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.770
 bit 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.200
 several chapters so that suddenly not 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.580
 stay a good time without going up I know 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.680
 that I'm too bad to upload this kind of 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.690
 things already know obviously without music and 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.760

 3 Editing waiting you like me 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.440
 recommended and this has multiplayer to 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.440
 see from that level 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.910
 the player is a cooperative 12 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.480
 keeps cooperative is not that it be 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.630
