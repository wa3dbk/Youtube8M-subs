00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.190
 all press amidar murtazin mosquito 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.769
 held ipo beacon 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.659
 water x 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:13.879
 found on the internet 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.599
 unlock pattern 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:17.970
 and she 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.450
 I quickly start after him 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.630
 it's a cold start i mean i didn't fall asleep 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.499
 I want to open a kidney 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.159
 there is one feature many 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:29.549
 have seen the video that shows 

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:31.799
 roughly the same picture when the mail 

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:34.280
 run indecently long 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.990
 so just try like that 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.210
 So 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.440
 but at the same time 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.320
 relatively fast work 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.080
 yes the reason is very simple at first 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.540
 start mail really became 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.750
 only reality 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.920
 seconds 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.720
 seized 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.100
 but pisses off the buffalo 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.510
 that is, if you look at others 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.420
 applications 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.120
 they start faster 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.120
 these are just mail attachments this is not outlook 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.360
 and regional should introduce difficulties 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.540
 I usually want to add an account 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.940
 a record 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.600
 add account another account 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 I have a record box here begins 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.250
 the most fun is that it is a terrible situation 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.240
 she is very simple 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.450
 I want the envoy considers this many 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.590
 no career March 1 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.270
 that's what cube 3 accounts don't support 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.060
 you know m killing me what they 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.380
 added in principle here 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.350
 but 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.350
 oh no parameters zatlers 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.670
 kill that in the accounts they 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 added this line 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.909
 what can i add here m club notes 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.990
 mayor adds not clear 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.040
 Another point is that the mail 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.210
 It works quite accurately in 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.289
 aspect of configuring exchange mailboxes 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.679
 built here failed basically i 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.500
 I do not know how the capital is a video certificate 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.980
 I can say that it is just enough 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.400
 crazy 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.619
 idea then 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.030
 how it did 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.519
 at the construction site are very simple 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.379
 at the same time if you look at 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.859
 creating a new letter here for example i 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.709
 I want to create a new letter 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.380
 send it to the press 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.680
 layout 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.649
 I have already entered this address I and the onion plant 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.819
 from the squad this is not from the bow this is the postal 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.569
 outlook box is called 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.689
 I have already sent to this box 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.900
 just an hour ago, well, for some reason, he's searching 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.199
 in the outlook directory 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.619
 but if people have for example recently 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.889
 the house will not show now ildar in 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.799
 all sorts of manifestations 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.889
 it seems crazy to me 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:42.720
 idea 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.870
 if to speak pay others 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.850
 gun apps don't exist today 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.229
 shrinks 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.859
 it seems to me a minus 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.359
 If you look at the person as she is 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.689
 implemented it is on the main screen i 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.389
 I'll show you now that it is not in it 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.339
 running applications 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.339
 here and there 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:03.189
 further search does not make sense honestly 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.809
 by saying 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.809
 typical sandra what will happen next 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.799
 and so I run the kidneys 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.150
 Now the mail has started, I can work with it 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.709
 initially I have everything supported 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.409
 my mailboxes regiment is not half 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.299
 in fact today 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.010
 I can say that this is exactly it from 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.429
 work boxes 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.549
 in sight of the event mail you imagine 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.019
 these are not corporate solutions never more 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:34.759
 Togo 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.139
 this decision 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.730
 I say one thing 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.259
 strange 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.089
 if not worse but it works strange 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.459
 and 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.549
 based on this, I can note that he told me 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.839
 she does not like her mail at all 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:49.659
 Today 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.739
 oddly for the mind of an event this 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.589
 very weak point that is if we talk by 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.609
 mail 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.879
 i don't like her dislikes in all 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.269
 meanwhile you can invest different 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.169
 file 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.679
 can see what you have 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:08.069
 from one country very simply in detail with 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.489
 the other side of course rejected waiting 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.639
 good or for chains 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.310
 at least outlook 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.620
 the main problem here is people who know and 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.329
 beauty can say that microsoft office 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.769
 should not have been indicated we are waiting for that 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.259
 I stay jacket medium point half point 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.740
 out bow here 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.240
 my mind is huge huge 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.099
 cons for microsoft microsoft and 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.509
 because 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.279
 this minus cross in general 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.279
 then mail is used by all and for many 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:40.279
 mail is very important on mobile 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:41.229
 devices 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.249
 with you was eldar murtazin 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.599
 viktyuk analog child stay 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:45.759
 with us
