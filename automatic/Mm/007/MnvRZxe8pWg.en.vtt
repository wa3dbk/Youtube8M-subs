of the questions about accordions always

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.620 
of the questions about accordions always
have<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.289> with<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.529> left<00:00:16.740> hand<00:00:17.630> probably

bit<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.619> counter<00:00:29.310> base<00:00:29.519> side<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:31.380> counter

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
bit is the counter base side the counter

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.740 
bit is the counter base side the counter
bases<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.279> that's<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.610> first<00:00:32.880> row<00:00:33.149> basis

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
bases and that's the first row basis

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.620 
bases and that's the first row basis
right<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:34.579> you<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> common<00:00:36.120> base<00:00:36.360> is

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
right here you have the common base is

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.280 
right here you have the common base is
the<00:00:37.140> regular<00:00:37.320> base<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:39.329> major<00:00:39.510> chord<00:00:39.989> minor

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the regular base the major chord minor

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.790 
the regular base the major chord minor
chord<00:00:40.800> settled<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.670> diminished<00:00:42.090> corridor

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
chord settled for diminished corridor

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.880 
chord settled for diminished corridor
now<00:00:43.969> what<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.000> would<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.930> try<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> explain

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
now what I would like to try to explain

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.029 
now what I would like to try to explain
is<00:00:47.399> how<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> use<00:00:47.850> these<00:00:48.000> counter<00:00:48.480> basis<00:00:49.039> now

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
is how to use these counter basis now

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
is how to use these counter basis now
let's<00:00:50.550> take<00:00:50.760> C<00:00:51.090> major<00:00:51.620> right<00:00:52.620> here<00:00:53.570> just<00:00:54.570> sea

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
let's take C major right here just sea

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.350 
let's take C major right here just sea
bass<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:56.219> counter<00:00:56.550> base<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> going

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
bass the counter base of that is going

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.610 
bass the counter base of that is going
to<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.690> eat<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> third<00:01:00.620> same

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
to be eat it's going to be a third same

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.010 
to be eat it's going to be a third same
as<00:01:01.770> e<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.579> right<00:01:02.760> side<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:08.600> they<00:01:09.600> run<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
as e on your right side and they run the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.500 
as e on your right side and they run the
same<00:01:10.260> way<00:01:10.470> they<00:01:10.890> run<00:01:11.040> fifths<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
same way they run fifths just like the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
same way they run fifths just like the
regular<00:01:12.689> basis<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.560> now<00:01:14.220> they<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:14.939> used

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
regular basis and now they can be used

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.969 
regular basis and now they can be used
as<00:01:15.330> spice<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.110> playing<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.770> often

why<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> don't<00:01:24.420> know<00:01:24.619> but<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.060> fingering<00:01:27.060> is

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
why I don't know but the fingering is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.390 
why I don't know but the fingering is
the<00:01:27.390> same<00:01:27.659> we're<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> use<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:29.009> three

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the same we're going to use for three

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.910 
the same we're going to use for three
fingering<00:01:29.939> which<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.229> proper<00:01:31.710> fingering

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
fingering which is the proper fingering

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.399 
fingering which is the proper fingering
to<00:01:32.250> use<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.610> these<00:01:32.700> bases<00:01:33.240> which<00:01:33.990> means<00:01:34.259> this

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
to use on these bases which means this

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.170 
to use on these bases which means this
fourth<00:01:34.770> finger<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.280> only<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> play
