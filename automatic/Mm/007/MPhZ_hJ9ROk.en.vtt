00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
would think the best thing to do is to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.979 
would think the best thing to do is to
try<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.829> prevent<00:00:38.450> prevent<00:00:39.450> getting<00:00:39.719> them

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
try to prevent prevent getting them

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.959 
try to prevent prevent getting them
absolutely<00:00:40.710> prevent<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.190> very<00:00:41.399> first<00:00:41.700> one

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
absolutely prevent that very first one

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.240 
absolutely prevent that very first one
and<00:00:42.210> they'll<00:00:43.050> even<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.680> great<00:00:43.860> big<00:00:44.040> cavity

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and they'll even the great big cavity

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.430 
and they'll even the great big cavity
start<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.030> very<00:00:45.300> tiny<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.140> want<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
start out as very tiny one so we want to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.229 
start out as very tiny one so we want to
start<00:00:46.680> preventing<00:00:47.489> them<00:00:47.640> right<00:00:47.879> from<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
start preventing them right from the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
start preventing them right from the
start<00:00:48.300> now<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.899> would<00:00:49.110> bet<00:00:49.289> people<00:00:49.559> watching

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
start now I would bet people watching

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.049 
start now I would bet people watching
this<00:00:50.010> morning<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.399> we've<00:00:50.640> all<00:00:50.760> heard<00:00:50.969> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
this morning you know we've all heard of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.639 
this morning you know we've all heard of
cavities<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.690> think<00:00:51.899> people<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.289> probably

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
cavities and I think people are probably

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.540 
cavities and I think people are probably
thinking<00:00:52.890> well<00:00:53.070> those<00:00:53.219> are<00:00:53.340> those<00:00:53.430> little

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
thinking well those are those little

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
thinking well those are those little
holes<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> dentistry<00:00:55.469> ilysm

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
holes that I get and the dentistry ilysm

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.319 
holes that I get and the dentistry ilysm
and<00:00:55.860> fills<00:00:56.039> them<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.730> there's<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and fills them in but there's more to it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.029 
and fills them in but there's more to it
than<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.530> used<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.829> think

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
than that right right we used to think

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.979 
than that right right we used to think
it<00:00:59.129> was<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.520> holes<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.390> would<00:01:00.570> fill<00:01:00.750> but

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it was just holes that we would fill but

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.330 
it was just holes that we would fill but
now<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.170> know<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.710> bacterial<00:01:02.250> infection

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
now we know it's a bacterial infection

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.850 
now we know it's a bacterial infection
and<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> bacteria<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.350> bugs<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.769> our

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
and that the bacteria the bugs in our

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
and that the bacteria the bugs in our
mouths<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.580> actually<00:01:06.090> produce<00:01:06.330> acids<00:01:07.110> from

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
mouths can actually produce acids from

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.140 
mouths can actually produce acids from
the<00:01:07.500> foods<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.950> eat<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> asset<00:01:09.119> that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the foods we eat and it's the asset that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
the foods we eat and it's the asset that
will<00:01:09.390> melt<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.900> enamel<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.409> create<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> hole

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
will melt the enamel and create the hole

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.800 
will melt the enamel and create the hole
now<00:01:11.700> where<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.060> getting<00:01:12.270> all<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.750> this

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
now where are we getting all of this

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.469 
now where are we getting all of this
bacteria<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.439> comes<00:01:13.650> into<00:01:13.830> our<00:01:13.950> mouths

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
bacteria that comes into our mouths

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.219 
bacteria that comes into our mouths
surprisingly<00:01:15.479> would<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.810> them<00:01:15.960> from<00:01:16.080> our

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
surprisingly would get them from our

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.280 
surprisingly would get them from our
moms<00:01:16.470> babies<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.220> born<00:01:17.400> germ-free<00:01:17.960> but<00:01:18.960> moms

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
moms babies are born germ-free but moms

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
moms babies are born germ-free but moms
are<00:01:19.560> very<00:01:19.740> generous<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.400> their<00:01:20.580> kisses<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
are very generous with their kisses and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
are very generous with their kisses and
tasting<00:01:21.630> food<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.110> they<00:01:22.229> share<00:01:22.439> saliva<00:01:22.920> with

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
tasting food and they share saliva with

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.130 
tasting food and they share saliva with
the<00:01:23.460> bacteria<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:24.689> how<00:01:24.869> kids

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the bacteria in it so that's how kids

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.920 
the bacteria in it so that's how kids
get<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> bacteria<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.720> pry

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
get the bacteria so what do we do to pry

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.800 
get the bacteria so what do we do to pry
to<00:01:28.350> prevent<00:01:28.979> these<00:01:29.400> bacteria<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.180> being<00:01:30.720> in

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to prevent these bacteria from being in

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.300 
to prevent these bacteria from being in
our<00:01:30.930> own<00:01:31.110> mouths<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.560> also<00:01:31.710> prevent<00:01:32.159> them

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
our own mouths but also prevent them

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.620 
our own mouths but also prevent them
from<00:01:32.340> going<00:01:32.610> into<00:01:32.880> our<00:01:33.030> children's<00:01:33.420> mouths

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
from going into our children's mouths

a good oral hygiene regimen now besides
and<00:01:52.770> we've<00:01:52.950> always<00:01:53.070> heard<00:01:53.250> brushing<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
flossing but I'm sure we can probably

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.810 
flossing but I'm sure we can probably
take<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> step<00:01:55.680> beyond<00:01:56.070> right<00:01:56.369> beyond

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
take it a step beyond right beyond

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.760 
take it a step beyond right beyond
brushing<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.360> flossing<00:01:57.420> there's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.380> sweet

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
brushing and flossing there's a sweet

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.889

natural sweetener now we have talked

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
natural sweetener now we have talked
about<00:02:03.060> xylitol<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:03.990> show<00:02:04.170> before<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
about xylitol on this show before and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.770 
about xylitol on this show before and
it's<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.909> said<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> sweetener

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
it's like you just said it's a sweetener

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.229 
it's like you just said it's a sweetener
but<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.290> also<00:02:07.439> found<00:02:07.849> naturally<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.090> it's

tooth<00:02:27.960> decay<00:02:27.990> how<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:28.980> going<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.550> prevent

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
tooth decay how is this going to prevent

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.420 
tooth decay how is this going to prevent
tooth<00:02:30.150> decay<00:02:30.180> that's<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.080> good<00:02:31.260> question<00:02:31.500> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
tooth decay that's a good question the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.390 
tooth decay that's a good question the
way<00:02:32.610> xylitol<00:02:33.180> works<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.080> actually

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
way xylitol works is that it actually

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.460 
way xylitol works is that it actually
confuses<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.520> bacteria<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.630> thinks<00:02:37.320> it's

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
confuses the bacteria it thinks it's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.230 
confuses the bacteria it thinks it's
eating<00:02:37.800> sugar<00:02:38.070> but<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.460> isn't<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.940> when<00:02:39.090> it

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
eating sugar but it isn't and when it

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.630 
eating sugar but it isn't and when it
eats<00:02:39.510> sugar<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.140> can<00:02:40.320> produce<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.830> acid<00:02:41.250> so

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
eats sugar it can produce the acid so

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.850 
eats sugar it can produce the acid so
when<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.940> takes<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.420> xylitol<00:02:42.930> molecule<00:02:43.470> it

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
when it takes in a xylitol molecule it

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.980 
when it takes in a xylitol molecule it
doesn't<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.090> nutritive<00:02:45.420> value<00:02:45.570> it

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
doesn't have the nutritive value it

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.170 
doesn't have the nutritive value it
can't<00:02:46.440> produce<00:02:46.650> acid<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.340> can't<00:02:47.580> stick<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.940> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
can't produce acid it can't stick to the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.540 
can't produce acid it can't stick to the
other<00:02:48.300> bugs<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.870> can't<00:02:49.530> produce<00:02:49.830> acid<00:02:50.220> that

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
other bugs it can't produce acid that

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.550 
other bugs it can't produce acid that
will<00:02:50.700> cause<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.910> cavity<00:02:51.570> in<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.690> tooth<00:02:51.960> so<00:02:52.320> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
will cause a cavity in the tooth so the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.830 
will cause a cavity in the tooth so the
bacteria<00:02:52.980> simply<00:02:53.310> slide<00:02:53.640> off<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.880> teeth<00:02:54.240> so

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
bacteria simply slide off the teeth so

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.450 
bacteria simply slide off the teeth so
you'll<00:02:55.020> have<00:02:55.170> fifty<00:02:55.620> percent<00:02:55.920> less<00:02:56.160> bacteria

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
you'll have fifty percent less bacteria

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.820 
you'll have fifty percent less bacteria
if<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.090> use<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.420> xylitol<00:02:57.960> several<00:02:58.470> times<00:02:58.680> a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
if you use the xylitol several times a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.010 
if you use the xylitol several times a
day<00:02:58.860> ok<00:02:59.490> so<00:02:59.550> now<00:03:00.000> obviously<00:03:00.570> we<00:03:00.720> need<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.900> get

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
day ok so now obviously we need to get

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.170 
day ok so now obviously we need to get
this<00:03:01.110> into<00:03:01.380> our<00:03:01.410> systems<00:03:01.890> how<00:03:02.130> can<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:02.610> do<00:03:03.150> that

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
this into our systems how can we do that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.420 
this into our systems how can we do that
it's<00:03:03.810> fun<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.290> easy<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.710> it's<00:03:04.890> sweet<00:03:05.130> you

it's fun it's easy and it's sweet you

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.270 
it's fun it's easy and it's sweet you
can<00:03:05.670> put<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.240> xylitol<00:03:06.800> toothpaste<00:03:07.800> too<00:03:08.070> in
