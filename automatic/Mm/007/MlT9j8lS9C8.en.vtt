the number of blocks you roll so you

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.749 
the number of blocks you roll so you

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
roll a one so I mean showing it one

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:52.050 
roll a one so I mean showing it one
launch<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:47.710> will<00:01:47.860> build<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.850> right

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
launch so we will build that all right

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.010 
launch so we will build that all right
so<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:53.649> is<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:55.000> build<00:01:55.210> we<00:01:55.390> were<00:01:55.479> given<00:01:55.840> and

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
so here is the build we were given and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.630 
so here is the build we were given and
both<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.969> pigs<00:01:58.210> are<00:01:58.360> up<00:01:58.479> high<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.770> we<00:02:00.490> will

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
both of the pigs are up high so we will

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.959 
both of the pigs are up high so we will
have<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:01.119> move<00:02:01.869> our<00:02:02.109> camera<00:02:02.649> back<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.789> get<00:02:03.939> a

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
have to move our camera back to get a

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.270 
have to move our camera back to get a
better<00:02:04.210> angle<00:02:04.869> of<00:02:05.170> these<00:02:05.710> getting<00:02:06.070> knocked

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
better angle of these getting knocked

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.480 
better angle of these getting knocked
down<00:02:06.579> and<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:08.740> won't<00:02:08.979> be<00:02:09.070> able<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.250> see<00:02:09.399> me

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
down and so you won't be able to see me

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.759 
down and so you won't be able to see me
launch<00:02:09.729> but<00:02:09.910> basically<00:02:10.240> I'll<00:02:10.420> launch<00:02:10.769> you

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
launch but basically I'll launch you

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.400 
launch but basically I'll launch you
hold<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.459> snowspeeder<00:02:12.730> down<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.660> then

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
hold the snowspeeder down and then

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.250 
hold the snowspeeder down and then
we'll<00:02:17.410> just<00:02:17.560> do<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.860> way<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.020> put<00:02:20.170> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
we'll just do it that way so you put the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.310 
we'll just do it that way so you put the
bird<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:21.190> launch<00:02:21.400> pad<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:23.730> fire<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.910> off

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
bird in the launch pad and fire it off

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.580 
bird in the launch pad and fire it off
like<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.240> get<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.450> Miss<00:02:31.720> there<00:02:32.020> now

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.740 
like so and so you get a Miss there now
in<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.130> game<00:02:33.310> if<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.700> roll<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.330> one<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.630> only

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
in the game if you roll it one you only

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.490 
in the game if you roll it one you only
get<00:02:34.900> one<00:02:35.080> shot<00:02:37.770> that's<00:02:38.770> my<00:02:38.980> second<00:02:39.670> miss<00:02:40.500> so

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
get one shot that's my second miss so

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.710 
get one shot that's my second miss so
we'll<00:02:41.620> go<00:02:41.709> for<00:02:41.890> number<00:02:42.100> three<00:02:42.340> here<00:02:42.580> see<00:02:43.540> if<00:02:43.630> we

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
we'll go for number three here see if we

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.760 
we'll go for number three here see if we
can<00:02:43.870> finally<00:02:44.260> land<00:02:44.500> one<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:47.140> we<00:02:47.230> got<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.620> one

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
can finally land one so we got that one

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.170 
can finally land one so we got that one
that<00:02:48.100> one<00:02:48.280> was<00:02:48.400> kind<00:02:48.550> of<00:02:48.700> straight<00:02:48.910> up<00:02:48.940> and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
that one was kind of straight up and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.810 
that one was kind of straight up and
down<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.690> little<00:02:49.900> easier<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.820> knock

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
down so it's a little easier to knock

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.400 
down so it's a little easier to knock
that<00:02:52.060> down<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.660> that's<00:02:52.840> basically<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.290> game

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
that down so that's basically the game

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.110 
that down so that's basically the game
you<00:02:53.530> go<00:02:53.620> back<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.010> forth<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.370> whoever<00:02:54.790> built

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
you go back and forth so whoever built

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.080 
you go back and forth so whoever built
then<00:02:55.570> rolls<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.410> launches<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.220> then<00:02:57.880> whoever

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
then rolls and launches and then whoever

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.800 
then rolls and launches and then whoever
launched<00:02:59.080> then<00:02:59.410> rolls<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.370> build<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.880> then

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
launched then rolls to build and then

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.370 
launched then rolls to build and then
there's<00:03:02.080> your<00:03:02.410> close-up<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:05.140> snow

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.440 
the hole on the bottom to put into the
launcher<00:03:15.370> whereas<00:03:15.880> these<00:03:16.060> don't<00:03:17.020> have<00:03:18.450> that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
launcher whereas these don't have that

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.370 
launcher whereas these don't have that
