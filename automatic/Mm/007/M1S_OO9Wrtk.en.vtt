installed and fitted I removed the inner

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.340 
installed and fitted I removed the inner
structures<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.690> install<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.020> correct

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
structures so I can install the correct

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.410 
structures so I can install the correct
proper<00:01:02.160> rivets<00:01:02.520> rather<00:01:02.760> than<00:01:02.969> using<00:01:03.300> an

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
proper rivets rather than using an

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.780 
proper rivets rather than using an
aftermarket<00:01:03.870> pop<00:01:04.290> rivet<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.189> install<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> tub

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
aftermarket pop rivet to install the tub

sides<00:01:06.090> once<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.689> fuel<00:01:07.200> bladders<00:01:07.619> put<00:01:07.830> in

sides once we get fuel bladders put in

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.660 
sides once we get fuel bladders put in
well<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> guess<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> next<00:01:10.350> step<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.430> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
well I guess that's the next step is to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.600 
well I guess that's the next step is to
install<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.030> new<00:01:12.240> fuel<00:01:12.540> bladders<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:16.610> fuel
