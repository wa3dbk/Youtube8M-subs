which<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.860> why<00:02:45.010> i'm<00:02:45.400> leaning<00:02:45.910> towards<00:02:46.420> i<00:02:46.630> want

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
which is why i'm leaning towards i want

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.840 
which is why i'm leaning towards i want
to<00:02:47.200> get<00:02:47.260> sitrep<00:02:47.650> because<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.519> would<00:02:48.640> just<00:02:48.670> be

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
to get sitrep because that would just be

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.880 
to get sitrep because that would just be
very<00:02:49.090> great<00:02:49.390> if<00:02:49.630> while<00:02:49.959> sitrep<00:02:50.319> pro<00:02:50.500> at<00:02:50.680> least

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
very great if while sitrep pro at least

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.979 
very great if while sitrep pro at least
not<00:02:51.519> very<00:02:51.549> much<00:02:51.940> equipment<00:02:52.330> in<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:52.750> game

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
not very much equipment in this game

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.840 
not very much equipment in this game
because<00:02:53.890> everyone<00:02:54.250> likes<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.519> use<00:02:54.700> the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
because everyone likes to use the

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.080 
because everyone likes to use the
fragile<00:02:55.680> semtex<00:02:56.680> which<00:02:56.859> bounces<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.670> out<00:02:57.790> well

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
fragile semtex which bounces it out well

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.330 
fragile semtex which bounces it out well
it's<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.630> good<00:02:58.750> thing<00:02:58.810> but<00:02:59.470> explosive<00:03:00.100> suck

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
it's a good thing but explosive suck

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.330 
it's a good thing but explosive suck
anyway<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:01.030> really<00:03:01.450> don't<00:03:01.690> need<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
anyway so you really don't need the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.680 
anyway so you really don't need the
default<00:03:03.340> form<00:03:03.609> of<00:03:03.760> sitrep<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.299> doesn't<00:03:04.540> do

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
default form of sitrep it doesn't do

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.550 
default form of sitrep it doesn't do
much<00:03:06.209> especially<00:03:07.209> because<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.750> lot<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.470> people

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
much especially because a lot of people

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.349 
much especially because a lot of people
still<00:03:08.920> run<00:03:09.130> stalker<00:03:09.609> because<00:03:09.940> it's<00:03:10.180> one<00:03:10.299> of

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
still run stalker because it's one of

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.699 
still run stalker because it's one of
the<00:03:10.450> first<00:03:10.570> unlocks<00:03:10.989> it's<00:03:11.170> died<00:03:11.350> down<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.590> bit

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
the first unlocks it's died down a bit

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.490 
the first unlocks it's died down a bit
because<00:03:12.540> people<00:03:13.540> have<00:03:13.630> unlocked<00:03:13.930> more<00:03:14.230> things

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
because people have unlocked more things

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.819 
because people have unlocked more things
but<00:03:14.829> at<00:03:15.220> first<00:03:15.609> i<00:03:15.940> thought<00:03:16.750> clean<00:03:17.380> wars<00:03:17.560> and

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
but at first i thought clean wars and

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.340 
but at first i thought clean wars and
Betty's<00:03:18.160> were<00:03:18.340> absolutely<00:03:18.900> literally<00:03:19.900> did<00:03:20.140> no

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
Betty's were absolutely literally did no

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.259 
Betty's were absolutely literally did no
damage<00:03:20.380> because<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.220> never<00:03:21.609> got<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.910> kill<00:03:22.150> with

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
damage because I never got a kill with

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.460 
damage because I never got a kill with
them<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.540> they<00:03:22.600> never<00:03:22.810> went<00:03:22.989> off<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.440> was

them and they never went off and I was
like<00:03:23.620> what<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.799> heck<00:03:24.070> but<00:03:24.579> then<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.730> realized

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
like what the heck but then I realized

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.920 
like what the heck but then I realized
well<00:03:25.329> it's<00:03:25.540> cuz<00:03:25.690> everyone<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:26.019> stalker<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.930> that

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
well it's cuz everyone a stalker so that

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.330 
well it's cuz everyone a stalker so that
