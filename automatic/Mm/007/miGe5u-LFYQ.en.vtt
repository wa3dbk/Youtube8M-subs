it<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:04.530> my<00:02:04.740> monitor<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.689> extended<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:08.340> my<00:02:08.550> TV

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
it now my monitor is extended to my TV

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.610 
it now my monitor is extended to my TV
with<00:02:09.030> my<00:02:09.119> chromecast<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.910> pretty<00:02:11.910> neat

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
with my chromecast on it pretty neat

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.770 
with my chromecast on it pretty neat
you<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:14.310> there's<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.610> lag<00:02:14.819> because<00:02:15.330> we're

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
you know there's a lag because we're

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.559 
you know there's a lag because we're
going<00:02:15.930> through<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> wireless<00:02:16.530> network<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:18.239> it

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
going through the wireless network so it

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.500 
going through the wireless network so it
maybe<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.110> not<00:02:19.140> as<00:02:19.349> convenient<00:02:19.920> as<00:02:20.330> just<00:02:21.330> using

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
maybe is not as convenient as just using

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.809 
maybe is not as convenient as just using
our<00:02:21.840> real<00:02:22.050> cable<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.470> connect<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.860> two<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.700> if

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
our real cable to connect the two but if

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.100 
our real cable to connect the two but if
you<00:02:23.910> find<00:02:24.090> yourself<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.569> situation<00:02:24.660> where

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
you find yourself in the situation where

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.589 
you find yourself in the situation where
you<00:02:25.230> need<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.680> do<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.150> turns<00:02:27.150> out<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.420> can

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
you need to do this turns out you can
