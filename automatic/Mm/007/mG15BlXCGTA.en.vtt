00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:14.940
 BNY's the video here showing you the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 automatic potion panel that is this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.189
 here you are seeing why the high 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.820
 more because the old one I made the video 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.310
 the website owns you use drop you 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.929
 placed here in the sport positions now 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.969
 he already does direct then minute the items 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.510
 here is a phrase of water that gives others 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.730
 process items the system is very 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.610
 very simple system is that you can 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.770
 see basic system and in the next video there 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.710
 I'm going there to do a tutorial that account 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.050
 It 's very simple here. 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:01:05.689
 so let's go first to the people 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:08.640
 Let's put the bottles 2323 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.250
 Now come on, I do not understand much. 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.990
 position but I'm going to put this from here 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.920
 because I think I already did a test here 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:26.360
 let's put this here is already coming 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:31.500
 wait there while I'm going to put the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.240
 Water paulo can see she is already here 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.280
 When it's over here, she'll be gone. 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.390
 fall here 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.479
 This is very cool, you already fell 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.189
 can see is not worked because I 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.369
 I have a lot of positions I do not know how 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.960
 But you know, you go, the parents. 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.610
 find out fast and just put here and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.119
 on here 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:03.960
 I'm going to put the net toni edson does not have 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.409
 function does not know how to listen 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.110
 stone also has no function did not know 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.510
 finally understood the position if it is ugly 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.150
 Stop putting that here I know that. 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.260
 more function 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.780
 the system is basically this from here 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.480
 control panel 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.410
 I'm really sorry, I do not know if the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.840
 position I'm going to take it out here and I'll see 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.840
 if I do some here I'll put it here 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.610
 23 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.090
 I'll put the spider here to see if 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:51.709

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:51.709

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.519

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.570
 position of weakness now let's 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.579
 putting the gunpowder to stay in 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.560
 position of weakness to highlight let's 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:51.299
 to say that I'm seeing it done 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.220
 something makes us a function then 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.790
 It's in the next video I'm going to show you how 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:02.359
 make this panel here that really does not 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.359
 It's difficult, it 's very simple to do. 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.540

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:13.739

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.730
 greater weakness with not decreased but is 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.730
 basically this 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.800

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.320
 automatic I hope you have 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.240
