00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.540
 Well now I'm all pike and 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.639
 welcome to a new video because 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.250
 internet is full of photos of you 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.170
 making the face of duck and uncles that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.090
 photos are taken to show that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.769
 effectively have a click or we 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.330
 they talk little about this good we can 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.890
 arrive that the world of photography has 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.480
 changed a lot in recent years and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.150
 only with the appearance of the cameras 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.890
 digital are a revolution let's say is 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.990
 that it's always good to say revolution 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.550
 the adjunct that I desisted is this 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.160
 it's as if you take a character from 'mad 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.930
 men ' of the 50s and you put 400 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.010
 cigars in your mouth if we look 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.230
 back a little 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.300
 formerly we used cameras with 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.160
 East reel has about 20 races 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.350
 photos had other achievements around 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.700
 about 20 photos this meant that up 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.440
 that did not reveal was reel you did not know 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.570
 footprints in the photos were you could not 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.280
 see them in the middle of the photos you left 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.989
 with the face of an asshole and the other half 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.489
 with closed eyes but you have to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.980
 recognize that this made the photos a lot 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.210
 more special at least one photo of each 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.250
 career and I would dare to say that I was going to 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.600
 stop to a picture frame of the living room today 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.969
 in day however a person who is leaving 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.199
 of travel like two thousand photos two thousand 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.519
 photos that end up lost in the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.259
 computer up what 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.210
 jordan by mistake is a very typical thing 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.219
 of windows or when you update the mac 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.600
 that also erases all your shit but 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.979
 there are photos that people do not have 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.329
 that feeling 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.619
 formerly you had to choose from 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.719
 really that you could do or it was not 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.600
 like a picture of this and this and this other 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.880
 you did not have 20 tips photos that is that pussy 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.459
 Saco in this seems like an ass I'm not going to 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.289
 take pictures that we also take 3 or 4 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:30.719
 Sometimes, on the one hand, there are the aunts who 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.039
 see how I have come out I have gone wrong we are going to 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.200
 do it again it happens almost 10 minutes 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.060
 taking the same photo or wait for it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.920
 I take the landscape from this other angle to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.560
 see how it looks and you end up doing 20 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.420
 landscape photos 20 photos was what 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.829
 you had formerly for your entire trip 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.119
 but all this situation has taken 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.530
 to a world in which everyone has 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.789
 a digital camera and everyone has 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.189
 the possibility of uploading photos to the internet 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.020
 Instantly 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.310
 no one lives in a cave or in a cave 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.380
 town that does not even reach the phone 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.270
 let's let's adapt to the times 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.679
 in which we live that I get angry and 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.049
 I work this wall that I have in front of me 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.610
 mouse and this whole situation is very 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.679
 dangerous because now it turns out that everything 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.450
 the world the models have taken care of everything 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.069
 the world poses as if we did not know that 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.750
 He has taken it out while in his room 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.240
 without anyone else with your grandmother other 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.180
 a bit glamorous but not guys like 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.830
 were in the catalog because 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.230
 it was the village's ugliest a picture of 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.060
 victoria's secret the typical good of 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.610
 beach is a picture that puts in the title 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.470
 having breakfast is a tip photo of your 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.660
 abdominal what the fuck have you had breakfast 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.310
 cubes of rubik looks toasted where 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.510
 all this trend is also 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.300
 It has also led to not being able to stay 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.590
 never from profile pictures of people 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.780
 because now it turns out that everyone 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.700
 is good for God that we are going to see 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.620
 miracles exist and everyone a 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.090
 Once I had taken a great picture but 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.040
 then after the rest of the photos and 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.440
 you think about what orca cavern you have 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.630
 escaped cayÃ³n balaguer and as I said 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.660
 all this without counting the duck's nose 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.160
 of the aunts that I do not explain myself how 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.070
 can they make those photos really be 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.720
 They think it's so pretty, so I 'm going to 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.310
 make a profile 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.020
 or like the guys I was talking about 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.510
 before they all appear the same 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.440
 raising the shirt looks i'm not 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.570
 kyle xy 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.640
 I have an old man we do not give a shit 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.650
 your abs and the cani shirt 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.850
 with which you come out in the photo not even 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.350
 I'm going to start talking about the friend who 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.790
 you have next in the bathroom interests 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.780
 do the photo but good now as 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.310

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.630
 comments or atwi test from youtube blogs 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.730

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.930
 experience with digital cameras if 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.330
 you have seen some upload a thing 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.340
 horrible to your facebook profile of 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:34.490
 twitter Tuenti if someone really cool 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.530
 of tumblr or something that nobody uses 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.120
 google + and then always remember the 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.560
 successes of the subscribed in blogs why 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.420
 Rible motive of life you can see it

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.480
 Google will decide what you want to join YouTube 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.690

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.190
 meaning and link to your accounts to 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.380

 go fuck life after all 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.650
 we will die starting with common sense 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.790
 because these are the horrible things that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.709
 occur in blogs when you do not 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.110
