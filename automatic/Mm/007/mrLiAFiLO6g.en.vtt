00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
be put into context we know where it's

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.580 
be put into context we know where it's
come<00:02:26.730> from<00:02:27.030> where<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:27.720> going<00:02:28.050> when<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.440> was

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
come from where it's going when it was

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.280 
come from where it's going when it was
created<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:30.000> he<00:02:30.450> didn't<00:02:30.720> add<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.080> to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
created and then he didn't add this to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.229 
created and then he didn't add this to
the<00:02:31.860> list<00:02:32.040> he<00:02:32.190> talks<00:02:32.430> about<00:02:32.519> this<00:02:32.849> later<00:02:33.120> on

the list he talks about this later on

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.050 
the list he talks about this later on
but<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:33.720> think<00:02:33.810> something<00:02:34.260> that's<00:02:34.319> also<00:02:34.560> worth

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
but I think something that's also worth

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.250 
but I think something that's also worth
mentioning<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.120> his<00:02:36.480> honor<00:02:36.660> mentioned<00:02:37.140> is

mentioning that his honor mentioned is

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.860 
mentioning that his honor mentioned is
