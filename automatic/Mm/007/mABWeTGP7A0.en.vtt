makes a really nice candy stripe cake
top<00:01:42.640> but<00:01:43.330> we<00:01:43.420> don't<00:01:43.600> have<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.870> leave<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.200> there

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
top but we don't have to leave it there

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.960 
top but we don't have to leave it there
we<00:01:46.330> can<00:01:46.510> take<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.810> stencil<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.440> then<00:01:47.650> just

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
we can take the stencil and then just

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.720 
we can take the stencil and then just
put<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.000> across<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:50.290> other<00:01:50.440> direction<00:01:50.830> now

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
put it across the other direction now

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.150 
put it across the other direction now
you<00:01:51.790> can<00:01:51.970> go<00:01:52.090> straight<00:01:52.630> across<00:01:52.840> or<00:01:53.380> zigzag<00:01:53.890> a

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
you can go straight across or zigzag a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.280 
you can go straight across or zigzag a
little<00:01:54.550> whatever<00:01:54.760> you<00:01:55.030> want<00:01:55.290> crisscross

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
little whatever you want crisscross

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
little whatever you want crisscross
rather<00:01:56.680> then<00:01:57.220> zigzag<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.990> again<00:01:59.320> spray<00:01:59.800> down

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
rather then zigzag and again spray down

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.000 
rather then zigzag and again spray down
spray<00:02:00.910> straight<00:02:01.300> right<00:02:01.540> into<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.010> openings

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
spray straight right into the openings

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.400 
spray straight right into the openings
I'm<00:02:03.490> going<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.940> little<00:02:03.970> bit<00:02:04.300> lighter<00:02:04.570> this<00:02:05.080> time

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
I'm going a little bit lighter this time

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.680 
I'm going a little bit lighter this time
with<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.920> airbrush<00:02:06.370> so<00:02:06.610> that<00:02:06.850> we<00:02:07.330> can<00:02:07.510> see

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
with the airbrush so that we can see

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.380 
with the airbrush so that we can see
both<00:02:07.870> of<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.290> stripes<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.980> get<00:02:09.160> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
both of the stripes and get the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.800 
both of the stripes and get the
definition<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:13.090> then<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.420> have<00:02:13.570> something

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
definition so then you have something

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.810 
definition so then you have something
like<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.930> there's<00:02:17.260> your<00:02:17.530> cake<00:02:17.650> top<00:02:17.950> and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
like that and there's your cake top and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.460 
like that and there's your cake top and
it<00:02:19.060> makes<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.300> real<00:02:19.450> nice<00:02:19.660> effect<00:02:20.080> we<00:02:20.290> could

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
it makes a real nice effect we could

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.729 
it makes a real nice effect we could
also<00:02:20.620> use<00:02:21.330> two<00:02:22.330> colors<00:02:22.600> rather<00:02:22.989> than<00:02:23.230> just<00:02:23.470> one

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
also use two colors rather than just one

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.720 
also use two colors rather than just one
maybe<00:02:24.459> I'll<00:02:24.670> put<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:24.850> stripe<00:02:25.270> on<00:02:25.510> with<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.050> pink

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
maybe I'll put a stripe on with the pink

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.440 
maybe I'll put a stripe on with the pink
and<00:02:28.709> then<00:02:29.709> we'll<00:02:30.040> come<00:02:30.280> back<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:34.300> could

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
and then we'll come back and you could

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.470 
and then we'll come back and you could
use<00:02:34.570> lavender<00:02:34.840> or<00:02:35.410> blue<00:02:35.739> or<00:02:36.300> anything<00:02:37.300> like

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
use lavender or blue or anything like

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.229 
use lavender or blue or anything like
that<00:02:37.510> anything<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.230> would<00:02:38.730> be<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> good<00:02:39.940> color

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
that anything that would be a good color

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.199 
that anything that would be a good color
combination<00:02:40.510> for<00:02:40.930> your<00:02:41.670> now<00:02:42.670> I'm<00:02:42.820> going<00:02:43.060> to

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
combination for your now I'm going to

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.820 
combination for your now I'm going to
rather<00:02:43.540> than<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:45.150> turn<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.380> sideways<00:02:47.380> like

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
rather than just turn it sideways like

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.040 
rather than just turn it sideways like
you<00:02:47.980> did<00:02:48.130> before<00:02:48.450> opposite<00:02:49.450> I'm<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.900> gonna

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
you did before opposite I'm just gonna

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.940 
you did before opposite I'm just gonna
let<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:50.680> overlap<00:02:51.250> about<00:02:51.430> halfway<00:02:51.880> over<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
let this overlap about halfway over the

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.350 
let this overlap about halfway over the
first<00:02:54.190> stripe<00:02:54.459> we<00:02:54.610> did<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:54.970> then<00:02:55.060> I'm<00:02:55.239> gonna

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
first stripe we did and then I'm gonna

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.930 
first stripe we did and then I'm gonna
use<00:02:55.540> blue<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:57.420> what<00:02:58.420> that's<00:02:58.630> gonna<00:02:58.840> do<00:02:59.140> is

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
use blue and what that's gonna do is

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.140 
use blue and what that's gonna do is
hopefully<00:03:00.940> make<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.180> violet<00:03:01.780> where<00:03:02.020> it

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
hopefully make a violet where it

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.330 
hopefully make a violet where it
overlaps<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.450> pink<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.050> then<00:03:05.530> blue<00:03:05.560> where<00:03:06.190> it

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
overlaps the pink and then blue where it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.199 
overlaps the pink and then blue where it
it's<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.150> white

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.970 

and<00:03:11.049> then<00:03:11.650> we'll<00:03:11.859> see<00:03:12.069> what<00:03:12.189> we<00:03:12.340> have<00:03:12.549> here

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
and then we'll see what we have here

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.319 
and then we'll see what we have here
something<00:03:14.980> like<00:03:15.129> that<00:03:15.489> gives<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.879> a<00:03:15.909> three

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
something like that gives you a three

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.649 
something like that gives you a three
tone<00:03:16.650> another<00:03:17.650> possibility<00:03:18.280> would<00:03:19.060> be<00:03:19.120> maybe

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
tone another possibility would be maybe

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.990 
tone another possibility would be maybe
a<00:03:19.780> gingham<00:03:20.230> effect<00:03:20.769> where<00:03:21.010> I'll<00:03:21.519> just<00:03:21.549> go<00:03:21.969> over

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
a gingham effect where I'll just go over

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.660 
a gingham effect where I'll just go over
with<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.780> blue<00:03:23.439> to<00:03:23.769> start<00:03:24.099> with<00:03:29.459> now<00:03:30.459> I've

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
with the blue to start with now I've

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.000 
with the blue to start with now I've
turned<00:03:30.879> this<00:03:31.060> stencil<00:03:31.359> so<00:03:31.870> it's<00:03:32.079> going<00:03:32.859> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
turned this stencil so it's going the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.440 
turned this stencil so it's going the
opposite<00:03:33.879> way<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.629> I'll<00:03:35.159> go<00:03:36.159> ahead<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.730> hit

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
opposite way and I'll go ahead and hit

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.780 
opposite way and I'll go ahead and hit
it<00:03:37.480> with<00:03:37.719> a<00:03:37.750> light<00:03:40.109> light<00:03:41.109> spray<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:42.489> pink

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
it with a light light spray of the pink

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.349 
it with a light light spray of the pink
food<00:03:43.030> color<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.829> then<00:03:48.579> we'll<00:03:48.879> see<00:03:49.090> what<00:03:49.239> we

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
food color and then we'll see what we

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.759 
food color and then we'll see what we
have<00:03:49.540> here<00:03:50.010> we<00:03:51.010> get<00:03:51.159> nice<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:53.109> gingham<00:03:53.409> effect

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
have here we get nice the gingham effect

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.240 
have here we get nice the gingham effect
might<00:03:53.950> be<00:03:54.069> a<00:03:54.099> great<00:03:54.430> effect<00:03:55.269> for<00:03:55.599> a<00:03:56.250> baby

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
might be a great effect for a baby

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.770 
might be a great effect for a baby
shower<00:03:57.549> cake<00:03:57.969> or<00:03:58.180> something<00:03:58.389> if<00:03:58.629> you're

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
shower cake or something if you're

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.920 
shower cake or something if you're
putting<00:03:59.049> some<00:03:59.620> flowers<00:03:59.769> or<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:01.120> baby<00:04:01.780> or

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
putting some flowers or a baby or

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.129 
putting some flowers or a baby or
something<00:04:02.379> on<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.530> cake<00:04:02.769> like<00:04:02.980> that

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
something on a cake like that

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.569 
something on a cake like that
another<00:04:05.139> great<00:04:05.409> effect<00:04:05.769> can<00:04:05.950> be<00:04:05.980> achieved<00:04:06.400> by

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
another great effect can be achieved by

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.809 
another great effect can be achieved by
using<00:04:06.609> a<00:04:07.030> mask<00:04:07.359> is<00:04:07.810> cut<00:04:08.560> out<00:04:08.680> of<00:04:08.889> a<00:04:08.919> clear

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
using a mask is cut out of a clear

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.030 
using a mask is cut out of a clear
plastic<00:04:10.090> here<00:04:11.459> mylar<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.719> I<00:04:13.769> when<00:04:14.769> I<00:04:14.799> make

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
plastic here mylar and I when I make

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.460 
plastic here mylar and I when I make
these<00:04:15.190> little<00:04:15.400> stencils<00:04:15.909> I<00:04:16.030> put<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.659> little

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
these little stencils I put a little

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.649 
these little stencils I put a little
handle<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.310> tape<00:04:18.609> on<00:04:18.849> there<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.180> it's<00:04:19.299> easy<00:04:19.510> to

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
handle of tape on there so it's easy to

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.140 
handle of tape on there so it's easy to
position<00:04:19.959> and<00:04:20.409> pick<00:04:20.590> them<00:04:20.799> up<00:04:21.150> especially

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
position and pick them up especially

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.520 
position and pick them up especially
important<00:04:22.659> when<00:04:22.840> you're<00:04:23.020> working<00:04:23.349> on<00:04:23.440> your

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
important when you're working on your

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.339 
important when you're working on your
cake<00:04:23.889> with<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.880> softer<00:04:25.270> icing<00:04:25.659> so<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.199> don't

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
cake with the softer icing so you don't

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.960 
cake with the softer icing so you don't
have<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.560> try<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.770> dig<00:04:27.039> underneath<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:27.880> I'm

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
have to try to dig underneath so I'm

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.580 
have to try to dig underneath so I'm
going<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.210> try<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.479> Center<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.470> then

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
going to try and Center that and then

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.610 
going to try and Center that and then
I'll<00:04:29.740> set<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.419> stencil<00:04:31.419> on<00:04:31.510> top<00:04:31.750> of<00:04:31.960> this<00:04:33.210> and

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
I'll set the stencil on top of this and

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.120 
I'll set the stencil on top of this and
spray<00:04:35.620> this

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.130 

now<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.190> don't<00:04:40.340> need<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.760> spray<00:04:41.060> where<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.480> mask

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
now I don't need to spray where the mask

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.050 
now I don't need to spray where the mask
is<00:04:42.470> because<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:42.980> know<00:04:43.040> that<00:04:43.400> color<00:04:43.760> is<00:04:43.940> not

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
is because I know that color is not

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.780 
is because I know that color is not
gonna<00:04:44.270> go<00:04:44.480> through<00:04:44.780> there<00:04:44.990> anyway<00:04:45.440> so<00:04:45.790> no

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
gonna go through there anyway so no

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.810 
gonna go through there anyway so no
sense<00:04:47.090> in<00:04:47.300> getting<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:48.350> any<00:04:48.590> messier<00:04:49.520> than<00:04:49.670> it

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
sense in getting it any messier than it

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.980 
sense in getting it any messier than it
needs<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.210> be<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.970> or<00:04:53.060> something<00:04:53.480> like<00:04:53.660> that

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
needs to be so or something like that

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.530 
needs to be so or something like that
and<00:04:54.520> at<00:04:55.520> this<00:04:55.670> point<00:04:57.310> take<00:04:58.310> this<00:04:58.490> office<00:04:58.940> like

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
and at this point take this office like

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.450 
and at this point take this office like
so<00:04:59.900> which<00:05:00.320> just<00:05:00.530> makes<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.830> a<00:05:01.040> real<00:05:01.280> nice

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
so which just makes it a real nice

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.420 
so which just makes it a real nice
background<00:05:01.760> for<00:05:02.300> flowers<00:05:02.840> or<00:05:03.200> or<00:05:03.590> any

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
background for flowers or or any

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.340 
background for flowers or or any
situation<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.180> might<00:05:05.510> want<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:05.840> do<00:05:05.960> I'm<00:05:06.200> gonna

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
situation you might want to do I'm gonna

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.960 
situation you might want to do I'm gonna
add<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.650> little<00:05:06.920> more<00:05:07.220> to<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:07.490> here<00:05:07.760> I'm<00:05:07.880> going

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
add a little more to it here I'm going

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.520 
add a little more to it here I'm going
to<00:05:08.030> reposition<00:05:08.390> this<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.200> then<00:05:09.290> come<00:05:09.500> back

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
to reposition this and then come back

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.710 
to reposition this and then come back
with<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:09.890> different<00:05:10.280> color<00:05:10.550> okay<00:05:11.510> this<00:05:11.690> time

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
with a different color okay this time

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.200 
with a different color okay this time
I've<00:05:12.140> positioned<00:05:13.130> the<00:05:13.430> stencil<00:05:13.880> kind<00:05:14.090> of<00:05:14.150> a

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
I've positioned the stencil kind of a

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.600 
I've positioned the stencil kind of a
crosswise<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:16.450> we'll<00:05:17.450> just<00:05:18.440> add<00:05:18.800> some<00:05:19.250> color

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
crosswise so we'll just add some color

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.480 
crosswise so we'll just add some color
and<00:05:19.930> maybe<00:05:20.930> add<00:05:21.170> a<00:05:21.200> little<00:05:21.560> heavier<00:05:21.980> to<00:05:22.250> one

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
and maybe add a little heavier to one

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.050 
and maybe add a little heavier to one
side<00:05:23.620> inside<00:05:24.620> of<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:25.040> stripe<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.670> not<00:05:25.850> so

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
side inside of the stripe and not so

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.970 
side inside of the stripe and not so
much<00:05:26.210> to<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.570> other<00:05:29.290> and<00:05:30.290> I<00:05:30.410> can<00:05:30.470> just<00:05:30.770> leave

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
much to the other and I can just leave

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.760 
much to the other and I can just leave
it<00:05:31.130> like<00:05:31.160> that<00:05:31.340> or<00:05:31.880> go<00:05:32.330> back<00:05:32.600> this<00:05:33.080> direction

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
it like that or go back this direction

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.980 
it like that or go back this direction
also<00:05:35.770> again<00:05:36.770> kind<00:05:37.070> of<00:05:37.160> hitting<00:05:37.940> just<00:05:38.270> one<00:05:38.600> side

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
also again kind of hitting just one side

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.490 
also again kind of hitting just one side
rather<00:05:39.260> than<00:05:40.210> everything<00:05:41.210> by<00:05:41.990> one<00:05:42.200> side<00:05:42.470> I

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
rather than everything by one side I

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.690 
rather than everything by one side I
mean<00:05:42.830> just<00:05:43.100> off<00:05:43.310> to<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:45.190> heavier<00:05:46.190> on<00:05:46.370> this<00:05:46.520> one

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
mean just off to the heavier on this one

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.550 
mean just off to the heavier on this one
side<00:05:46.880> leaving<00:05:47.120> part<00:05:47.510> of<00:05:47.600> it<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:47.930> other<00:05:48.050> side<00:05:48.320> a

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
side leaving part of it the other side a

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.430 
side leaving part of it the other side a
little<00:05:48.860> lighter<00:05:49.100> and<00:05:49.700> it<00:05:50.510> just<00:05:50.720> adds<00:05:50.960> an

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
little lighter and it just adds an

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.330 
little lighter and it just adds an
effect<00:05:52.340> that<00:05:52.490> might<00:05:53.450> be<00:05:54.410> more<00:05:54.620> interesting

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
effect that might be more interesting

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.930 
effect that might be more interesting
perhaps<00:05:56.200> in<00:05:57.200> some<00:05:57.530> situations<00:05:58.190> anyway<00:05:58.580> so

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
perhaps in some situations anyway so

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.700 
perhaps in some situations anyway so
let's<00:05:59.120> see<00:05:59.270> what<00:05:59.420> we<00:05:59.510> have<00:05:59.540> here<00:06:01.180> take<00:06:02.180> this

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
let's see what we have here take this

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:09.970 
let's see what we have here take this
and<00:06:04.060> then<00:06:05.060> we<00:06:05.210> have<00:06:05.240> this<00:06:05.600> very<00:06:08.980> interesting

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
and then we have this very interesting

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.040 
and then we have this very interesting
background<00:06:10.130> kind<00:06:10.610> of<00:06:10.700> looks<00:06:10.880> like<00:06:10.940> a<00:06:11.060> colored

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
background kind of looks like a colored

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.590 
background kind of looks like a colored
Easter<00:06:12.440> egg<00:06:12.620> pretty<00:06:13.220> fancy<00:06:13.670> there<00:06:13.850> but<00:06:14.330> anyway

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
Easter egg pretty fancy there but anyway

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.450 
Easter egg pretty fancy there but anyway
that's<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.960> way<00:06:15.020> you<00:06:15.140> would<00:06:15.350> use<00:06:15.530> this<00:06:15.830> this

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
that's the way you would use this this

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.860 
that's the way you would use this this
stencil<00:06:16.730> it's<00:06:17.150> a<00:06:17.240> great<00:06:17.510> tool<00:06:17.840> for

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
stencil it's a great tool for

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.410 
stencil it's a great tool for
airbrushing<00:06:18.770> or<00:06:19.190> adding<00:06:19.670> highlights<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.390> your

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
airbrushing or adding highlights to your

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.100 
airbrushing or adding highlights to your
cakes<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:21.430> enhancing<00:06:22.430> them<00:06:22.580> and<00:06:22.790> wait<00:06:23.390> ways

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
cakes and enhancing them and wait ways

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.690 
cakes and enhancing them and wait ways
that<00:06:24.350> you<00:06:24.440> really<00:06:24.710> can't<00:06:24.920> do<00:06:25.160> without<00:06:25.400> the

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
that you really can't do without the

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:36.959 
that you really can't do without the
stencil<00:06:26.090> on<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.240> airbrush

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:36.969
