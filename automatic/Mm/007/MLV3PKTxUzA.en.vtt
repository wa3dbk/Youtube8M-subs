00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.470
 a bit more expensive 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.190

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.880

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.860
 as a 5 native 5th eighth year, she arrived 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.050
 Moscow understandable regret mi 6 understandable 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.040
 nonsense in the advertisement is so deceiving in 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.830
 him to deceive 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.170
 well, because the fifth year is the sixth year as 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.840
 although for the price it is completely different things 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.640
 but besides in their language they drove around 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.530
 Beats his year, I understand for example 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.240
 bought a car and when I will sell it 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.700
 here is a girl will sell in two 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.430
 years to whom she will tell these 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 that's about the stupidity of the carcass is there something 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.280
 you can see trawls, what is written in TCP 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.020

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.840
 often meet their stories when 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.000
 you look at the car is not quite the owners 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.920

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.369

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.210

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.640
 it was clear to all but excellent though 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.759
 that TCP there he is not a duplicate not in return that 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.950
 you have a central excise customs it 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.890
 of course let's get inside can 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.730
 be peeking about what you smeared the seats 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.950
 he is completely spawn 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.470
 the seat here is his genuine leather than 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.420
 what snot excuse me or four what 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.670
 this shoe cream and just what it is 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.450
 storage may be similar to 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.290
 steering wheel Astana grater hands and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.750
 vlad not but i see something 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.489
 you have rubbed 120 thousand kilometers 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.239
 utter a run and now what 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:40.180
 speedometer 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:43.150
 on the odometer that 10 that 10 what and 110 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.580
 miles and 120 thousand kilometers this is this 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:51.489
 is it the same thing we fly there that 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.489
 Means neither here nor kilometers on the ground 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.700
 multiplied in proportion 1 and 6 as far as I am 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.959
 I understand it how much 160 there is 170 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.329
 thousand you give at all oh well you 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.579
 are different 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:10.590
 that's why he blocked his ass 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:13.329
 and shoe cream here's this seat i 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.160
 I see that you have a light bulb tire 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.890
 how do you explain your wonderful 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.380
 the owner than explain it and you understand 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.660
 I turn the key is not tested exactly 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.430
 sell three bulbs if we argue 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.440
 I can take this console down now 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.900
 and show how to extinguish 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.910
 light bulbs and I see in your eyes that you 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.220
 understand perfectly what I am talking about 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.500
 I think that you did it yesterday or 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.500
 the day before yesterday 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.500
 apa 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.020
 This is an indication to you that if you 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.490
 open the hood better carry and there 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.400
 my head is good that I now 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.710
 talk did not give 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.930
 see a homogeneous country 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.890
 Yes, I think it is from wear simply 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.850
 listen about dude among on we will find the world 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:03.290
 shadows in the summer or something went there 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:08.010
 three thorns on the wheel of hunger beetles 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:11.460
 as far as not 310 actions mark 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.830
 preserved about him as true but you had 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.750
 surely a blow to this side is just me 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.480
 I think that he was very long and done 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.880
 it's still in america so what us 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.880
 dear with the year then fooled cars 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.910
 because you told me it's in 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.850
 perfect condition condition than he 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.770
 unique they are perfect well first 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.900
 queue possible potential 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.270
 problems on the engine which outbid 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.250
 trying to hide for the guests all the same 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.200
 the notorious light bulb on the console by the way 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.230
 this may be the reason 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.930
 the owner did not charge this car 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.180
 to the second-hand dealer here without thinking twice put out 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.490
 light bulbs and try to push the car 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.770
 The trick in this case is that it did not 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.050
 start the car no ride no 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.060
 meaning because consider this 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.760
 car costs at least 100 thousand 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.750
 cheaper to talk to outbid 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.750
 just useless
