hello<00:00:01.230> everyone<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:01.890> Daniel<00:00:02.310> and

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hello everyone this is Daniel and

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.240 
hello everyone this is Daniel and
welcome<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.939> another<00:00:03.090> video<00:00:03.799> today<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:04.950> thought

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
welcome to another video today I thought

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.800 
welcome to another video today I thought
I<00:00:05.310> would<00:00:05.520> show<00:00:05.670> you<00:00:05.700> again<00:00:06.000> two<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.210> my<00:00:06.450> little

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
I would show you again two of my little

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.339 
I would show you again two of my little
test<00:00:07.470> projects<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.130> I'm<00:00:08.250> doing<00:00:09.050> so<00:00:10.050> let<00:00:10.230> me

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
test projects that I'm doing so let me

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.620 
test projects that I'm doing so let me
very<00:00:10.380> quickly<00:00:11.040> introduce<00:00:11.849> what<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.480> is

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
very quickly introduce what this is

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.890 
very quickly introduce what this is
about<00:00:12.920> so<00:00:13.920> basically<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.880> I've<00:00:14.969> done<00:00:15.120> is

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
about so basically what I've done is

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.590 
about so basically what I've done is
bring<00:00:16.710> two<00:00:16.980> camera<00:00:17.580> tracking<00:00:17.880> tests<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
bring two camera tracking tests and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.300 
bring two camera tracking tests and
integration<00:00:20.960> tests<00:00:21.960> basically<00:00:22.279> for<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
integration tests basically for a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.120 
integration tests basically for a
project<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.970> I'll<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.449> taking<00:00:25.380> part<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.830> in

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
project that I'll be taking part in in

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.689 
project that I'll be taking part in in
the<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.640> future<00:00:28.070> basically<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.340> wanted<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the in the future basically I wanted to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.810 
the in the future basically I wanted to
see<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:30.029> I'm<00:00:30.150> able<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> our<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:32.340> there

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
see if I'm able to do it our if there

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
see if I'm able to do it our if there
will<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:32.969> any<00:00:33.210> issues<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.649> know<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:35.040> I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
will be any issues just so I know what I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.290 
will be any issues just so I know what I
can<00:00:35.430> expect<00:00:36.390> from<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> result<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.090> first

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
can expect from the result so this first

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.850 
can expect from the result so this first
example<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.469> test<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.160> tracking<00:00:42.860> an

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
example was a test for tracking an

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.729 
example was a test for tracking an
object<00:00:44.629> that<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:46.079> hard<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> track<00:00:46.590> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
object that is really hard to track you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.040 
object that is really hard to track you
can<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.399> entire<00:00:47.670> surface<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.480> phone

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
can see the entire surface of this phone

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.130 
can see the entire surface of this phone
is<00:00:49.700> giving<00:00:50.700> us<00:00:50.789> reflections<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> was<00:00:51.840> really

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
is giving us reflections and was really

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.810 
is giving us reflections and was really
a<00:00:52.170> challenge<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.100> think<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> turned<00:00:53.760> out

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
a challenge but I think it turned out

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.400 
a challenge but I think it turned out
pretty<00:00:53.969> well<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:55.520> yeah<00:00:56.520> I'll<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
pretty well so yeah I'll to the the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.529 
pretty well so yeah I'll to the the
blend<00:00:58.620> files<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> moment<00:00:59.550> now<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> other

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
blend files in a moment now the other

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.290 
blend files in a moment now the other
one<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.989> more<00:01:01.620> about<00:01:01.859> object<00:01:02.609> integration<00:01:03.180> as

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
one is more about object integration as

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
one is more about object integration as
realistic<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:03.930> possible<00:01:03.989> obviously<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
realistic as possible obviously the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.359 
realistic as possible obviously the
clothes<00:01:05.580> isn't<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.270> realistic<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.830> wish<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
clothes isn't as realistic as I wish it

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.030 
clothes isn't as realistic as I wish it
would<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:09.110> but<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.320> about<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> physics

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
would be but it's not about the physics

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.770 
would be but it's not about the physics
anyways<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.729> much<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> colors

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
anyways it's much more about the colors

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
anyways it's much more about the colors
and<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:15.439> around<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.180> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and I think around here I think it is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.830 
and I think around here I think it is
realistic<00:01:18.689> enough<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.759> be<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:21.180> noticeable

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
realistic enough to be not noticeable

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.060 
realistic enough to be not noticeable
that<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.560> integrated<00:01:24.290> at<00:01:25.290> least<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.979> you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that it is integrated at least if you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.609 
that it is integrated at least if you
don't<00:01:26.299> look<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.509> work<00:01:27.810> closely<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.530> you

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
don't look at it work closely or if you

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.270 
don't look at it work closely or if you
don't<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:29.100> about<00:01:29.220> why<00:01:30.060> there<00:01:30.299> would<00:01:30.509> be

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
don't think about why there would be

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.590 
don't think about why there would be
something<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.180> room<00:01:33.390> or

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
something like that in a room or

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.249 
something like that in a room or
something<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> let's<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
something like that so let's go to the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.640 
something like that so let's go to the
files<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.159> first<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:40.470> phone

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
files the first one here is the phone

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
files the first one here is the phone
scene<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.820> see<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> bit<00:01:42.509> lazy<00:01:42.689> I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
scene so you can see it was a bit lazy I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.230 
scene so you can see it was a bit lazy I
didn't<00:01:43.259> use<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.710> features<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.610> camera<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
didn't use the features for camera and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.240 
didn't use the features for camera and
object<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.619> could<00:01:46.950> hear<00:01:48.590> yeah<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> did

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
object as I could hear yeah all I did

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.880 
object as I could hear yeah all I did
was<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.729> tracked<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.020> phone<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
was I tracked just this phone as if it

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.429 
was I tracked just this phone as if it
was<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.880> environment<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.810> gives<00:01:55.259> us<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
was the environment that gives us a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.780 
was the environment that gives us a
camera<00:01:55.890> moves<00:01:56.219> around<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
camera moves around like that and

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.850 
camera moves around like that and
basically<00:01:59.790> everything<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.899> stationary

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
basically everything that is stationary

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.109 
basically everything that is stationary
in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> scene<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:03.829> then<00:02:05.570> sticks<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.840> phone

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
in the scene is then sticks to the phone

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.170 
in the scene is then sticks to the phone
so<00:02:09.119> regarding<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.899> tracking<00:02:10.350> I<00:02:10.880> made<00:02:11.880> good

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
so regarding the tracking I made good

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.400 
so regarding the tracking I made good
use<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.840> planar<00:02:13.580> tracking<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.970> think<00:02:15.410> here

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
use of the planar tracking I think here

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.540 
use of the planar tracking I think here
is<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.830> under<00:02:17.430> perspective<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:20.400> was

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
is it's under perspective and it was

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.760 
is it's under perspective and it was
pretty<00:02:20.790> cool<00:02:21.420> how<00:02:21.690> well<00:02:22.319> this<00:02:22.470> worked

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
pretty cool how well this worked

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.520 
pretty cool how well this worked
actually<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.580> here<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.270> see<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:25.260> track

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
actually so here you can see the track

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.340 
actually so here you can see the track
the<00:02:26.280> center<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.910> sticked<00:02:27.600> very<00:02:27.810> well<00:02:28.080> to

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the center of it sticked very well to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.160 
the center of it sticked very well to
the<00:02:28.800> place<00:02:29.040> where<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:29.940> belongs<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.690> that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
the place where it belongs so that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.380 
the place where it belongs so that
worked<00:02:31.380> out<00:02:31.470> pretty<00:02:31.530> well<00:02:31.800> now<00:02:32.760> as<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.240> can

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
worked out pretty well now as you can

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.590 
worked out pretty well now as you can
see<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.340> reflections<00:02:35.340> were<00:02:35.610> quite<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> quite

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
see the reflections were quite a quite

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.220 
see the reflections were quite a quite
big<00:02:36.780> big<00:02:37.500> issue<00:02:37.739> here<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.310> also<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.870> motion

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
big big issue here and also the motion

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.130 
big big issue here and also the motion
blur<00:02:40.470> at<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.850> end<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.150> particular<00:02:42.420> was

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
blur at the end in particular was

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.540 
blur at the end in particular was
incredibly<00:02:44.100> strong<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.890> actually<00:02:46.890> quite<00:02:47.220> hard

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
incredibly strong so actually quite hard

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.540 
incredibly strong so actually quite hard
to<00:02:47.640> track<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:49.530> was<00:02:49.739> really<00:02:49.950> surprised<00:02:50.340> at

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
to track that was really surprised at

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.890 
to track that was really surprised at
how<00:02:50.700> well<00:02:50.970> blender<00:02:51.510> was<00:02:51.690> able<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.930> solve<00:02:52.230> this

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
how well blender was able to solve this

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.449 
how well blender was able to solve this
so<00:02:54.900> yeah<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.530> was<00:02:55.650> quite<00:02:55.830> successful<00:02:56.430> with

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
so yeah it was quite successful with

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.840 
so yeah it was quite successful with
that

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
that

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.060 
that
now<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.600> other<00:02:57.900> file<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.590> want<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:58.890> show

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
now the other file that I want to show

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.690 
now the other file that I want to show
you<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.489> this<00:02:59.880> one<00:03:00.060> here<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:01.130> here<00:03:02.130> as<00:03:02.280> well<00:03:02.310> I

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
you is this one here and here as well I

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.020 
you is this one here and here as well I
did<00:03:03.090> make<00:03:03.810> use<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.560> planar<00:03:04.830> tracks<00:03:05.280> which

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
did make use of the planar tracks which

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.240 
did make use of the planar tracks which
helped<00:03:06.330> me<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.420> lot

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
helped me a lot

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.039 
helped me a lot
towards<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:09.000> end<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:11.780> they're<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:12.959> a

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
towards the end and they're just a

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.319 
towards the end and they're just a
really<00:03:13.079> interesting<00:03:13.440> concept<00:03:13.829> I<00:03:14.130> think<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.730> I

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
really interesting concept I think and I

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.569 
really interesting concept I think and I
haven't<00:03:16.049> used<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.620> many<00:03:16.769> different<00:03:16.920> camera

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
haven't used so many different camera

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.670 
haven't used so many different camera
trackers<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.180> far<00:03:18.420> but<00:03:19.079> blender<00:03:19.590> is

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
trackers so far but blender is

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.280 
trackers so far but blender is
definitely<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> great<00:03:20.610> one<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:21.030> my<00:03:21.150> opinion<00:03:21.510> now

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
definitely a great one in my opinion now

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.460 
definitely a great one in my opinion now
regarding<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.190> object<00:03:23.579> integration<00:03:24.440> what<00:03:25.440> I

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
regarding the object integration what I

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.520 
regarding the object integration what I
did<00:03:25.709> was<00:03:25.860> basically<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.459> used<00:03:27.269> an<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.870> panorama

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
did was basically I used an a panorama

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.630 
did was basically I used an a panorama
of<00:03:28.829> of<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.959> room<00:03:31.170> as<00:03:31.640> environment

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
of of the the room as environment

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.199 
of of the the room as environment
lightening<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.890> then<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.920> projected<00:03:35.250> the

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
lightening and then I projected the

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.110 
lightening and then I projected the
video<00:03:36.660> onto<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:37.470> plane<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.579> ground<00:03:38.610> as<00:03:39.090> a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
video onto a plane on the ground as a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.140 
video onto a plane on the ground as a
diffused<00:03:39.600> texture<00:03:40.670> with<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.820> window

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
diffused texture with the window

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.280 
diffused texture with the window
coordinates<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:44.150> basically<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:45.870> floor

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
coordinates so that basically this floor

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.170 
coordinates so that basically this floor
looks<00:03:46.650> exactly<00:03:46.950> like<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.700> floor<00:03:47.940> in<00:03:48.060> this

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
looks exactly like the floor in this

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.620 
looks exactly like the floor in this
video<00:03:48.480> which<00:03:49.320> gave<00:03:49.590> me<00:03:49.769> then<00:03:49.950> all<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:53.630> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
video which gave me then all the the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.569 
video which gave me then all the the
bounce<00:03:54.959> light<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.680> stuff<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.549> I

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
bounce light and stuff like that that I

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.030 
bounce light and stuff like that that I
wanted<00:03:56.970> at<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.870> bottom<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.290> I'm<00:03:58.560> not<00:03:58.709> sure<00:03:58.920> if

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
wanted at the bottom and I'm not sure if

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.180 
wanted at the bottom and I'm not sure if
that<00:03:59.070> really<00:03:59.519> made<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.820> big<00:04:00.209> difference<00:04:00.420> but<00:04:01.190> it

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
that really made a big difference but it

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.270 
that really made a big difference but it
helped<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.790> bit<00:04:03.510> at<00:04:03.660> least<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:04.140> give<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.709> give<00:04:05.160> it

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
helped a bit at least to give a give it

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.319 
helped a bit at least to give a give it
a<00:04:05.630> realism<00:04:09.530> anyways<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.859> think<00:04:10.980> also<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:12.090> track

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
a realism anyways I think also the track

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.670 
a realism anyways I think also the track
here<00:04:12.540> wasn't<00:04:12.810> perfect

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
here wasn't perfect

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.060 
here wasn't perfect
really<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.320> didn't<00:04:16.320> play<00:04:16.440> too<00:04:16.500> much<00:04:16.799> around

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
really I didn't play too much around

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.820 
really I didn't play too much around
with<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:17.789> lens<00:04:18.299> distortion<00:04:19.019> things<00:04:19.500> and

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
with all the lens distortion things and

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.040 
with all the lens distortion things and
such

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
such

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.110 
such
basically<00:04:23.050> tried<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.380> get<00:04:24.310> sure<00:04:24.550> all<00:04:24.850> that

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
basically tried to get sure all that

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.170 
basically tried to get sure all that
with<00:04:26.010> just<00:04:27.010> really<00:04:27.370> little<00:04:27.610> amount<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:27.940> work

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
with just really little amount of work

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.730 
with just really little amount of work
since<00:04:30.510> I'm<00:04:31.510> not<00:04:31.690> going<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:32.050> have<00:04:32.140> lots<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.500> time

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
since I'm not going to have lots of time

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.980 
since I'm not going to have lots of time
later<00:04:32.980> on<00:04:33.100> as<00:04:33.190> well<00:04:33.370> but<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.330> think<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.810> still

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
later on as well but I think it still

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.720 
later on as well but I think it still
turned<00:04:35.170> out<00:04:35.290> well<00:04:35.500> basically<00:04:36.070> what<00:04:36.220> I<00:04:36.250> did<00:04:36.520> was

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
turned out well basically what I did was

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.690 
turned out well basically what I did was
I<00:04:37.030> made<00:04:37.270> sure<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.540> place<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:37.960> marker<00:04:38.260> there<00:04:38.860> at<00:04:39.640> a

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
I made sure to place a marker there at a

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.500 
I made sure to place a marker there at a
point<00:04:39.970> where<00:04:40.270> I<00:04:40.300> wanted<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.930> put<00:04:41.560> an<00:04:41.680> object<00:04:41.830> ad

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
point where I wanted to put an object ad

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.490 
point where I wanted to put an object ad
so<00:04:43.510> that<00:04:44.430> in<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.580> end<00:04:45.730> I<00:04:46.260> could<00:04:47.260> make<00:04:47.470> sure

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
so that in the end I could make sure

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.800 
so that in the end I could make sure
that<00:04:47.920> my<00:04:48.310> object<00:04:48.670> is<00:04:48.790> closed<00:04:49.120> this<00:04:49.480> track

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
that my object is closed this track

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.780 
that my object is closed this track
which<00:04:50.650> kind<00:04:51.550> of<00:04:51.640> guarantees<00:04:52.090> me<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:53.790> the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
which kind of guarantees me that the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.810 
which kind of guarantees me that the
object<00:04:55.120> will<00:04:55.300> stick<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.710> ground<00:04:57.010> as<00:04:57.580> good

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
object will stick to the ground as good

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.870 
object will stick to the ground as good
as<00:04:57.910> possible<00:04:58.800> at<00:04:59.800> least<00:04:59.860> better<00:05:00.220> than<00:05:00.610> if<00:05:00.760> I

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
as possible at least better than if I

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.970 
as possible at least better than if I
would<00:05:01.060> have<00:05:01.180> put<00:05:01.390> it<00:05:01.420> to<00:05:02.020> somewhere<00:05:02.320> like<00:05:02.950> here

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
would have put it to somewhere like here

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.440 
would have put it to somewhere like here
where<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.520> distortion<00:05:03.820> would<00:05:04.090> be<00:05:04.240> very

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
where the distortion would be very

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.930 
where the distortion would be very
strong<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.020> you'd<00:05:05.230> see<00:05:05.560> it<00:05:05.620> drift<00:05:06.460> away<00:05:06.550> from

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
strong and you'd see it drift away from

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.900 
strong and you'd see it drift away from
its<00:05:07.090> original<00:05:07.210> position<00:05:07.630> so<00:05:08.490> these<00:05:09.490> are<00:05:09.640> kind

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
its original position so these are kind

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.730 
its original position so these are kind
of<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.060> things<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.540> I<00:05:10.570> kept<00:05:11.020> in<00:05:11.140> mind<00:05:11.350> while

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
of the things that I kept in mind while

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.970 
of the things that I kept in mind while
I'm<00:05:11.860> up<00:05:11.950> here<00:05:11.980> on<00:05:12.130> this<00:05:13.170> alright<00:05:14.170> I<00:05:14.200> hope<00:05:14.800> you
