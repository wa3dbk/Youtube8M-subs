00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.640
 our little roll of ours 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.520
 mozzarella with ingredients that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.560
 we will find and during our seasons 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.269
 summer then we take ours 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.340
 mozzarella painting preserved in 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.010
 fridge between the two sheets of wax paper 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.779
 where you can follow how it will do already on 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.790
 our youtube channel you will find at 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.120
 our video recipe we remove the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.670
 mozzarella from the paper we take the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.750
 car cut in two we do so 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.750
 a kind of dish 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.070
 today we talk about eggplant with us 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.610
 basil ricotta a very simple thing 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.320
 we want to give you the pleasure of 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.390
 create something cheaper i give you one 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.969
 straight think maybe a parmigiana 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.340
 made eggplant and golden fried in the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.949
 place as it is used to do as the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.870
 let's do it in Naples and stuff this 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.430
 this letter with this eggplant 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.010
 golden hurry in the place then put us 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.260
 a bit of ricotta wrapped it in a 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.840
 cold parmigiana roll 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.720
 then here are the eggplants we have put 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.310
 of our roll then we sell a 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.710
 pinch of salt to season a bit of 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 basil what we do we take a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.470
 excellent ricotta from fuscella and la 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.980
 take it was put a little 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:41.380
 let's dissolve it a little now let's put it in the 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:46.450
 our piping add well 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.450
 we make our vote well 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.330
 now there is nothing left but 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.140
 wrap it I wash to make that 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.270
 this system is very easy so 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.150
 even from his death house you see 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.150
 seeing things some stops there but is 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.800
 difficult it did n't stop me from being able to 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.369
 make a thing very extremely 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.100
 sincere 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.420
 take this way we transfer it 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.720
 on our film so slowly 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.910
 with the help of low film 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.950
 we wrap you 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.020
 and so here is a lot I do okay 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.300
 with cars of the avellino singer and well 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:39.240
 well so see 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:41.580
 and so it is done and we always go to 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.420
 tighten so that I fill them in 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.220
 it compacts well and also rolls vi 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.090
 I invite you to do this system once 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.980
 store it in the fridge for a while 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.380
 resume because maybe with the heat 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.200
 with the products put there could not 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.650
 lose some elasticity and here's it 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.100
 we are 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.920
 the roll is ready cut the la 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.630
 film and here we are 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.670
 what to do now this way mine 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.989
 advice is to slice it with a 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.720
 sharp knife and then to season 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.600
 the dish maybe with two cherry tomatoes with 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.739
 a sort of ham maybe there 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.970
 let's see our recipe a little 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.980
 cut our own by sushi 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.410
 let's have a private couple take the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.690
 film 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:41.870
 and here is the first bike 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:52.510
 let's take still saw that you want 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:52.510
 March of blue water to be another cut 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.790
 here it is 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.400
 well 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.940
 here and there will now be another dish and 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.160
 ends here, however, from home you may well 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.130
 think about being able to continue it with 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.109
 some tomatoes maybe with some 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.780
 ruberto and a little mixture in the garden 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.370
 here are a few slices of ham a thread 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.669
 of oil we never do not fail to 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.669
 the good one 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:43.640
 is the recipe a leaflet of is ready 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.640
