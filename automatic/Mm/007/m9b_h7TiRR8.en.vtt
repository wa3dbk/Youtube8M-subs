00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.300 

let's<00:00:05.330> say<00:00:05.480> you<00:00:05.540> plant<00:00:05.930> a<00:00:06.140> PPD<00:00:06.350> and<00:00:06.859> a<00:00:06.920> person

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.310 
let's say you plant a PPD and a person

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.950 
let's say you plant a PPD and a person
comes<00:00:07.460> back<00:00:07.759> in<00:00:08.029> and<00:00:08.180> now<00:00:08.300> they<00:00:08.480> want<00:00:08.660> to<00:00:08.780> find

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
comes back in and now they want to find

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.480 
comes back in and now they want to find
out<00:00:09.110> whether<00:00:09.440> it's<00:00:09.680> positive<00:00:10.250> or<00:00:10.430> negative

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
out whether it's positive or negative

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.369 
out whether it's positive or negative
the<00:00:11.180> way<00:00:11.299> I<00:00:11.330> kind<00:00:11.690> of<00:00:11.750> think<00:00:11.900> about<00:00:12.020> it<00:00:12.230> is<00:00:12.290> I

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:12.379 
the way I kind of think about it is I

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.220 
the way I kind of think about it is I
break<00:00:12.740> people<00:00:12.769> down<00:00:13.160> into<00:00:14.120> their<00:00:14.570> risk<00:00:14.900> group

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
break people down into their risk group

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.350 
break people down into their risk group
and<00:00:15.440> I<00:00:15.469> think<00:00:15.530> of<00:00:15.799> three<00:00:16.279> risk<00:00:16.849> groups<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:17.330> think

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
and I think of three risk groups I think

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.730 
and I think of three risk groups I think
high<00:00:18.369> risk<00:00:19.369> medium<00:00:20.150> risk<00:00:20.390> and<00:00:20.660> low<00:00:21.140> risk<00:00:21.170> and

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
high risk medium risk and low risk and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.500 
high risk medium risk and low risk and
if<00:00:21.890> they're<00:00:22.340> not<00:00:22.369> higher<00:00:22.789> medium<00:00:23.330> then

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
if they're not higher medium then

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.720 
if they're not higher medium then
basically<00:00:23.840> they<00:00:24.050> kind<00:00:24.260> of<00:00:24.320> by<00:00:24.500> default<00:00:24.730> become

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
basically they kind of by default become

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.670 
basically they kind of by default become
low<00:00:26.000> risk<00:00:26.240> that's<00:00:26.570> how<00:00:26.840> it<00:00:26.990> works<00:00:27.170> out

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
low risk that's how it works out

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.490 
low risk that's how it works out
so<00:00:28.310> going<00:00:28.789> to<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:29.090> high<00:00:29.300> risk<00:00:29.539> there's<00:00:30.170> two

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
so going to the high risk there's two

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.259 
so going to the high risk there's two
ways<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:30.740> think<00:00:30.949> about<00:00:31.279> it<00:00:31.400> right<00:00:31.460> either<00:00:31.910> I'm

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
ways to think about it right either I'm

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.060 
ways to think about it right either I'm
really<00:00:32.570> worried<00:00:33.050> that<00:00:33.379> they<00:00:33.530> are<00:00:33.710> going<00:00:33.980> to

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
really worried that they are going to

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.680 
really worried that they are going to
have<00:00:34.280> TB<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:34.879> that<00:00:34.970> could<00:00:35.120> be<00:00:35.210> someone<00:00:35.449> who<00:00:35.629> I

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
have TB and that could be someone who I

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.799 
have TB and that could be someone who I
suspect<00:00:35.809> has<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:37.100> maybe<00:00:37.760> they<00:00:37.940> have<00:00:38.120> you<00:00:38.690> know

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
suspect has it maybe they have you know

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.950 
suspect has it maybe they have you know
very<00:00:39.080> abnormal<00:00:39.290> chest<00:00:40.190> x-ray<00:00:40.879> or<00:00:41.299> maybe<00:00:41.839> they

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
very abnormal chest x-ray or maybe they

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.020 
very abnormal chest x-ray or maybe they
have<00:00:42.080> lots<00:00:42.290> of<00:00:42.440> fevers<00:00:42.949> coughs<00:00:43.430> you<00:00:43.879> know

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
have lots of fevers coughs you know

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.369 
have lots of fevers coughs you know
night<00:00:44.210> sweats<00:00:44.570> things<00:00:44.839> like<00:00:45.019> that

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
night sweats things like that

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.890 
night sweats things like that
and<00:00:45.680> I<00:00:45.710> really<00:00:45.979> suspect<00:00:46.159> TB<00:00:46.790> they<00:00:47.449> would<00:00:47.690> fall

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
and I really suspect TB they would fall

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.840 
and I really suspect TB they would fall
in<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.019> high<00:00:48.260> risk<00:00:48.500> right<00:00:48.979> because<00:00:49.430> I<00:00:49.460> worry

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
in the high risk right because I worry

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.630 
in the high risk right because I worry
that<00:00:50.180> they<00:00:50.299> have<00:00:50.540> it<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.869> in<00:00:51.229> fact<00:00:51.470> even<00:00:52.280> their

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
that they have it and in fact even their

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.270 
that they have it and in fact even their
family<00:00:53.150> members<00:00:53.449> close<00:00:53.690> contact<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:54.710> let's

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
family members close contact so let's

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.840 
family members close contact so let's
say<00:00:55.430> a<00:00:55.460> grandchild<00:00:56.330> of<00:00:56.659> a<00:00:57.500> person<00:00:58.010> who<00:00:58.220> has<00:00:58.460> TB

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
say a grandchild of a person who has TB

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.660 
say a grandchild of a person who has TB
or<00:00:59.210> an<00:00:59.690> uncle<00:01:00.049> or<00:01:00.140> auntie<00:01:00.440> of<00:01:00.949> somebody<00:01:01.549> who

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
or an uncle or auntie of somebody who

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.549 
or an uncle or auntie of somebody who
has<00:01:01.790> TB<00:01:02.000> someone<00:01:02.360> in<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.510> household<00:01:02.989> they<00:01:03.320> are

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
has TB someone in the household they are

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.609 
has TB someone in the household they are
also<00:01:04.100> at<00:01:04.250> high<00:01:04.460> risk<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:05.000> getting<00:01:05.299> TB<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.140> these

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
also at high risk of getting TB so these

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.440 
also at high risk of getting TB so these
are<00:01:06.799> folks<00:01:07.040> I'm<00:01:07.220> worried<00:01:07.700> may<00:01:08.150> have

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
are folks I'm worried may have

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.080 
are folks I'm worried may have
tuberculosis<00:01:09.070> but<00:01:10.070> also<00:01:10.280> in<00:01:10.550> this<00:01:10.640> high<00:01:10.910> risk

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
tuberculosis but also in this high risk

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.330 
tuberculosis but also in this high risk
group<00:01:11.390> I'm<00:01:11.510> going<00:01:11.660> to<00:01:11.750> put<00:01:11.900> a<00:01:12.020> third<00:01:12.380> group<00:01:12.830> or

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
group I'm going to put a third group or

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.590 
group I'm going to put a third group or
a<00:01:13.370> third<00:01:13.580> category<00:01:13.820> which<00:01:14.210> is

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
a third category which is

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.900 
a third category which is
immunocompromised<00:01:15.080> people<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.670> this<00:01:16.790> is

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
immunocompromised people so this is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.580 
immunocompromised people so this is
people<00:01:17.210> that<00:01:17.300> do<00:01:17.480> not<00:01:17.720> have<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.020> normal<00:01:18.440> immune

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
people that do not have a normal immune

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.460 
people that do not have a normal immune
system<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:19.880> these<00:01:20.180> folks<00:01:20.540> it's<00:01:20.930> not<00:01:21.140> that<00:01:21.380> I'm

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
system so these folks it's not that I'm

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.650 
system so these folks it's not that I'm
worried<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:21.890> they<00:01:22.130> have<00:01:22.280> TB<00:01:22.700> necessarily

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
worried that they have TB necessarily

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.620 
worried that they have TB necessarily
but<00:01:24.170> it's<00:01:24.320> that<00:01:24.470> if<00:01:24.620> they<00:01:24.770> did<00:01:25.130> have<00:01:25.430> TB<00:01:25.850> gosh

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
but it's that if they did have TB gosh

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.940 
but it's that if they did have TB gosh
that<00:01:26.930> would<00:01:26.990> be<00:01:27.050> really<00:01:27.320> awful<00:01:27.560> because

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
that would be really awful because

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.010 
that would be really awful because
tuberculosis<00:01:28.790> requires<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.870> have<00:01:29.990> a

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
tuberculosis requires that you have a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.240 
tuberculosis requires that you have a
good<00:01:30.200> immune<00:01:30.410> system<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:30.980> if<00:01:31.070> they<00:01:31.160> don't

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
good immune system and if they don't

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.860 
good immune system and if they don't
have<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.490> good<00:01:31.610> immune<00:01:31.790> system<00:01:32.210> then

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
have a good immune system then

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.750 
have a good immune system then
tuberculosis<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.680> going<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:33.890> be<00:01:33.950> devastating

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
tuberculosis is going to be devastating

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.640 
tuberculosis is going to be devastating
for<00:01:34.940> these<00:01:35.060> folks<00:01:35.270> especially<00:01:35.930> folks<00:01:36.500> with

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
for these folks especially folks with

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.500 
for these folks especially folks with
HIV<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:37.400> in<00:01:37.580> this<00:01:37.670> first<00:01:37.880> group<00:01:38.240> then<00:01:38.420> the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
HIV so in this first group then the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.610 
HIV so in this first group then the
high-risk<00:01:38.840> group<00:01:38.990> either<00:01:39.290> I'm<00:01:39.470> really

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
high-risk group either I'm really

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.370 
high-risk group either I'm really
worried<00:01:39.920> they<00:01:40.100> have<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.520> or<00:01:40.760> I'm<00:01:41.750> worried<00:01:42.260> that

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
worried they have it or I'm worried that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.200 
worried they have it or I'm worried that
if<00:01:42.530> they<00:01:42.590> did<00:01:43.070> get<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.460> they<00:01:43.730> would<00:01:43.880> get<00:01:44.030> really

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
if they did get it they would get really

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.180 
if they did get it they would get really
sick<00:01:44.600> with<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.080> for<00:01:45.470> these<00:01:45.620> folks<00:01:45.980> a

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
sick with it and for these folks a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.880 
sick with it and for these folks a
positive<00:01:46.880> test<00:01:47.180> would<00:01:47.930> be<00:01:48.110> in<00:01:48.350> duration

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
positive test would be in duration

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.680 
positive test would be in duration
remember<00:01:49.460> PPD<00:01:49.880> you're<00:01:50.030> measuring<00:01:50.360> in

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
remember PPD you're measuring in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.280 
remember PPD you're measuring in
duration<00:01:51.790> anything<00:01:52.790> above<00:01:53.180> five<00:01:53.600> millimeters

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
duration anything above five millimeters

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.440 
duration anything above five millimeters
anything<00:01:54.680> above<00:01:55.010> this<00:01:55.280> range<00:01:55.700> would<00:01:56.390> be

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
anything above this range would be

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.840 
anything above this range would be
considered<00:01:56.990> positive<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.070> for<00:01:58.400> example<00:01:58.760> if

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
considered positive so for example if

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.180 
considered positive so for example if
someone<00:01:59.390> with<00:01:59.630> HIV<00:01:59.870> comes<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.860> they<00:02:01.040> have<00:02:01.159> a

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
someone with HIV comes and they have a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.210 
someone with HIV comes and they have a
PPD<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.880> let's<00:02:02.540> say<00:02:02.659> six<00:02:03.020> millimeters<00:02:03.590> then

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
PPD of let's say six millimeters then

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.219 
PPD of let's say six millimeters then
they<00:02:04.520> would<00:02:04.790> definitely<00:02:05.240> be<00:02:05.330> positive<00:02:05.930> but<00:02:06.140> if

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
they would definitely be positive but if

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.619 
they would definitely be positive but if
it<00:02:06.380> was<00:02:06.530> three<00:02:07.070> then<00:02:07.490> they<00:02:08.000> would<00:02:08.119> be<00:02:08.239> negative

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
it was three then they would be negative

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.630 
it was three then they would be negative
so<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.049> red<00:02:09.860> stuff<00:02:10.159> that<00:02:10.340> I'm<00:02:10.429> kind<00:02:10.610> of

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
so this red stuff that I'm kind of

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.699 
so this red stuff that I'm kind of
filling<00:02:11.000> in<00:02:11.120> this<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.870> positive<00:02:12.140> range

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
filling in this is the positive range

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.430 
filling in this is the positive range
positive<00:02:13.490> anywhere<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.690> anything

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
positive anywhere in here and anything

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.559 
positive anywhere in here and anything
below<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:16.069> I'm<00:02:16.490> going<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.730> write<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.480> in

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
below that I'm going to write it in

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.600 
below that I'm going to write it in
white

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
white

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.520 
white
on<00:02:18.640> here<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.150> would<00:02:19.330> be<00:02:19.360> negative<00:02:19.660> so

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
on here this would be negative so

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.490 
on here this would be negative so
anything<00:02:20.920> below<00:02:21.130> five<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.360> if<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:22.900> exactly

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
anything below five and if it's exactly

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.710 
anything below five and if it's exactly
five<00:02:23.830> then<00:02:24.220> that's<00:02:24.430> still<00:02:24.730> positive<00:02:25.270> so<00:02:25.540> who's

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
five then that's still positive so who's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.840 
five then that's still positive so who's
in<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.960> medium<00:02:26.290> range<00:02:26.440> these<00:02:26.740> folks<00:02:27.040> one

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
in the medium range these folks one

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.640 
in the medium range these folks one
group<00:02:28.180> would<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:28.390> people<00:02:28.990> coming<00:02:29.350> from<00:02:29.530> an

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
group would be people coming from an

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.680 
group would be people coming from an
endemic<00:02:30.160> country<00:02:30.520> let's<00:02:30.730> say<00:02:30.820> they<00:02:30.970> recently

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
endemic country let's say they recently

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.040 
endemic country let's say they recently
came<00:02:31.990> across<00:02:32.050> from<00:02:32.770> China<00:02:33.610> or<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.570> know<00:02:34.690> parts

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
came across from China or you know parts

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.510 
came across from China or you know parts
of<00:02:35.140> Africa<00:02:35.710> if<00:02:35.800> they're<00:02:35.920> coming<00:02:36.190> from<00:02:36.280> a

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
of Africa if they're coming from a

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.150 
of Africa if they're coming from a
country<00:02:36.760> where<00:02:37.170> tuberculosis<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.350> very

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
country where tuberculosis is very

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.330 
country where tuberculosis is very
common<00:02:39.820> or<00:02:40.060> endemic<00:02:40.690> then<00:02:41.290> they<00:02:41.620> are<00:02:41.830> also<00:02:42.040> in

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
common or endemic then they are also in

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.060 
common or endemic then they are also in
that<00:02:42.460> medium<00:02:42.970> risk<00:02:43.180> group<00:02:43.510> also<00:02:44.260> folks<00:02:44.830> that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
that medium risk group also folks that

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.060 
that medium risk group also folks that
live<00:02:45.430> or<00:02:45.850> work<00:02:46.300> in<00:02:46.690> large<00:02:47.560> groups

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
live or work in large groups

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.540 
live or work in large groups
so<00:02:48.490> think<00:02:48.790> about<00:02:48.850> nursing<00:02:49.540> homes<00:02:49.810> or<00:02:50.550> let's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
so think about nursing homes or let's

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.960 
so think about nursing homes or let's
say<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.880> jail<00:02:52.360> or<00:02:52.720> an<00:02:53.410> army<00:02:53.950> barracks<00:02:54.310> anyone

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
say a jail or an army barracks anyone

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.729 
say a jail or an army barracks anyone
that<00:02:55.180> lives<00:02:55.450> or<00:02:55.810> works<00:02:56.080> in<00:02:56.230> these<00:02:56.320> kinds<00:02:56.680> of

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
that lives or works in these kinds of

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.210 
that lives or works in these kinds of
places<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.570> large<00:02:58.570> group<00:02:58.989> setting<00:02:59.230> I'll<00:03:00.010> say

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
places in large group setting I'll say

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.150 
places in large group setting I'll say
large<00:03:00.520> group<00:03:00.970> setting<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.660> at<00:03:02.470> risk<00:03:02.830> for

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
large group setting is at risk for

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.479 
large group setting is at risk for
getting<00:03:03.580> TB<00:03:04.510> because<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.650> course<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.070> spreads

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
getting TB because of course it spreads

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.340 
getting TB because of course it spreads
from<00:03:06.640> person<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.209> person<00:03:07.330> very<00:03:07.720> quickly<00:03:08.020> and

from person to person very quickly and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.080 
from person to person very quickly and
if<00:03:08.680> you're<00:03:08.800> around<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.130> lot<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.310> people<00:03:09.489> you're

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
if you're around a lot of people you're

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.150 
if you're around a lot of people you're
upping<00:03:10.420> your<00:03:10.600> chances<00:03:11.050> similarly<00:03:11.980> people

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
upping your chances similarly people

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.920

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
that are in health care so anyone

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.020 
that are in health care so anyone
working<00:03:14.110> in<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.410> hospital<00:03:14.770> setting<00:03:15.280> because<00:03:15.880> of

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
working in a hospital setting because of

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.670 
working in a hospital setting because of
course<00:03:16.330> people<00:03:16.630> with<00:03:16.720> TB<00:03:17.020> often<00:03:17.320> come<00:03:17.530> to

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
course people with TB often come to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.680 
course people with TB often come to
health<00:03:18.160> care<00:03:18.430> settings<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.030> be<00:03:19.060> taken<00:03:19.450> care<00:03:19.660> of

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
health care settings to be taken care of

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.270 
health care settings to be taken care of
and<00:03:20.020> so<00:03:20.050> if<00:03:20.709> you're<00:03:20.830> in<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:20.980> health<00:03:21.220> care

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
and so if you're in a health care

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.479 
and so if you're in a health care
setting<00:03:21.670> working<00:03:22.030> as<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.270> nurse<00:03:22.570> or<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.930> doctor

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
setting working as a nurse or a doctor

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.310 
setting working as a nurse or a doctor
then<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.730> also<00:03:25.000> are<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.570> medium<00:03:25.870> risk<00:03:26.080> and

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
then you also are in the medium risk and

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.009 
then you also are in the medium risk and
I<00:03:26.560> myself<00:03:26.830> because<00:03:27.580> I'm<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.730> physician<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.390> in

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
the medium risk for this reason I'll put

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.479 
the medium risk for this reason I'll put
a<00:03:30.880> few<00:03:31.120> more<00:03:31.180> up<00:03:31.420> here<00:03:31.450> IV<00:03:32.019> drug<00:03:32.320> use<00:03:32.590> this<00:03:33.190> also

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
a few more up here IV drug use this also

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.479 
a few more up here IV drug use this also
puts<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:34.000> in<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.120> medium<00:03:34.450> risk<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:35.340> then<00:03:36.340> let

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
puts you in a medium risk and then let

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.860 
puts you in a medium risk and then let
me<00:03:36.580> actually<00:03:36.700> switch<00:03:37.000> gears<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:37.540> just<00:03:37.600> as

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
me actually switch gears and just as

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.840 
me actually switch gears and just as
before<00:03:38.049> where<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:38.530> said<00:03:38.799> well<00:03:38.950> I'm<00:03:39.220> also

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
before where I said well I'm also

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.670 
before where I said well I'm also
worried<00:03:40.480> specifically<00:03:41.200> worried<00:03:41.500> about

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
worried specifically worried about

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.039 
worried specifically worried about
certain<00:03:42.070> groups<00:03:42.330> here<00:03:43.330> I'm<00:03:43.540> very<00:03:43.570> worried

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
certain groups here I'm very worried

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.380 
certain groups here I'm very worried
about<00:03:44.170> children<00:03:44.920> less<00:03:45.430> than<00:03:45.700> four<00:03:45.970> years<00:03:46.000> of

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
about children less than four years of

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.300 
about children less than four years of
age<00:03:46.570> so<00:03:47.290> if<00:03:47.350> you're<00:03:47.470> less<00:03:47.680> than<00:03:47.709> four<00:03:48.040> years<00:03:48.070> of

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
age so if you're less than four years of

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.949 
age so if you're less than four years of
age<00:03:48.459> meaning<00:03:48.760> if<00:03:48.880> you're<00:03:48.970> three<00:03:49.360> or<00:03:49.600> two<00:03:49.810> or

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
age meaning if you're three or two or

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.070 
age meaning if you're three or two or
one<00:03:50.170> those<00:03:50.890> children<00:03:51.489> they<00:03:52.180> may<00:03:52.480> not<00:03:52.660> have<00:03:52.720> any

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
one those children they may not have any

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.470 
one those children they may not have any
other<00:03:53.320> reason<00:03:54.280> for<00:03:54.489> getting<00:03:54.580> TB<00:03:55.000> like<00:03:55.330> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
other reason for getting TB like the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.820 
other reason for getting TB like the
people<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.780> just<00:03:55.810> mentioned<00:03:56.140> like<00:03:56.440> health<00:03:56.739> care

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
people I just mentioned like health care

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.949 
people I just mentioned like health care

be<00:04:01.360> particularly<00:04:01.989> problematic<00:04:02.530> because

be particularly problematic because

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.830 
be particularly problematic because
young<00:04:03.549> kids<00:04:03.880> don't<00:04:04.030> have<00:04:04.299> great<00:04:04.600> immune

young kids don't have great immune

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.900 
young kids don't have great immune
systems<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.560> also<00:04:06.040> people<00:04:06.580> that<00:04:06.790> are

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
systems and also people that are

actually<00:04:07.150> fighting<00:04:08.049> other<00:04:08.410> diseases<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.459> we

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
actually fighting other diseases so we

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.150 
actually fighting other diseases so we
call<00:04:09.940> those<00:04:10.060> comorbidities<00:04:11.049> let's<00:04:11.920> say<00:04:12.100> you

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
call those comorbidities let's say you

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.970 
call those comorbidities let's say you
have<00:04:12.549> already<00:04:13.510> gotten<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:14.200> disease<00:04:14.709> like

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
have already gotten a disease like

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.099 
have already gotten a disease like
diabetes<00:04:15.010> or<00:04:15.640> let's<00:04:16.090> say<00:04:16.209> your<00:04:16.390> your<00:04:16.900> your

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
diabetes or let's say your your your

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.020 
diabetes or let's say your your your
kidneys<00:04:17.500> aren't<00:04:17.709> working<00:04:18.130> properly<00:04:18.160> if<00:04:18.910> you

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
kidneys aren't working properly if you

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.569 
kidneys aren't working properly if you
already<00:04:19.359> have<00:04:19.750> other<00:04:20.049> diseases<00:04:20.620> then<00:04:21.430> you're

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
already have other diseases then you're

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.900 
already have other diseases then you're
also<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.060> risk<00:04:22.330> because<00:04:22.570> if<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.410> did<00:04:23.770> get<00:04:24.010> TV<00:04:24.340> it

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
also a risk because if you did get TV it

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.670 
also a risk because if you did get TV it
would<00:04:25.030> be<00:04:25.120> even<00:04:25.300> tougher<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.020> fight<00:04:26.440> it<00:04:26.590> off

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
would be even tougher to fight it off

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.130 
would be even tougher to fight it off
and<00:04:27.010> for<00:04:27.760> all<00:04:27.849> of<00:04:28.000> these<00:04:28.180> folks<00:04:28.510> ten

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
and for all of these folks ten

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.659 
and for all of these folks ten

positive

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.540 
positive
I<00:04:31.509> didn't<00:04:32.229> make<00:04:32.319> an<00:04:32.499> exhaustive<00:04:33.129> list<00:04:33.309> or

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
I didn't make an exhaustive list or

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.399 
I didn't make an exhaustive list or
actually<00:04:33.789> are<00:04:33.909> a<00:04:33.939> few<00:04:34.270> other<00:04:34.419> ones<00:04:34.599> but<00:04:34.809> try<00:04:35.349> to

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
actually are a few other ones but try to

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:36.659 
actually are a few other ones but try to
highlight<00:04:35.770> some<00:04:35.949> of<00:04:36.009> the<00:04:36.099> most<00:04:36.219> important

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
highlight some of the most important

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.499 
highlight some of the most important
ones<00:04:36.900> on<00:04:37.900> this<00:04:38.289> list<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:38.949> for<00:04:39.909> example<00:04:40.330> then

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
ones on this list and for example then

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:41.879 
ones on this list and for example then
just<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.020> make<00:04:41.169> sure<00:04:41.199> we<00:04:41.409> understand<00:04:41.770> how<00:04:41.860> to

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
just to make sure we understand how to

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.459 
just to make sure we understand how to
utilize<00:04:42.159> this<00:04:42.610> let's<00:04:42.939> say<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.870> have<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.139> person

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:44.469 
utilize this let's say you have a person

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:48.629 
utilize this let's say you have a person
who<00:04:45.129> is<00:04:45.419> 3<00:04:46.419> years<00:04:46.599> old<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.259> that<00:04:48.039> person<00:04:48.400> comes

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
who is 3 years old and that person comes

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.320 
who is 3 years old and that person comes
in<00:04:48.759> with<00:04:48.909> a<00:04:48.939> PPD<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.740> 12<00:04:50.740> millimeters<00:04:51.580> well

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
in with a PPD of 12 millimeters well

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.909 
in with a PPD of 12 millimeters well
that<00:04:52.509> would<00:04:52.599> be<00:04:52.629> positive<00:04:52.930> here<00:04:53.439> but<00:04:53.710> if<00:04:53.800> it

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
that would be positive here but if it

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.589 
that would be positive here but if it
was<00:04:54.009> only<00:04:54.159> 8<00:04:54.430> millimeters<00:04:55.089> it<00:04:55.300> would<00:04:55.479> be

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
was only 8 millimeters it would be

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.299 
was only 8 millimeters it would be
negative<00:04:55.779> so<00:04:56.439> that's<00:04:56.620> kind<00:04:56.860> of<00:04:56.919> how<00:04:57.039> you<00:04:57.069> would

00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:57.309 
negative so that's kind of how you would

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:59.760 
negative so that's kind of how you would
use<00:04:57.370> this<00:04:57.879> graph<00:04:58.539> so<00:04:59.110> down<00:04:59.259> here<00:04:59.469> then<00:04:59.650> we<00:04:59.740> have

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
use this graph so down here then we have

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.950 
use this graph so down here then we have
anyone<00:05:00.339> else<00:05:00.580> anyone<00:05:01.270> that<00:05:01.449> doesn't<00:05:01.719> fit<00:05:01.839> into

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
anyone else anyone that doesn't fit into

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.749 
anyone else anyone that doesn't fit into
the<00:05:02.139> other<00:05:02.229> categories<00:05:02.400> fits<00:05:03.400> into<00:05:03.639> this

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
the other categories fits into this

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.339 
the other categories fits into this
final<00:05:04.089> one<00:05:04.360> so<00:05:04.389> this<00:05:04.719> is<00:05:04.839> the<00:05:04.960> low-risk

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
final one so this is the low-risk

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.129 
final one so this is the low-risk
category<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:06.009> for<00:05:06.400> these<00:05:06.550> folks<00:05:07.139> 15

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
category and for these folks 15

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.739 
category and for these folks 15
millimeters<00:05:08.680> or<00:05:08.889> greater<00:05:09.430> are<00:05:09.699> needed<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:10.629> be

00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:10.749 
millimeters or greater are needed to be

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.050 
millimeters or greater are needed to be
considered<00:05:11.080> positive<00:05:11.409> and<00:05:11.949> so<00:05:12.639> if<00:05:12.759> you<00:05:12.879> have

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
considered positive and so if you have

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.489 
considered positive and so if you have
someone<00:05:13.270> that<00:05:13.389> let's<00:05:13.689> say<00:05:13.810> is<00:05:13.930> very<00:05:14.199> healthy

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:14.499 
someone that let's say is very healthy

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:15.899 
someone that let's say is very healthy
and<00:05:14.740> doesn't<00:05:15.129> fit<00:05:15.310> into<00:05:15.430> any<00:05:15.520> of<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:15.789> other

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
and doesn't fit into any of the other

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.579 
and doesn't fit into any of the other
things<00:05:16.479> that<00:05:16.659> we<00:05:16.779> just<00:05:16.930> talked<00:05:17.139> about<00:05:17.349> and

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:17.589 
things that we just talked about and

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:21.089 
things that we just talked about and
their<00:05:18.069> PPD<00:05:18.550> is<00:05:18.669> 20<00:05:19.629> millimeters<00:05:19.870> then<00:05:20.860> they

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
their PPD is 20 millimeters then they

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.980 
their PPD is 20 millimeters then they
would<00:05:21.279> be<00:05:21.400> considered<00:05:21.430> positive<00:05:21.999> but<00:05:22.779> if<00:05:22.870> it

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
would be considered positive but if it

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.200 
would be considered positive but if it
was<00:05:23.080> only<00:05:23.229> let's<00:05:23.620> say<00:05:23.740> 13<00:05:24.639> millimeters

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
was only let's say 13 millimeters

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.480 
was only let's say 13 millimeters
somewhere<00:05:25.659> in<00:05:25.719> this<00:05:25.810> other<00:05:26.319> range<00:05:26.830> down<00:05:27.159> here

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
somewhere in this other range down here

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.129 
somewhere in this other range down here
then<00:05:28.060> they<00:05:28.300> would<00:05:28.419> be<00:05:28.539> considered<00:05:28.839> negative

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
then they would be considered negative

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.559 
then they would be considered negative
so<00:05:30.129> you<00:05:30.189> basically<00:05:30.399> measure<00:05:30.909> the<00:05:31.149> in<00:05:31.270> duration

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
so you basically measure the in duration

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.209 
so you basically measure the in duration
and<00:05:31.960> then<00:05:32.409> you<00:05:32.499> kind<00:05:32.680> of<00:05:32.740> think<00:05:32.979> about<00:05:33.039> what

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
and then you kind of think about what

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.339 
and then you kind of think about what
risk<00:05:33.699> group<00:05:34.029> a<00:05:34.180> person<00:05:34.539> falls<00:05:34.779> into<00:05:34.960> high

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
risk group a person falls into high

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.379 
risk group a person falls into high
medium<00:05:35.740> or<00:05:35.860> low<00:05:35.919> and<00:05:36.339> then<00:05:36.939> you<00:05:37.060> kind<00:05:37.330> of

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
medium or low and then you kind of

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.929 
medium or low and then you kind of
organize<00:05:37.930> it<00:05:38.259> using<00:05:38.889> these<00:05:39.039> graphs<00:05:39.370> very<00:05:39.729> easy

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:39.939 
organize it using these graphs very easy

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.510 
organize it using these graphs very easy
right<00:05:40.240> so<00:05:40.419> above<00:05:40.689> 5<00:05:40.990> or<00:05:41.319> above<00:05:41.409> 10<00:05:41.770> or<00:05:41.919> about<00:05:42.069> 15

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
right so above 5 or above 10 or about 15

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.820 
right so above 5 or above 10 or about 15
tells<00:05:43.240> you<00:05:43.419> which<00:05:43.629> is<00:05:43.899> considered<00:05:44.649> positive

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
tells you which is considered positive

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.320 
tells you which is considered positive
versus<00:05:45.310> negative<00:05:45.339> and<00:05:45.909> a<00:05:45.969> couple<00:05:46.180> of

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
versus negative and a couple of

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.850 
versus negative and a couple of
questions<00:05:46.569> people<00:05:46.930> always<00:05:47.199> ask<00:05:47.499> is<00:05:47.740> they

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
questions people always ask is they

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.139 
questions people always ask is they
think<00:05:47.919> well<00:05:48.189> what<00:05:48.339> if<00:05:48.459> someone<00:05:48.759> falls<00:05:48.999> into

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:49.149 
think well what if someone falls into

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:51.300 
think well what if someone falls into
two<00:05:49.449> of<00:05:49.599> these<00:05:49.719> categories<00:05:50.020> what<00:05:50.979> if<00:05:51.099> their

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
two of these categories what if their

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.820 
two of these categories what if their
let's<00:05:52.149> say<00:05:52.300> a<00:05:52.330> below<00:05:52.779> 4<00:05:53.169> years<00:05:53.349> old<00:05:53.560> let's<00:05:53.740> say

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
let's say a below 4 years old let's say

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.199 
let's say a below 4 years old let's say
we're<00:05:53.949> talking<00:05:54.069> about<00:05:54.310> a<00:05:54.339> 3<00:05:54.639> year<00:05:54.879> old<00:05:55.029> so

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:55.209 
we're talking about a 3 year old so

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:57.089 
we're talking about a 3 year old so
they're<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:55.749> know<00:05:55.779> have<00:05:56.050> this<00:05:56.199> one<00:05:56.469> but

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
they're you know have this one but

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.379 
they're you know have this one but
you're<00:05:57.279> also<00:05:57.430> really<00:05:57.789> worried<00:05:58.060> that<00:05:58.180> they

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
you're also really worried that they

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.779 
you're also really worried that they
have<00:05:58.479> TB<00:05:58.870> so<00:05:59.110> they're<00:05:59.229> in<00:05:59.379> this<00:05:59.499> one<00:05:59.770> well<00:06:00.610> if

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
have TB so they're in this one well if

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.399 
have TB so they're in this one well if
you<00:06:01.029> ever<00:06:01.180> have<00:06:01.539> someone<00:06:01.870> that<00:06:01.959> falls<00:06:02.229> into

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
you ever have someone that falls into

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.469 
you ever have someone that falls into
two<00:06:02.499> categories<00:06:02.740> you<00:06:03.490> have<00:06:03.759> to<00:06:03.999> go<00:06:04.180> with<00:06:04.360> the

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
two categories you have to go with the

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.899 
two categories you have to go with the
more<00:06:04.599> conservative<00:06:05.529> approach<00:06:05.649> and<00:06:06.159> say<00:06:06.699> well

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
more conservative approach and say well

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:09.839 
more conservative approach and say well
if<00:06:07.029> they<00:06:07.149> meet<00:06:07.419> the<00:06:07.589> high-risk<00:06:08.589> category<00:06:08.860> I'm

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
if they meet the high-risk category I'm

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.149 
if they meet the high-risk category I'm
going<00:06:10.149> to<00:06:10.209> use<00:06:10.389> that<00:06:10.870> one<00:06:11.169> to<00:06:11.680> decide<00:06:12.009> if

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
going to use that one to decide if

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.399 
going to use that one to decide if
they're<00:06:12.279> positive<00:06:12.520> or<00:06:12.939> negative<00:06:13.449> so<00:06:14.199> in<00:06:14.289> this

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
they're positive or negative so in this

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.920 
they're positive or negative so in this
case<00:06:14.680> a<00:06:14.949> three<00:06:15.550> year<00:06:15.699> old<00:06:15.879> -<00:06:16.029> our<00:06:16.120> suspect<00:06:16.689> has

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
case a three year old - our suspect has

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.350 
case a three year old - our suspect has
TB<00:06:17.580> automatically<00:06:18.580> I<00:06:18.610> would<00:06:18.909> have<00:06:19.060> to<00:06:19.209> go<00:06:19.330> with

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
TB automatically I would have to go with

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.649 
TB automatically I would have to go with
this<00:06:19.629> top<00:06:19.959> one<00:06:20.229> because<00:06:20.860> I<00:06:20.889> suspect<00:06:21.189> TB<00:06:21.729> simple

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
this top one because I suspect TB simple

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:23.939 
this top one because I suspect TB simple
as<00:06:22.719> that<00:06:22.899> and<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.139> other<00:06:23.289> question<00:06:23.560> often

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
as that and the other question often

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.850 
as that and the other question often
comes<00:06:24.129> up<00:06:24.459> is<00:06:24.610> what<00:06:24.759> about<00:06:24.969> BCG<00:06:25.719> vaccine<00:06:26.289> this

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
comes up is what about BCG vaccine this

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.679 
comes up is what about BCG vaccine this
is<00:06:27.039> a<00:06:27.069> vaccine<00:06:27.339> that<00:06:27.729> some<00:06:27.969> countries<00:06:28.419> offer

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:28.689 
is a vaccine that some countries offer

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.579 
is a vaccine that some countries offer
to<00:06:29.139> their<00:06:29.289> citizens<00:06:29.919> to<00:06:30.399> help<00:06:30.520> prevent

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:31.589 
to their citizens to help prevent

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.980 
to their citizens to help prevent

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
disseminated or spread out TB especially

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.320 
disseminated or spread out TB especially
a<00:06:35.020> problem<00:06:35.229> among<00:06:35.529> young<00:06:35.949> babies<00:06:36.399> so<00:06:36.849> what<00:06:37.209> if

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
a problem among young babies so what if

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.929 
a problem among young babies so what if
someone<00:06:37.659> has<00:06:37.839> had<00:06:37.870> BCG<00:06:38.620> vaccine<00:06:39.099> and<00:06:39.370> it's

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:39.939 
someone has had BCG vaccine and it's

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:41.369 
someone has had BCG vaccine and it's

Control has been very clear on this

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:45.030 
Control has been very clear on this
point<00:06:43.300> they<00:06:43.569> say<00:06:43.750> you<00:06:44.199> do<00:06:44.379> not<00:06:44.560> need

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
point they say you do not need

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.180 
point they say you do not need
to<00:06:45.130> interpret<00:06:45.910> the<00:06:46.420> PPD<00:06:46.810> with<00:06:47.530> this<00:06:47.770> in<00:06:47.980> mind

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
to interpret the PPD with this in mind

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.690 
to interpret the PPD with this in mind
ignore<00:06:48.730> the<00:06:49.510> BCG<00:06:50.140> vaccine<00:06:50.590> completely<00:06:51.250> in

out<00:06:54.160> whether<00:06:54.430> someone's<00:06:54.880> PPD<00:06:55.210> is<00:06:55.300> positive<00:06:55.690> or

out whether someone's PPD is positive or

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.110 
out whether someone's PPD is positive or
negative<00:06:55.780> just<00:06:56.680> rely<00:06:57.130> on<00:06:57.160> the<00:06:57.400> high<00:06:57.670> medium

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
negative just rely on the high medium

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.180
