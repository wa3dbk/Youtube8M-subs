conditioner<00:00:38.600> I<00:00:39.230> this<00:00:40.160> is<00:00:40.309> ok<00:00:40.640> I<00:00:40.670> used<00:00:41.150> it<00:00:41.360> for<00:00:41.660> a

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
conditioner I this is ok I used it for a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.270 
conditioner I this is ok I used it for a
little<00:00:41.870> bit<00:00:42.080> and<00:00:42.260> then<00:00:42.379> I<00:00:42.410> started<00:00:42.800> using<00:00:43.010> it

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
little bit and then I started using it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.619 
little bit and then I started using it
on<00:00:43.489> Chloe's<00:00:44.120> hair<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:44.770> I<00:00:45.770> I<00:00:46.520> thought<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:47.480> was

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
on Chloe's hair and I I thought it was

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.319 
on Chloe's hair and I I thought it was
fine<00:00:48.050> it's<00:00:48.379> not<00:00:48.560> as<00:00:48.710> natural<00:00:49.280> as<00:00:49.520> i<00:00:49.670> prefer<00:00:49.910> so

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
fine it's not as natural as i prefer so

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.660 
fine it's not as natural as i prefer so
i<00:00:50.360> probably<00:00:50.690> won't<00:00:51.110> be<00:00:51.230> using<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:51.649> again<00:00:51.950> but

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
i probably won't be using it again but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.270 
i probably won't be using it again but
you<00:00:53.180> don't<00:00:53.300> care<00:00:53.540> about<00:00:53.630> that<00:00:53.950> then<00:00:54.950> I<00:00:55.070> think

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280
