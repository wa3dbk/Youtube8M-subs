00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.820 

okay<00:00:22.250> I<00:00:22.279> was<00:00:22.490> right<00:00:22.700> I<00:00:23.390> was<00:00:24.170> expecting<00:00:24.650> this<00:00:24.710> to

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
okay I was right I was expecting this to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.320 
okay I was right I was expecting this to
be<00:00:24.860> pointing<00:00:25.279> down<00:00:25.400> I<00:00:25.460> guess<00:00:25.760> I<00:00:25.910> was<00:00:26.029> looking

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
be pointing down I guess I was looking

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.960 
be pointing down I guess I was looking
at<00:00:26.450> the<00:00:26.540> wrong<00:00:26.720> wire<00:00:27.020> but<00:00:27.490> when<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.520> when<00:00:28.880> it

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
at the wrong wire but when I when it

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.400 
at the wrong wire but when I when it
came<00:00:29.150> off<00:00:29.360> I<00:00:29.540> saw<00:00:29.720> it<00:00:29.810> was<00:00:29.930> pointing<00:00:30.259> this<00:00:30.349> way

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
came off I saw it was pointing this way

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.560 
came off I saw it was pointing this way
and<00:00:30.590> I<00:00:30.740> looked<00:00:30.950> at<00:00:31.070> my<00:00:31.189> distributor<00:00:31.849> it<00:00:32.300> sits

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
and I looked at my distributor it sits

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.939 
and I looked at my distributor it sits
like<00:00:32.809> this<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.760> this<00:00:34.760> fourth<00:00:35.269> wire<00:00:35.600> on<00:00:36.470> here

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
like this and this fourth wire on here

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.280 
like this and this fourth wire on here
is<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.120> one<00:00:38.269> that<00:00:38.390> needs<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.660> be<00:00:38.780> pointing<00:00:39.199> at

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
is the one that needs to be pointing at

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.780 
is the one that needs to be pointing at
but<00:00:39.500> where<00:00:39.620> they<00:00:39.769> cross<00:00:40.040> right<00:00:40.400> here<00:00:40.699> it

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
but where they cross right here it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.460 
but where they cross right here it
fooled<00:00:41.059> my<00:00:41.300> eyes<00:00:41.480> I<00:00:41.840> was<00:00:41.930> thinking<00:00:42.260> it's<00:00:42.350> going

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
fooled my eyes I was thinking it's going

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.900 
fooled my eyes I was thinking it's going
to<00:00:42.530> be<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.680> bottom<00:00:42.980> one<00:00:43.100> but<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:43.340> actually<00:00:43.489> is

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
to be the bottom one but it actually is

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.299 
to be the bottom one but it actually is
this<00:00:44.180> point<00:00:44.420> which<00:00:45.140> is<00:00:45.350> where<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:45.980> thing<00:00:46.280> is

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
this point which is where this thing is

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.939 
this point which is where this thing is
pointing<00:00:46.879> to<00:00:47.059> what<00:00:47.870> I'll<00:00:47.989> do<00:00:48.140> is<00:00:48.290> I'll<00:00:48.500> uh<00:00:48.710> I'll

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
pointing to what I'll do is I'll uh I'll

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.819 
pointing to what I'll do is I'll uh I'll
clean<00:00:49.339> this<00:00:49.519> up<00:00:49.580> and<00:00:50.110> never<00:00:51.110> hurts<00:00:51.469> to<00:00:51.559> put<00:00:51.800> a

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
clean this up and never hurts to put a

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.670 
clean this up and never hurts to put a
shot<00:00:52.070> of<00:00:52.100> wd-40<00:00:52.820> on<00:00:52.969> one<00:00:53.180> of<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.360> things<00:00:53.719> that

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
shot of wd-40 on one of the things that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.529 
shot of wd-40 on one of the things that
basically<00:00:54.890> says<00:00:55.520> water<00:00:55.760> out<00:00:56.030> of<00:00:56.059> it<00:00:56.329> while<00:00:56.510> I

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
basically says water out of it while I

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.680 
basically says water out of it while I
got<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.899> off<00:00:57.820> but<00:00:58.820> I'll<00:00:58.910> lick<00:00:59.090> that<00:00:59.239> off<00:00:59.450> till<00:00:59.600> I

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
got it off but I'll lick that off till I

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.080 
got it off but I'll lick that off till I
get<00:00:59.750> true<00:01:00.110> I've<00:01:01.010> double-checked<00:01:01.399> my<00:01:01.640> timing

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
get true I've double-checked my timing

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.760 
get true I've double-checked my timing
marks<00:01:02.390> over<00:01:02.690> here<00:01:02.719> again<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:03.410> don't<00:01:03.530> know<00:01:03.680> if

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
marks over here again I don't know if

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.350 
marks over here again I don't know if
you<00:01:03.860> guys<00:01:04.039> can<00:01:04.309> see<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.610> timing<00:01:04.850> mark<00:01:05.180> with

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
you guys can see the timing mark with

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.930 
you guys can see the timing mark with
there's<00:01:05.539> a<00:01:05.600> little<00:01:05.810> point<00:01:06.320> on<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.550> piece<00:01:07.789> of

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
there's a little point on that piece of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.330 
there's a little point on that piece of
plastic<00:01:08.420> down<00:01:08.600> there<00:01:08.869> right<00:01:09.560> here<00:01:09.979> that's

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
plastic down there right here that's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.540 
plastic down there right here that's
your<00:01:10.550> timing<00:01:10.940> mark<00:01:11.289> and<00:01:12.289> a<00:01:12.770> little<00:01:13.039> notch

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
your timing mark and a little notch

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.400 
your timing mark and a little notch
right<00:01:13.580> here<00:01:14.270> that's<00:01:14.509> your<00:01:14.630> time<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.050> mark<00:01:15.200> on

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
right here that's your time and mark on

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.529 
right here that's your time and mark on
the<00:01:15.530> end<00:01:15.649> of<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.860> cam<00:01:16.100> share<00:01:16.430> those<00:01:17.300> two

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
the end of the cam share those two

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.330 
the end of the cam share those two
pointing<00:01:17.930> together<00:01:18.259> top<00:01:18.770> dead<00:01:18.979> center

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
pointing together top dead center

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.920 
pointing together top dead center
basically<00:01:19.520> means<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.119> piston<00:01:20.539> is<00:01:20.660> all<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
basically means the piston is all the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.839 
basically means the piston is all the
way<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.200> top<00:01:21.440> back<00:01:22.220> in<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.369> old<00:01:22.459> days<00:01:22.670> we

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:22.849 
way to the top back in the old days we

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.570 
way to the top back in the old days we
would<00:01:22.970> literally<00:01:23.709> on<00:01:24.709> a<00:01:24.740> small-block<00:01:25.190> Chevy

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
would literally on a small-block Chevy

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.550 
would literally on a small-block Chevy
sometimes<00:01:26.090> drop<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.450> screwdriver<00:01:26.899> take<00:01:27.440> this

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
sometimes drop a screwdriver take this

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.469 
sometimes drop a screwdriver take this
mark<00:01:28.130> plug<00:01:28.369> output<00:01:28.729> screwdriver<00:01:29.209> in<00:01:29.360> there

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
mark plug output screwdriver in there

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.359 
mark plug output screwdriver in there
watch<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.929> piston<00:01:30.289> push<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.679> up<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.979> when<00:01:31.220> all

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
watch the piston push it up to when all

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.949 
watch the piston push it up to when all
the<00:01:31.520> way<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.789> top<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.300> look<00:01:32.330> too<00:01:32.569> far<00:01:32.810> to

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
the way to the top you look too far to

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.870 
the way to the top you look too far to
talk<00:01:33.170> back<00:01:33.440> them<00:01:33.709> that<00:01:34.340> give<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:34.759> pretty

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
talk back them that give you a pretty

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.190 
talk back them that give you a pretty
good<00:01:35.090> idea<00:01:35.179> when<00:01:35.509> you<00:01:35.599> were<00:01:35.720> at<00:01:35.810> top<00:01:35.990> dead

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
good idea when you were at top dead

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.199 
good idea when you were at top dead
center<00:01:36.619> to<00:01:36.860> think<00:01:37.280> about<00:01:37.459> top<00:01:37.640> dead<00:01:37.849> center

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
center to think about top dead center

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:39.940 
center to think about top dead center
though<00:01:38.330> is<00:01:38.569> that<00:01:38.929> your<00:01:39.170> piston<00:01:39.619> is<00:01:39.709> going<00:01:39.890> to

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
though is that your piston is going to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.589 
though is that your piston is going to
be<00:01:40.039> at<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.250> top<00:01:40.490> on<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:42.369> firing<00:01:43.369> valve<00:01:44.240> as

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:44.599 
be at the top on the firing valve as

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.690 
be at the top on the firing valve as
well<00:01:44.630> as<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.170> exhaust<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.740> intake<00:01:46.039> valve<00:01:46.340> so

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
well as the exhaust the intake valve so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.109 
well as the exhaust the intake valve so
an<00:01:47.330> intake<00:01:47.750> cycle<00:01:48.289> so<00:01:48.530> just<00:01:49.429> because<00:01:49.580> this<00:01:49.940> on

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
an intake cycle so just because this on

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.699 
an intake cycle so just because this on
the<00:01:50.209> top<00:01:50.420> doesn't<00:01:50.780> mean<00:01:50.869> is<00:01:50.959> top<00:01:51.140> dead<00:01:51.349> center

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
the top doesn't mean is top dead center

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.199 
the top doesn't mean is top dead center
it<00:01:51.800> has<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.069> be<00:01:52.130> top<00:01:52.340> dead<00:01:52.550> center<00:01:52.849> with<00:01:53.000> both

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
it has to be top dead center with both

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:54.940 
it has to be top dead center with both
the<00:01:53.390> valves<00:01:53.780> closed<00:01:54.140> which<00:01:54.560> is<00:01:54.709> the

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
the valves closed which is the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.219 
the valves closed which is the
combustion<00:01:57.340> cycle<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.849> in<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.420> cycle<00:01:59.899> the

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
combustion cycle and in that cycle the

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.589 
combustion cycle and in that cycle the
valves<00:02:00.590> are<00:02:01.489> all<00:02:01.610> loose<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.149> at<00:02:02.209> that<00:02:02.360> point

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
valves are all loose and at that point

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.930 
valves are all loose and at that point
you<00:02:02.750> can<00:02:02.929> adjust<00:02:03.259> them<00:02:03.470> both<00:02:04.250> flagons<00:02:04.729> have<00:02:04.910> a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
you can adjust them both flagons have a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.240 
you can adjust them both flagons have a
very<00:02:05.330> similar<00:02:05.720> well<00:02:06.619> you're<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:06.800> both

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
very similar well you're just both

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.160 
very similar well you're just both
wagons<00:02:07.670> are<00:02:07.789> almost<00:02:07.940> exactly<00:02:08.119> like<00:02:08.569> this<00:02:08.840> both

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
wagons are almost exactly like this both

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.530 
wagons are almost exactly like this both
wagon<00:02:09.560> bugs<00:02:10.000> except<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.090> they<00:02:11.209> only<00:02:11.330> have

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
wagon bugs except that they only have

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.809 
wagon bugs except that they only have
one<00:02:11.780> valve<00:02:12.110> per<00:02:12.709> cylinder<00:02:12.739> at<00:02:13.250> least<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.580> two

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
one valve per cylinder at least have two

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.910 
one valve per cylinder at least have two
valves<00:02:14.209> per<00:02:14.270> cylinder<00:02:14.450> thus<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.260> get<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.470> 16

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
valves per cylinder thus you get the 16

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.330 
valves per cylinder thus you get the 16
valve<00:02:16.129> engine<00:02:16.340> which<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:17.120> lot<00:02:17.930> more

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
valve engine which is a lot more

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.130 
valve engine which is a lot more
economical<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.209> way<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.330> set<00:02:20.629> these<00:02:20.810> is

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
economical so the way to set these is

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.339 
economical so the way to set these is
DISA<00:02:21.489> there's<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.610> setting<00:02:23.030> on<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.870> hood<00:02:24.080> over

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
DISA there's a setting on the hood over

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.230 
DISA there's a setting on the hood over
here<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:24.830> says<00:02:25.040> it's<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.580> think<00:02:25.700> it's

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
here that says it's I think it's

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.620 
here that says it's I think it's
weenie<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.950> either<00:02:28.160> 20<00:02:28.580> or<00:02:28.700> 25<00:02:29.150> on<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
weenie it's either 20 or 25 on the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.750 
weenie it's either 20 or 25 on the
exhaust<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.470> whatever<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.430> other<00:02:31.580> one

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
on the intake once 20 thousands 125

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.270 
on the intake once 20 thousands 125
thousands<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:36.050> take<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> feeler<00:02:36.650> gauge<00:02:37.010> and

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
thousands you take a feeler gauge and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.070 
thousands you take a feeler gauge and
you<00:02:37.370> literally<00:02:37.670> slip<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.180> up<00:02:38.300> in<00:02:38.480> here<00:02:38.870> you

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
you literally slip it up in here you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.200 
you literally slip it up in here you
loosen<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.650> nut<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.640> tighten<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.150> screw

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
loosen this nut you tighten this screw

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.280 
loosen this nut you tighten this screw
each<00:02:41.780> other<00:02:41.990> fuel<00:02:42.350> gauges<00:02:43.060> just<00:02:44.060> snug<00:02:44.930> but<00:02:45.260> not

each other fuel gauges just snug but not
clamp<00:02:45.830> crimp<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.550> then<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.760> retighten<00:02:47.360> this

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
clamp crimp and then you retighten this

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.370 
clamp crimp and then you retighten this
thing<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:48.380> one<00:02:48.560> actually<00:02:48.860> gives<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.340> torque

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
thing this one actually gives a torque

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.930 
thing this one actually gives a torque
amount<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.530> torque<00:02:51.770> these<00:02:51.950> things<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.550> you

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
amount to torque these things that you

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.910 
amount to torque these things that you
know<00:02:53.060> once<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.360> get<00:02:53.480> them<00:02:53.600> back<00:02:53.750> down<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.890> I'm

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
know once you get them back down so I'm

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.560 
know once you get them back down so I'm
gonna<00:02:55.280> go<00:02:55.430> through<00:02:55.700> I'm<00:02:55.790> gonna<00:02:55.940> do<00:02:56.030> one<00:02:56.270> I'm

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
gonna go through I'm gonna do one I'm

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.940 
gonna go through I'm gonna do one I'm
going<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.750> turn<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.110> engine<00:02:57.230> over<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.830> the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
going to turn the engine over to the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.760 
going to turn the engine over to the
next<00:02:58.160> one<00:02:58.850> which<00:02:59.810> I<00:02:59.930> think<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.320> something<00:03:00.560> like

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
next one which I think is something like

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.230 
next one which I think is something like
180<00:03:01.250> degrees<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:02.540> don't<00:03:03.530> exactly<00:03:03.710> know<00:03:03.890> but

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
180 degrees I don't exactly know but

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.600 
180 degrees I don't exactly know but
I'll<00:03:05.240> do<00:03:05.900> one<00:03:06.590> two<00:03:06.800> three<00:03:07.040> four<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.370> then<00:03:07.430> I

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
I'll do one two three four and then I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.040 
I'll do one two three four and then I
got<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.910> done<00:03:08.060> I'll<00:03:08.270> be<00:03:08.300> done<00:03:08.600> with<00:03:08.750> this<00:03:08.870> I

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
got that done I'll be done with this I

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.620 
got that done I'll be done with this I
could<00:03:09.110> all<00:03:09.410> back<00:03:09.590> together<00:03:09.740> I<00:03:10.330> guess<00:03:11.330> I'll<00:03:11.510> go

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
could all back together I guess I'll go

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.880 
could all back together I guess I'll go
ahead<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:11.870> say<00:03:11.990> this<00:03:12.170> too<00:03:12.440> I'm<00:03:12.650> fairly

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
ahead and say this too I'm fairly

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.530 
ahead and say this too I'm fairly
impressed<00:03:13.400> with<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.640> lot<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:14.030> things<00:03:14.210> about<00:03:14.330> the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
impressed with a lot of things about the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.380 
impressed with a lot of things about the
way<00:03:14.630> this<00:03:14.780> car<00:03:15.050> is<00:03:15.170> engineered<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:17.090> know<00:03:17.210> for

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
way this car is engineered you know for

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.260 
way this car is engineered you know for
example<00:03:17.480> when<00:03:17.960> you<00:03:18.080> take<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.560> screws<00:03:19.310> out<00:03:19.700> of

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
example when you take the screws out of

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.390 
example when you take the screws out of
the<00:03:20.420> distributor<00:03:21.020> cap<00:03:21.070> they<00:03:22.070> won't

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
the distributor cap they won't

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.760 
the distributor cap they won't
unscrew<00:03:23.060> they<00:03:23.390> won't<00:03:23.630> unscrew<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.110> fall<00:03:24.500> out

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
unscrew they won't unscrew and fall out

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.350 
unscrew they won't unscrew and fall out
so<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:25.070> lose<00:03:25.310> them<00:03:25.550> they'll<00:03:25.700> unscrew<00:03:26.120> enough

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
so you lose them they'll unscrew enough

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.240 
so you lose them they'll unscrew enough
to<00:03:26.480> get<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.750> off<00:03:26.930> but<00:03:26.960> then<00:03:27.350> they<00:03:27.470> stay<00:03:27.770> in<00:03:27.980> here

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
to get it off but then they stay in here

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.250 
to get it off but then they stay in here
so<00:03:29.030> they're<00:03:29.210> ready<00:03:29.450> for<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:29.810> when<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:29.960> put<00:03:30.110> it

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
so they're ready for you when you put it

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.080 
so they're ready for you when you put it
back<00:03:30.380> on<00:03:30.620> that's<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.220> nice<00:03:31.400> piece<00:03:31.610> of<00:03:31.670> thinking

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
back on that's a nice piece of thinking

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.090 
back on that's a nice piece of thinking
I<00:03:32.300> know<00:03:32.870> back<00:03:33.050> today<00:03:33.290> we'd<00:03:33.500> be<00:03:33.530> working<00:03:33.890> on<00:03:33.950> old

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
I know back today we'd be working on old

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.740 
I know back today we'd be working on old
cars<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.520> we<00:03:34.610> think<00:03:34.850> man<00:03:35.060> now<00:03:35.240> to<00:03:35.330> make<00:03:35.600> this

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
cars and we think man now to make this

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.600 
cars and we think man now to make this
like<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.350> now<00:03:36.620> they<00:03:36.830> ought<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.040> do<00:03:37.160> this<00:03:37.340> how

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
like that now they ought to do this how

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.030 
like that now they ought to do this how
to<00:03:37.640> do<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.060> well<00:03:38.300> on<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:38.810> car<00:03:39.380> in<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.770> lot<00:03:39.950> of

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
to do that well on this car in a lot of
