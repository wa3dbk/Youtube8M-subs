00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:08.800
 Thank you very much for coming out 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.460
 I've been waiting for Splatoon, yes, I've finally been coming all the way without time limit 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.760
 is not it 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:17.410
 Multi likely s high this time but is not the first battle of the game 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.430
 I chose an interesting match as a match development 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.110
 I think it will be 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.880
 I car road arm month is spline Shooter 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.650
 Guy is a map that has been used even Oh is Beaver Park here, according to a problem was in the middle 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.730
 I can overlook the central wide area 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.600
 But if you look at the center only, the part that you can not see may be painted and reversed. 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:40.520
 This time I will try to extend the territory to the left side 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 The other party seems to be coming to this side, so let's go ahead while holding up and climb up on stomachache 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.660
 Somewhat deer 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:52.079
 It is indeed the word No, this is I think whether advantageous took over 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:58.100
 I have a chance, but I still have to go ahead 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.670
 Oh enemy of the previous paint it or wall will hit Chimachima Well 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.850
 Dangerous dangerous husband reel even got beat there I 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.240
 Well I guess I was able to earn some time 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:13.070
 But the other party is young leaves This must be barrier alert 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.810
 Cormorant Well look is not so much painted feel ally area gold was I the super jump 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.159
 In it before f 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.430
 And basshan this did not confirm the election I think bad 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.300
 It quickly super jump have to somehow 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.880
 I 'm going to the middle 55 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.880
 I have to take the top here 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.430
 I want to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.910
 Is not war criminals remains this regrettable, not unexpected Nag quite a good partner 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.110
 I have cut my remaining time in half and I should do something about it soon 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.420
 If this happens, I will only have to fill in the unpainted area If there is only an enemy ahead of this 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.020
 Let's go around from the top as I saw 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.130
 Went a if promote good I have good to adjust the this side before or 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.560
 Don't be beaten from this very future moon 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.689
 Because there is no way, there is only one prefecture , and if you think that it is difficult to get rid of it, allies will be 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.730
 It looks like you came to frontline support 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.790
 I will go ahead too 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.940
 It seems that the enemy is not so near now 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:15.600
 It would be better if the boundaries were not clear yet 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.060
 I took it this time and the remaining time 1 minute 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.900
 From rolling back do you ze really because Karamaku here I'm a good while to jump if there is at this time 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.430
 I did not notice 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.970
 But keep in control with a rubber rush, and allies are destroying the opponent area . 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:36.340
 This is a good feeling I will also go to the back road 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:42.459
 And it seems like a too- popular view of the ever-prone ink management will fly 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.920
 But I 'm going to paint this area-the remaining time is also 30 lines Election until the end 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.270
 I do not understand 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.599
 Iyo I 'm interested in Pine Efficiency Up Member Recovery Speed ​​Up 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.950
 Instruments recovery will peach Naa I'm with 1 U 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:03:01.280
 After that you can not but destroy the area anymore What will happen to this action in the end 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.910
 War situation Ya' is Well then empty scene 's cat has fallen a little and Do have become war of words if you notice 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.910
 Why 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.540
 10 seconds remaining 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:11.690
 So this has come true or the elections will have come true this will have come 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.690
 After that it's only going wild 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.470
 u 8 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.930
 It wasn't quite the last minute, and allies and enemies were strong. 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.069
 It was the first video of the full version by say 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.810
 Please request if you have a weapon you want to use or a stage you want to show 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.810
 I will raise it if it is a match that can be shown
