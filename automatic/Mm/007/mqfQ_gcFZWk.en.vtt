00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.740
 And then everyone is going to be right, like you are. 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.800
 You could see we're here with goals. 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.370
 explained futil show da and ubisoft 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.610
 ubisoft for those who do not know is 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.760
 developer of the chosen race a 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.750
 producer of games I'll start here 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.980
 a new campaign is and show you 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.310
 already the first phase of this game 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:34.540
 game is a tactical shooting game in 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:38.050
 third person is because there is no video 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.890
 first because he did not accept by hand 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.200
 second because it gave a lot of laziness but 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.060
 I think I'm going to go back to video now 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.000
 I will not talk when it develops by 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.150
 because it's from outside again and not 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.890
 it worked out very well 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:58.060
 so I 'm going to try suicide but not 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.450
 I know how many or how much all that play 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.230
 I think this game is $ 30 in 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.230
 style 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.630
 hence the first on the floor 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:17.220
 you will see if it is worth or not will 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.220
 to the field 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.680
 I can not touch her 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:31.150
 I already played the ring a few jewels of a 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.150
 good way but did not generate 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.590
 now to keep it 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.629
 now 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.520
 longing 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.430
 good 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:13.530
 when it comes into contact with water 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.530
 I'm not 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:26.470
 touch of death to powder 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:28.810
 3 came time for a little played 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.300
 nobody gives a touch guys and played in the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.450
 time but only in georgia 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.450
 Nobody cares about being good here. 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.800
 Hello 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.959
 the technical shock 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.959
 photo there 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.240
 This game has an exchange of vat that is 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.230
 very good pastor 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:22.820
 just close to time 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.810
 the opening of a cowboy 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.810
 just as simple 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.570
 Now I 'm going to go back to a workout for a 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:46.360
 year to 9th grade who will sentence ens 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:46.360
 build 13 is not for me in this logic 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:05:05.000
 of life helmet boot she denied her vice 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.690
 already tried to escape this real way but 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.690
 strange glory 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.440
 that was a way and I shut up 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:36.139
 now it's time for the era now show 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.950
 the meaning of goals 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:45.060
 the taste is a manifestation of death 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:52.500
 they stay in 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:56.919
 is helping punishing them was in the mine the 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.690
 today the game was jumping then it was 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.940
 This was the game. 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.840
 if you want to talk squarely for 30 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.600
 dollars 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.980
 a cool thing to play that you can 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.570
 choose your weapons before you start 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.810
 mission 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.130
 so I found her and left her game 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.050
 favorite 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.050
 A hug and until the next
