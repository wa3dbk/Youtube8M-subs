one and 51 and 100 probably a breaking
so<00:01:33.890> just<00:01:34.250> give<00:01:34.400> it<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.550> chance<00:01:34.580> let<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:35.600> let<00:01:35.750> it

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
so just give it a chance let it let it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.280 
so just give it a chance let it let it
reach<00:01:36.020> 500<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.310> after<00:01:37.580> 500<00:01:38.180> if<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.810> continues
