this<00:00:02.179> is<00:00:02.389> a<00:00:02.420> product<00:00:02.750> review<00:00:03.020> of<00:00:03.409> the<00:00:03.679> water

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
this is a product review of the water

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.489 
this is a product review of the water
pump<00:00:04.900> with<00:00:05.900> switch<00:00:06.319> it's<00:00:06.710> an<00:00:07.430> electronic<00:00:07.970> pump

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:08.499 
pump with switch it's an electronic pump

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.259 
pump with switch it's an electronic pump
so<00:00:09.499> it's<00:00:09.650> not<00:00:09.829> the<00:00:10.009> hand<00:00:10.280> pump<00:00:10.549> that<00:00:10.820> you<00:00:10.909> see<00:00:11.240> a

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
so it's not the hand pump that you see a

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.739 
so it's not the hand pump that you see a
Walmart<00:00:11.869> and<00:00:12.079> submitter<00:00:12.669> stores<00:00:13.749> there's

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:14.749 
Walmart and submitter stores there's

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.509 
Walmart and submitter stores there's
many<00:00:15.110> of<00:00:15.289> these<00:00:15.440> I<00:00:15.499> actually<00:00:15.889> think<00:00:16.369> they're

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:16.519 
many of these I actually think they're

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.849 
many of these I actually think they're
all<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:16.670> same<00:00:16.849> one<00:00:17.380> this<00:00:18.380> one<00:00:18.589> in<00:00:18.710> particular

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
all the same one this one in particular

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.470 
all the same one this one in particular
is<00:00:20.529> model<00:00:21.529> two<00:00:21.769> nine<00:00:22.009> seven<00:00:22.609> nine<00:00:22.820> nine<00:00:22.849> it

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
is model two nine seven nine nine it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.489 
is model two nine seven nine nine it
uses<00:00:23.990> two<00:00:24.199> D<00:00:24.470> cell<00:00:24.740> batteries<00:00:24.769> and<00:00:26.199> the<00:00:27.199> flow

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:27.499 
uses two D cell batteries and the flow

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:35.220 
uses two D cell batteries and the flow
rate<00:00:27.529> is<00:00:28.070> 0.9<00:00:28.970> to<00:00:29.329> one<00:00:29.570> gallon<00:00:30.079> per<00:00:30.289> minute<00:00:31.039> and

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.560 

handles<00:00:36.230> cold<00:00:37.219> and<00:00:37.460> hot<00:00:37.579> temperatures<00:00:38.210> and

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
handles cold and hot temperatures and

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.020 
handles cold and hot temperatures and
they<00:00:39.140> do<00:00:39.199> say<00:00:39.590> it's<00:00:39.770> not<00:00:39.949> just<00:00:40.219> for<00:00:40.430> water<00:00:40.670> it

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
they do say it's not just for water it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.200 
they do say it's not just for water it
could<00:00:41.180> be<00:00:41.359> for<00:00:41.859> very<00:00:42.859> liquid<00:00:43.280> beverages<00:00:43.910> and

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
could be for very liquid beverages and

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.939 
could be for very liquid beverages and
so<00:00:44.840> forth<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:45.859> basically<00:00:50.199> you<00:00:51.199> set<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:51.679> in<00:00:51.800> the

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
so forth so basically you set it in the

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.729 
so forth so basically you set it in the
bottle<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:52.640> it<00:00:53.539> has<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.690> screw<00:00:54.109> ring<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:54.649> you

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
bottle and it has a screw ring so you

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.680 
bottle and it has a screw ring so you
set<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.100> in<00:00:55.219> and<00:00:55.519> you<00:00:55.609> just<00:00:55.789> screw<00:00:56.539> it<00:00:56.690> on<00:00:58.690> right

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
set it in and you just screw it on right

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.380 
set it in and you just screw it on right
tightens<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:00.649> it<00:01:01.339> has<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.489> switch<00:01:01.910> on<00:01:02.149> top

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
tightens it and it has a switch on top

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
tightens it and it has a switch on top
and<00:01:03.880> this<00:01:04.880> one<00:01:05.090> has<00:01:05.210> been<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.450> use<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.200> same

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
and this one has been in use of the same

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.620 
and this one has been in use of the same
batteries<00:01:07.010> for<00:01:07.280> almost<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.760> month<00:01:07.970> in<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.360> very

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
batteries for almost a month in a very

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.100 
batteries for almost a month in a very
very<00:01:08.990> busy<00:01:09.380> day<00:01:09.530> care<00:01:10.010> here<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.900> we<00:01:11.900> have

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
very busy day care here and we have

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.520 
very busy day care here and we have
noted<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.970> top<00:01:14.240> does<00:01:14.720> sit<00:01:15.230> well<00:01:15.500> with

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
noted that the top does sit well with

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.040 
noted that the top does sit well with
certain<00:01:16.130> bottles<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:17.000> not<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.570> well<00:01:17.600> with

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
certain bottles and not so well with

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.230 
certain bottles and not so well with
some<00:01:18.260> etter<00:01:18.440> bottles<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.070> have<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:19.490> bulge

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
some etter bottles that have this bulge

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.620 
some etter bottles that have this bulge
this<00:01:20.960> folds<00:01:21.410> on<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.680> ring<00:01:21.920> here<00:01:22.360> so<00:01:23.360> I'm<00:01:23.510> going

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
this folds on the ring here so I'm going

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.030 
this folds on the ring here so I'm going
to<00:01:23.720> go<00:01:23.810> ahead<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.140> show<00:01:24.260> you<00:01:24.320> how<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:24.530> use<00:01:24.830> it

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
to go ahead and show you how to use it

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.250 
to go ahead and show you how to use it
you<00:01:25.220> basically<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:26.030> push<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.780> button<00:01:27.110> and

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
you basically just push the button and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.950 
you basically just push the button and
unlike<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.370> hand<00:01:28.610> pumps<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.180> does<00:01:29.540> not<00:01:29.690> really

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
unlike the hand pumps it does not really

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.790 
unlike the hand pumps it does not really
need<00:01:30.260> an<00:01:30.650> air<00:01:30.980> seal<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.330> can<00:01:33.260> even<00:01:33.410> be<00:01:33.560> crook

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
need an air seal so it can even be crook

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.660 
need an air seal so it can even be crook
it<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.130> still<00:01:34.310> work<00:01:34.490> great<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.590> that's<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.800> try

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
it and still work great so that's a try

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.630 
it and still work great so that's a try
to<00:01:37.730> do<00:01:37.910> this<00:01:38.060> with<00:01:38.240> one<00:01:38.420> hand<00:01:38.450> real<00:01:39.050> quick

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.820 
get my teapot here and I'm going to push
the<00:01:47.470> switch<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.730> starts<00:01:52.120> pumping<00:01:52.330> water

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
the switch and it starts pumping water

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:00.370

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
bought the more expensive one because we

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.630 
bought the more expensive one because we
didn't<00:02:23.690> want<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.870> wait<00:02:24.050> for<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.560> arrival<00:02:24.650> so

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.340 
we're very happy we've we killed two
hand<00:02:28.160> pumps<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:29.270> we<00:02:29.390> decided<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.230> get

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
hand pumps so we decided to get
