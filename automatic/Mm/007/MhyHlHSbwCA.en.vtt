00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.840
 they grow and they do it separately as well 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.180
 that many of us in life do not 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.280
 they found their way many will 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.910
 years until fate returns them to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.910

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.590

 I present to you a good friend when 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.710
 We were little ladies 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.710
 say hello 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.050
 and how many of you do not have a father 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.000
 Even if you do all this, I'm amazing 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.440
 what happens when you ask for something 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.560
 true is that all this happened to 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.120
 Denis I only do my part, what happens 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.490
 my two kidneys stopped working 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.890
 a few years ago I went from being in the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.440
 prison to work on the project that has 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.620
 Past knows that it has been the girl's 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.200
 optimist that I knew 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.060
 murdered my husband in your neighborhood in 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.370
 how I saw a man that matched the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.180
 description of the weak killer and wore 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.520
 a red hood is called anthony jones 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.740
 that's life, I guess it's a 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.560
 dead end I have gone through things 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.760
 similar and it is not a dead end 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.060
 if it takes you to a place where 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.290
 you needed to go it 's okay your body has 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.710
 rejected dialysis 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.710
 Whatever happens, take care of those children
