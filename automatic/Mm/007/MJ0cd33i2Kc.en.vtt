00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.190 
are amongst the nicest screen shields i
have<00:03:43.459> tried<00:03:43.840> especially<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:44.930> one<00:03:45.049> in<00:03:45.139> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
have tried especially the one in the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.599 
have tried especially the one in the
back<00:03:45.349> obviously<00:03:45.620> i<00:03:45.829> only<00:03:45.980> tried<00:03:46.190> it<00:03:46.250> but<00:03:46.549> i

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
back obviously i only tried it but i

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:47.800 
back obviously i only tried it but i
imagine<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:47.120> front<00:03:47.329> is<00:03:47.419> going<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.599> be<00:03:47.660> just

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
imagine the front is going to be just

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.650 
imagine the front is going to be just
the<00:03:47.959> same<00:03:47.989> they're<00:03:48.940> super<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.209> know<00:03:50.329> good

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
the same they're super you know good

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.170 
the same they're super you know good
quality<00:03:51.260> kind<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:51.769> on<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:51.919> thick<00:03:52.250> side<00:03:52.280> which

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
quality kind of on the thick side which

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.120 
quality kind of on the thick side which
makes<00:03:53.450> installing<00:03:53.959> them<00:03:54.319> quite<00:03:54.560> easy<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.069> you

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
makes installing them quite easy and you

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.099 
makes installing them quite easy and you
can<00:03:55.160> see<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:55.669> got<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.329> one<00:03:56.480> on<00:03:56.599> the<00:03:56.690> back<00:03:56.870> I

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
can see I got that one on the back I

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.360 
can see I got that one on the back I
mean<00:03:57.319> I<00:03:57.380> didn't<00:03:57.560> even<00:03:57.620> have<00:03:57.829> to<00:03:57.950> do<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.220> old

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
mean I didn't even have to do the old

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.069 
mean I didn't even have to do the old
scotch<00:03:58.669> tape<00:03:58.940> trick<00:03:59.209> there<00:03:59.419> wasn't<00:03:59.690> any<00:03:59.780> dust

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
scotch tape trick there wasn't any dust

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.289 
scotch tape trick there wasn't any dust
nothing<00:04:00.500> stuck<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.919> it<00:04:01.069> no<00:04:01.579> bubbling<00:04:02.090> go

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
nothing stuck to it no bubbling go

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.390 
nothing stuck to it no bubbling go
watermarking<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.109> laid<00:04:03.319> down<00:04:03.530> absolutely

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
watermarking it laid down absolutely

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.789 
watermarking it laid down absolutely
perfectly<00:04:04.849> the<00:04:05.060> first<00:04:05.090> time<00:04:05.510> now<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:06.440> know<00:04:06.709> it

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
perfectly the first time now you know it

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.650 
perfectly the first time now you know it
may<00:04:06.919> be<00:04:06.980> luck<00:04:07.280> but<00:04:07.579> i<00:04:07.609> think<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.209> screen

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
may be luck but i think the the screen

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.349 
may be luck but i think the the screen
shields<00:04:08.959> are<00:04:09.139> you<00:04:09.650> know<00:04:09.739> of<00:04:10.010> very<00:04:10.280> very<00:04:10.760> good

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359

shields are you know of very very good
quality<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:11.959> i<00:04:11.989> would<00:04:12.139> consider<00:04:12.290> picking<00:04:12.680> up

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
quality and i would consider picking up

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.949 
quality and i would consider picking up
some<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.370> just<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.030> screen<00:04:14.269> shields<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:14.840> know

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959

the money shot is you can see that

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.219 
the money shot is you can see that
really<00:05:03.080> unique<00:05:03.470> design<00:05:03.919> very<00:05:04.729> I<00:05:04.820> think

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229

know<00:06:13.849> if<00:06:13.940> you<00:06:14.000> can<00:06:14.120> make<00:06:14.300> that<00:06:14.449> out<00:06:14.659> maybe<00:06:14.900> if<00:06:15.020> I

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
know if you can make that out maybe if I

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.320 
know if you can make that out maybe if I
turn<00:06:15.380> it<00:06:15.470> that<00:06:15.620> way<00:06:15.800> you<00:06:16.310> can<00:06:16.490> see<00:06:16.639> that<00:06:16.669> the

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
lip hair runs along the edge but then

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.560 
lip hair runs along the edge but then
it's<00:06:19.070> kind<00:06:19.250> of<00:06:19.280> flared<00:06:19.639> down<00:06:20.000> around<00:06:20.389> the

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
it's kind of flared down around the

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.570 
it's kind of flared down around the
corners<00:06:21.080> and<00:06:21.320> that's<00:06:21.800> true<00:06:22.070> on<00:06:22.220> all<00:06:22.250> the

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.700 
corners and that's true on all the
corners<00:06:22.760> just<00:06:23.510> creates<00:06:23.840> kind<00:06:23.990> of<00:06:24.139> a<00:06:24.199> different

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
corners just creates kind of a different

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.800 
corners just creates kind of a different
look<00:06:24.919> it's<00:06:25.250> just<00:06:25.400> you<00:06:25.610> know<00:06:25.639> it's<00:06:26.150> unlike<00:06:26.570> any

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810

probably you've seen as well so I think

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.020 
probably you've seen as well so I think
this<00:06:30.620> case<00:06:30.860> is<00:06:30.889> very<00:06:31.280> unique<00:06:31.460> it's<00:06:31.820> not

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
this case is very unique it's not

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.670 
this case is very unique it's not
expensive<00:06:32.479> you<00:06:32.960> know<00:06:33.050> it's<00:06:33.199> under<00:06:33.409> thirty

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680
