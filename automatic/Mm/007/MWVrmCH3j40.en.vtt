you<00:02:00.700> can<00:02:00.789> kind<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:00.999> see<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.329> doing<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.109> the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
you can kind of see that doing this the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.830 
you can kind of see that doing this the
short<00:02:03.009> segment<00:02:03.579> that<00:02:03.670> shows<00:02:03.909> Percy<00:02:04.390> Harvin

while he's being tackled so that kind of

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.240 
while he's being tackled so that kind of
lends<00:02:10.899> credence<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.470> that'll<00:02:12.010> be<00:02:12.130> in

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
lends credence that that'll be in

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.290 
the cover athletes coming out I think
that's<00:06:42.319> really<00:06:42.740> gonna<00:06:42.860> I<00:06:43.310> but<00:06:43.819> imagine<00:06:44.180> we're

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
that's really gonna I but imagine we're

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.670 
that's really gonna I but imagine we're
going<00:06:44.419> to<00:06:44.479> find<00:06:44.569> out<00:06:44.750> one<00:06:45.259> or<00:06:45.379> two<00:06:45.500> big

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
going to find out one or two big

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.309 
going to find out one or two big
features<00:06:46.099> or<00:06:46.460> maybe<00:06:47.089> some<00:06:47.990> more<00:06:48.050> gameplay

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
features or maybe some more gameplay

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.200 
features or maybe some more gameplay
features<00:06:48.860> will<00:06:48.979> be<00:06:49.009> flushed<00:06:49.849> out<00:06:50.029> and

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
features will be flushed out and

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.089 
features will be flushed out and
explained<00:06:50.479> in<00:06:50.599> better<00:06:50.750> detail<00:06:50.930> so<00:06:51.770> I<00:06:51.800> think

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
explained in better detail so I think

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.649 
explained in better detail so I think
the<00:06:52.339> next<00:06:52.400> week<00:06:52.729> or<00:06:52.879> two<00:06:53.029> I<00:06:53.300> think<00:06:53.599> the

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:53.659 
the next week or two I think the

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:54.790 
the next week or two I think the
information<00:06:53.810> is<00:06:54.050> going<00:06:54.199> to<00:06:54.259> pick<00:06:54.379> up<00:06:54.560> and

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800
