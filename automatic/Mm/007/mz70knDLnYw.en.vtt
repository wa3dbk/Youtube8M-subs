00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.810
 the dvd 1 that if sometimes you put by is the 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.240
 dvd 1 suddenly it stops working 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.370
 it happens that's all, even though that happens 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.090
 it works, and if it does not register, it's 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.539
