the<00:05:59.729> computer<00:06:00.270> in<00:06:00.360> the<00:06:00.479> system<00:06:00.840> filters<00:06:01.620> all

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
the computer in the system filters all

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.439 
the computer in the system filters all
the<00:06:01.979> data<00:06:02.219> and<00:06:02.430> then<00:06:02.610> it<00:06:02.639> picks<00:06:02.909> you<00:06:03.060> a<00:06:03.210> little

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
the data and then it picks you a little

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.420 
the data and then it picks you a little
picture<00:06:03.779> on<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:04.020> screen<00:06:04.259> sometimes<00:06:04.949> even

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
picture on the screen sometimes even

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.149 
picture on the screen sometimes even
puts<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:05.639> little<00:06:05.729> fish<00:06:06.029> symbol<00:06:06.330> down<00:06:06.599> there

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
puts a little fish symbol down there

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.040 
puts a little fish symbol down there
that's<00:06:08.159> what's<00:06:08.430> happened<00:06:08.849> down<00:06:09.029> there<00:06:09.060> it's

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
that's what's happened down there it's

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.209 
that's what's happened down there it's
not<00:06:10.319> what's<00:06:10.560> happening<00:06:10.650> right<00:06:11.250> here<00:06:13.219> flasher

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
not what's happening right here flasher

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.959 
not what's happening right here flasher
technology<00:06:14.849> is<00:06:15.090> real-time<00:06:15.710> so<00:06:16.849> what<00:06:17.849> I'm

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:17.969 
technology is real-time so what I'm

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:20.240 
technology is real-time so what I'm
saying<00:06:18.210> is<00:06:18.479> when<00:06:18.900> you<00:06:19.229> see<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.949> transition

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
saying is when you see the transition

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
saying is when you see the transition
line<00:06:20.819> go<00:06:21.060> from<00:06:21.419> soft<00:06:21.840> to<00:06:22.469> hard

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
line go from soft to hard

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.200 
line go from soft to hard
that<00:06:24.270> means<00:06:24.599> the<00:06:24.870> spot<00:06:25.229> is<00:06:25.740> right<00:06:26.210> underneath

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
that means the spot is right underneath

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.120 
that means the spot is right underneath
you<00:06:27.539> or<00:06:27.750> exactly<00:06:28.169> where<00:06:28.349> the<00:06:28.469> transducer

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
you or exactly where the transducer

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.559 
you or exactly where the transducer
would<00:06:29.250> happen<00:06:29.490> to<00:06:29.580> be<00:06:29.639> you<00:06:30.210> have<00:06:30.330> to<00:06:30.419> actually

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 
would happen to be you have to actually

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.600 
would happen to be you have to actually
think<00:06:30.810> now<00:06:31.139> I<00:06:31.169> keep<00:06:31.440> my<00:06:31.500> transducer<00:06:32.370> on<00:06:32.460> my

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
think now I keep my transducer on my

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.550 
think now I keep my transducer on my
boat<00:06:32.849> on<00:06:33.060> my<00:06:33.569> electric<00:06:33.930> trolling<00:06:34.110> motor<00:06:34.440> in

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
boat on my electric trolling motor in

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.040 
boat on my electric trolling motor in
the<00:06:34.620> front<00:06:34.860> of<00:06:34.949> the<00:06:35.009> boat<00:06:35.159> so<00:06:35.789> my<00:06:36.270> motor<00:06:36.509> is<00:06:36.630> I

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
the front of the boat so my motor is I

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.320 
the front of the boat so my motor is I
know<00:06:37.589> exactly<00:06:38.240> soft<00:06:39.240> hard

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
know exactly soft hard

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.499 
know exactly soft hard
soft<00:06:41.139> hard<00:06:41.889> the<00:06:42.490> edge<00:06:42.669> is<00:06:43.000> directly

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
soft hard the edge is directly

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.480 
soft hard the edge is directly
underneath<00:06:43.840> me<00:06:44.169> or<00:06:44.229> drip<00:06:44.710> down<00:06:44.979> between<00:06:45.370> my

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
underneath me or drip down between my

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.290 
underneath me or drip down between my
legs<00:06:46.319> knowing<00:06:47.319> that<00:06:47.560> I<00:06:47.860> can<00:06:48.550> position<00:06:48.879> my

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
legs knowing that I can position my

legs knowing that I can position my
casts<00:06:49.990> position<00:06:50.860> my<00:06:51.039> boat

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
casts position my boat

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.260 
casts position my boat
so<00:06:52.060> I'm<00:06:52.210> specifically<00:06:52.960> on<00:06:53.259> those<00:06:53.530> creases

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
so I'm specifically on those creases

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.450 
so I'm specifically on those creases
that<00:06:55.270> could<00:06:55.479> be<00:06:55.599> the<00:06:55.690> crease<00:06:55.960> from<00:06:56.560> soft<00:06:56.949> to

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
that could be the crease from soft to

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.270 
that could be the crease from soft to
hard<00:06:57.639> it<00:06:58.419> could<00:06:58.659> be<00:06:58.750> the<00:06:58.870> crease<00:06:59.139> from<00:06:59.680> rock<00:06:59.979> to

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
hard it could be the crease from rock to

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.659 
hard it could be the crease from rock to
weed<00:07:00.669> it<00:07:01.360> even<00:07:01.900> could<00:07:02.110> be<00:07:02.259> a<00:07:02.289> pocket<00:07:02.949> inside

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:03.669 
weed it even could be a pocket inside

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.379 
weed it even could be a pocket inside
the<00:07:04.389> vegetation<00:07:05.020> but<00:07:05.949> only<00:07:06.250> and<00:07:07.030> I<00:07:07.090> have<00:07:07.270> to
