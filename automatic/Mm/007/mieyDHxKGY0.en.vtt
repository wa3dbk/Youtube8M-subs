00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello good that god subscribers and 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.080
 we are with this new video for the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.019
 channel and it is that it turns out that today 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.300
 had to get up early I wanted to overtake 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.790
 a series of things I had to do 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.650
 for the channel for you I said 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.720
 because in some blog that does a lot 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.090
 of time I do not upload blog to the channel and 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 I really want to do it, you are going to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.220
 see the house the partner's house 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.310
 youtube is the partner on youtube in the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.920
 that I live normally live and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.260
 I sleep and I recorded my video and everything is 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.780
 so I've decided to get up early are 5 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.360
 in the afternoon now is this would 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 my bed and this is good because this is a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.420
 pillow that I bought or with the money 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.760
 of the partner is oca feather 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.219
 I know because I plucked the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.870
 geese and good and the rest is going to 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.059
 see my room because the rest would be 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.460
 what would be to me the rest of my 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.890
 room what would it be then this that is 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.710
 the see does not give me a 360 degree turn 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.570
 so you can see more or less how it is not already 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.269
 you have seen it then hala let's go to the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.520
 next area I got dizzy and everything did not 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.250
 I knew you could get dizzy doing this 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.159
 but it's funny because because they do so 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.100
 you stop and you get dizzy this is my table 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.470
 work where I said edit that I know 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.240
 that lamp is very gay but in 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.950
 reality is my sister's worth only the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.450
 used for when he recorded me with the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.069
 camera and it's night so that it 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.720
 see better because if not my camera then no 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.720
 does not catch the student well you 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.950
 I had to have removed the flower too 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.859
 it's true but hey this is the toilet 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.720
 that's where he threw all the shit 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:38.720
 gago and 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.070
 and those things that youtubers do 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.730

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.800
 my room and as you can see there are below 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.530

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.590
 with the camera by stairs is 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.120
 quite dangerous like that 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.460
 you have to have a little bit of entity 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.050
 well now we were here we have what 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.460

 space where I then play and those 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.190
 things 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:29.129
 I feel there and it touched me a little bit what 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.129

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.330

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.370

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.670
 then you have listened but it does 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.500
 a rather strange sound 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.300
 I am today 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.500

 today 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.400
 [Music] 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.209
 poor sausage 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.650
 I'm poor or good sausage 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.760
 I usually make a sound 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.319
 I miss with my mouth that now 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.579
 supposedly as we are creating 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.440
 with the camera 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.180
 surely I do not 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.910
 but he drops the drool look how you 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.950
 drool when when you see the sausage 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.010
 that is the sound 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.190
 although I'm going to eat it, I'm not rich 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.750
 I can eat this well let's continue 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.599
 seeing good here is where you have then 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.989
 this is the entrance to my house here what 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:12.950
 you have and well, it fills me hello 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.290

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.079

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.019
 but well here is what you have then 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.850
 the garage here we have the garage makes 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.370
 course of the host makes a sun 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.639
 incredible but good I'm going to put the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.850
 glasses is quite simple and easy to see and 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.639
 here we have what would be the yard worth 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.750
 This is the patio, in which I 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.760
 the truth that he did not spend much time in the 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.990
 patio but this is where we parked the 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.030
 cars and such 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.300
 there in the background because there is my 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.720
 family is there that is a room that 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.650
 they have where they stay there in the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.470
 family came with the house when the 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.990
 buy and well this is the pool here 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.340
 is where I do not occasionally bathe and 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.500
 if you want now we give ourselves a 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.110
 little bathroom we think if we take a bath 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.060
 together would be fine let's go to it good 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.710
 I'm ready, let's give us a 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.630
 What do you think if we give ourselves a 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.090
 I bathe with this heat that makes here 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.580
 I am that is this this is my town and it is 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.740
 a rain-fed area that hallucinates then 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.110
 the heat here is not hot is hell 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.210
 hell pure and hard is worth it so let's go 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.100
 to give us a swim and see how 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.120
 to see how we feel to see what 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.430
 if not, well, the water is a little 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.050
 we will look like a pond this 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.530
 it costs a little cold of everything there is 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.530
 what to say 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.710
 I have to say one thing for those who do not 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.530
 you know me still well and that is that I am 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.000
 Very vase is worth so I need 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.770
 credit to get me into water thing of a 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.810
 hour if one hour is worth one hour long 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.400
 and when the eggs arrive, 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.229
 tender that there are boys you will understand what 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.780
 that when the water reaches the part 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.979
 of those of the eggs is deadly 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.289
 after a long time I got 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.930
 put me in the water lying down and what 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.759
 it seems if we leave together if we 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.819
 we hit a bathroom is that it seems if 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.819
 we dive a little point down 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.650
 is big 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.340
 I stayed synthesized 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:28.710
 [Music] 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:28.710
 we have not seen since the crisis 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.099
 we rested 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.470
 Well, I'm saying goodbye after this 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.570
 refreshing bath that we have stuck 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.800
