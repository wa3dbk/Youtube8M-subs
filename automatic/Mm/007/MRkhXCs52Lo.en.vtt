unsprung mass is important because it's

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.480 
unsprung mass is important because it's
a<00:00:02.879> key<00:00:03.179> part<00:00:03.510> of<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.899> total<00:00:04.310> evaluation<00:00:05.310> and

it<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.639> drive<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> important<00:00:16.170> thing

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
it is to drive but the important thing

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.000 
it is to drive but the important thing
is<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.680> know<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:16.890> as<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.880> add<00:00:18.150> unsprung<00:00:18.810> mass

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
is to know that as you add unsprung mass

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.769 
is to know that as you add unsprung mass
you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.220> engineer<00:00:20.699> your<00:00:20.910> way<00:00:21.060> past<00:00:21.420> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
you can engineer your way past and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.509 
you can engineer your way past and
actually<00:00:22.080> recover<00:00:22.529> those<00:00:22.800> issues<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.400> are

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
actually recover those issues that are

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.420 
actually recover those issues that are
created<00:00:23.939> with<00:00:24.300> additional<00:00:24.779> unsprung<00:00:25.170> mass

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
created with additional unsprung mass

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.740 
created with additional unsprung mass
it's<00:00:26.430> really<00:00:26.699> important<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.300> know<00:00:27.449> that

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
it's really important to know that

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.109 
it's really important to know that
although<00:00:27.960> we're<00:00:28.590> 31<00:00:29.010> kilograms<00:00:29.250> per<00:00:29.670> motor

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
although we're 31 kilograms per motor

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.999 
although we're 31 kilograms per motor
you<00:00:30.449> think<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.109> terms<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
you think about it in terms of the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.910 
you think about it in terms of the
horsepower<00:00:32.550> we've<00:00:32.850> added<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.510> us<00:00:34.440> numbers

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
horsepower we've added in us numbers

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.310 
horsepower we've added in us numbers
it's<00:00:35.160> over<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> hundred<00:00:35.550> horsepower<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.660> then

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
it's over a hundred horsepower and then

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
it's over a hundred horsepower and then
if<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> look<00:00:37.680> at<00:00:37.739> our<00:00:37.860> torque<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.090> call

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
if you look at our torque what we call

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.119 
if you look at our torque what we call
torque<00:00:39.600> density<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> amount<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.590> torque<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
torque density the amount of torque that

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.310 
torque density the amount of torque that
you<00:00:41.250> provide<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.820> automobile<00:00:42.270> given<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you provide to the automobile given the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.779 
you provide to the automobile given the
amount<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.649> weight<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.920> you've<00:00:44.250> added<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
amount of weight that you've added is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.180 
amount of weight that you've added is
really<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> pretty<00:00:45.780> good<00:00:45.960> ratio<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.739> very

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
really a pretty good ratio it's a very

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.360 
really a pretty good ratio it's a very
powerful<00:00:47.520> motor<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.930> by<00:00:49.140> adding<00:00:49.350> some<00:00:49.860> mass<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
powerful motor so by adding some mass to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.830 
powerful motor so by adding some mass to
the<00:00:50.489> vehicle<00:00:50.910> you're<00:00:51.059> also<00:00:51.210> adding<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the vehicle you're also adding a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.090 
the vehicle you're also adding a
tremendous<00:00:52.350> amount<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.710> additional

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
tremendous amount of additional

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.970 
tremendous amount of additional
capability<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.030> car<00:00:54.530> there<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> study

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
capability to the car there was a study

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.849 
capability to the car there was a study
done<00:00:56.280> by<00:00:56.520> Lotus<00:00:56.969> engineering<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:58.620> a

then<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.630> took<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.990> same<00:01:25.320> exact<00:01:25.890> vehicle

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
then they took that same exact vehicle

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.819 
then they took that same exact vehicle
and<00:01:26.549> modified<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.689> added<00:01:27.900> mass<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and modified it they added mass to the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.700 
and modified it they added mass to the
vehicle<00:01:29.369> both<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> front<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.229> also<00:01:31.650> to

other words the masses just added and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.569 
other words the masses just added and
stays<00:01:36.360> there<00:01:36.689> as<00:01:37.049> well<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> rotational

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
stays there as well as the rotational

mass that would be added to the vehicle

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.700 
mass that would be added to the vehicle
if<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.610> put<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> proton<00:01:42.240> motors<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.899> then

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
if you put the proton motors on then

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.679 
if you put the proton motors on then
they<00:01:43.979> ran<00:01:44.159> their<00:01:44.369> tests<00:01:44.700> again<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.210> they

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
they ran their tests again and they

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.929 
they ran their tests again and they
found<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.439> there<00:01:46.770> was<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> difference<00:01:47.700> but

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
found that there was a difference but

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.700 
found that there was a difference but
that<00:01:48.149> difference<00:01:48.420> could<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.960> recovered<00:01:49.290> with

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that difference could be recovered with
