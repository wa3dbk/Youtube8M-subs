00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.170
 maybe another word to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.950
 condensation in the bivi bags 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.590
 with biwaksäcken it is so if the 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.170
 are breathable and you are not very 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.630
 a lot of sweats or not with very wet ones 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.130
 clothes in the bivouac sack go in then 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.410
 you do not have the chance that as much as possible 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.790
 from the water vapor, so to speak, the man 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.320
 that transfers from the bivouac 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.750
 thing goes well overnight the body 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.930
 loses a lot of liquid in the form 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.860
 sweaty over the night more than so 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.690
 some believe 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.239
 and since it is then already sometimes 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.190
 that one that I'm a pretty awesome 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.470
 breathable bivouac sack on then with 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.100
 Wet clothes go in or extreme 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.820
 sweat in it and then think there is yes 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.890
 For example, there is something humid about the poor 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.320
 is because here we go 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.810
 Morning dew in or has a bit 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.200
 he may not be raining 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.380
 waterproof yes and there you have to 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.039
 so watch the transpiration of the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.659
 body in the form of sweat the 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:24.500
 manifests itself just left and right 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.869
 mostly from the body and if there is one 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.090
 small puddle is or moisture in the 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.250
 bivouac does not have to say that 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.060
 the bivouac sack is leaking that there 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.210
 It has been raining but it is in the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.490
 most cases the own body 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.189
 Switzerland is in the bivouac sack 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.320
 does not accumulate at biwaksäcken 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:51.380
 are breathable from the halo or 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.829
 plastic höfer category there is this 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.850
 chance of course a lot bigger because 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:03.640
 everything the body gives in 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.679
 form of sweat so water vapor, so to speak 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.410
 Condensed dish in which all sack 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.240
 or in the plastic bag and stays 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.330
 in there yes what is also called if the 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.450
 is airy and if the no membrane 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.000
 has where the moisture can go out 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.650
 then it just stays that way in the sector 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.540
 means it could already be that one 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.540
 wakes up a bit wet in the morning 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.750
 that's just so who's there 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.120
 this one would like to have less 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.680
 a very good one 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.810
 get breathable bivouac sack because there 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.810
 the humidity for the most part 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.870
 discharged through the membrane to the outside 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.580
 can be depending on 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.620
 weather conditions naturally and in 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.110
 the plastic says great or in the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.220
 Age class is just a bit 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.530
 consensus in it 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.110
 that's why we're the same 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.930
 because the sleeping bags or in the 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.910
 winter you have the problem not quite so 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.070
 blatant always depends on you can 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.580
 Of course, let up on that too 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.580
 moisture can escape and there is 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.740
 it then many possibilities that 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.020
 the simplest is one or more breathable 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:22.140
 bivouac the others see him in the 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.610
 rescue and callallisch is always 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.380
 difficult as an egg laying 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.960
 to find wool milk sow 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.610
 mostly bites somewhere than he does 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.800
 either the back is super breathable 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:41.570
 superlight super waterproof super 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:46.140
 windproof or he is very cheap so 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.120
 everything is well, so to speak, it is whole 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.010
 I have not had a difficult time yet 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.210
 found where I say that it but the 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.910
 absolute madness 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.930
 mostly, then the post but 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.660
 a little bit heavier 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.170
 or is super tough and very light 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.880
 but it is extremely expensive that it is always so 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.130
 A balance is the must for everyone 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.550
 decide what they want from you 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.810
 otherwise important 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.340
 we have a choice of 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.930
 bivouac sacks 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.989
 Just stop by 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.840
 specialty we see ourselves in old age 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.530
 fresh and i forget support your 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.530
 local de la
