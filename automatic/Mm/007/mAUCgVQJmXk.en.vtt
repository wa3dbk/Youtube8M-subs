00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.720
 territory 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.660
 no nothing I start thinking that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.400
 the oracle is really not very good 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.750
 key where they should not see me 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.310
 no forgiveness serving his shows little 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.870

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.060
 just the right moment to act 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.190

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.560
 two boys I saw that he made him a 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.700
 sign to say he agreed 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.840
 does not mean anything at all that if gives 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.840
 me a hand you want 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.300

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.220

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.140

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.190

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.510

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.849
 oh that yes thank you 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.019
 at oracle I understand now what 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.030
 that you try to tell me since the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.010
 early couple relationships are already 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.780
 quite difficult enough like that it is 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.430
 needless to complicate further the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.349
 things I have to make a choice 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.349
 raw jackson
