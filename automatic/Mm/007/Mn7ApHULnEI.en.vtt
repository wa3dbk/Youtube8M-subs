00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.880
 hello everyone how are I am johnny 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.099
 knoxville and today I 'm going to show you a 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.110
 way to get more out of your 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.039
 playstation life 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.199
 in the range of the gameplay both in 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.690
 the game of first person shooter and in 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.390
 the games as a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.240
 modnation or daniel andersch of the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.830
 technique and resistance the game the first 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.120
 person shooter 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.390
 good 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.280
 as everyone already knows the precision 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.610
 vital is characterized by having two 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.310
 joysticks 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.290
 Well, in my opinion, there are too many 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.560
 small ones are very small of course 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.460
 almost change 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.210
 totally 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.399
 in the pcpe for the half price because 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.870
 the pcpe was too much 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.739
 too small 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.460
 well this is the way of how 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.449
 make it bigger or better it can if 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.449
 You could say that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.890
 it is about 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.870
 this a pacifier that is a kind of 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.520
 you can come stopper 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.370
 in the hearing aids in some hearing aids and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.650
 well that way just because I know 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.930
 we apply and we can improve the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.510
 gameplay now let's see I'm going to 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.280
 teach how to do it on the other joystick 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.670
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.670
 is 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.530
 good that there is that kind of pacifier 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.220
 something like that 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.220
 we turn it around 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.140
 and we 're going to cut it a little 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.659
 here also some of this size 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.200
 we put it on the joystick 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.290
 and a little bit of strength 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.930
 moment 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.630
 this remove this requires a lot 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.910
 patience 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.060
 and I also did not get out but then 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.060
 already 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.700
 and that's it 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.790
 how can you see like this 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.340
 Well they are super manageable and gives them a 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.340
 best aspect of gameplay 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.280
 I'm going to 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.280
 I'll show you how 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.780
 thanks for watching the video
