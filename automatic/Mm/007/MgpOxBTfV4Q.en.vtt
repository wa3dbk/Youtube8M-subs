 receive 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.460
 you are looking for a coach that 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.070

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.520
 caldito with sea king 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.520
 and with me I think it's normal 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.170
 and it's not training 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.260
 what we do we exchange from this sea 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.700
 rhythm and we try another flexible let's 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.159

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 let's go with the prodigious change 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.330

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.470

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.009
 time 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.009

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.720

 and finds nothing nothing finds nothing 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.880

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.550
 we had to exchange the pokemon that 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.100
 I love so much 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.220

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.819
 I do not say anything else and I hope that 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.819
 change first in something interesting 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.560

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:49.010

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.659
 pretty common 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.659
 you do not see that it's training 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.700
