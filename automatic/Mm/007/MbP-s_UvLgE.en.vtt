00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.180 
that's because the Sun warms the
topsy-turvy<00:00:34.239> planter<00:00:34.929> like<00:00:34.960> a<00:00:35.140> greenhouse<00:00:35.530> so

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190

the<00:00:36.339> root<00:00:36.609> system<00:00:37.059> explodes<00:00:37.569> and<00:00:38.050> because

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499 
the root system explodes and because

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.590 
the root system explodes and because
it's<00:00:38.679> upside<00:00:39.100> down<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.670> water<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:40.179> nutrients

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
it's upside down the water and nutrients

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.629 
it's upside down the water and nutrients
go<00:00:40.780> directly<00:00:41.409> from<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.710> roots<00:00:41.920> to<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:42.309> fruit

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:42.639 
go directly from the roots to the fruit

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:44.969 
go directly from the roots to the fruit
so<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.059> get<00:00:43.479> better<00:00:43.690> results<00:00:43.989> with<00:00:44.589> a<00:00:44.620> lot
