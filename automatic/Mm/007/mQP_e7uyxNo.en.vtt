00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.550
 the mobile emergency service samu began to attend to 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.310
 population of Manaus on July 2 of this year 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.759
 today the municipality counts on eight professionals between driver and 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.479
 nursing technicians 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:35.100
 two cars are available in the city for basic and advanced support 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.250
 but only one is doing community service 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.770
 the daily lives of these men and women have not been easy at all 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.310
 in the last days the municipality faces a wave of traffic accidents 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.020
 registered by the military police 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.380
 the great majority caused by drivers' recklessness in order to have 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.330
 an idea in the month of June samu made the attendance of two hundred and fourteen 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.020
 requests 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.400
 of these 90 numbers were only for clinical care hypertension 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.650
 diabetes the terranos infarcts among others 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 in July the requests lowered were 154 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.060
 being 52 for clinical care 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.110
 the month of August month of many festivities in juÃ­na the car of samu 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.080
 was fired 259 times 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.370
 81'- clinical care 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.780
 but the motorcycle accident also gets attention this month 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.980
 were 24 attendances of people who get involved in traffic accident the month 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.460
 September was also worrisome with 267 visits 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.350
 made by the mobile emergency service 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.619
 43 was critical of motorcycle were 24 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.400
 October has not yet been counted but there is information from 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.680
 that traffic accidents may exceed the previous months 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.030
 the coordinator of the samu in June nurse elisiane cardozo one of the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.900
 responsible for implementing the samu in the municipality takes a positive 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.850
 of these calls that was made to the malan community are positive 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 the population has accepted our work very well 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:15.389
 it is still in the beginning there was a bit of menthol should pertaining to the service 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.999
 of the samu that the samu does for anyone who wants to see samu but I think it was 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.119
 following these four months the population is more aware of the 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:29.929
 is hexa no longer removes the helmet of the victims in case of accidents 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:34.749
 is this on the ground or in cases of extreme gravity I think this is 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.749
 important to be in the sentence 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:42.279
 is reinforced for the population samu performs emergency care and 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:43.789
 emergency anywhere 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:47.119
 local workplaces and public thoroughfares 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.439
 juice is made after a call 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.930
 see the situations 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.090
 then called should be called 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.090
 in cases where 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.659
 an athlete who has made a bad case of accidents 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.449
 the action on us 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:13.129
 traumas in general poisoned snakebite then extreme cases where the 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:19.109
 people can tattooing were victims and before lists we attend is also 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.149
 an emergency, but we urge people to check 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:28.969
 the victim responds if she does not respond to see the level of awareness of this 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:30.999
 silver victim rationing people 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:34.429
 samu is part of the national emergency and emergency policy of 2003 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.549
 and helps organize the care in the public network by providing 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:40.519
 population 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.379
 in cases of emergency 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.959
 only came to the municipality thanks to the support of the secretariat of health prefecture 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.049
 municipal 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.569
 but it has not been easy for these life-saving practitioners to 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.640
 population is when you ask people to 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.760
 he exists is destined to he arrived on the spot they find what the priority 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.289
 of that case 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:06.899
 given his family selma is a greater gravity I think we see the 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:09.719
 family of people with pain we will want to be taken care of the fastest 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.509
 possible but they have to understand that here is not the gravity inputs 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:16.309
 professional of this fine in another occurrence took time to arrive 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:17.809
 a little bit in the house 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:21.299
 and I said air ends up being and verbally assaulting voice it happened already 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.020
 sometimes here 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.280
 It will be complicated because we are here to help the shelf better. 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.580
 the population 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.250
 and I would just like the population to understand our work and so 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.510
 have something critical is something that makes us happy with the new 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.699
 service contact me look for us to be able to do 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.409
 improving our service adding the months of June July August and September 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.129
 about eight hundred and ninety-two occurrences 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.330
 were attended by samu 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.619
 in the most varied neighborhoods and also in the region 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.660
 more segment 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.850
 this care in the na in the drink because it is the dangers that beyond the agency occurs the 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.530
 people also have to help prevent it so I guess they just take care of the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.990
 excess alcohol with a solenzara scrub and things like that
