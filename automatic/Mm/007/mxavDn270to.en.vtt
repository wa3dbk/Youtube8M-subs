friendship 7 back in 1962 it was a tube

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.860 
friendship 7 back in 1962 it was a tube
of<00:00:34.559> applesauce<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.579> Zyliss<00:00:36.210> sugar<00:00:36.510> tablets

with water yuck

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.819 
with water yuck
at<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> time<00:00:39.450> NASA<00:00:39.629> had<00:00:39.899> no<00:00:40.050> idea<00:00:40.350> what<00:00:40.590> space

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
at the time NASA had no idea what space

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
at the time NASA had no idea what space
would<00:00:41.070> do<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> human<00:00:41.670> body<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.149> even<00:00:42.390> if

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
would do to the human body and even if

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.869 
would do to the human body and even if
it<00:00:42.719> was<00:00:42.840> possible<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.620> eat<00:00:43.800> food<00:00:44.160> while<00:00:44.730> in

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it was possible to eat food while in

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.490 
it was possible to eat food while in
zero<00:00:45.090> gravity<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.960> result<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
zero gravity the result of this

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.160 
zero gravity the result of this
experiment<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.520> yeah<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.930> eat<00:00:48.989> food

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
experiment you can yeah you can eat food

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.380 
experiment you can yeah you can eat food
though<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.160> consensus<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> food<00:00:51.210> was

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
though the consensus was that food was

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.180 
though the consensus was that food was
pretty<00:00:51.570> gross<00:00:51.809> space<00:00:52.350> food<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:52.770> reflects

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
pretty gross space food really reflects

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.310 
pretty gross space food really reflects
the<00:00:53.340> era<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> space<00:00:54.239> travel<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.960> NASA

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the era of the space travel as NASA

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.590 
the era of the space travel as NASA
learns<00:00:55.710> more<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.190> more<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.760> food<00:00:57.120> get

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
learns more and more we see the food get

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.119 
learns more and more we see the food get
better<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.079> better<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.500> problem<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:58.949> food

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
better and better the problem with food

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.160 
better and better the problem with food
in<00:00:59.399> zero-gravity<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.420> crumbs<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
in zero-gravity is that crumbs and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
in zero-gravity is that crumbs and
pieces<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.710> float<00:01:01.949> away<00:01:02.190> when<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:02.489> managed

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
pieces can float away when not managed

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.700 
pieces can float away when not managed
and<00:01:03.270> these<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.629> bits<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:04.170> mess<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and these little bits can mess up the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.550 
and these little bits can mess up the
equipment<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.280> even<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.729> inhaled

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
equipment and even be inhaled

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.960 
equipment and even be inhaled
accidentally<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.770> caused<00:01:08.070> choking<00:01:08.670> it's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
accidentally and caused choking it's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.730 
accidentally and caused choking it's
serious<00:01:09.299> business<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.170> started<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.560> this

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
serious business so we started with this

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.280 
serious business so we started with this
gross<00:01:11.010> tube<00:01:11.460> food<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.330> by<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.479> late<00:01:12.659> 60s<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
gross tube food but by the late 60s we

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.750 
gross tube food but by the late 60s we
had<00:01:13.320> freeze-dried<00:01:13.920> food<00:01:14.159> which<00:01:14.369> means<00:01:14.580> food

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
had freeze-dried food which means food

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.070 
had freeze-dried food which means food
that<00:01:14.909> was<00:01:15.000> cooked<00:01:15.150> packaged<00:01:15.659> too<00:01:15.780> quickly

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that was cooked packaged too quickly

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
that was cooked packaged too quickly
frozen<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.560> dried<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.310> all<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.460> had<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.580> do

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
frozen and dried so all you had to do

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.429 
frozen and dried so all you had to do
was<00:01:17.820> add<00:01:17.970> water<00:01:18.210> by<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.689> Apollo<00:01:19.020> mission<00:01:19.350> we

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
was add water by the Apollo mission we

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.440 
was add water by the Apollo mission we
had<00:01:19.560> rehydrated<00:01:20.250> food<00:01:20.490> came<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> bowl<00:01:21.270> with

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
had rehydrated food came in a bowl with

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.880 
had rehydrated food came in a bowl with
a<00:01:21.479> zipper<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> top<00:01:22.020> had<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.650> spoon

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
a zipper on the top had a little spoon

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.560 
a zipper on the top had a little spoon
and<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.549> wet<00:01:23.700> food<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.150> stick<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
and the wet food would stick to the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.820 
and the wet food would stick to the
spoon<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.110> didn't<00:01:25.290> float<00:01:25.439> away<00:01:25.650> as

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
spoon so it didn't float away as

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.770 
spoon so it didn't float away as
missions<00:01:26.400> got<00:01:26.610> longer<00:01:26.880> stretching<00:01:27.420> into<00:01:27.540> days

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
missions got longer stretching into days

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.999 
missions got longer stretching into days
and<00:01:27.990> weeks<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.290> couldn't<00:01:28.590> eat<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and weeks they couldn't eat out of a

astronauts<00:01:31.560> needed<00:01:31.860> more<00:01:32.130> calcium<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
astronauts needed more calcium and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.999 
astronauts needed more calcium and
vitamin<00:01:33.090> D<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.390> keep<00:01:33.570> their<00:01:33.720> bones<00:01:34.079> strong<00:01:34.770> in
