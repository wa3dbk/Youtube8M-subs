00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.910
 to know how to draw a mouth 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.110
 we will start with a sketch 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.610
 started by drawing a heart shape 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.450
 for the middle part of the lip 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.240
 higher 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.980
 from there trace the lines forming 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.040
 the upper lip then the lip 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.040
 lower 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.280
 now that you know how to make a 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.429
 sketch the bush does two points and 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:37.890
 draw a line between the two marks 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:41.999
 and the center of a point makes a point to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.239
 above and below draw the center 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:44.239
 superior 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.920
 the top of the heart corresponds to the features 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.570
 duo now like this is no longer a 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.440
 sketch the shape of the heart and a lot 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.440
 more rounded 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.979
 join both sides as these 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:20.570
 the two lines are slightly curved 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:23.229
 approaching both sides makes the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.229
 middle of the mouth 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.990
 do the bottom part in 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.990
 starting with the center 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.979
 now we already have a shape 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:03.300
 more concrete of the mouth make 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.300
 then all the lines of the lips 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.430
 [Music] 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.060
 see if it's as you go 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.330
 well master the contrasts and the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.330
 relief 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.990
 you have to draw a shadow on the part 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.120
 less than the junction of the part 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.339
 superior when the mouth close them 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.339
