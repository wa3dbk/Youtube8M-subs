00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.060
 totally bvb 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.870
 in duplicate with the telecom 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:16.020
 So super intense game for us 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.850
 anyway, of course, because of the 120th 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.020
 on Tuesday that's clear that now 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.970
 also used that some with 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 all you ask for a bit 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.090
 the possibility of such a game purely 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.230
 to find without of course passive too 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.220
 yes that was okay then okay 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.200
 opponent had to change over it still 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.430
 a bit more early long balls 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.390
 played purely in the front that was against the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.040
 hard for both big players 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.890
 we have done well there to defend 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.480
 but I solved myself in the four-chain 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.180
 had to spend a lot of money to run around 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.130
 to close the rooms someday 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.330
 does not bring the gate at that time 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.040
 I would wake up one hundred percent 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.860
 say that makes a lot of demands 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.550
 good but not so easy one too hard 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.880
 win the fight and make the compensation 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.770
 maybe two second half 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.490
 do not have to believe but do not count 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.189
 one or the other possibility 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.880
 of course for hope home and back out 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.350
 more and more opportunities have for us 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.490
 Both directions can go out 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 games do not always go in a tie 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.759
 but today it happened and after 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.229
 I can do that and I have to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.119
 even with the point that live no 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.149
 problem 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:34.799
 I wish you all the best and yes there 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.170
 I grab yet that this is going 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.819
 yes, but not as easy as 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.889
 have found today thank you very much 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.439
 then thank Markus Gisdol with the 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:45.020
 statement to the game 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.420
 yes, I think we have one today 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.719
 have seen an extraordinary game 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.950
 stadium has actually burned 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.889
 two teams saw each other 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.469
 have not given anything 

00:01:54.889 --> 00:02:01.079
 both have tried at any time 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.520
 to score goals and to play the game 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.189
 win 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.129
 Join us the first 60 70 minutes 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.450
 seen in the front if then the clear 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.709
 chances are not denied, though 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.690
 There man had there again and again 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.849
 still a dangerous situation for us 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.720
 defend 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.129
 despite all this in the chances 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.330
 rear house for dortmund a bit bigger 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.790
 become in the counter 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.170
 that's just unfair fast that 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.730
 It's almost impossible to defend 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.430
 when he starts and defends high 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.720
 That means we are aware of this risk 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.220
 but in spite of all that, I think 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.489
 both teams today actually one 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.690
 deserved victory and intensity 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.489
 of the game and we can today 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.560
 The main saying we have one 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.849
 very good performance from ours 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.360
 team and on this 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.950
 build performance so that we can with the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.920
 do not fulfill your wish 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.940
 that can give us a hold up 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.799
 Do everything that it does not succeed 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.329
 Thank you very much then your questions and 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:09.170
 please wait until the microphone 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.170
 they have the new one up front 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.560
 jÃ¼rgen the second half in particular 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.610
 was a spectacle for the audience like 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.080
 you experience it as a coach so apparently 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.310
 otherwise, because I do not have that anymore 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.319
 keeps I've noticed that so down 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.880
 and there goes from the spectacle I have 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.380
 now somehow if you have the 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.019
 installation inside had the feeling 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.640
 that we with increasing playing time the 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.440
 have found the right way 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.970
 I already said it the valve 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.130
 has risen the team has 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.630
 Properly to the actions the rowa had 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.830
 one also with it and has also again 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.170
 live properly brought in so 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.730
 Accordingly, as gamblers 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.350
 to lead where you did not see chance 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.330
 Reinmacht but as I said it was for 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.440
 Both sides keep coming up 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.640
 Both sides are hot and 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.290
 accordingly, even if we at the 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.640
 chances of the hoffheimer together 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.750
 have helped a bit more than 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.010
 she changes both ways with us 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.160
 played like we had it to 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.870
 maybe a shot in but 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.760
 everything was okay that was if it was 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.500
 I did not like people 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.989
 even like the game or you 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.959
 but also if the people enjoy 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.320
 also ok is not bad 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.549
 but it remains the draw is 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.450
 then we go to the second row 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.370
 tobias becker from radio rainbow gentleman 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.900
 gisdol how do you have the compensation 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.390
 at least I'm against it 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.419
 three hoffheimer through you to do so 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:37.720
 maybe what do you already say 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.720
 and what was 

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:44.959
 a regular goal 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.679
 it 's just seeing us mistress pulling nothing 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:53.009
 our offside rule is still there 

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:54.439
 that was off the beaten track 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.579
 There is nothing to discuss 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:59.459
 player is clearly in the offside 

00:04:56.579 --> 00:05:02.419
 and it's crucial now 

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:02.419
 not allowed to apply
