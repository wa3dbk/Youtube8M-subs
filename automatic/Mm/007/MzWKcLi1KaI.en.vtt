00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.820 
and an island of lost 3-1 to Croatia
which<00:00:21.750> could<00:00:22.050> have<00:00:22.140> been<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.289> little<00:00:22.439> bit<00:00:22.650> harsh

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
which could have been a little bit harsh

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.380 
which could have been a little bit harsh
bit<00:00:23.100> obviously<00:00:23.430> defensively<00:00:24.000> they<00:00:24.180> weren't

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
bit obviously defensively they weren't

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.150 
bit obviously defensively they weren't
that<00:00:24.539> good<00:00:24.720> owl<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.260> although<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:26.010> should

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
that good owl and although they should

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800 
that good owl and although they should
have<00:00:26.250> an<00:00:26.369> additional<00:00:27.029> avella<00:00:27.240> penalty<00:00:27.599> could

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
have an additional avella penalty could

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.970 
have an additional avella penalty could
have<00:00:27.930> got<00:00:28.050> them<00:00:28.170> back<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.470> game<00:00:28.680> except

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
have got them back in the game except

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.050 
have got them back in the game except
this<00:00:29.099> did<00:00:29.310> lose<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.699> they<00:00:29.789> probably

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
this did lose and they probably

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.299 
this did lose and they probably
deservedly<00:00:30.900> lose<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.470> well<00:00:31.619> no<00:00:31.800> offense<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
deservedly lose as well no offense to

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130 
deservedly lose as well no offense to
them<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:32.969> yeah<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.120> mean<00:00:33.239> Croatia<00:00:33.660> were<00:00:33.870> really

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
them but yeah I mean Croatia were really

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.270 
them but yeah I mean Croatia were really
good<00:00:34.260> attacking<00:00:34.500> outfit<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.980> don't<00:00:35.130> quite

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
good attacking outfit I don't quite

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.860 
good attacking outfit I don't quite
surprised<00:00:35.610> by<00:00:35.760> them<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.059> Island<00:00:36.450> defensive

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
surprised by them and Island defensive

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
surprised by them and Island defensive
will<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.170> seem<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.980> know<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:38.760> no

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
will just seem to you know there was no

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.639 
will just seem to you know there was no
defensive<00:00:39.270> solidity<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.050> has<00:00:40.170> been<00:00:40.379> in

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
defensive solidity like that has been in

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.979 
defensive solidity like that has been in
the<00:00:40.829> qualifying<00:00:41.219> round<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.870> quite

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
the qualifying round so and it's quite

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.779 
the qualifying round so and it's quite
an<00:00:43.110> interesting<00:00:43.320> game<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.890> yeah<00:00:44.399> we'll<00:00:44.640> move

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
an interesting game and yeah we'll move

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.610 
an interesting game and yeah we'll move
on<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.260> actually

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
on now to what I think will actually

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.400 
on now to what I think will actually
happen<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.160> game<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:48.170> you're<00:00:49.170> probably

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
happen in this game and you're probably

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.529 
happen in this game and you're probably
you're<00:00:49.739> probably<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.280> why<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.300> kid

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
you're probably like why is this kid

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.150 
you're probably like why is this kid
talking<00:00:51.840> about<00:00:52.140> he<00:00:52.230> knows<00:00:52.379> nothing<00:00:52.710> about

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
talking about he knows nothing about

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.709 
talking about he knows nothing about
football<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.239> all<00:00:54.390> finished

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
football but I think you all finished

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.170 
football but I think you all finished
1-1<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.070> don't<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:56.670> spain<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:57.059> go

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
1-1 because I don't think spain will go

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.369 
1-1 because I don't think spain will go
with<00:00:57.329> their<00:00:57.449> six<00:00:57.600> midfielders<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.199> think

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
with their six midfielders I think

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.599 
with their six midfielders I think
against<00:00:58.680> island<00:00:58.980> they<00:00:59.070> will<00:00:59.190> public<00:00:59.460> place

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
against island they will public place

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.150 
against island they will public place
striker<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.239> rent<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.109> or<00:01:01.260> Torres<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
striker to rent a or Torres on the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.210 
striker to rent a or Torres on the
grader<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.019> Kylie<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:05.010> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
grader and but I think I Kylie know that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.500 
grader and but I think I Kylie know that
they've<00:01:05.339> probably<00:01:05.580> got<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.360> as

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
they've probably got to go for it as

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.000 
they've probably got to go for it as
well<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.350> gonna<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.650> bit<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> an

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
well so it's gonna be a bit of an

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.920 
well so it's gonna be a bit of an
interesting<00:01:08.490> game<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.820> i<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
interesting game and I i think that the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.390 
interesting game and I i think that the
Irish<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.380> come<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> surprise<00:01:11.369> or

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
Irish will come up with a surprise or

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.890 
Irish will come up with a surprise or
two<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.450> they<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> good

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
two because I know that they are a good

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
two because I know that they are a good
team<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> team<00:01:14.310> gets<00:01:14.520> off

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
team and just because the team gets off

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.130 
team and just because the team gets off
to<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> bad<00:01:14.939> start<00:01:15.000> her<00:01:15.330> time<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.810> does<00:01:15.990> not

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
to a bad start her time that does not

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.080 
to a bad start her time that does not
mean<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.560> they<00:01:16.979> can't<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
mean that they can't actually go on and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.149 
mean that they can't actually go on and
you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.900> do<00:01:19.080> something<00:01:19.290> great<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.619> like

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you know do something great like like

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
you know do something great like like
for<00:01:20.340> example<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> world<00:01:21.210> cup<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
for example in the world cup I think it

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.399 
for example in the world cup I think it
was<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> world<00:01:22.470> cup<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:23.640> my<00:01:23.820> vineyard<00:01:24.020> 2012<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
was a world cup in my vineyard 2012 and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.649 
was a world cup in my vineyard 2012 and
Spain<00:01:25.799> did<00:01:26.040> lose<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.310> nil<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.759> Switzerland

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
Spain did lose one nil to Switzerland

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.390 
Spain did lose one nil to Switzerland
and<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.170> Switzerland<00:01:28.770> had<00:01:28.920> something

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and I think Switzerland had something

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
and I think Switzerland had something
like<00:01:29.549> twenty<00:01:30.030> percent<00:01:30.360> possession<00:01:30.930> didn't

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
like twenty percent possession didn't

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.810 
like twenty percent possession didn't
they<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.770> there's<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.070> much<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.790> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
they but there's so much to you know I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.240
