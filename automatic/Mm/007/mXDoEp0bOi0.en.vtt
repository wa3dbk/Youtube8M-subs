because it stores up that energy you're
not<00:02:20.350> wasting<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.800> all<00:02:20.860> in<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.040> front<00:02:21.220> like<00:02:21.610> you

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
not wasting it all in the front like you

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.240 
not wasting it all in the front like you
see<00:02:21.880> Brad<00:02:22.060> here<00:02:22.330> coming<00:02:22.690> off<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.930> side<00:02:23.250> lots

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
see Brad here coming off the side lots

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.040 
see Brad here coming off the side lots
of<00:02:24.340> reaction<00:02:24.760> down<00:02:24.910> there<00:02:25.090> boom<00:02:25.390> explosion

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
of reaction down there boom explosion

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.800 
of reaction down there boom explosion
just<00:02:26.470> breaks<00:02:27.160> off<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.580> spot<00:02:27.820> great<00:02:28.600> ball

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
just breaks off that spot great ball

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.400 
just breaks off that spot great ball
good<00:02:29.230> motion<00:02:29.470> solid<00:02:30.780> now<00:02:31.780> we<00:02:31.840> have<00:02:32.080> scoops

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
good motion solid now we have scoops

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.840 
good motion solid now we have scoops
himself<00:02:32.890> now<00:02:33.100> what<00:02:33.280> did<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.400> think<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.760> this

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
himself now what did you think of this

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.970 
himself now what did you think of this
ball<00:02:34.000> um<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.810> had<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.140> play<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.320> tiny<00:02:35.800> bit

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
ball um I had to play a tiny bit

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.880 
ball um I had to play a tiny bit
straighter<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.520> little<00:02:36.820> bit<00:02:36.940> tighter<00:02:37.890> great

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
straighter a little bit tighter great

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.590 
straighter a little bit tighter great
reaction<00:02:39.489> off<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> spot<00:02:40.030> though<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.450> can

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
reaction off the spot though you can

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.350 
reaction off the spot though you can
actually<00:02:40.900> see<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.650> ball<00:02:41.980> when<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.790> winds<00:02:43.270> up

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
actually see this ball when it winds up

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.930 
actually see this ball when it winds up
to<00:02:43.600> make<00:02:43.750> its<00:02:43.930> move<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.680> just<00:02:44.890> spins<00:02:45.580> up<00:02:45.820> in

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
to make its move it just spins up in

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.540 
to make its move it just spins up in
this<00:02:46.060> boom<00:02:46.360> just<00:02:47.140> explodes<00:02:47.890> off<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.190> spot

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
this boom just explodes off the spot

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.090 
this boom just explodes off the spot
with<00:02:48.670> energy<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.120> watch<00:02:49.410> multicolors<00:02:50.440> you

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
with energy if you watch multicolors you

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.010 
with energy if you watch multicolors you
just<00:02:51.280> watch<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.700> white<00:02:51.880> stripe<00:02:52.209> now<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.870> want

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
just watch that white stripe now I want

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.930 
just watch that white stripe now I want
to<00:02:53.050> get<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.200> little<00:02:53.290> wide<00:02:53.530> but<00:02:53.880> without<00:02:54.880> all

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
to get a little wide but without all

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.380 
to get a little wide but without all
energy<00:02:55.810> down<00:02:55.930> there<00:02:56.170> boom<00:02:56.440> great<00:02:57.220> reaction<00:02:57.760> so

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
energy down there boom great reaction so

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.790 
energy down there boom great reaction so
what<00:02:58.510> you're<00:02:58.630> saying<00:02:58.810> this<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.290> isn't<00:02:59.709> a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
what you're saying this this isn't a

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.410 
what you're saying this this isn't a
GoBot<00:03:00.100> this<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.370> actually<00:03:00.610> transformer<00:03:01.120> yeah

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
GoBot this is actually transformer yeah

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.350 
GoBot this is actually transformer yeah
yes<00:03:01.870> it's<00:03:02.110> definitely<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.470> transformer<00:03:03.040> it's

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
yes it's definitely a transformer it's

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.070 
yes it's definitely a transformer it's
definitely<00:03:04.360> more<00:03:04.510> than<00:03:04.660> meets<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.930> eye<00:03:05.020> with

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
definitely more than meets the eye with

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.040 
definitely more than meets the eye with
this<00:03:05.410> ball<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:06.430> was<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.239> GoBot<00:03:07.570> kid<00:03:07.810> when<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.020> was
