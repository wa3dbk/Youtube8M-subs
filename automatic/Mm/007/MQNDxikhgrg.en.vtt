00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.360
 Today, I'm Moritaka Music TV. 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.430
 Today is open code 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.990
 Auditorium for everyone 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.330
 I think I will remember first but with a guitar 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.070
 To use the form of the open code 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.660
 It's been a little bit more of code work 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.320
 It is a way of thinking 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.200
 I would like to explain it 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.960
 So also it'd Well open advanced 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:35.060
 First First Well I first is to do that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.210
 It is major code Major code that can be played with open code 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.620
 Though it is written while staying here as well 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.399
 Though it is meat d and suite え g 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.510
 I would like to take a look at those action forms first 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.820
 Oh dear 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.800
 From what point 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.890
 Because I think it is often the first to be quite minute advanced to play to buy a guitar 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.910
 I think Well it's familiar 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:05.500
 I think that I just learned the catfish fly 8 e 8 d like 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.570
 Hey its revenge or rather of confirmation also would like to little shaved description It is also serves as 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.980
 I'm sorry 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.409
 First of all 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.409
 Alright 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.409
 It's bad for nuclear power plants look at Iida this 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.070
 Have 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.070
 Two-person two-ring 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.870
 To 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.950
 First of all 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.180
 Right? 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.460
 Because it is an open structure , it becomes a nickname Jaguar structure that it should be reduced only three here 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.600
 Because this is good with this 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.890
 In this form 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.890
 It's a rat boom 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.670
 I usually but I do not keep of because it is part mat with 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.310
 This 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.820
 Please assume that you are tracking with your index finger 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.380
 Then to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.720
 Well though 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.030
 Falling wings to war Lou 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.600
 I think it will be in the same form as the code 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.710
 The current route is 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 It is an open chord of this 6 string because it is a code of 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:20.400
 In short , this open string is played using a pointing finger . 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.530
 It is said that this member is open and good 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.850
 Attract the form of the code 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.340
 Well Well, other than the open court 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.390
 For example, a bit higher fret 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.960
 To in 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.550
 It is a major code 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.300
 That it can be made is such a natural but 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.710
 Though it is such a story 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.880
 That 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:47.000
 Just look around any action dg g other than 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.920
 While checking one by one 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.099
 Well, if only this is not good thing 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.730
 You can play action in various positions by applying this for a while 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.250
 Because it will 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.250
 I want to explain it a bit
