that's<00:01:44.940> an<00:01:45.120> old<00:01:45.270> Chinese<00:01:45.900> proverb<00:01:45.930> saying<00:01:46.800> hot

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
that's an old Chinese proverb saying hot

and this is another good reason for

using cast iron or steel for that matter

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.380 
using cast iron or steel for that matter
rather<00:02:06.450> than<00:02:06.780> Teflon<00:02:07.590> or<00:02:07.620> nonstick<00:02:08.580> because<00:02:09.149> a
