make a little music of your very own
today<00:00:19.369> I'm<00:00:19.489> further<00:00:20.119> talking<00:00:20.659> about<00:00:20.869> the

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
today I'm further talking about the

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.679 
today I'm further talking about the
minor<00:00:21.890> pentatonic<00:00:22.159> scale<00:00:22.909> in<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.150> past<00:00:23.390> I

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
minor pentatonic scale in the past I

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.559 
minor pentatonic scale in the past I
talked<00:00:24.109> about<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.949> first<00:00:25.249> pattern<00:00:26.089> of<00:00:26.390> the

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:26.569 
talked about the first pattern of the

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.960 
talked about the first pattern of the
minor<00:00:26.869> pentatonic<00:00:27.140> scale<00:00:27.859> on<00:00:28.130> guitar<00:00:28.699> and

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
minor pentatonic scale on guitar and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.089 
minor pentatonic scale on guitar and
today<00:00:29.630> I<00:00:29.659> will<00:00:29.960> top<00:00:30.169> be<00:00:30.380> talking<00:00:30.739> about<00:00:30.859> the

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
today I will top be talking about the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.100 
today I will top be talking about the
second<00:00:31.729> pattern<00:00:32.029> or<00:00:32.180> second<00:00:32.509> position<00:00:32.930> as

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
second pattern or second position as

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.000 
second pattern or second position as
it's<00:00:33.680> called<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.450> you<00:00:35.450> can<00:00:35.660> if<00:00:35.900> you<00:00:36.320> play<00:00:36.560> the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
it's called and you can if you play the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.370 
it's called and you can if you play the
first<00:00:37.310> position<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:38.000> then<00:00:38.600> you<00:00:38.780> move<00:00:38.990> up<00:00:39.200> and

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
first position and then you move up and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.350 
first position and then you move up and
play<00:00:39.620> in<00:00:39.830> the<00:00:39.950> second<00:00:40.370> position<00:00:40.460> you're

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
play in the second position you're

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.560 
play in the second position you're
playing<00:00:41.720> in<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.050> same<00:00:42.530> key<00:00:43.370> that<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:44.150> were

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
playing in the same key that you were

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.350 
playing in the same key that you were
playing<00:00:45.350> in<00:00:45.650> the<00:00:45.680> first<00:00:46.160> position<00:00:46.310> so<00:00:47.120> this<00:00:47.240> is

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
playing in the first position so this is

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.080 
playing in the first position so this is
very<00:00:47.510> useful<00:00:47.630> for<00:00:48.160> taking<00:00:49.160> starting<00:00:49.790> out<00:00:49.940> and

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
very useful for taking starting out and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.940 
very useful for taking starting out and
playing<00:00:50.300> in<00:00:50.480> that<00:00:50.630> first<00:00:50.900> position<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.530> then

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
playing in that first position and then

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.100 
playing in that first position and then
moving<00:00:52.370> walking<00:00:53.120> your<00:00:53.270> way<00:00:53.300> up<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.720> fretboard

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
moving walking your way up the fretboard

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.319 
moving walking your way up the fretboard
to<00:00:54.950> get<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.130> different<00:00:55.280> sound<00:00:55.670> that<00:00:55.940> even<00:00:56.150> notes

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
to get a different sound that even notes

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.370 
to get a different sound that even notes
a<00:00:56.540> higher<00:00:56.720> sound<00:00:57.640> so<00:00:58.750> like<00:00:59.750> I<00:00:59.840> said<00:00:59.900> it<00:01:00.110> stays

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
a higher sound so like I said it stays

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.760 
a higher sound so like I said it stays
in<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.650> same<00:01:00.860> key<00:01:01.160> and<00:01:01.400> so<00:01:02.150> minor<00:01:02.770> minor

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
in the same key and so minor minor

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.039 
in the same key and so minor minor
pentatonic<00:01:04.189> scales<00:01:04.759> are<00:01:05.920> made<00:01:06.920> from<00:01:07.399> the

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
pentatonic scales are made from the

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.999 
pentatonic scales are made from the
natural<00:01:09.049> minor<00:01:09.560> scale<00:01:11.020> so<00:01:12.020> it's<00:01:12.590> kind<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:12.920> like

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
natural minor scale so it's kind of like

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.309 
natural minor scale so it's kind of like
the<00:01:13.130> traditional<00:01:13.539> minor<00:01:14.539> scale<00:01:14.990> there's

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
the traditional minor scale there's

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.459 
the traditional minor scale there's
minor<00:01:15.950> harmonic<00:01:16.249> scale<00:01:16.789> those<00:01:17.259> other<00:01:18.259> skills

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
minor harmonic scale those other skills

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.279 
minor harmonic scale those other skills
of<00:01:18.889> that<00:01:19.399> sort<00:01:19.729> but<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.509> traditional<00:01:21.020> minor

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
of that sort but the traditional minor

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.620 
of that sort but the traditional minor
scale<00:01:21.679> to<00:01:21.859> natural<00:01:22.310> minor<00:01:22.520> scale<00:01:22.639> is<00:01:23.420> what

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
scale to natural minor scale is what

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.340 
scale to natural minor scale is what
makes<00:01:23.840> up<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:24.409> minor<00:01:24.920> pentatonic<00:01:25.159> scale<00:01:25.759> and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
makes up the minor pentatonic scale and

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.800 
makes up the minor pentatonic scale and
as<00:01:27.369> pentatonic<00:01:28.369> suggests<00:01:28.939> there's<00:01:29.389> only<00:01:29.479> five

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
as pentatonic suggests there's only five

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.469 
as pentatonic suggests there's only five
notes<00:01:30.679> in<00:01:30.979> this<00:01:31.670> scale<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.799> out<00:01:33.799> of<00:01:34.069> the<00:01:34.219> minor

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
notes in this scale and out of the minor

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.770 
notes in this scale and out of the minor
the<00:01:35.479> natural<00:01:35.869> minor<00:01:36.049> scale<00:01:36.139> it's<00:01:36.709> the<00:01:37.459> one<00:01:38.179> the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
the natural minor scale it's the one the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.639 
the natural minor scale it's the one the
first<00:01:39.020> slow<00:01:39.560> root<00:01:39.770> note<00:01:40.009> first<00:01:40.850> third<00:01:41.659> fourth

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
first slow root note first third fourth

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.599 
first slow root note first third fourth
fifth<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:44.060> seventh<00:01:44.959> notes<00:01:45.399> from<00:01:46.399> this

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
fifth and seventh notes from this

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.169 
fifth and seventh notes from this
natural<00:01:47.090> minor<00:01:48.020> scale<00:01:48.170> which<00:01:49.039> makes<00:01:49.340> up<00:01:49.579> the

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
natural minor scale which makes up the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.849 
natural minor scale which makes up the
minor<00:01:50.630> pentatonic<00:01:50.899> scale<00:01:51.499> that<00:01:51.590> will<00:01:51.709> be

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
minor pentatonic scale that will be

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.129 
minor pentatonic scale that will be
talking<00:01:52.219> about<00:01:52.459> so<00:01:52.880> if<00:01:52.999> you<00:01:53.149> take<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.689> look<00:01:53.929> at

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
talking about so if you take a look at

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:57.399 
talking about so if you take a look at
if<00:01:54.469> you<00:01:54.619> start<00:01:54.829> out<00:01:54.950> in<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.249> a<00:01:56.409> minor

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
if you start out in the a minor

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.069 
if you start out in the a minor
pentatonic<00:01:58.100> scale<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.810> you're<00:01:59.899> gonna<00:01:59.990> have

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
pentatonic scale so you're gonna have

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:07.209 
pentatonic scale so you're gonna have
your<00:02:00.259> root<00:02:00.439> node<00:02:00.679> a<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.249> then<00:02:01.959> c<00:02:03.159> d<00:02:04.159> e<00:02:05.499> g<00:02:06.499> that's

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
your root node a and then c d e g that's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.910 
your root node a and then c d e g that's
the<00:02:07.369> first<00:02:07.609> third<00:02:07.969> fourth<00:02:08.420> fifth<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:09.470> set<00:02:09.770> of

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
the first third fourth fifth and set of

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.870 
the first third fourth fifth and set of
notes<00:02:10.160> from<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.030> natural<00:02:12.220> natural<00:02:13.220> harmonic

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
notes from the natural natural harmonic

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.900 
notes from the natural natural harmonic
scale

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
scale

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.290 
scale
okay<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.830> was<00:02:16.980> playing<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.940> first

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
okay so if I was playing the first

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.680 
okay so if I was playing the first
position<00:02:18.570> in<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:20.220> minor<00:02:20.880> pentatonic<00:02:21.120> scale

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
position in the minor pentatonic scale

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.020 
position in the minor pentatonic scale
for<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.020> minor<00:02:22.340> starting<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.610> fifth<00:02:23.880> fret

if<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:07.350> were<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.470> play<00:03:13.610> each<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.850> those<00:03:14.970> frets

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
if you were to play each of those frets

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.810 
if you were to play each of those frets
up<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.170> down<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.440> fretboard<00:03:16.620> they<00:03:17.490> wouldn't

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
up and down the fretboard they wouldn't

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.250 
up and down the fretboard they wouldn't
they<00:03:18.090> would<00:03:18.180> all<00:03:18.300> each<00:03:18.480> have<00:03:18.720> their<00:03:18.840> own<00:03:18.900> front

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
can actually you can start out in the a

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.409 
can actually you can start out in the a
minor<00:05:17.940> pentatonic<00:05:18.419> first<00:05:18.930> position<00:05:20.210> ok<00:05:21.210> and

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
minor pentatonic first position ok and

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.260 
minor pentatonic first position ok and
then<00:05:22.110> so<00:05:22.770> now<00:05:22.979> you're<00:05:23.460> playing<00:05:23.639> a<00:05:23.850> note<00:05:24.000> in<00:05:24.180> the

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
then so now you're playing a note in the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.170 
then so now you're playing a note in the
second<00:05:24.660> position<00:05:25.039> then<00:05:26.039> you<00:05:26.250> slide<00:05:26.669> up<00:05:26.699> to<00:05:27.090> the

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
second position then you slide up to the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.040 
second position then you slide up to the
next<00:05:27.419> note<00:05:28.070> okay<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.880> continue<00:05:30.570> playing<00:05:30.840> this

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
next note okay and continue playing this

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:40.790 
next note okay and continue playing this
position<00:05:38.090> ok<00:05:39.090> I<00:05:39.300> just<00:05:39.450> kind<00:05:39.900> of<00:05:39.930> move<00:05:40.470> up<00:05:40.650> and

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
position ok I just kind of move up and

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.620 
position ok I just kind of move up and
down<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:41.130> front<00:05:41.280> board<00:05:41.580> by<00:05:42.120> those<00:05:42.389> two

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
down the front board by those two

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.969 
down the front board by those two
positions<00:05:42.810> because<00:05:43.289> they<00:05:43.380> connect<00:05:43.680> like<00:05:43.860> a

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
positions because they connect like a

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.390 
positions because they connect like a
like<00:05:44.430> pieces<00:05:44.789> of<00:05:44.820> a<00:05:45.000> puzzle<00:05:45.210> ok<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:46.440> but<00:05:47.310> you

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
like pieces of a puzzle ok and but you

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.070 
like pieces of a puzzle ok and but you
can<00:05:47.580> play<00:05:47.729> this<00:05:47.940> the<00:05:48.270> second<00:05:48.630> position<00:05:48.750> all

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
can play this the second position all

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.270 
can play this the second position all
the<00:05:49.200> same<00:05:49.380> because<00:05:49.530> it<00:05:49.680> has<00:05:49.800> a<00:05:49.830> different

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
the same because it has a different

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.920 
the same because it has a different
overall<00:05:51.270> sound<00:05:52.200> than<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.270> first<00:05:54.270> position<00:05:54.570> it

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
overall sound than the first position it

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.640 
overall sound than the first position it
actually<00:05:55.260> sounds<00:05:55.770> pretty<00:05:56.220> good<00:05:56.669> in<00:05:57.320> like<00:05:58.320> 12

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.830 
actually sounds pretty good in like 12
bar<00:05:58.860> blues<00:05:58.889> progressions<00:05:59.880> that<00:06:00.180> sort<00:06:00.780> of

bar blues progressions that sort of

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.650 
bar blues progressions that sort of
thing<00:06:01.280> so<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.310> would<00:06:02.490> recommend<00:06:02.550> just<00:06:03.389> playing

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
thing so I would recommend just playing

around<00:06:03.780> going<00:06:04.680> from<00:06:04.800> the<00:06:04.979> first<00:06:05.220> position<00:06:05.490> to

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
around going from the first position to

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.659 
around going from the first position to

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840
