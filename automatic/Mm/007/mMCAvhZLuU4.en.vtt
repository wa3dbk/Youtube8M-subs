00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
season I mean a lot of people don't

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.460 
season I mean a lot of people don't
didn't<00:01:38.880> expect<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.810> he's<00:01:40.290> grown

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
didn't expect this but and he's grown

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
didn't expect this but and he's grown
absolutely<00:01:40.860> ham<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.130> La<00:01:41.280> Liga<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
absolutely ham in La Liga and this is

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.969 
absolutely ham in La Liga and this is
only<00:01:42.869> halfway<00:01:43.110> through<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> season<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.829> well

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
only halfway through the season as well

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.319 
only halfway through the season as well
so<00:01:44.100> he<00:01:44.220> could<00:01:44.399> quite<00:01:44.640> easily<00:01:44.670> finished<00:01:45.180> with

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
so he could quite easily finished with

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.109 
so he could quite easily finished with
25<00:01:45.930> plus<00:01:46.380> maybe<00:01:46.740> even<00:01:47.009> 30<00:01:47.189> goals<00:01:47.520> we'll<00:01:48.000> have

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
25 plus maybe even 30 goals we'll have

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.520 
25 plus maybe even 30 goals we'll have
to<00:01:48.270> wait<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:48.930> he<00:01:49.049> looks<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.380> you'll

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
to wait and see but he looks like you'll

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.289 
to wait and see but he looks like you'll
be<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.920> January<00:01:50.280> upgrade<00:01:50.579> I'm<00:01:51.000> thinking

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
be in for a January upgrade I'm thinking

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.730 
be in for a January upgrade I'm thinking
he<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.689> definitely<00:01:51.780> get<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.170> goal<00:01:52.380> because<00:01:52.649> of

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
he will definitely get a goal because of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.130 
he will definitely get a goal because of
course<00:01:52.950> how<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.850> upgrade<00:01:54.000> us<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.450> 74

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
course how can you upgrade us up 74

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.469 
course how can you upgrade us up 74
silver<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.189> only<00:01:56.430> move<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.820> him<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.360> can

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
silver you can only move in him you can

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.389 
silver you can only move in him you can
only<00:01:57.719> move<00:01:57.899> him<00:01:58.110> into<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> gold<00:01:58.710> category<00:01:59.159> and

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
only move him into the gold category and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.219 
only move him into the gold category and
I'm<00:01:59.670> thinking<00:01:59.909> he<00:02:00.149> could<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.479> quite<00:02:00.659> high<00:02:00.810> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
I'm thinking he could be quite high you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.870 
I'm thinking he could be quite high you
know<00:02:01.320> could<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.649> even<00:02:02.009> more<00:02:02.219> high<00:02:02.430> rated<00:02:02.729> than

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
know could be even more high rated than

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.880 
know could be even more high rated than
I've<00:02:03.000> predicted<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.560> you'll<00:02:04.710> stay

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
I've predicted but I think you'll stay

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.029 
I've predicted but I think you'll stay
like<00:02:05.189> 76<00:02:05.729> 77<00:02:06.240> maybe<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.780> don't<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:07.770> you'll<00:02:07.890> go

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
like 76 77 maybe I don't think you'll go

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.469 
like 76 77 maybe I don't think you'll go
too<00:02:08.280> far<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.729> than<00:02:09.149> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
too far up than that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.540 
too far up than that
and<00:02:09.659> moving<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.950> next<00:02:11.220> player<00:02:11.400> guys

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and moving on to the next player guys

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.440 
and moving on to the next player guys

him<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.580> banging<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.000> many<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.390> then<00:02:33.510> the

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
him to be banging this many and then the

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.660 
him to be banging this many and then the

him plus 10 shooting because you don't

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.059

upgrade<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.760> stature<00:03:06.150> but<00:03:06.510> um<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.930> think

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
upgrade of that stature but um I think

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.569 
upgrade of that stature but um I think
you'll<00:03:07.620> get<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:08.040> 72<00:03:08.819> or<00:03:09.120> 71<00:03:09.660> 73<00:03:10.230> may<00:03:10.500> TV<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:10.980> but

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
you'll get a 72 or 71 73 may TV and but

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.490 
you'll get a 72 or 71 73 may TV and but
you<00:03:11.790> know<00:03:11.910> his<00:03:12.299> inform<00:03:12.780> will<00:03:12.989> actually<00:03:13.319> go<00:03:13.470> up

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
you know his inform will actually go up

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.339 
you know his inform will actually go up
to<00:03:13.739> like<00:03:13.859> a<00:03:13.919> 74<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:14.790> i'm<00:03:15.690> pretty<00:03:16.019> sure<00:03:16.230> it's

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349

definitely think you will have an 80

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.779 
definitely think you will have an 80
rated<00:07:09.990> upgrade<00:07:10.320> for<00:07:10.530> coming<00:07:10.889> maybe<00:07:11.340> even<00:07:11.550> like

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:11.789 
rated upgrade for coming maybe even like

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:13.909

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 
an 81 or 82 card but I don't think it

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.740 
an 81 or 82 card but I don't think it
will<00:07:13.979> be<00:07:14.070> above<00:07:14.400> 80<00:07:14.580> to<00:07:14.789> read<00:07:15.000> so<00:07:15.479> I'm<00:07:15.570> going<00:07:15.720> to

stick with like an 80 or 282 rated card

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.240 
stick with like an 80 or 282 rated card
but<00:07:19.139> it<00:07:19.229> looks<00:07:19.380> like<00:07:19.470> a<00:07:19.590> truly<00:07:20.039> incredible

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250
