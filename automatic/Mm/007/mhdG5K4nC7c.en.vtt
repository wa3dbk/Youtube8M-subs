00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.140 

I'm<00:00:16.039> used<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.369> thinking<00:00:16.699> of<00:00:16.789> the<00:00:16.910> Ted<00:00:17.119> audience

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
I'm used to thinking of the Ted audience

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.179 
I'm used to thinking of the Ted audience
as<00:00:17.689> that<00:00:17.869> wonderful<00:00:18.349> collection<00:00:18.770> of<00:00:18.890> some<00:00:19.070> of

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
as that wonderful collection of some of

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.830 
as that wonderful collection of some of
the<00:00:19.279> most<00:00:19.430> effective<00:00:19.880> intelligent

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
the most effective intelligent

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.400 
the most effective intelligent
intellectual<00:00:22.480> savvy<00:00:23.480> worldly<00:00:24.230> and

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
intellectual savvy worldly and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.749 
intellectual savvy worldly and
innovative<00:00:24.919> people<00:00:25.099> in<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.369> world<00:00:25.520> and<00:00:25.700> I

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
innovative people in the world and I

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.750 
innovative people in the world and I
think<00:00:25.820> that's<00:00:26.090> true<00:00:26.390> however<00:00:27.199> I<00:00:27.830> also<00:00:28.369> have

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
think that's true however I also have

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.880 
think that's true however I also have
reason<00:00:28.970> to<00:00:29.119> believe<00:00:29.269> that<00:00:29.689> many<00:00:30.080> if<00:00:30.259> not<00:00:30.410> most

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
reason to believe that many if not most

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.220 
reason to believe that many if not most
of<00:00:31.130> you<00:00:31.279> are<00:00:31.970> actually<00:00:32.239> tying<00:00:32.720> your<00:00:32.900> shoes

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
of you are actually tying your shoes

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.420 
of you are actually tying your shoes
incorrectly<00:00:34.600> now<00:00:35.600> I<00:00:36.110> know<00:00:36.650> that<00:00:37.100> seems

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
incorrectly now I know that seems

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.310 
incorrectly now I know that seems
ludicrous<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:38.269> know<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:38.870> seems<00:00:39.110> ludicrous

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
ludicrous I know that seems ludicrous

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.100 
ludicrous I know that seems ludicrous
and<00:00:39.739> believe<00:00:40.309> me<00:00:40.519> I<00:00:40.550> lived<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.330> same<00:00:41.540> sad<00:00:41.839> life

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
and believe me I lived the same sad life

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.540 
and believe me I lived the same sad life
until<00:00:42.410> about<00:00:42.620> three<00:00:42.890> years<00:00:43.129> ago

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
until about three years ago

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.240 
until about three years ago
and<00:00:44.360> what<00:00:44.539> happened<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:44.960> me<00:00:45.140> was<00:00:45.860> I<00:00:45.890> bought

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
and what happened to me was I bought

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.340 
and what happened to me was I bought
what<00:00:46.730> was<00:00:46.850> for<00:00:47.059> me<00:00:47.210> a<00:00:47.239> very<00:00:47.329> expensive<00:00:47.840> pair<00:00:48.260> of

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
what was for me a very expensive pair of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.590 
what was for me a very expensive pair of
shoes<00:00:48.620> but<00:00:49.280> those<00:00:49.460> shoes<00:00:49.730> came<00:00:50.030> with<00:00:50.239> round

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
shoes but those shoes came with round

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.930 
shoes but those shoes came with round
nylon<00:00:51.260> laces<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.129> I<00:00:52.219> couldn't<00:00:52.460> keep<00:00:52.579> him<00:00:52.640> tied

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
nylon laces and I couldn't keep him tied

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.270 
nylon laces and I couldn't keep him tied
so<00:00:53.629> I<00:00:53.660> went<00:00:53.930> back<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.410> store<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:54.860> said<00:00:55.129> to

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
so I went back to the store and said to

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.010 
so I went back to the store and said to
the<00:00:55.370> owner<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:55.789> love<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.239> shoes<00:00:56.449> but<00:00:56.780> I<00:00:56.809> hate

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
the owner I love the shoes but I hate

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.319 
the owner I love the shoes but I hate
the<00:00:57.170> laces<00:00:57.530> he<00:00:58.160> took<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.399> look<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:58.820> said<00:00:59.059> oh

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
the laces he took a look and said oh

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.380 
the laces he took a look and said oh
you're<00:00:59.930> tying<00:01:00.170> him<00:01:00.320> wrong<00:01:00.609> now<00:01:01.609> up<00:01:01.879> until<00:01:02.059> that

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
you're tying him wrong now up until that

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.749 
you're tying him wrong now up until that
moment<00:01:02.600> I<00:01:03.019> would<00:01:03.410> have<00:01:03.530> thought<00:01:03.710> that<00:01:04.009> by<00:01:04.489> age

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
moment I would have thought that by age

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.690 
moment I would have thought that by age
fifty<00:01:05.239> one<00:01:06.110> of<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.590> life<00:01:06.830> skills<00:01:07.009> that<00:01:07.399> I<00:01:07.460> had

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
fifty one of the life skills that I had

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.499 
fifty one of the life skills that I had
really<00:01:08.030> nailed<00:01:08.420> was<00:01:09.020> tying<00:01:09.289> my<00:01:09.470> shoes<00:01:10.300> but<00:01:11.300> not

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
really nailed was tying my shoes but not

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.530 
really nailed was tying my shoes but not
so<00:01:11.840> let<00:01:12.289> me<00:01:12.380> demonstrate<00:01:14.619> this<00:01:15.619> is<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.159> way

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
so let me demonstrate this is the way

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.240 
so let me demonstrate this is the way
that<00:01:17.540> most<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.960> us<00:01:18.140> were<00:01:18.470> taught<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:18.740> tie<00:01:19.100> your

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
that most of us were taught to tie your

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.890 
that most of us were taught to tie your
shoes<00:01:22.299> now<00:01:23.299> as<00:01:23.479> it<00:01:23.630> turns<00:01:23.780> out<00:01:24.049> thank<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:25.900> but

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
shoes now as it turns out thank you but

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.609 
shoes now as it turns out thank you but
wait<00:01:27.079> there's<00:01:27.350> more<00:01:27.619> as<00:01:27.829> it<00:01:28.369> turns<00:01:28.610> out

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
wait there's more as it turns out

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.679 
wait there's more as it turns out
there's<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:30.740> strong<00:01:31.189> form<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.970> weak<00:01:32.180> form<00:01:32.540> of

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
there's a strong form and a weak form of

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.510 
there's a strong form and a weak form of
this<00:01:32.900> knot<00:01:33.079> now<00:01:33.650> we<00:01:33.799> were<00:01:33.920> taught<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.189> tie<00:01:34.460> the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
this knot now we were taught to tie the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.819 
this knot now we were taught to tie the
weak<00:01:34.790> form<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.299> here's<00:01:35.479> how<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.630> tell<00:01:35.900> if<00:01:36.350> you

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
weak form and here's how to tell if you

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.530 
weak form and here's how to tell if you
pull<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.250> strands<00:01:37.579> at<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.909> base<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.329> nut

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
pull the strands at the base of the nut

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.170 
pull the strands at the base of the nut
you<00:01:38.810> can<00:01:39.560> see<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.220> bow<00:01:40.430> will<00:01:40.790> orient

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
you can see that the bow will orient

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.210 
you can see that the bow will orient
itself<00:01:41.479> down<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.020> long<00:01:42.229> axis<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.950> shoe

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
itself down the long axis of the shoe

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.030 
itself down the long axis of the shoe
that's<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.240> weak<00:01:44.420> form<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.020> nut<00:01:45.229> but<00:01:45.860> not

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
that's the weak form of the nut but not

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.609 
that's the weak form of the nut but not
to<00:01:46.189> worry<00:01:46.840> if<00:01:47.840> we<00:01:48.140> start<00:01:48.500> over<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:50.259> simply<00:01:51.259> go

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
to worry if we start over and simply go

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.459 
to worry if we start over and simply go
the<00:01:51.770> other<00:01:52.009> direction<00:01:52.189> around<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.360> bow<00:01:53.509> we

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
the other direction around the bow we

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.190 
the other direction around the bow we
get<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.670> strong<00:01:55.969> form<00:01:56.390> of<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.719> knot<00:01:56.899> and

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
get this the strong form of the knot and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.499 
get this the strong form of the knot and
if<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.860> pull<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.490> cords<00:01:58.850> under<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.299> knot<00:01:59.479> you

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
if you pull the cords under the knot you

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.899 
if you pull the cords under the knot you
will<00:01:59.719> see<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:01.070> bow<00:02:01.219> Orient's<00:02:01.820> itself

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
will see that the bow Orient's itself

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.149 
will see that the bow Orient's itself
along<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.630> transverse<00:02:03.200> axis<00:02:03.469> of<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.979> shoe

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
along the transverse axis of the shoe

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.880 
along the transverse axis of the shoe
this<00:02:04.939> is<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.329> stronger<00:02:05.719> nut<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.500> will<00:02:06.680> come

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
this is a stronger nut it will come

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.310 
this is a stronger nut it will come
untied<00:02:07.280> less<00:02:07.610> often<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.479> will<00:02:08.660> let<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.049> down

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
untied less often it will let you down

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.120 
untied less often it will let you down
less<00:02:09.799> and<00:02:10.070> not<00:02:10.190> only<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.489> it<00:02:11.360> looks<00:02:11.660> better

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
less and not only that it looks better

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.460

we're<00:02:13.130> gonna<00:02:13.220> do<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:13.820> more<00:02:14.000> time<00:02:17.470> start

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
we're gonna do this one more time start

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.439 
we're gonna do this one more time start
as<00:02:18.650> usual<00:02:21.040> go<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.250> other<00:02:22.519> way<00:02:22.699> around<00:02:23.090> the

but<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.430> think<00:02:25.669> you<00:02:25.760> could<00:02:25.940> handle<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:28.720> pull<00:02:29.720> the

I'd like to point out and something you
