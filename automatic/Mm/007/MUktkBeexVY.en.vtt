actually another video on it right here

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.540 
actually another video on it right here
it<00:00:14.519> was<00:00:14.639> originally<00:00:15.150> built<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.809> Maria

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
it was originally built for the Maria

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.429 
it was originally built for the Maria
and<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.150> which<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.199> basically

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
and for what it is which is basically

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.260 
and for what it is which is basically
just<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.010> crappy<00:00:20.340> little<00:00:20.460> home-built<00:00:20.850> trailer

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
just a crappy little home-built trailer

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.420 
just a crappy little home-built trailer
it<00:00:21.570> actually<00:00:22.140> supports<00:00:22.650> quite<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> bit<00:00:23.310> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
it actually supports quite a bit of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.029 
it actually supports quite a bit of
weight<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.300> by<00:00:24.480> no<00:00:24.539> means<00:00:24.720> pretty<00:00:25.320> as<00:00:25.560> you

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
weight it is by no means pretty as you

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.730 
weight it is by no means pretty as you
can<00:00:26.189> see<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.580> built<00:00:26.910> out<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.359> mostly

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
can see it's built out of mostly

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.519 
can see it's built out of mostly
signposts<00:00:29.210> some<00:00:30.210> parts<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.599> galvanized<00:00:31.170> steel

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
signposts some parts of galvanized steel

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.639 
signposts some parts of galvanized steel
and<00:00:32.480> well<00:00:33.480> those<00:00:33.750> are<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.020> right<00:00:34.290> angle

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
and well those are just right angle

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
and well those are just right angle
brackets<00:00:35.579> there<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.090> are<00:00:36.210> axle<00:00:36.600> supports

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
brackets there that are axle supports

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.630 
brackets there that are axle supports
and<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.649> said<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.040> rear<00:00:38.190> axle<00:00:38.579> is

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and like I said the rear axle is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.450 
and like I said the rear axle is
actually<00:00:39.000> manufactured<00:00:39.510> by<00:00:39.870> me<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.469> uh<00:00:40.710> it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
actually manufactured by me it's uh it's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
actually manufactured by me it's uh it's
bushing<00:00:41.879> based<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> wheels<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.989> can

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
bushing based on the wheels but I can

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260 
bushing based on the wheels but I can
upgrade<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> bearings<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.850> want<00:00:45.090> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
upgrade it to bearings if I want to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.750 
upgrade it to bearings if I want to
which<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.200> might<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> upgrade

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
which I might actually do when I upgrade

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.729 
which I might actually do when I upgrade

it's kind of ugly it's very limited on
its<00:00:54.809> physical<00:00:55.260> capacity<00:00:55.800> what<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.219> carry

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

going to build this trailer exclusively

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.690 
going to build this trailer exclusively
for<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> sears<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.159> sheer<00:01:32.340> fact<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
for the sears for the sheer fact that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.300 
for the sears for the sheer fact that
the<00:01:32.850> sears<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.540> way<00:01:34.200> better<00:01:34.380> at<00:01:34.619> hauling<00:01:35.040> than

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the sears is way better at hauling than

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.399 
the sears is way better at hauling than
the<00:01:35.460> murray<00:01:35.640> ever<00:01:35.939> will<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.570> few<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the murray ever will be a few of the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.319 
the murray ever will be a few of the
major<00:01:37.650> changes<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.430> definitely<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.000> tires

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
major changes will definitely be tires

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.910 
major changes will definitely be tires
in<00:01:39.630> wheels<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.229> will<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.470> getting<00:01:40.650> bigger

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
in wheels it will be getting bigger

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
in wheels it will be getting bigger
tires<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.549> also<00:01:41.700> allow<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> roll<00:01:42.659> over

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
tires and we also allow it to roll over

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.590 
tires and we also allow it to roll over
obstacles<00:01:43.079> much<00:01:43.619> easier<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.880> frame<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.450> going

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
obstacles much easier the frame is going

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
obstacles much easier the frame is going
to<00:01:45.659> remain<00:01:45.869> generally<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.470> same<00:01:46.770> however<00:01:47.100> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
to remain generally the same however I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.399 
to remain generally the same however I
am<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.850> remove<00:01:48.090> much<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.990> upright

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
am going to remove much of the upright

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.429 
am going to remove much of the upright
support<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.640> draw-tite<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.689> assembly<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
support the draw-tite on assembly and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
support the draw-tite on assembly and
I'm<00:01:53.070> actually<00:01:53.280> going<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.759> replace<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
I'm actually going to replace it with a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
I'm actually going to replace it with a
more<00:01:54.750> traditional<00:01:54.979> Reese<00:01:55.979> hitch<00:01:56.280> assembly

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
more traditional Reese hitch assembly

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.969 
more traditional Reese hitch assembly
which<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.810> actually<00:01:58.170> recently<00:01:58.380> acquired

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
which I have actually recently acquired

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.569 
which I have actually recently acquired
and<00:01:59.430> I<00:02:00.210> believe<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.960> cut<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
and I believe I'm going to cut just this

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.330 
and I believe I'm going to cut just this
hitch<00:02:02.969> mount<00:02:03.240> off<00:02:03.860> I'm<00:02:04.860> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.189> rid<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
hitch mount off I'm going to get rid of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.010 
hitch mount off I'm going to get rid of
this<00:02:05.490> whole<00:02:05.670> bracket<00:02:06.180> right<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.840> just

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
this whole bracket right here and just

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.609 
this whole bracket right here and just
use<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.380> piece

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
use this piece

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.430 
use this piece
and<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:10.360> probably<00:02:10.810> going<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.200> mount

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
and that is probably going to mount

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.830 
and that is probably going to mount
right<00:02:12.099> in<00:02:12.310> here<00:02:12.730> I'm<00:02:12.940> going<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.330> most<00:02:13.690> likely

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
right in here I'm going to most likely

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.770 
right in here I'm going to most likely
cut<00:02:14.260> all<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.769> right<00:02:14.980> out<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.569> recess<00:02:16.569> the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
cut all of this right out and recess the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.330 
cut all of this right out and recess the
research<00:02:17.170> up<00:02:17.379> in<00:02:17.500> here<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:17.890> weld<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.220> in

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
research up in here and weld it in

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.240 
research up in here and weld it in
because<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.269> very<00:02:19.420> thick<00:02:19.750> steel<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.349> I

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
because this is very thick steel and I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.830 
because this is very thick steel and I
don't<00:02:21.459> want<00:02:21.610> anything<00:02:22.030> any<00:02:22.180> lower<00:02:22.420> than<00:02:22.540> this

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
don't want anything any lower than this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.250 
don't want anything any lower than this
bottom<00:02:23.230> plate<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.890> problem<00:02:24.310> right<00:02:24.489> now<00:02:25.260> with

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
bottom plate the problem right now with

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.059 
bottom plate the problem right now with
my<00:02:26.470> dual<00:02:27.569> shackle<00:02:28.569> clevis<00:02:29.049> I<00:02:29.290> figured<00:02:29.650> these

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
my dual shackle clevis I figured these

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.690 
my dual shackle clevis I figured these
are<00:02:30.220> exactly<00:02:30.640> called<00:02:30.970> but<00:02:31.810> if<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:33.459> have

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
are exactly called but if you have

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.160 
are exactly called but if you have
weight<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:34.659> trailer

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
weight in this trailer

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.009 
weight in this trailer
I<00:02:35.610> can't<00:02:36.610> disconnect<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:37.659> that<00:02:37.780> really

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
I can't disconnect it so that really

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.970 
I can't disconnect it so that really
sucks<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:39.129> having<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.360> ball<00:02:40.569> mount<00:02:40.780> on<00:02:41.109> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
sucks so having the ball mount on the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.030 
sucks so having the ball mount on the
research<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:43.540> this<00:02:43.660> heavy-duty<00:02:44.079> tube<00:02:44.739> steel

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
research with this heavy-duty tube steel

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.099 
research with this heavy-duty tube steel
and<00:02:45.220> all<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.910> going<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:46.959> way

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
and all that is going to be way

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.289 
and all that is going to be way
more<00:02:47.140> user-friendly<00:02:47.650> when<00:02:48.160> removing<00:02:48.879> it<00:02:49.120> with

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
more user-friendly when removing it with

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.539 
more user-friendly when removing it with
weight<00:02:49.510> inside<00:02:49.840> or<00:02:50.260> anything<00:02:50.799> like<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.099> and

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
weight inside or anything like that and

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.430 
weight inside or anything like that and
it<00:02:52.420> will<00:02:52.569> offer<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.870> good<00:02:53.049> amount<00:02:53.260> of

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
it will offer a good amount of

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.559 
it will offer a good amount of
maneuverability<00:02:53.950> maybe<00:02:54.879> not<00:02:55.060> as<00:02:55.180> much<00:02:55.390> is

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
maneuverability maybe not as much is

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.330 
maneuverability maybe not as much is
this<00:02:55.780> setup<00:02:56.290> but<00:02:56.829> it<00:02:56.920> should<00:02:57.069> still<00:02:57.190> have

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
this setup but it should still have

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.160 
this setup but it should still have
quite<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.760> good<00:02:58.000> amount<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.420> articulation

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
quite a good amount of articulation

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.110 
quite a good amount of articulation
between<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.709> tractor<00:03:00.069> in<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.400> trailer<00:03:00.909> for

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
between the tractor in the trailer for

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.970 
between the tractor in the trailer for
when<00:03:01.209> I'm<00:03:01.329> off-roading<00:03:01.780> off-roading<00:03:02.560> which

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
when I'm off-roading off-roading which

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.750 
when I'm off-roading off-roading which
is<00:03:03.159> basically<00:03:03.700> all<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.359> time<00:03:04.599> because<00:03:05.760> what

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
is basically all the time because what

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.830 
is basically all the time because what
have<00:03:06.849> I<00:03:06.940> ever<00:03:07.060> on<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.659> road<00:03:07.840> on<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.349> tractor

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
have I ever on the road on this tractor

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
minutes about what I'm going to do I'm

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.210 
minutes about what I'm going to do I'm
going<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.120> get<00:03:16.480> started<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:17.230> got<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.799> cut<00:03:17.980> all

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
going to get started I got to cut all

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.620 
going to get started I got to cut all
the<00:03:18.370> steel<00:03:18.579> off<00:03:18.819> this<00:03:18.970> thing<00:03:19.180> piece<00:03:19.419> by<00:03:19.599> piece

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
the steel off this thing piece by piece

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.990 
the steel off this thing piece by piece
because<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.230> reuse<00:03:20.950> all<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.430> steel<00:03:21.669> I<00:03:21.700> ever

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
because I reuse all the steel I ever

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.379 
because I reuse all the steel I ever
have<00:03:22.470> because<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.650> costs<00:03:23.919> money<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:25.269> know

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
have because it costs money and you know

00:03:25.389 --> 00:04:30.800 
have because it costs money and you know
I'm<00:03:25.629> not<00:03:25.810> made<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.019> money<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:27.269> here<00:03:28.269> we<00:03:28.359> go

left of the frame just to signposts my
custom<00:04:38.440> axle<00:04:43.169> and<00:04:44.760> I<00:04:45.760> guess<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.780> right<00:04:46.990> angle

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
custom axle and I guess the right angle

custom axle and I guess the right angle
corner<00:04:48.190> brackets<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:48.820> don't<00:04:49.090> really<00:04:49.210> know<00:04:49.389> the

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
corner brackets I don't really know the

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.940 
corner brackets I don't really know the
proper<00:04:49.780> name<00:04:49.930> for<00:04:49.960> them<00:04:50.290> but<00:04:50.500> that's<00:04:50.740> what

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
proper name for them but that's what

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.230 
proper name for them but that's what
supports<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.400> axle<00:04:51.790> it's<00:04:51.910> all<00:04:52.000> welded

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
supports the axle it's all welded

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.820 
supports the axle it's all welded
together<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:55.210> left<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.960> front<00:04:56.500> crock

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
together and I left the front crock

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:04.020 
together and I left the front crock
cross<00:04:57.280> piece<00:04:57.520> on<00:04:57.729> there<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:03.430> can<00:05:03.520> see<00:05:03.729> all<00:05:03.760> the

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
cross piece on there you can see all the

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.140 
cross piece on there you can see all the
scrap<00:05:04.630> metal<00:05:04.660> I<00:05:05.080> cut<00:05:05.590> off<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.919> thing<00:05:06.100> all<00:05:06.910> this

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
scrap metal I cut off the thing all this

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.969 
scrap metal I cut off the thing all this
is<00:05:07.300> galvanized<00:05:07.840> so<00:05:08.350> I'll<00:05:08.440> probably<00:05:08.560> just<00:05:08.770> get

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
is galvanized so I'll probably just get

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.659 
is galvanized so I'll probably just get
rid<00:05:09.100> of<00:05:09.160> that<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:11.560> is<00:05:11.710> steel<00:05:11.979> so<00:05:12.520> that's

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
rid of that this is steel so that's

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.760 
rid of that this is steel so that's
good<00:05:12.910> these<00:05:13.210> two<00:05:13.360> a<00:05:13.390> galvanized<00:05:13.960> it's<00:05:14.260> junk

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
good these two a galvanized it's junk

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.240 
good these two a galvanized it's junk
and<00:05:15.100> these<00:05:15.669> two<00:05:15.910> signposts<00:05:16.780> those<00:05:17.680> are<00:05:17.830> good

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
and these two signposts those are good

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.070 
and these two signposts those are good
so<00:05:18.760> I'll<00:05:18.850> keep<00:05:19.030> those<00:05:19.210> this<00:05:19.510> is<00:05:19.539> nice<00:05:19.840> tube

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
so I'll keep those this is nice tube

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.400 
so I'll keep those this is nice tube
steel<00:05:20.320> stick<00:05:20.919> wall<00:05:21.130> stuff<00:05:21.690> so<00:05:22.690> I'm<00:05:23.080> glad<00:05:23.200> I<00:05:23.320> got

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
steel stick wall stuff so I'm glad I got

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.650 
steel stick wall stuff so I'm glad I got
that<00:05:23.680> back<00:05:23.890> when<00:05:24.580> I<00:05:24.610> rebuild<00:05:25.030> this<00:05:25.180> thing<00:05:25.419> I

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
that back when I rebuild this thing I

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.110 
that back when I rebuild this thing I
will<00:05:26.470> be<00:05:26.590> rebuilding<00:05:27.070> it<00:05:27.250> with<00:05:27.490> stuff

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
will be rebuilding it with stuff

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.659 
will be rebuilding it with stuff
somewhere<00:05:28.510> like<00:05:28.780> this<00:05:29.410> like<00:05:30.010> square<00:05:30.430> tube

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
somewhere like this like square tube

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.650 
somewhere like this like square tube
steel<00:05:31.830> pretty<00:05:32.830> thick<00:05:33.039> wall<00:05:33.220> stuff<00:05:33.550> I<00:05:33.820> don't

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
steel pretty thick wall stuff I don't

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.510 
steel pretty thick wall stuff I don't
have<00:05:34.780> enough<00:05:35.169> of<00:05:35.350> it<00:05:35.440> here<00:05:35.830> to<00:05:36.039> do<00:05:36.190> everything

free<00:05:43.870> to<00:05:44.139> bounce<00:05:44.260> some<00:05:44.500> ideas<00:05:44.590> off<00:05:45.039> me<00:05:45.280> I've

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
free to bounce some ideas off me I've

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.700 
free to bounce some ideas off me I've
got<00:05:45.820> a<00:05:45.850> pretty<00:05:46.570> good<00:05:46.750> idea<00:05:46.900> as<00:05:47.169> to<00:05:47.260> what<00:05:47.470> I<00:05:47.500> want

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
to do with this trailer I know a lot of

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.870 
to do with this trailer I know a lot of
people<00:05:50.289> throw<00:05:50.590> in<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.770> quite<00:05:51.310> a<00:05:51.340> few<00:05:51.520> ideas<00:05:51.760> at

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
people throw in a quite a few ideas at

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.150 
people throw in a quite a few ideas at
me<00:05:51.970> already<00:05:52.240> some<00:05:52.539> people<00:05:52.570> want<00:05:53.020> to<00:05:53.289> actually

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
me already some people want to actually

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.240 
me already some people want to actually
see<00:05:54.550> this<00:05:54.639> become<00:05:54.970> like<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.150> flatbed<00:05:56.250> tractor

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
see this become like a flatbed tractor

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.950 
see this become like a flatbed tractor
recovery<00:05:57.729> trailer<00:05:58.210> so<00:05:58.360> I<00:05:58.419> could<00:05:58.600> like<00:05:58.720> park

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
recovery trailer so I could like park

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.510 
recovery trailer so I could like park
another<00:05:59.169> tractor<00:05:59.650> on<00:05:59.740> top<00:05:59.950> of<00:06:00.160> it<00:06:00.280> and<00:06:00.370> like

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
another tractor on top of it and like

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.060 
another tractor on top of it and like
tow<00:06:00.729> the<00:06:00.970> Murray<00:06:01.120> around<00:06:01.560> which<00:06:02.560> is<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:02.770> which

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
tow the Murray around which is a which

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.620 
tow the Murray around which is a which
is<00:06:03.190> actually<00:06:03.490> a<00:06:03.520> pretty<00:06:03.669> cool<00:06:03.760> concept<00:06:04.150> it's<00:06:04.570> a

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
is actually a pretty cool concept it's a

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.879 
is actually a pretty cool concept it's a
good<00:06:04.750> idea<00:06:04.870> but<00:06:06.750> relatively<00:06:07.750> useless<00:06:08.229> from<00:06:08.800> a

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
good idea but relatively useless from a

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.620 
good idea but relatively useless from a
functional<00:06:09.340> standpoint<00:06:09.550> I'm<00:06:10.030> never<00:06:10.300> going<00:06:10.539> to

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
functional standpoint I'm never going to

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.870 
functional standpoint I'm never going to
I'm<00:06:11.080> never<00:06:11.289> going<00:06:11.470> to<00:06:11.530> tow<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:12.700> Murray

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
I'm never going to tow the Murray

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.029 
I'm never going to tow the Murray
through<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.300> woods<00:06:13.510> with<00:06:13.659> the<00:06:13.780> Sears<00:06:14.080> I'm

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
through the woods with the Sears I'm

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:15.900 
through the woods with the Sears I'm
never<00:06:15.250> going<00:06:15.430> to<00:06:15.460> do<00:06:15.610> that

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
never going to do that

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.680 
never going to do that
so<00:06:16.270> I<00:06:17.220> don't<00:06:18.220> really<00:06:18.430> necessarily<00:06:18.790> want<00:06:19.450> to<00:06:19.540> go

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
so I don't really necessarily want to go

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.560 
so I don't really necessarily want to go
with<00:06:19.840> that<00:06:19.990> design<00:06:20.380> but<00:06:20.680> I<00:06:21.270> don't<00:06:22.270> think<00:06:22.450> it's

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
with that design but I don't think it's

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.450 
with that design but I don't think it's
going<00:06:22.660> to<00:06:22.750> be<00:06:22.840> a<00:06:22.870> dump<00:06:23.140> because<00:06:23.590> I<00:06:23.860> feel<00:06:24.430> like

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
going to be a dump because I feel like

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.340 
going to be a dump because I feel like
dump<00:06:24.910> making<00:06:25.390> dump<00:06:25.600> bodies<00:06:25.900> will<00:06:26.020> make<00:06:26.170> them

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
dump making dump bodies will make them

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.840 
dump making dump bodies will make them
weaker<00:06:26.710> so<00:06:26.950> I<00:06:26.980> don't<00:06:27.250> want<00:06:27.370> to<00:06:27.430> do<00:06:27.520> that<00:06:27.670> either

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
weaker so I don't want to do that either

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.000 
weaker so I don't want to do that either
yeah<00:06:28.390> I'm<00:06:28.510> gonna<00:06:28.600> keep<00:06:28.750> it<00:06:28.930> simple<00:06:28.960> I'm<00:06:29.890> going

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
yeah I'm gonna keep it simple I'm going

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.380 
yeah I'm gonna keep it simple I'm going
to<00:06:30.070> keep<00:06:30.190> the<00:06:30.280> center<00:06:30.550> of<00:06:30.640> gravity<00:06:30.700> relatively

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
to keep the center of gravity relatively

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.140
