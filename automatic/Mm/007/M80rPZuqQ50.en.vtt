make this smaller do whatever you want
just<00:01:58.229> make<00:01:58.710> sure<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.250> border<00:01:59.640> is<00:02:00.979> in<00:02:01.979> front<00:02:02.460> of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
just make sure the border is in front of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.670 
just make sure the border is in front of
your<00:02:02.880> video<00:02:03.920> not<00:02:04.920> behind<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.079> so<00:02:07.079> insert<00:02:07.530> your

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
your video not behind it so insert your

your video not behind it so insert your
photo<00:02:07.920> after<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.489> video<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.509> goes<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.840> top

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
photo after your video so it goes on top

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.710 
photo after your video so it goes on top
and<00:02:11.690> then<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.580> have<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.300> let<00:02:14.480> me<00:02:14.569> just

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
and then you have this so let me just

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.710 
and then you have this so let me just
shorten<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.230> video<00:02:15.470> for<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.739> second<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.599> know

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
shorten the video for a second so I know

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.070 
shorten the video for a second so I know
you<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:20.989> that<00:02:21.319> border<00:02:21.830> there<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.870> might

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
you have that border there and it might

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.559 
you have that border there and it might
be<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.260> little<00:02:24.530> too<00:02:24.769> thick<00:02:25.069> but<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:26.120> can<00:02:26.360> um

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
be a little too thick but you can um

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.229 
be a little too thick but you can um
change<00:02:27.110> that<00:02:27.379> later<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:28.519> other<00:02:28.880> thing<00:02:29.209> that

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
change that later one other thing that

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.270 
change that later one other thing that
you<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.569> do<00:02:29.720> is<00:02:29.930> stretch<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.410> out<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.739> bit<00:02:31.069> and

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
you can do is stretch this out a bit and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.839 
you can do is stretch this out a bit and
then<00:02:31.849> move<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:32.269> up<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.230> when<00:02:33.500> we<00:02:34.370> do<00:02:34.519> get<00:02:34.670> to

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
then move this up so when we do get to

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.479 
then move this up so when we do get to
the<00:02:34.880> one<00:02:35.180> part<00:02:35.420> in<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.690> tutorial<00:02:36.340> where<00:02:37.340> we

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the one part in the tutorial where we

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.140 
the one part in the tutorial where we
have<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:38.530> do<00:02:39.530> other<00:02:39.769> step<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.430> um<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.970> won't

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
have to do other step to it um it won't

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.210 
have to do other step to it um it won't
be<00:02:41.360> noticeable<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:42.410> might<00:02:42.590> not<00:02:42.769> understand

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
be noticeable you might not understand

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.440 
be noticeable you might not understand
at<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> moment<00:02:43.519> but<00:02:43.880> I'll<00:02:44.030> show<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.239> guys
