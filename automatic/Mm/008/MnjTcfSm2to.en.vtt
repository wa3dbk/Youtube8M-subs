half we won a lot of races we came

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.170 
half we won a lot of races we came
through<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.260> tried<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.340> know<00:00:17.400> chase<00:00:17.699> Dario

through we tried to you know chase Dario

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.910 
through we tried to you know chase Dario
down<00:00:18.449> who<00:00:18.630> had<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> massive<00:00:19.109> point<00:00:19.529> lead<00:00:19.740> midway

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
down who had a massive point lead midway

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.560 
down who had a massive point lead midway
through<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> season<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.029> come<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.390> that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
through the season and to come in that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 
through the season and to come in that
close<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.050> think<00:00:22.109> we're<00:00:22.410> maybe<00:00:23.130> eight<00:00:23.369> points

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
close I think we're maybe eight points

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.759 
close I think we're maybe eight points
out<00:00:23.910> or<00:00:24.119> ten<00:00:24.330> points<00:00:24.660> out<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.140> think<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.410> put<00:00:25.619> most

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
out or ten points out I think I put most

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.230 
out or ten points out I think I put most
of<00:00:25.949> our<00:00:26.039> my<00:00:26.310> memory<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.760> was<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.060> pretty

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
of our my memory it was a pretty

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.880 
of our my memory it was a pretty
stressful<00:00:27.510> time<00:00:28.730> we'd<00:00:29.730> lost<00:00:30.470> some<00:00:31.470> points<00:00:31.619> in

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
stressful time we'd lost some points in

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.479 
stressful time we'd lost some points in
Sonoma<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:34.410> was<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:34.860> common<00:00:35.070> think<00:00:35.370> it

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
Sonoma and it was really common think it

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.830 
Sonoma and it was really common think it
was<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> come<00:00:35.910> down<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.210> her

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
was going to come down to her

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.780 
was going to come down to her
I<00:00:36.870> think<00:00:37.350> won<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.710> last<00:00:37.890> race<00:00:38.190> between<00:00:38.399> score

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
I think won that last race between score

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
I think won that last race between score
and<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.660> literally<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:40.320> comes<00:00:40.559> down<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and I it literally all comes down to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.680 
and I it literally all comes down to
this<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.640> championship<00:00:42.149> could<00:00:42.570> be

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
this and this championship could be

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.529 
this and this championship could be
decided<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> final<00:00:43.469> lap<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.789> ring<00:00:45.059> we

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
decided on the final lap of this ring we

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.350 
decided on the final lap of this ring we
qualified<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.200> pole<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.760> car<00:00:47.969> was<00:00:48.149> very

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
qualified on pole and the car was very

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.770 
qualified on pole and the car was very
fast<00:00:49.430> in<00:00:50.430> practice<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.149> qualifying<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.750> I

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
fast in practice and qualifying but I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.510 
fast in practice and qualifying but I
went<00:00:51.960> off<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.680> start<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> race<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
went off the the start of the race and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.860 
went off the the start of the race and
it<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.789> wasn't<00:00:54.059> quite<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.600> speed

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it just wasn't quite right the speed

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.979 
it just wasn't quite right the speed
just<00:00:54.989> wasn't<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.989> target

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
just wasn't there and so the to target

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.229 
just wasn't there and so the to target
cars<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.770> two<00:00:58.949> Penske<00:00:59.579> cars<00:00:59.789> passed<00:01:00.030> me

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cars and the two Penske cars passed me

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
cars and the two Penske cars passed me
and<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> was<00:01:01.140> running<00:01:01.320> fit<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.800> knew

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and I think I was running fit so I knew

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.090 
and I think I was running fit so I knew
I<00:01:02.309> didn't<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.120> speech<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:04.470> my<00:01:04.769> own<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
I didn't have this speech on my own to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
I didn't have this speech on my own to
win<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> race<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.030> had<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.540> use<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
win the race so I had to just use the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.359 
win the race so I had to just use the
one<00:01:06.900> weapon<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.320> had<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:07.740> fuel<00:01:07.979> saving

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
one weapon I had which was fuel saving

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.390 
one weapon I had which was fuel saving

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
in Caribe on the last restart I made her

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730 
in Caribe on the last restart I made her
on<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.150> them<00:01:21.360> what's<00:01:21.659> his<00:01:21.810> outside<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
on one of them what's his outside but I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.289 
on one of them what's his outside but I
didn't<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.400> quite<00:01:23.549> enough<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> done

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
didn't have quite enough to get it done

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.609 
didn't have quite enough to get it done
so<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:24.630> sizing<00:01:24.840> him<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.170> trying<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> get<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
so I was sizing him up trying to get the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.140 
so I was sizing him up trying to get the
drafter<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> backstretch<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.000> last

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
drafter in the backstretch on that last

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.630 
drafter in the backstretch on that last
lap<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> could<00:01:28.770> make<00:01:29.220> happen<00:01:29.549> up

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
lap to see what I could make happen up

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.819 
lap to see what I could make happen up
the<00:01:29.820> lane<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.409> was<00:01:31.500> thinking

about<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.369> thinking<00:01:32.729> about<00:01:32.850> pulling

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
about it and just thinking about pulling

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.490 
about it and just thinking about pulling
out<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> make<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> move<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.930> run<00:01:34.079> out<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.229> fuel
