00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
pulling that up it looked like if that

hair<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.269> coming<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.039> my<00:00:29.039> forehead<00:00:29.429> so

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
hair is coming out of my forehead so

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.920 
hair is coming out of my forehead so
when<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.380> my<00:00:31.830> density<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.700> use<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.630> same

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
when I do my density I use the same

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.530 
when I do my density I use the same
needle<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> back<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> cap<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.700> use<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
needle in the back of the cap I use the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.299 
needle in the back of the cap I use the
same<00:00:36.840> needle<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> middle<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> cap

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
same needle in the middle of the cap

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.790 
same needle in the middle of the cap
then<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> use<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.329> smaller<00:00:39.930> needle<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> front

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
then I use a smaller needle in the front

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.940 
then I use a smaller needle in the front
of<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> cap<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.780> by<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.680> you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
of the cap so I don't go by a lot of you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.650 
of the cap so I don't go by a lot of you
go<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.340> lot<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.730> sites<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.210> they<00:00:45.300> say

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
go on a lot of these sites and they say

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.470 
go on a lot of these sites and they say
this<00:00:46.350> density<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.010> density<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.059> density

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
this density that density this density

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.770 
this density that density this density
that<00:00:48.600> density<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.530> am<00:00:50.600> self-operated<00:00:51.600> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that density I am self-operated and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.290 
that density I am self-operated and
self-taught<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.739> mean<00:00:53.370> my<00:00:53.640> visions<00:00:54.120> come

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
self-taught I mean my visions come

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.299 
self-taught I mean my visions come
different<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> way<00:00:55.980> other<00:00:56.219> people

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
different and then the way other people

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
hair but this is the front hairline of

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.980 
hair but this is the front hairline of
my<00:01:22.290> units<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> say<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.420> light

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
my units and like I say I do light

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.980 
my units and like I say I do light
density<00:01:25.590> around<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.970> front<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.869> I'm

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
density around the front but when I'm

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.399 
density around the front but when I'm
done<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.979> longer<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.689> more<00:01:31.020> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
done and the longer there is the more it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.580 
done and the longer there is the more it
weighs<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.390> 22<00:01:33.990> inches

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
weighs so like this is like 22 inches

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
weighs so like this is like 22 inches
because<00:01:35.280> his<00:01:35.610> hair<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.939> long<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:36.840> have

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
because his hair is long and I do have

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.800 
because his hair is long and I do have
to<00:01:37.320> fold<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.950> get<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.340> my<00:01:38.490> scale<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.180> would

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to fold it to get it in my scale I would

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.960 
to fold it to get it in my scale I would
say<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.350> my<00:01:40.500> way<00:01:40.740> seven<00:01:41.579> point<00:01:41.880> three

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
