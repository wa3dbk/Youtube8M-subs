anything's changed my mind for good or
worse<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.600> all<00:03:50.600> that<00:03:50.750> kind<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:50.960> stuff<00:03:51.020> so

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
worse and all that kind of stuff so

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.420 
worse and all that kind of stuff so
that's<00:03:51.650> pretty<00:03:51.830> much<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.010> gist<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.340> the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
that's pretty much the gist of the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.510 
that's pretty much the gist of the
series<00:03:52.790> or<00:03:53.050> video<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.350> guess<00:03:54.560> it's<00:03:54.740> a<00:03:54.830> soft

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
series or video I guess it's a soft

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.640 
series or video I guess it's a soft
synonymous<00:03:56.030> but<00:03:56.600> either<00:03:56.780> way<00:03:56.990> let<00:03:57.440> me<00:03:57.530> know

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
synonymous but either way let me know

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.070 
synonymous but either way let me know
what<00:03:57.740> you<00:03:57.860> guys<00:03:57.980> think<00:03:58.460> about<00:03:58.730> project<00:03:59.390> SOS<00:03:59.870> I

right<00:04:28.860> before<00:04:29.009> I'm<00:04:29.190> did<00:04:29.520> this<00:04:29.580> narration<00:04:29.880> so

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
right before I'm did this narration so

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.779 
right before I'm did this narration so
definitely<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.800> quality<00:04:32.250> person<00:04:32.460> in<00:04:32.699> my

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
definitely a quality person in my

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.719 
definitely a quality person in my
opinion<00:04:33.090> um<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.770> honest<00:04:35.100> perhaps<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.610> only

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
opinion um to be honest perhaps the only

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.040 
opinion um to be honest perhaps the only
negative<00:04:36.150> thing<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.360> could<00:04:36.509> say<00:04:36.539> about<00:04:36.870> him

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
negative thing you could say about him

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.800 
negative thing you could say about him
is<00:04:37.110> he<00:04:37.259> does<00:04:37.410> have<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.620> bit<00:04:37.740> of<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.919> lisp<00:04:38.190> but<00:04:38.810> I

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
is he does have a bit of a lisp but I

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.180 
is he does have a bit of a lisp but I
really<00:04:40.169> don't<00:04:40.320> think<00:04:40.410> that<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:40.919> enough

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
really don't think that that is enough

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.840 
really don't think that that is enough
to<00:04:41.370> discredit<00:04:42.360> him<00:04:42.720> from<00:04:42.960> any<00:04:43.080> of<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.850> very

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
to discredit him from any of the very

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.700 
to discredit him from any of the very
true<00:04:45.210> words<00:04:45.449> that<00:04:45.690> I've<00:04:45.810> spoken<00:04:46.380> on<00:04:46.590> his
