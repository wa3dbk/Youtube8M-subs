 what material is better to buy a tube 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.850
 from briar 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.190
 it is more durable and as a result 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.500
 durable everything else leave on 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.199
 time when you will clearly represent 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.539
 yourself what and why do you need the very first 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.789
 tube should be briar what are you 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.609
 Briard read the link given in

 description of the video how to disassemble 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.829
 smoking pipe for this pipe 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.129
 must be cooled just recoverable 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.260
 doctor's pieces it clockwise fiber stream 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.600
 Briars a man with a drill in this 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.360
 direction and if we rotate 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.760
 counterclockwise we can them 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 raise may eventually result in 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.440
 jamming the mouthpiece and maybe not 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.050
 lead but this is not the case as well 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.760
 worth the risk 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.330
 how often do you need to clean the smoking room 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.180
 a tube 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.880
 the pipe is cleaned after each smoking 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.330
 before that it should cool down and only 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.060
 after that the tube can be disassembled 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.100
 whether to wash a smoking pipe 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.470
 there is no everyday life sometimes 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.120
 need to clean the tobacco chamber 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.310
 moisture toothbrush if you 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.240
 recovering old very confusing 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.710
 the tube is usually the same with regular care 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.540
 good enough cleaning trubachymi 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.790
 ruffs 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.490
 how and which side to insert the filter in 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.680
 tube in which side to insert 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.200
 filter in the smoking pipe absolutely 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.690
 there is no difference insert filter 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.299
 any ends until easy click after 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.430
 which collect tube rotate the mouthpiece 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.040
 how often do you need to change the filter in the tube 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.100
 the filter changes during cleaning after 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.860
 each smoking tube burned gave 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.319
 cool down a little and then disassemble it and 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.870
 remove the filter 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.450
 what to do if tobacco is planted 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.970
 of course you can put all the charms 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.930
 taste you will not return but tobacco will 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.510
 quite chicken 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.550
 especially since there is not always a choice 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.060
 especially if we are talking about those tobacco 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.470
 mixtures that have not been produced for a long time 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.630
 tobacco moistening issues 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.420
 we will dedicate a separate video and article 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.380
 if you friends will consider it necessary 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.470
 vote in the comments is it possible to dry 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.180
 pipe smoking in the sun is not in 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.160
 first sharp uneven heating 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.890
 wood can bring to her 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.530
 damage or at least cusack during 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.350
 second ebonite mouthpieces burn out on 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.450
 the sun was oxidized if you dry the bowl on 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.400
 the sun without two pieces and then you can get 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.560
 the result when we pieces just 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.700
 will cease to be inserted into a tube why 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.600
 this is my tube changing color why and how 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.540
 fight it 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.610
 this is normal and even inevitably masonry 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.709
 briar you and tubes without varnish and black 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.079
 finish sooner or later becomes 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.150
 one color soaking new than 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.799
 lighter natural finish tube themes 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.660
 noticed a change in color 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.820
 but in the end all smooth tubes at 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.609
 regular smoking becomes the same 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.700
 even green blue if they are not covered 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:34.000
 varnish what to do if the handset is strong 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.709
 heats up while smoking experimenting with 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.690
 packing density towards it 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.030
 decrease 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.640
 working on you smoking pipe should 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.160
 be a little warm don't make sharp and 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.540
 deep puffs and do not seek to squeeze 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.150
 out of the tube more smoke 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.490
 smoke and slowly and calmly and not 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.530
 scary if the tube go out the same 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.660
 Tips are valid for those cases when 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.660
 tube chicken too wet 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.580
 that's probably all for today if you 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.430
 think that some questions are necessary 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.890
 light in more detail write about this in 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.930
 comments you can also ask your 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.600
 questions and I will try to answer 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.700
 most frequent interesting here thanks
