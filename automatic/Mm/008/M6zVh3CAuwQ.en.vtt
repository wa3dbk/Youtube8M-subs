color<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.600> towards<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.200> bottom<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.829> here

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
color so towards the bottom of it here

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550 
color so towards the bottom of it here
you're<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> writing

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you're going to see that the writing

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.929 
you're going to see that the writing
really<00:01:40.829> does<00:01:40.979> their<00:01:41.220> leiden<00:01:41.579> does<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.909> very

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
really does their leiden does get very

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.030 
really does their leiden does get very
bright<00:01:42.450> very<00:01:42.479> sufficient<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.470> far<00:01:43.829> as<00:01:44.009> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
bright very sufficient as far as a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.620 
bright very sufficient as far as a
nighttime<00:01:44.520> seeing<00:01:44.970> especially<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.600> have

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
nighttime seeing especially if you have

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.660 
nighttime seeing especially if you have
a<00:01:45.750> set<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.049> transparent<00:01:46.560> key<00:01:46.649> caps<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
a set of transparent key caps on it's a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.789 
a set of transparent key caps on it's a
bit<00:01:47.820> difficult<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> also<00:01:49.470> comes

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
bit difficult to see but it also comes

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.969 
bit difficult to see but it also comes
with<00:01:49.890> different<00:01:50.570> lighting<00:01:51.570> zones<00:01:52.350> which<00:01:52.829> I

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
with different lighting zones which I

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.740 
with different lighting zones which I
demonstrate<00:01:53.490> here<00:01:53.700> not<00:01:53.909> very<00:01:54.119> well<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.329> decided

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
demonstrate here not very well I decided

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.260 
demonstrate here not very well I decided
with<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> camera<00:01:55.290> over<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.740> now<00:01:56.149> but<00:01:57.149> with

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
with the camera over right now but with

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.670 
with the camera over right now but with
these<00:01:57.390> different<00:01:57.780> lighting<00:01:57.930> zones<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.530> have

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
these different lighting zones you have

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.319 
these different lighting zones you have
different<00:01:58.860> gaming<00:01:59.189> zones<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.729> are<00:01:59.790> preset

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
different gaming zones that are preset

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.030 
different gaming zones that are preset
so<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.770> full

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
so as you can see you have your full

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.160 
so as you can see you have your full
keyboard<00:02:02.490> lit<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:03.030> WASD<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.990> some

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
keyboard lit just WASD and some

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.319 
keyboard lit just WASD and some
modifiers<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:05.490> several<00:02:05.700> different<00:02:06.060> really

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
different game styles depending on what

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.700 
different game styles depending on what
sorts<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.080> games<00:02:13.230> you

sorts of games you

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.840 
sorts of games you
now<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.550> do<00:02:14.820> not<00:02:15.480> believe<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.220> cross<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
now I do not believe you can cross the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.880 
now I do not believe you can cross the
lighting<00:02:18.150> zones<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.170> fading<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.620> believe

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
lighting zones with the fading I believe

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.380 
lighting zones with the fading I believe
you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.160> either<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.490> one<00:02:20.520> or<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.120> other<00:02:21.150> but

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
you can either have one or the other but

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.270 
you can either have one or the other but
you<00:02:21.630> cannot<00:02:21.840> have<00:02:22.110> only<00:02:22.350> some<00:02:22.710> letting<00:02:23.040> zones

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
you cannot have only some letting zones

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.230 
you cannot have only some letting zones
with<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.880> fading<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.550> next<00:02:26.610> shot<00:02:27.090> I

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
with the fading so for this next shot I

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.420 
with the fading so for this next shot I
do<00:02:27.300> apologize<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.110> advance<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.650> very<00:02:28.860> dusty
