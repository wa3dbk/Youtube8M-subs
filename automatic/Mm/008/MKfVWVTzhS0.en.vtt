00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
review of the warrior method shoulder

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.299 
review of the warrior method shoulder
pad<00:00:09.840> I'm<00:00:10.170> they've<00:00:10.500> gone<00:00:10.650> ahead<00:00:10.799> and<00:00:10.920> made<00:00:11.040> some

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
pad I'm they've gone ahead and made some

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.459 
pad I'm they've gone ahead and made some
updates<00:00:11.520> on<00:00:11.850> this<00:00:11.940> guy<00:00:12.120> from<00:00:12.360> last<00:00:12.570> year<00:00:12.900> so

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
updates on this guy from last year so

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.109 
updates on this guy from last year so
they've<00:00:13.590> done<00:00:13.709> a<00:00:13.740> nice<00:00:13.950> job<00:00:14.010> on<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.639> I'm

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:15.119 
they've done a nice job on it I'm

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.400 
they've done a nice job on it I'm
starting<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.539> the<00:00:15.600> front<00:00:15.809> portion<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
starting on the front portion of this

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.290 
starting on the front portion of this
they<00:00:16.830> actually<00:00:17.010> have<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> different<00:00:18.030> design

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
they actually have a different design

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.910 
they actually have a different design
here<00:00:18.539> they've<00:00:18.869> gone<00:00:18.990> ahead<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.289> segmented

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
here they've gone ahead and segmented

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.169 
here they've gone ahead and segmented
these<00:00:20.130> pieces<00:00:20.429> so<00:00:20.759> that's<00:00:20.880> going<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.029> offer

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.179 
these pieces so that's going to offer

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:22.609 
these pieces so that's going to offer
some<00:00:21.570> better<00:00:21.779> mobility<00:00:22.109> which<00:00:22.500> I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
some better mobility which I

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.829 
some better mobility which I
particularly<00:00:23.099> like<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.519> also<00:00:24.179> can<00:00:24.359> see<00:00:24.570> here

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:24.839 
particularly like you also can see here

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.240 
particularly like you also can see here
how<00:00:24.960> they<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.259> those<00:00:25.410> segments<00:00:26.009> going

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
how they have those segments going

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.429 
how they have those segments going
across<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.390> that's<00:00:27.509> going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> also<00:00:28.169> increase

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
across so that's going to also increase

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.710 
across so that's going to also increase
the<00:00:28.560> mobility<00:00:29.119> taking<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.210> look<00:00:30.419> on<00:00:30.660> how

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the mobility taking a look on how

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.530 
the mobility taking a look on how
they've<00:00:31.410> binded<00:00:31.980> these<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:33.060> it's<00:00:33.329> kind<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
they've binded these is one it's kind of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.790 
they've binded these is one it's kind of
nice<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.840> these<00:00:33.990> they<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.290> some<00:00:34.440> nylon

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
nice on these they have some nylon

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.920 
nice on these they have some nylon
webbing<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.190> actually<00:00:35.610> allow<00:00:35.700> slide<00:00:36.390> movement

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
webbing to actually allow slide movement

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.020 
webbing to actually allow slide movement
between<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.560> then<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> middle<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.850> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
between and then in the middle of it you

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.760 
between and then in the middle of it you
have<00:00:39.150> some<00:00:39.360> elastic<00:00:39.870> material<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.620> that's

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
have some elastic material so that's

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.350 
have some elastic material so that's
also<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.280> let<00:00:41.400> it<00:00:41.430> stretch<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:42.000> well<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
also going to let it stretch as well and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.540 
also going to let it stretch as well and
increase<00:00:42.720> that<00:00:42.900> mobility<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.620> as<00:00:44.280> far<00:00:44.310> as

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
increase that mobility of it as far as

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.010 
increase that mobility of it as far as
protection<00:00:44.910> goes<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.420> front<00:00:45.600> portion

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
protection goes in this front portion

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380 
protection goes in this front portion
you<00:00:46.740> have<00:00:46.920> some<00:00:47.190> basically<00:00:47.820> single<00:00:48.240> density

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you have some basically single density

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
you have some basically single density
foams<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> outside<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.650> it<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.460> going

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
foams on the outside of it so it's going

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.470 
foams on the outside of it so it's going
to<00:00:50.640> give<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.000> increased

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
to give you a little increased

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.390 
to give you a little increased
protection<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:52.950> going<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.130> be<00:00:53.220> more

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
protection but that's going to be more

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.160 
protection but that's going to be more
focused<00:00:53.580> on<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.880> mobility<00:00:54.330> portion<00:00:54.720> and<00:00:54.870> then

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
focused on the mobility portion and then

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.210 
focused on the mobility portion and then
you're<00:00:55.290> going<00:00:55.380> to<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.500> some<00:00:55.800> dents<00:00:56.040> or

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
you're going to have some dents or

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.680 
you're going to have some dents or
materials<00:00:56.610> down<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> sternum<00:00:57.330> to<00:00:57.480> give<00:00:57.630> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
materials down the sternum to give you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.240 
materials down the sternum to give you
that<00:00:57.840> increased<00:00:58.260> protection<00:00:58.410> where<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.100> need

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that increased protection where you need

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
that increased protection where you need
it<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> little<00:00:59.490> bit<00:00:59.670> more<00:00:59.880> going<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.900> to<00:01:01.080> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
it a little bit more going on to the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.160 
it a little bit more going on to the
side<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:02.310> can<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.490> here<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.570> shoulder<00:01:03.990> cap

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
side you can see here the shoulder cap

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.299 
side you can see here the shoulder cap
design<00:01:04.350> they're<00:01:04.619> using<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> nice<00:01:05.070> sized

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
design they're using a nice sized

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.440 
design they're using a nice sized
shoulder<00:01:05.670> cap<00:01:05.850> give<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.180> some<00:01:06.330> protection

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
shoulder cap give you some protection

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.290 
shoulder cap give you some protection
from<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> front<00:01:07.259> as<00:01:07.409> well<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.160> back<00:01:08.400> also

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
from the front as well as the back also

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.360 
from the front as well as the back also
on<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.810> bicep<00:01:10.020> guard<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.130> some

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
on the bicep guard you have some

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.640 
on the bicep guard you have some
plastics<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> plastic<00:01:12.990> inserts<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:13.560> as

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
plastics and plastic inserts in there as

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.680 
plastics and plastic inserts in there as
well<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:14.100> well<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> foams<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
well as well as the foams on it and you

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.940 
well as well as the foams on it and you
can<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.230> that<00:01:16.260> they<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.860> an

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
can see here that they do have an

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.190 
can see here that they do have an
adjustable<00:01:17.310> design<00:01:17.730> on<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.120> which<00:01:18.900> i<00:01:19.050> also

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
adjustable design on it which i also

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.320 
adjustable design on it which i also
like<00:01:19.530> its<00:01:19.710> elastic<00:01:20.340> material<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.970> it's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
like its elastic material and it's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
like its elastic material and it's
velcro<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.200> actually

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
velcro here so you can actually

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.640 
velcro here so you can actually
determine<00:01:22.830> how<00:01:23.190> far<00:01:23.490> down<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.380> bicep<00:01:25.380> guards

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
determine how far down that bicep guards

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.320 
determine how far down that bicep guards
going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> come<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.760> it's<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.210> can

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
going to come so it's going to you can

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.149 
going to come so it's going to you can
really<00:01:27.510> make<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.870> customized<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> elbow

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159

this portion you have some nice thick
high-density<00:01:35.700> foam<00:01:36.120> is<00:01:36.270> right<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.600> these

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
high-density foam is right there these

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.260 
high-density foam is right there these
have<00:01:37.470> also<00:01:37.860> been<00:01:38.010> segmented<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.030> see

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
so that's going to allow it to wrap

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.440 
so that's going to allow it to wrap

far<00:02:50.010> up<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.209> nice<00:02:51.359> feature<00:02:51.540> does

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
far up so that's a nice feature does

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.020 
far up so that's a nice feature does
have<00:02:52.290> some<00:02:52.470> good<00:02:52.890> size<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.640> though<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:53.940> you

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
have some good size to it though so you

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.610 
have some good size to it though so you
can<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.390> does<00:02:54.510> kind<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.780> overlap<00:02:55.230> onto<00:02:55.409> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
can see it does kind of overlap onto the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.830 
can see it does kind of overlap onto the
front<00:02:55.950> as<00:02:56.129> well<00:02:56.609> as<00:02:56.760> on<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:56.970> back<00:02:57.209> portion<00:02:57.540> of

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
front as well as on the back portion of

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.809 
front as well as on the back portion of
it<00:02:58.019> but<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.739> do<00:02:58.799> like<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.129> it<00:02:59.250> doesn't<00:02:59.280> rise<00:02:59.609> up

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
it but I do like that it doesn't rise up

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.759 
it but I do like that it doesn't rise up
to<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.690> doesn't<00:03:01.019> kind<00:03:01.139> of<00:03:01.230> hinder<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.650> at

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769
