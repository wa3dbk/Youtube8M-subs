00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.780 
terrifying even if you're driving around
that<00:03:09.440> course<00:03:09.709> is<00:03:09.860> pretty<00:03:09.980> terrifying<00:03:10.489> doing

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
that course is pretty terrifying doing

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.809 
that course is pretty terrifying doing
on<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:10.940> motorbike<00:03:11.390> as<00:03:11.959> you<00:03:12.110> say<00:03:12.290> at<00:03:13.010> over<00:03:13.310> 100<00:03:13.670> ma

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
on a motorbike as you say at over 100 ma

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.430 
on a motorbike as you say at over 100 ma
on<00:03:14.060> 8<00:03:14.269> miles<00:03:14.570> an<00:03:14.720> hour's<00:03:14.900> an<00:03:15.049> average<00:03:15.320> speed

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
on 8 miles an hour's an average speed

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.710 
on 8 miles an hour's an average speed
around<00:03:15.680> there<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.489> it's<00:03:16.970> pretty<00:03:17.239> pretty

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
around there it is it's pretty pretty

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.380 
around there it is it's pretty pretty
it's<00:03:18.709> very<00:03:18.920> tiring<00:03:19.220> very<00:03:19.430> stressful<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.150> think

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
it's very tiring very stressful I think

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.210 
it's very tiring very stressful I think
it<00:03:20.660> flattens<00:03:21.110> me<00:03:21.260> now<00:03:21.500> watching<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.100> know

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
it flattens me now watching you know

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.039 
it flattens me now watching you know
just<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.640> think<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.940> can't<00:03:23.360> believe<00:03:23.570> I<00:03:23.600> did<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.870> at

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
just I think I can't believe I did it at

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.750 
just I think I can't believe I did it at
all<00:03:24.170> speeds<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:24.739> I'm<00:03:24.980> sure<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.370> always<00:03:25.519> looks

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
all speeds but I'm sure it always looks

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.789 
all speeds but I'm sure it always looks
worse<00:03:25.850> watching<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.600> actually<00:03:26.870> doing<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.230> but

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
worse watching and actually doing it but

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.560 
worse watching and actually doing it but
when<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.040> did<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.280> lap<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:28.940> remember<00:03:29.420> that

when you did that lap I remember that
lap<00:03:29.870> you'll<00:03:30.079> think<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.290> was<00:03:30.320> on<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.590> Suzuki

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
lap you'll think it was on the Suzuki

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.319 
lap you'll think it was on the Suzuki
maybe<00:03:31.400> when<00:03:31.519> you<00:03:31.610> did<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.910> lap<00:03:32.120> with<00:03:32.299> a

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
it it was a blood I mean now a camera

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.380 
it it was a blood I mean now a camera
would<00:04:12.130> be<00:04:12.160> no<00:04:12.430> bigger<00:04:12.700> than<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.850> ballpoint<00:04:13.209> pen

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
would be no bigger than a ballpoint pen

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.510 
would be no bigger than a ballpoint pen
absolutely<00:04:14.230> with<00:04:14.410> it<00:04:14.530> he<00:04:14.830> put<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.010> bum<00:04:15.220> bag<00:04:15.400> on

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
me it wasn't easy and a sound engineer

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.870 
me it wasn't easy and a sound engineer
and<00:04:26.770> her<00:04:26.860> record<00:04:27.160> is<00:04:27.340> sticky<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.820> back
