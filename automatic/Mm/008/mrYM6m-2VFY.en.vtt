particular they do have different shapes

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.799 
particular they do have different shapes
I've<00:00:37.739> seen<00:00:38.040> different<00:00:38.190> shapes<00:00:38.610> Plan<00:00:38.910> B's<00:00:41.809> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
I've seen different shapes Plan B's the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.150 
I've seen different shapes Plan B's the
nose<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.260> tail<00:00:43.410> were<00:00:43.590> out<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> little<00:00:43.920> bit<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
nose and tail were out a little bit of a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.940 
nose and tail were out a little bit of a
different<00:00:44.460> height<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.820> tail<00:00:45.590> actually<00:00:46.590> on

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
different height the tail actually on

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.819 
different height the tail actually on
this<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:48.180> particular<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.410> tail<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
this one in particular the tail was a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.819 
this one in particular the tail was a
little<00:00:49.980> bit<00:00:50.070> bulkier<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.000> sanded<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.600> down

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
little bit bulkier but I sanded it down

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.260 
little bit bulkier but I sanded it down
made<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> little<00:00:53.010> bit<00:00:53.160> point<00:00:53.430> here<00:00:53.610> cuz<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.090> don't

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
made a little bit point here cuz I don't

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.580 
made a little bit point here cuz I don't
really<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> capes<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.110> my<00:00:55.199> board<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
really like the capes on my board to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.910 
really like the capes on my board to
have<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> whole<00:00:56.100> lot<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.460> bulk<00:00:56.670> till<00:00:57.890> and<00:01:00.739> on<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
have a whole lot of bulk till and on the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.690 
have a whole lot of bulk till and on the
tail<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:03.030> about<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.300> medium<00:01:03.719> kick<00:01:03.960> height<00:01:04.700> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
tail it's about a medium kick height the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.870 
tail it's about a medium kick height the
rocker<00:01:07.700> was<00:01:08.700> about<00:01:09.000> medium<00:01:10.729> distance<00:01:11.729> from

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
rocker was about medium distance from

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640 
rocker was about medium distance from
them<00:01:12.030> where<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> base<00:01:12.960> plate<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.380> your<00:01:13.470> truck

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
them where the base plate of your truck

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.109 
them where the base plate of your truck
would<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.280> where<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> kick<00:01:14.700> actually

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
would be to where the kick actually

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.149 
would be to where the kick actually
starts<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.530> it's<00:01:19.530> not<00:01:19.590> too

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
starts it's about there so it's not too

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.910 
starts it's about there so it's not too
much<00:01:20.340> room<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> got<00:01:21.750> some<00:01:22.080> room<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.619> lock

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
much room like you got some room to lock

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.429 
much room like you got some room to lock
in<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.700> tail<00:01:24.060> slides<00:01:26.840> but<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> whole<00:01:28.259> lot

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
in on tail slides but not a whole lot

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.469 
in on tail slides but not a whole lot
but<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.670> mounting<00:01:29.970> holes<00:01:30.150> aren't

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
but it's not the mounting holes aren't

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.850 
but it's not the mounting holes aren't
too<00:01:30.630> close<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> tail<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.560> where<00:01:31.710> your

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
too close to the tail to where your

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.270 
too close to the tail to where your
boards<00:01:32.220> gonna<00:01:32.369> feel<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:33.240> high<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:34.439> lot

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
boards gonna feel really high a lot

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.460 
boards gonna feel really high a lot
higher<00:01:35.549> than<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.000> really<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.439> when<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
higher than what it really is when you

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.130 
higher than what it really is when you
go<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> pop<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.540> also<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.720> gives<00:01:39.810> attention

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
go to pop and also that gives attention

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140 
go to pop and also that gives attention
when<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.560> go<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.710> pop<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.640> makes<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.000> feel

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
when you go to pop which makes it feel

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.690 
when you go to pop which makes it feel
higher<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.009> also<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.310> mounting<00:01:44.549> holes

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
higher and also the mounting holes

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.280 
higher and also the mounting holes
aren't<00:01:44.939> too<00:01:45.060> far<00:01:45.299> away<00:01:45.479> from<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.780> kicks<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
aren't too far away from the kicks to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
aren't too far away from the kicks to
where<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.369> board<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> feel<00:01:48.060> super

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
where your board is going to feel super

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
where your board is going to feel super
low<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.189> you're<00:01:50.210> gonna<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.479> issues<00:01:51.860> with<00:01:52.860> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
low and you're gonna have issues with it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.389 
low and you're gonna have issues with it
being<00:01:53.340> too<00:01:53.670> responsive<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:56.149> on<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.420> nose<00:01:58.399> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
being too responsive and on the nose the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.139 
being too responsive and on the nose the
nose<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.640> slightly<00:02:00.240> higher<00:02:00.659> than<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.229> tail<00:02:02.149> it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
nose is slightly higher than the tail it

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.910 
nose is slightly higher than the tail it
is<00:02:05.270> not<00:02:06.270> much<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.659> difference<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.320> still<00:02:07.710> say

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
is not much of a difference I still say

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.059 
is not much of a difference I still say
it's<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> medium<00:02:09.060> range

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.360 

and<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:13.569> rocker<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.319> little<00:02:14.739> bit<00:02:14.860> different

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and the rocker is a little bit different

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.229 
and the rocker is a little bit different
on<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.569> nose<00:02:17.040> from<00:02:18.040> where<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.760> bass<00:02:18.970> play<00:02:19.209> the

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
on the nose from where the bass play the

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.580 
on the nose from where the bass play the
truck<00:02:19.569> would<00:02:19.720> end<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.230> where<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.439> kick

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
truck would end to where the kick

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.869 
truck would end to where the kick
actually<00:02:20.950> starts<00:02:21.370> there's<00:02:21.549> a<00:02:21.610> little<00:02:21.790> bit

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
actually starts there's a little bit

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.960 
actually starts there's a little bit
more<00:02:22.060> space<00:02:22.799> so<00:02:23.799> more<00:02:24.099> room<00:02:24.280> for<00:02:24.459> no<00:02:24.579> slides

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
more space so more room for no slides

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.630 
more space so more room for no slides
and<00:02:27.450> with<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.629> being<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:29.409> little<00:02:29.950> bit<00:02:30.400> higher

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
and with it being a little bit higher

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.149 
and with it being a little bit higher
than<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:31.030> tail<00:02:31.269> but<00:02:32.110> with<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.829> mounting

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
than the tail but with the mounting

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.059 
than the tail but with the mounting
holes<00:02:33.340> being<00:02:34.239> back<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.569> little<00:02:34.930> bit<00:02:35.079> more<00:02:35.319> on

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
holes being back a little bit more on

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.890 
holes being back a little bit more on
the<00:02:36.280> nose<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.849> makes<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.269> feel<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.510> same<00:02:37.720> as

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the nose it makes it feel the same as

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.780 
the nose it makes it feel the same as
the<00:02:38.019> tail<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.859> balances<00:02:39.340> out<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:42.099> quality<00:02:42.609> I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
the tail it balances out the quality I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.630 
the tail it balances out the quality I
put<00:02:43.390> on<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.659> deck<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.739> really<00:02:45.099> nice<00:02:45.280> I

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
put on this deck it's really nice I

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.390 
put on this deck it's really nice I
really<00:02:45.819> only<00:02:46.329> got<00:02:46.540> one<00:02:46.930> ship<00:02:47.260> just<00:02:48.190> right

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
really only got one ship just right

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.369 
really only got one ship just right
there<00:02:48.579> on<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.760> tail<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.150> nothing<00:02:49.900> major<00:02:50.079> at

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
there on the tail it's nothing major at

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.930 
there on the tail it's nothing major at
all<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.930> didn't<00:02:53.260> ship<00:02:53.709> easily<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.700> was<00:02:54.909> a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
all it didn't ship easily this was a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.479 
all it didn't ship easily this was a
really<00:02:55.389> solid<00:02:55.659> deck<00:02:56.109> it<00:02:56.379> felt<00:02:56.739> very<00:02:56.829> solid

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
really solid deck it felt very solid

with the other thing I really did too

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.800 
with the other thing I really did too
many<00:03:03.519> big<00:03:03.849> gaps<00:03:04.120> with<00:03:04.450> it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
many big gaps with it

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.979 
many big gaps with it
though<00:03:05.170> but<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:06.459> did<00:03:06.700> feel<00:03:06.909> strong<00:03:07.239> for<00:03:07.569> sure

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
though but it did feel strong for sure

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.930 
though but it did feel strong for sure
felt<00:03:08.319> pretty<00:03:08.379> strong<00:03:11.430> quality<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.549> Maples

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
felt pretty strong quality of the Maples

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.539 
felt pretty strong quality of the Maples
good<00:03:13.209> they're<00:03:14.170> epoxy<00:03:14.799> didn't<00:03:15.159> have<00:03:15.340> any

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
good they're epoxy didn't have any

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.640 
good they're epoxy didn't have any
problems<00:03:16.299> with<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.540> D<00:03:16.720> lambing<00:03:17.169> at<00:03:17.349> all<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:20.230> I

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
problems with the D lambing at all and I

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.900 
problems with the D lambing at all and I
would<00:03:20.769> have<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:20.980> say<00:03:21.099> that<00:03:21.280> was<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> great<00:03:21.579> deck

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
would have to say that was a great deck

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.580 
would have to say that was a great deck
I<00:03:22.120> enjoyed<00:03:22.660> skiing<00:03:22.930> as<00:03:23.139> planned<00:03:23.410> Dean<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:25.590> but

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
I enjoyed skiing as planned Dean and but

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.220 
I enjoyed skiing as planned Dean and but
there<00:03:26.769> is<00:03:26.859> one<00:03:27.699> thing<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.150> reason<00:03:28.480> why<00:03:28.599> I<00:03:28.720> just

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
there is one thing the reason why I just

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.960 
there is one thing the reason why I just
stopped<00:03:29.440> skating<00:03:29.739> it<00:03:30.069> because<00:03:30.579> as<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.819> can

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
stopped skating it because as you can

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.550 
stopped skating it because as you can
see<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:31.269> still<00:03:31.449> in<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.660> condition<00:03:32.139> to<00:03:32.410> where

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
see it's still in the condition to where

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.770 
see it's still in the condition to where
it<00:03:32.620> can<00:03:32.739> still<00:03:32.980> be<00:03:33.010> skated<00:03:33.519> for<00:03:34.209> sure<00:03:34.389> like<00:03:34.629> it

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
it can still be skated for sure like it

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.589 
it can still be skated for sure like it
has<00:03:34.959> razortail<00:03:35.410> pretty<00:03:36.280> bad<00:03:36.489> but<00:03:37.329> it's<00:03:37.449> not

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
has razortail pretty bad but it's not

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.800 
has razortail pretty bad but it's not
too<00:03:37.840> bad<00:03:38.049> but<00:03:38.459> what<00:03:39.459> happened<00:03:39.879> was<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.720> it

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
too bad but what happened was is that it

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.059 
too bad but what happened was is that it
feels<00:03:40.989> really<00:03:41.260> soggy<00:03:41.680> but<00:03:42.519> that<00:03:43.030> wasn't<00:03:43.449> like

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
feels really soggy but that wasn't like

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.220 
feels really soggy but that wasn't like
really<00:03:48.389> that<00:03:49.389> was<00:03:49.540> my<00:03:49.569> fault

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
really that was my fault

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.970 
really that was my fault
of<00:03:50.489> Hawaii<00:03:51.489> got<00:03:51.730> soggy<00:03:52.060> in<00:03:52.449> the<00:03:53.169> wintertime<00:03:53.500> if

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
of Hawaii got soggy in the wintertime if

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.930 
of Hawaii got soggy in the wintertime if
you<00:03:54.099> live<00:03:54.250> somewhere<00:03:54.459> where<00:03:54.669> it's<00:03:54.819> really

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
you live somewhere where it's really

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.520 
you live somewhere where it's really
cold<00:03:56.190> it's<00:03:57.190> not<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.150> good<00:03:58.540> idea<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.290> keep<00:03:59.470> your

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
cold it's not a good idea to keep your

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.180 
cold it's not a good idea to keep your
board<00:03:59.829> out<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.690> your<00:04:01.690> car<00:04:01.989> or<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:02.980> garage

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
board out in your car or in the garage

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.970 
board out in your car or in the garage
because<00:04:04.180> what<00:04:04.750> happens<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.530> overnight

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
because what happens is that overnight

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.000 
because what happens is that overnight
it<00:04:06.370> gets<00:04:06.519> even<00:04:06.819> colder<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.650> with<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.829> deck

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
it gets even colder and with that deck

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.789 
it gets even colder and with that deck
freezing<00:04:09.639> there<00:04:10.629> is<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.780> moisture<00:04:11.049> that<00:04:11.620> will

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
freezing there is a moisture that will

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.129 
freezing there is a moisture that will
build<00:04:12.040> up<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.489> then<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.120> will<00:04:13.239> soak<00:04:13.599> into<00:04:13.840> the

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
build up and then it will soak into the

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.949 
build up and then it will soak into the
wood<00:04:14.699> causing<00:04:15.699> your<00:04:15.790> board<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.299> fill<00:04:16.539> very

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
wood causing your board to fill very
