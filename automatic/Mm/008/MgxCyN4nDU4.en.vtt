00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.520 
to strain them and make them look
vintagey<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.189> also<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.899> glossy

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
vintagey and also if you have glossy

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.130 
vintagey and also if you have glossy
back<00:01:52.740> cards<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.000> put<00:01:54.299> pan<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.659> them<00:01:54.840> or<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
back cards if you put pan on them or a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.530 
back cards if you put pan on them or a
sharpie<00:01:55.619> or<00:01:55.770> whatever<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.310> might<00:01:56.939> smudge<00:01:57.329> off

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
sharpie or whatever it might smudge off

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.639 
sharpie or whatever it might smudge off
and<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> lot<00:01:58.290> harder<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and it's going to be a lot harder to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.380 
and it's going to be a lot harder to
write<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.100> them<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.790> will<00:01:59.850> kind<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.240> make

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
write on them so this will kind of make

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.649 
write on them so this will kind of make
them<00:02:00.600> more<00:02:00.750> papery<00:02:01.490> now<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.790> left<00:02:03.479> them<00:02:03.630> in

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
them more papery now I left them in

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.020 
them more papery now I left them in
about<00:02:04.350> three<00:02:04.740> minutes<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.219> then<00:02:05.640> put<00:02:05.759> them<00:02:05.909> on

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
about three minutes and then put them on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.080 
about three minutes and then put them on
towels<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.630> dry<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.429> what<00:02:08.429> happened<00:02:08.849> was<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
towels to dry and what happened was a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.520 
towels to dry and what happened was a
lot<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.420> them<00:02:09.599> ends<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:09.869> sticking<00:02:10.229> together

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
lot of them ends up sticking together

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.890 
lot of them ends up sticking together
and<00:02:11.099> ripping<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.379> luckily<00:02:13.379> for<00:02:13.560> me

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
and ripping and luckily for me

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.509 
and ripping and luckily for me
I<00:02:13.930> ended<00:02:14.079> up<00:02:14.200> liking<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.590> look<00:02:14.829> because<00:02:15.189> it

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
I ended up liking the look because it

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.339 
I ended up liking the look because it
only<00:02:15.700> happened<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.239> couple<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.689> them<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.290> I

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
only happened to a couple of them and I

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.660 
only happened to a couple of them and I
just<00:02:17.530> kind<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.709> made<00:02:17.829> it<00:02:17.920> more<00:02:18.040> rustic<00:02:18.489> and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
just kind of made it more rustic and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.610 
just kind of made it more rustic and
vintage<00:02:18.970> II<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.329> I<00:02:19.750> just<00:02:19.989> pretty<00:02:20.110> much<00:02:20.200> stuck

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
vintage II and I just pretty much stuck

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.740 
vintage II and I just pretty much stuck
pictures<00:02:21.069> on<00:02:21.280> those<00:02:21.489> ones<00:02:21.730> anyway<00:02:22.209> if<00:02:22.450> you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
pictures on those ones anyway if you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.140 
pictures on those ones anyway if you
don't<00:02:22.930> want<00:02:23.079> that<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.349> happen<00:02:24.000> definitely<00:02:25.000> use

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
don't want that to happen definitely use

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.569 
don't want that to happen definitely use
a<00:02:25.180> bigger<00:02:25.569> kind<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.290> bin<00:02:26.500> full<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.829> tea<00:02:27.040> than<00:02:27.400> I

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
a bigger kind of bin full of tea than I

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.390 
a bigger kind of bin full of tea than I
did<00:02:28.079> so<00:02:29.079> I<00:02:29.140> ended<00:02:29.319> up<00:02:29.379> writing<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:29.920> about<00:02:30.159> half

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
did so I ended up writing on about half

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.149 
did so I ended up writing on about half
of<00:02:30.519> them<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.150> ten<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.739> then<00:02:32.739> with<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
of them just in ten and then with the

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.580 
of them just in ten and then with the
other<00:02:33.189> ones<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.420> did<00:02:34.689> was<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:34.989> went<00:02:35.349> and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
other ones what I did was I went and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.559 
other ones what I did was I went and
printed<00:02:35.890> out<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.010> bunch<00:02:36.129> of<00:02:36.459> pictures<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.150> some

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
printed out a bunch of pictures and some

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.940 
printed out a bunch of pictures and some
of<00:02:37.659> them<00:02:37.750> are<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:37.900> normal<00:02:38.349> size<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:38.829> you<00:02:38.890> can

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
of them are just normal size but you can

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.899 
of them are just normal size but you can
see<00:02:39.159> over<00:02:39.189> on<00:02:39.700> my<00:02:39.909> TV<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.769> then<00:02:41.769> I<00:02:42.129> put<00:02:42.760> these

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
see over on my TV and then I put these

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.460 
see over on my TV and then I put these
in<00:02:42.970> Photoshop<00:02:43.629> and<00:02:43.810> just<00:02:44.019> shrunk<00:02:44.260> them<00:02:44.439> down

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
in Photoshop and just shrunk them down

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.500 
in Photoshop and just shrunk them down
so<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.069> this<00:02:45.189> is<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.609> regular<00:02:45.790> four<00:02:46.329> by

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
so that this is just a regular four by

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.680 
so that this is just a regular four by
whatever

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
whatever

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.809

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.809 
but then I just shrunk a bunch of stuff
down<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.010> then<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.209> cut<00:02:55.540> them<00:02:55.780> out<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:57.459> then
