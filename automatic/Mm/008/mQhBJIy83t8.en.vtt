00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.260 
usually when you're in these kind of
missions<00:01:18.649> for<00:01:18.709> RP<00:01:19.009> you<00:01:19.520> can<00:01:19.700> stop<00:01:19.909> getting<00:01:20.179> the

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
missions for RP you can stop getting the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.270 
missions for RP you can stop getting the
RP<00:01:20.539> but<00:01:20.720> i<00:01:20.750> did<00:01:20.959> not<00:01:21.049> do<00:01:21.229> that<00:01:21.350> for<00:01:21.530> me<00:01:21.709> so<00:01:22.159> I'm

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
RP but i did not do that for me so I'm

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.730 
RP but i did not do that for me so I'm
pretty<00:01:22.459> sure<00:01:22.789> um<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:23.630> won't<00:01:23.990> do<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.200> for<00:01:24.560> you

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
pretty sure um it won't do that for you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.490 
pretty sure um it won't do that for you
I<00:01:24.950> think<00:01:25.340> it's<00:01:25.459> a<00:01:25.520> limited<00:01:26.030> time<00:01:26.509> with<00:01:26.810> RP<00:01:27.259> I

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.440 
I think it's a limited time with RP I
don't<00:01:27.920> think<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.190> does<00:01:28.310> break<00:01:28.640> what<00:01:29.240> any<00:01:29.420> of

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450
