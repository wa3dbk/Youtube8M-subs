for<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> long<00:00:35.340> time<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> wish<00:00:35.910> I'd<00:00:36.090> gotten<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.450> in

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.290 
for a long time I wish I'd gotten it in
the<00:00:36.690> GM<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.410> think<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.280> were<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:39.030> purchase

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the GM I think if I were to purchase

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.569 
the GM I think if I were to purchase
this<00:00:40.110> all<00:00:40.350> over<00:00:40.530> again<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.860> probably<00:00:41.160> would

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
this all over again I probably would

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.940 
this all over again I probably would
have<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:42.510> because<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.960> personal<00:00:43.379> preference

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
have just because my personal preference

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.330 
have just because my personal preference
is<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:45.289> especially<00:00:46.289> as<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> tote<00:00:46.980> type

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
is to have especially as a tote type

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.760 
is to have especially as a tote type
style<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.420> lots<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.960> room<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.230> put<00:00:49.469> things

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
style to have lots of room to put things

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.869 
style to have lots of room to put things
in<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:52.039> learned<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
in but I have learned to really like the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.350 
in but I have learned to really like the
size

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
size

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
size
I<00:00:54.390> think<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> MM<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.739> prettiest<00:00:56.190> size<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
I think the MM is the prettiest size and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.660 
I think the MM is the prettiest size and
the<00:00:57.390> most<00:00:57.539> fetching<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:59.010> been<00:00:59.190> accused<00:00:59.579> of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the most fetching it's been accused of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.180 
the most fetching it's been accused of
looking<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.210> diaper<00:01:00.539> bag<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.920> think

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
looking like a diaper bag but I think

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.160 
looking like a diaper bag but I think
it's<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.609> great<00:01:02.910> tote<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:03.989> I'm

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it's just a great tote and if I'm

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440 
it's just a great tote and if I'm
looking<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.799> bag<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.390> to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
you see you know immediately you're

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.250 
you see you know immediately you're
supposed<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.850> have<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.900> not<00:02:50.080> one

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
supposed to have it and this is not one

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.170 
supposed to have it and this is not one
of<00:02:50.380> those<00:02:50.500> things<00:02:50.770> so<00:02:51.100> perhaps<00:02:51.459> it's<00:02:51.820> that's

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
of those things so perhaps it's that's

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
think I won't leave it on there but this

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.130 
think I won't leave it on there but this
is<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.170> totally<00:02:59.650> MN<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:01.090> my<00:03:01.330> one<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:01.630> my<00:03:01.750> very

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
and that's probably the most confusing

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.440 
and that's probably the most confusing
part<00:04:11.980> with<00:04:12.070> this<00:04:12.190> bag<00:04:12.400> is<00:04:12.640> there<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.329> many
