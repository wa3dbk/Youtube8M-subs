right under my ears so I have good chunk
like<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.899> hanging<00:02:10.710> out<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.070> then<00:02:11.310> before<00:02:11.460> I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
like this hanging out and then before I

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
like this hanging out and then before I
get<00:02:11.850> started<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.780> use<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> heat

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
get started I like to use a heat

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.590 
get started I like to use a heat
protectant<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:13.890> I'm<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.190> going<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.640> evenly

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
protectant so I'm just going to evenly

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.110 
protectant so I'm just going to evenly
distribute<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:16.260> throughout<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:17.130> layer<00:02:17.490> so

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
distribute that throughout this layer so

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.490 
distribute that throughout this layer so
what<00:02:18.270> happens<00:02:18.630> when<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.840> press<00:02:18.990> down<00:02:19.080> on<00:02:19.290> the

what happens when you press down on the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.650 
what happens when you press down on the
iron<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.190> steam<00:02:20.490> starts<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.330> come<00:02:21.540> up

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
iron is the steam starts to come up

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.140 
iron is the steam starts to come up
through<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.080> tube<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.520> iron<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.030> you

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
through this tube up to the iron so you

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.760 
through this tube up to the iron so you
want<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.360> hold<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.660> down<00:02:24.780> for<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:25.140> bit<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.560> you

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
want to hold it down for a bit and you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.590 
want to hold it down for a bit and you
will<00:02:25.890> see<00:02:26.070> see<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.700> will<00:02:26.880> start<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.180> come<00:02:27.420> up

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
will see see that will start to come up

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.750 
will see see that will start to come up
and<00:02:27.780> once<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.290> starts<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.620> come<00:02:28.800> up<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:29.700> this

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
and once it starts to come up like this

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.870 
and once it starts to come up like this
constantly<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.380> completely<00:02:31.770> ready<00:02:32.100> to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
constantly then it's completely ready to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.970 
constantly then it's completely ready to
go<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.510> front<00:02:33.690> over<00:02:33.870> here<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.530> also<00:02:34.800> see

pods that are over here to be on the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.290 
pods that are over here to be on the
bottom<00:02:46.230> I'm<00:02:46.770> just<00:02:47.070> going<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.370> take<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.880> chunk<00:02:48.150> of

my hair and then I'm just going to iron
this<00:02:50.730> piece<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.240> let's<00:02:51.690> see<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.050> before<00:02:52.200> it's

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
this piece so let's see the before it's

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.210 
this piece so let's see the before it's
really<00:02:53.490> curly<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.270> now<00:02:55.260> let<00:02:55.590> me<00:02:55.680> eye<00:02:55.890> on<00:02:55.950> it

really curly and now let me eye on it
and<00:02:56.370> you'll<00:02:57.000> see<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.360> answer<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:59.100> go

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and you'll see the answer so you just go

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.020 
and you'll see the answer so you just go
right<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.910> scalp<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:01.620> slowly<00:03:02.130> go

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
right to the scalp and you slowly go

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.890 
right to the scalp and you slowly go
down<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.250> like<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.550> pass<00:03:08.760> through<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.330> about

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
down and I like to pass through it about

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.110 
down and I like to pass through it about
one<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.530> two<00:03:10.560> times<00:03:11.070> depending<00:03:11.700> on<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.940> piece

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
one to two times depending on the piece

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.850 
one to two times depending on the piece
that<00:03:12.239> I'm<00:03:12.390> going<00:03:12.660> through<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.410> was<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.680> no

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
that I'm going through and I was like no

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.710 
that I'm going through and I was like no
effort<00:03:14.220> all<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.820> did<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.120> didn't<00:03:15.360> have<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.570> go

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
effort all you did I didn't have to go

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.750 
effort all you did I didn't have to go
over<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.080> with<00:03:16.200> an<00:03:16.380> iron<00:03:16.620> like<00:03:16.920> 20<00:03:17.310> times<00:03:17.489> to

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
over it with an iron like 20 times to

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.300 
over it with an iron like 20 times to
get<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.120> straight<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:19.140> like<00:03:19.440> amazing<00:03:19.920> how

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
get this straight it's like amazing how

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.979 
get this straight it's like amazing how
easy<00:03:20.580> this<00:03:20.820> thing<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.180> especially<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:21.840> you

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
easy this thing is especially if you

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.470 
easy this thing is especially if you
have<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.200> really<00:03:22.860> curly<00:03:23.220> hair<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:24.000> thing<00:03:24.269> is

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
have a really curly hair this thing is

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.390 
have a really curly hair this thing is
literally<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.110> lifesaver<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.220> also

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
literally a lifesaver this is also

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.790 
literally a lifesaver this is also
considered<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.000> be<00:03:27.239> way<00:03:27.930> less<00:03:28.200> damaging<00:03:28.739> to

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
considered to be way less damaging to

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.460 
considered to be way less damaging to
your<00:03:29.130> hair<00:03:29.489> then<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.750> compare<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.170> like<00:03:31.440> a

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
your hair then can I compare to like a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.250 
your hair then can I compare to like a
normal<00:03:31.920> straightener<00:03:32.400> um<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:33.480> believe<00:03:33.630> because

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
normal straightener um I believe because

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.199 
normal straightener um I believe because
of<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.500> steam<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:35.070> just<00:03:35.280> really<00:03:35.610> nourishes

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
of the steam it just really nourishes

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.330 
of the steam it just really nourishes
your<00:03:36.360> hair<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.170> also<00:03:37.320> strings<00:03:37.800> it<00:03:38.100> way

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
your hair and it also strings it way

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.620 
your hair and it also strings it way
quicker<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:38.970> don't<00:03:39.180> have<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.360> like<00:03:39.480> go

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630
