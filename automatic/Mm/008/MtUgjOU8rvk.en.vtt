00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
honey from my top bar beehive and today

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.750 
honey from my top bar beehive and today
I'm<00:00:22.330> going<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.840> process<00:00:23.170> it<00:00:23.440> and<00:00:23.830> so<00:00:24.400> basically

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
I'm going to process it and so basically

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.460 
I'm going to process it and so basically
all<00:00:24.880> I'm<00:00:25.120> doing<00:00:25.390> is<00:00:25.480> removing<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:26.080> honey<00:00:26.260> from

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
all I'm doing is removing the honey from

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.040 
all I'm doing is removing the honey from
the<00:00:26.620> wax<00:00:26.830> and<00:00:27.070> to<00:00:28.000> get<00:00:28.150> started<00:00:28.600> I<00:00:28.720> first

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
the wax and to get started I first

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.260 
the wax and to get started I first
crushed<00:00:29.350> up<00:00:29.530> all<00:00:29.740> of<00:00:29.950> the<00:00:30.040> honeycomb<00:00:30.310> and<00:00:30.700> then

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
crushed up all of the honeycomb and then

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.910 
crushed up all of the honeycomb and then
poured<00:00:31.630> it<00:00:31.720> through<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:31.930> page<00:00:32.200> strainer<00:00:32.529> into<00:00:32.890> a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
poured it through a page strainer into a

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.610 
poured it through a page strainer into a
bucket<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:33.610> now<00:00:33.660> I'm<00:00:34.660> just<00:00:34.720> simply<00:00:35.260> going<00:00:35.440> to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
bucket and now I'm just simply going to

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.260 
bucket and now I'm just simply going to
pour<00:00:35.830> the<00:00:35.980> honey<00:00:36.070> from<00:00:36.309> the<00:00:36.370> bucket<00:00:36.760> into

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
pour the honey from the bucket into

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.570 
pour the honey from the bucket into
these<00:00:37.570> mason<00:00:37.960> jars<00:00:38.200> now<00:00:38.739> people<00:00:39.280> who<00:00:39.370> get<00:00:39.550> a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
these mason jars now people who get a

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.970 
these mason jars now people who get a
lot<00:00:39.940> of<00:00:40.120> honey<00:00:40.330> will<00:00:40.989> use<00:00:41.200> something<00:00:41.590> called<00:00:41.620> a

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
lot of honey will use something called a

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.590 
lot of honey will use something called a
honey<00:00:42.190> gate<00:00:42.460> which<00:00:42.670> is<00:00:42.820> basically<00:00:43.300> like<00:00:43.570> a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
honey gate which is basically like a

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.600 
honey gate which is basically like a
tack<00:00:43.900> at<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.200> bottom<00:00:44.470> of<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:44.650> bucket<00:00:44.830> and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
tack at the bottom of the bucket and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.890 
tack at the bottom of the bucket and
maybe<00:00:45.910> that's<00:00:46.120> something<00:00:46.450> I'll<00:00:46.540> deal<00:00:46.720> with

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
maybe that's something I'll deal with

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.200 
maybe that's something I'll deal with
next<00:00:47.110> year<00:00:47.470> but<00:00:47.950> for<00:00:48.250> right<00:00:48.430> now<00:00:48.610> with<00:00:48.850> just

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
next year but for right now with just

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.329 
next year but for right now with just
this<00:00:49.360> little<00:00:49.720> amount<00:00:49.900> of<00:00:50.080> honey<00:00:50.199> I<00:00:50.739> shouldn't

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
this little amount of honey I shouldn't

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:52.680 
this little amount of honey I shouldn't
have<00:00:51.400> any<00:00:51.519> problem<00:00:52.000> just<00:00:52.210> pouring<00:00:52.480> it<00:00:52.540> from

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
have any problem just pouring it from

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:23.840 
have any problem just pouring it from
the<00:00:52.780> bucket<00:00:53.110> into<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.410> jars

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.130 

well<00:01:24.850> we<00:01:24.970> didn't<00:01:25.180> get<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.330> tremendous<00:01:25.900> amount

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
well we didn't get a tremendous amount

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.800 
well we didn't get a tremendous amount
of<00:01:26.290> honey<00:01:26.440> but<00:01:27.220> we<00:01:27.670> had<00:01:27.910> a<00:01:27.940> lot<00:01:28.090> of<00:01:28.240> fun<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.690> my

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
of honey but we had a lot of fun and my

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.260 
of honey but we had a lot of fun and my
kids<00:01:29.080> learned<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.470> little<00:01:29.590> bit<00:01:29.770> about

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
kids learned a little bit about

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.150 
kids learned a little bit about
beekeeping<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.420> honeybees<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.320> that<00:01:33.040> was

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
beekeeping and honeybees and that was

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.100 
beekeeping and honeybees and that was
really<00:01:33.370> the<00:01:33.490> whole<00:01:33.670> goal<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:34.479> if<00:01:34.870> you're

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
really the whole goal so if you're

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.960 
really the whole goal so if you're
thinking<00:01:35.350> about<00:01:35.620> getting<00:01:36.040> into<00:01:36.340> beekeeping

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
thinking about getting into beekeeping

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.249 
thinking about getting into beekeeping
and<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:37.180> want<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.450> build<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.690> top<00:01:37.900> bar<00:01:38.110> hive

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
and you want to build a top bar hive

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.710 
and you want to build a top bar hive
I'll<00:01:38.590> put<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.040> link<00:01:39.220> on<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.490> screen<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:40.119> the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
I'll put a link on the screen to the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.990 
I'll put a link on the screen to the
first<00:01:40.990> video<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:41.740> really<00:01:41.979> is<00:01:42.550> it's<00:01:42.880> like

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
first video and that really is it's like

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.030 
first video and that really is it's like
a<00:01:43.030> series<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.479> videos<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:44.080> covers<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.770> build

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
a series of videos that covers the build

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.790 
a series of videos that covers the build
and<00:01:45.369> then<00:01:46.000> putting<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.750> bees<00:01:47.350> in<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.770> hive

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
and then putting the bees in the hive

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.460 
and then putting the bees in the hive
all<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.910> way<00:01:49.000> down<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.570> harvesting<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.259> honey

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
all the way down to harvesting the honey

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.790 
all the way down to harvesting the honey
and<00:01:50.710> processing<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.490> honey<00:01:51.700> now<00:01:52.360> my<00:01:53.259> goal<00:01:53.560> for

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
and processing the honey now my goal for

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.490 
and processing the honey now my goal for
the<00:01:53.950> hive<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.880> be<00:01:55.450> able<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.810> split<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.350> which

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
the hive is to be able to split it which

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.930 
the hive is to be able to split it which
means<00:01:56.710> I'll<00:01:56.920> need<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.190> build<00:01:57.399> another<00:01:57.640> hive

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
means I'll need to build another hive

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.330 
means I'll need to build another hive
and<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.360> will<00:01:58.509> be<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.630> project<00:01:58.930> for<00:01:59.340> sometime

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
and that will be a project for sometime

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.570 
and that will be a project for sometime
in<00:02:00.700> January<00:02:01.660> or<00:02:01.840> February<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.619> when<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.280> built

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
in January or February and when I built

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.230 
in January or February and when I built
that<00:02:03.700> hive

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
that hive

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.810 
that hive
I'll<00:02:04.780> build<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.380> little<00:02:05.680> simpler<00:02:06.160> than<00:02:06.460> the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
I'll build it a little simpler than the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.479 
I'll build it a little simpler than the
first<00:02:07.330> build<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:07.960> I'll<00:02:08.950> make<00:02:09.100> sure<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.310> I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
first build and I'll make sure that I

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.870 
first build and I'll make sure that I
have<00:02:09.670> plans<00:02:10.030> on<00:02:10.239> my<00:02:10.450> website<00:02:11.049> so<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.790> know

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
really into it this hive should be an

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.740 
really into it this hive should be an
easy<00:02:17.560> build<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.269> shouldn't<00:02:19.269> cost<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.600> lot<00:02:19.690> of

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
easy build and shouldn't cost a lot of

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.170 
easy build and shouldn't cost a lot of
money<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.290> build<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:21.100> thanks<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:22.030> tuning
