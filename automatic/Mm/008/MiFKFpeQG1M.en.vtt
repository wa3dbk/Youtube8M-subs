00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
the nose as well and then I actually

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.920 
the nose as well and then I actually
talk<00:02:36.000> about<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.330> nose<00:02:36.480> first<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.860> nose<00:02:38.040> is

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
talk about the nose first the nose is

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.160 
talk about the nose first the nose is
this<00:02:39.930> piece<00:02:40.350> right<00:02:40.650> here<00:02:41.270> of<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.420> owl<00:02:42.600> filter

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
this piece right here of the owl filter

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.320 
this piece right here of the owl filter
and<00:02:43.380> we're<00:02:43.800> actually<00:02:44.010> gonna<00:02:44.310> cut<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.910> half

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
and we're actually gonna cut it in half

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.430 
and we're actually gonna cut it in half
and<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.740> like<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.340> build<00:02:48.060> all<00:02:48.360> my<00:02:48.390> eyes<00:02:48.900> and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
and I like to build all my eyes and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.470 
and I like to build all my eyes and
stuff<00:02:49.680> right<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:49.980> glue<00:02:50.430> dots<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.240> leave

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
stuff right on glue dots and I leave

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.000 
stuff right on glue dots and I leave
them<00:02:51.600> right<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:52.200> they're<00:02:52.350> easy<00:02:52.620> to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
them right on here they're easy to

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.730 
them right on here they're easy to
handle<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:55.020> what<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.380> mini<00:02:55.560> glue

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
handle so this is what the mini glue

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.130 
handle so this is what the mini glue
dots<00:02:55.980> look<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.550> then<00:02:57.360> while<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.960> is

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
dots look like and then while this is

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.770 
dots look like and then while this is
still<00:02:58.350> on<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.890> glue<00:02:59.190> dot<00:02:59.370> paper<00:02:59.670> then<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.570> can

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
still on the glue dot paper then I can

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.590 
still on the glue dot paper then I can
take<00:03:00.960> my<00:03:01.020> scissors<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:02.070> trim<00:03:02.790> straight

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
take my scissors and just trim straight

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.790 
take my scissors and just trim straight
through<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.140> glue<00:03:04.320> dot<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:06.500> card<00:03:07.500> stock

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
through the glue dot and the card stock

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.960 
through the glue dot and the card stock
circle<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.840> get<00:03:10.080> my<00:03:10.740> nose<00:03:11.010> here<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:11.940> I

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
circle and I can get my nose here so I

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.740 
circle and I can get my nose here so I
love<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:12.959> those<00:03:13.170> went<00:03:13.470> right<00:03:13.709> there

build<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.940> we're<00:03:18.090> gonna<00:03:18.180> build<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:19.290> this

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
build this we're gonna build it on this

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.380 
build this we're gonna build it on this
one<00:03:19.709> here<00:03:20.100> I'm<00:03:20.370> going<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.880> start<00:03:21.180> by<00:03:21.360> just

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
one here I'm going to start by just

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.010 
one here I'm going to start by just
putting<00:03:21.959> adhesive<00:03:23.120> towards<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.330> bottom<00:03:24.840> of

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
putting adhesive towards the bottom of

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.690 
putting adhesive towards the bottom of
the<00:03:25.260> oval<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.890> I'm<00:03:25.980> gonna<00:03:26.100> line<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.430> up

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
the oval and I'm gonna line that up

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.030 
the oval and I'm gonna line that up
towards<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.840> bottom<00:03:27.990> of<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.540> owl

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
towards the bottom of the of the owl

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.090 
towards the bottom of the of the owl
position<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.250> little<00:03:32.550> bit<00:03:32.760> better<00:03:34.100> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
position this a little bit better the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.640 
position this a little bit better the
reason<00:03:35.489> I'm<00:03:35.700> doing<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:36.540> way<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.290> my

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
reason I'm doing it this way is that my

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.550 
reason I'm doing it this way is that my
eyes<00:03:37.890> are<00:03:38.489> going<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.570> just<00:03:39.750> slide<00:03:40.200> in

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
eyes are going to just slide in

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.770 
eyes are going to just slide in
underneath<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:42.470> just<00:03:43.470> like<00:03:43.830> this<00:03:44.780> alright

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
underneath that just like this alright

of<00:03:52.830> has<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.010> bit<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.250> googly<00:03:53.700> eyes<00:03:53.820> going<00:03:54.300> on

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
of has a bit of googly eyes going on

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.920 
of has a bit of googly eyes going on
there<00:03:54.810> let's<00:03:55.230> get<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.739> underneath<00:03:56.280> there

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
there let's get that underneath there

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.229 
there let's get that underneath there
there<00:03:57.930> we<00:03:58.080> go<00:03:58.790> there<00:03:59.790> he<00:04:00.030> is

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
there we go there he is

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.110 
there we go there he is
and<00:04:00.600> now<00:04:00.840> we're<00:04:01.140> going<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.560> use<00:04:02.120> stampin

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
and now we're going to use stampin

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.300 
and now we're going to use stampin
dimensionals<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:06.530> we'll<00:04:07.530> put<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.890> on<00:04:08.070> top

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
dimensionals and we'll put that on top

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.220 
dimensionals and we'll put that on top
of<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.780> first<00:04:10.110> one<00:04:10.380> that<00:04:10.590> we<00:04:10.769> built<00:04:11.070> here<00:04:11.550> and

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
of the first one that we built here and

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.229 
of the first one that we built here and
these<00:04:13.230> just<00:04:13.620> match<00:04:13.920> up<00:04:15.650> just<00:04:16.650> like<00:04:16.830> that<00:04:17.239> and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
these just match up just like that and

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.210 
these just match up just like that and
