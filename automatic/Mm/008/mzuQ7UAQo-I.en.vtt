00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 That's the personal beauty Diego can do. 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.930
 one gameplay here comparison my pc 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.620
 without video card with 4 gb of memory 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.799
 ram and 8 gb of ram memory from gta 5 to 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.789
 realize how and what with the difference there 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.160
 the IFFHS considered your computer dell 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.369
 I bought a few months ago and did a few months 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.890
 I 'm with him in color 5 44 60 s 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.689
 has a wee bit of 2.9 hertz plus 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.390
 turbo and I do not know how the intention works 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.940
 was to buy to make a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.360
 upgrade and start playing with it is only 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.910
 that I made a wrong choice came 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.820
 with gabriel induced that precludes 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 to make upgrades more aggressive then 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 some research that was running 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.530
 cool in the intel processor games that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.079
 connect graphics card abigraf of a chip 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.360
 graphic embedded in the computer 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.239
 it performs well even up to 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.219
 So I decided to download a cover 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.739
 is in Washington in that even though the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.530
 buy the game without knowing if the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.580
 or not is so low around 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.220
 of the same 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.810
 already ordered and to the south is downloading that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.950
 It takes long and 60 little young 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.619
 henrique that I was not using the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:26.100
 myself and I thought the main one is 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:30.119
 lack of plates after the bajaki and 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.420
 I started to see that whoever ends up winning 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.460
 truth and 4gb ram and with 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.189
 my mother on her computer just like I have 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.020
 the weight of them to test de sÃ£o miguel 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.020
 then I'll show you put up with 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.350
 the show will have subject in 4g babysitters but 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.660
 configuration shown in the table does not 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:02:01.290
 playing does not appear the second there the dogs 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:03.400
 which according to her was 0 1 2 3 5 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.650
 Here it goes 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.840
 the image is stopped in the square 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:13.570
 no problem around money 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:18.070
 framed voter is 280 km 24 in the 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:23.100
 girl shows that indicating a change 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:25.630
 in this configuration 8 tomorrow never runs 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.310
 is running here from the house but who is 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.500
 who 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.120
 what else left that medication 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.120
 lectrum really fills my understanding 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.209
 this in both the attack and the father 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.850
 of the blind boy's grandfather can not always 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.950
 play played hard and showed all 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.840
 horizon by 3 1 while confidence 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.090
 my intention from the beginning was 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.390
 up to five if it worked 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.070
 so I never stopped playing a time and it 's 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:03.760
 that I'll show you 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:07.270
 the settings that were here 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.769
 configurations that would run down one 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.940
 tip is always you if the one of the one 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.080
 third if you put who will be 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.050
 standards 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.140
 if you call because he has that 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.810
 use the interest for your configuration 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.200
 so often the police officer on the board 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.750
 much video of the game begins to catch the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.230
 work where I was was there 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.209
 and it changes the settings is 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.450
 increase some things to lower some 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.900
 things and then end up laughing at 30 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.209
 frames leiria 28 frames per second 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.550
 You can play it easy, I found it a lot. 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.040
 Nice does not need to buy the card. 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.989
 video and then as with anyone on the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.630
 true a short memory comb using 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.250
 My mother is like training in the market. 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.010
 free enough a comb just like 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.480
 round I had the same potential 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.950
 same brand name 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.239
 she still had then she's walking 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.780
 Calm down, that's it, buy it without fear. 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.780
 thanks guys
