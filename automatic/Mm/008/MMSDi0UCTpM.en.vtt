your roses instead just use a dotting

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.840 
your roses instead just use a dotting
motion<00:01:53.049> because<00:01:53.680> you<00:01:53.860> don't<00:01:54.070> want<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.580> smudge

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
motion because you don't want to smudge

your<00:01:55.030> roses<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:57.009> same<00:01:57.220> with<00:01:57.369> the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
your roses and the same with the

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
baccarat when you put on a top coat just

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.590 
baccarat when you put on a top coat just
a<00:01:59.680> dotting<00:02:00.009> motion<00:02:00.130> instead<00:02:00.729> of<00:02:00.790> swiping<00:02:01.210> it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
a dotting motion instead of swiping it

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.999 
a dotting motion instead of swiping it
