00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
basically what it is is you got the end

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.940 
basically what it is is you got the end
there<00:00:43.390> standing<00:00:43.900> up<00:00:44.050> so<00:00:44.470> they<00:00:44.590> have<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:44.800> get

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
there standing up so they have to get

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.090 
there standing up so they have to get
off<00:00:45.160> and<00:00:45.430> then<00:00:45.670> you<00:00:45.790> got<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.090> line<00:00:46.330> that<00:00:46.570> just

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
off and then you got the line that just

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.770 
off and then you got the line that just
kind<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.129> crashes<00:00:48.610> and<00:00:48.790> hits<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.030> back<00:00:49.330> or

the<00:00:58.600> plate<00:00:58.809> looks<00:00:58.840> like<00:00:59.079> that<00:00:59.519> so<00:01:00.519> I'm<00:01:00.609> just

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
the plate looks like that so I'm just

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.560 
the plate looks like that so I'm just
going<00:01:00.910> to<00:01:00.969> show<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.629> more<00:01:02.410> time<00:01:03.390> base<00:01:04.390> the

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
going to show you more time base the

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
option so there as you can see the

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.120 
option so there as you can see the
defense<00:01:10.720> gets<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:11.020> really<00:01:11.320> good<00:01:11.500> push<00:01:11.799> on

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
defense gets a really good push on

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.789 
defense gets a really good push on
everything<00:01:12.720> making<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.840> really<00:01:14.110> hard<00:01:14.259> for<00:01:14.560> the

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
everything making it really hard for the

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.490 
everything making it really hard for the
running<00:01:15.009> back<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.430> even<00:01:15.790> go<00:01:15.909> anywhere<00:01:16.289> this<00:01:17.289> is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
running back to even go anywhere this is

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.990 
running back to even go anywhere this is
really<00:01:18.399> good<00:01:18.549> for<00:01:18.820> those

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
really good for those

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.900 
really good for those
the<00:01:20.690> read-option<00:01:20.870> triple-option<00:01:21.730> stuff<00:01:22.730> like

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
the read-option triple-option stuff like

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.400 
the read-option triple-option stuff like
that<00:01:22.940> this<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:24.220> get<00:01:25.220> in<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.520> disrupt

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410

to no game so then just baseline show
bleep<00:01:48.950> then<00:01:49.760> option

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
bleep then option

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.740 
bleep then option
quarterback<00:01:53.190> as<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:53.940> they<00:01:54.120> always
