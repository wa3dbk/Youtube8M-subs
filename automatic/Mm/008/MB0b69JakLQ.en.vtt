00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
is really convenient it allows me to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.539

read<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.990> any<00:01:19.259> position<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.189> don't<00:01:20.310> end

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
read in any position so that I don't end

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.270 
read in any position so that I don't end
up<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:22.460> firearms<00:01:24.439> and<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.619> lets<00:01:25.799> me<00:01:26.009> do

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
up like this firearms and it lets me do

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.039 
up like this firearms and it lets me do
other<00:01:26.580> things<00:01:27.030> while<00:01:27.299> I'm<00:01:27.540> reading<00:01:27.750> too

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
other things while I'm reading too

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.600 
other things while I'm reading too
because<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.560> easily<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.130> hold<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.460> in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
because I can easily just hold this in

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:40.670 
because I can easily just hold this in
one<00:01:29.759> hand<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.479> drink<00:01:38.299> instead<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.680> drink

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
one hand so I can drink instead of drink

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.819 
one hand so I can drink instead of drink
like<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.450> eat<00:01:42.750> which<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> thing

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
like that and I can eat which is a thing

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.740 
like that and I can eat which is a thing
that<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.159> we've<00:01:44.460> always<00:01:44.700> tried<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.570> do

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that I think we've always tried to do

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.910 
that I think we've always tried to do
but<00:01:45.960> completely<00:01:46.740> fail<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.460> because

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
but completely fail that because

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.800 
but completely fail that because
to<00:01:48.520> hold<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.790> book<00:01:48.939> open<00:01:49.119> and<00:01:49.450> eat<00:01:49.600> at<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:49.780> same

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
what it means so that's brilliant and I

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.740 
what it means so that's brilliant and I
really<00:03:48.470> like<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.799> ability<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.430> resize<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
really like the ability to resize the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.929 
really like the ability to resize the
font<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.439> if<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.680> font<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.099> too<00:03:52.340> small<00:03:52.370> for<00:03:52.790> me<00:03:52.909> to

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
font so if a font is too small for me to

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.300 
font so if a font is too small for me to
read<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.390> can<00:03:53.599> just<00:03:53.780> blow<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.319> up<00:03:54.439> or<00:03:54.680> if<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.129> want

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
it to be a lot smaller I can shrink it

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.809 
it to be a lot smaller I can shrink it
down<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:57.739> that's<00:03:57.890> just<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.220> physical<00:03:58.670> review
