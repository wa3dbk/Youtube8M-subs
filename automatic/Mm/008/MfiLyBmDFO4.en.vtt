well<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.270> Boston<00:02:03.570> first<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.110> all<00:02:04.200> did<00:02:04.350> it

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
well I think Boston first of all did it

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.410 
well I think Boston first of all did it
had<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> great<00:02:05.399> game<00:02:05.549> plan<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:06.090> I'm<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
had a great game plan I think I'm a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.550 
had a great game plan I think I'm a
coach<00:02:06.570> your<00:02:06.689> staff<00:02:06.840> gave<00:02:07.020> them<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> great<00:02:07.320> game

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
coach your staff gave them a great game

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.219 
coach your staff gave them a great game
playing

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
playing

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.840 
playing
you<00:02:09.009> know<00:02:09.130> they<00:02:09.280> try<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.460> keep<00:02:09.640> us<00:02:09.729> on<00:02:09.819> a

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
you know they try to keep us on a

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.480 
you know they try to keep us on a
perimeter<00:02:10.030> as<00:02:10.270> much<00:02:10.390> as<00:02:10.509> possible<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:11.459> got<00:02:12.459> a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
perimeter as much as possible I got a

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.770 
perimeter as much as possible I got a
lot<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.790> veteran<00:02:13.090> players<00:02:13.330> that's<00:02:13.540> been<00:02:13.660> in

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
lot of veteran players that's been in

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.840 
lot of veteran players that's been in
postseason<00:02:14.290> games<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.770> they<00:02:15.430> all<00:02:15.610> just

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
postseason games and they all just

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.040 
postseason games and they all just
bought<00:02:16.000> into<00:02:16.240> their<00:02:16.390> system<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.900> worked

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
bought into their system and it worked

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.160 
bought into their system and it worked
for<00:02:17.200> him<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:18.450> think<00:02:19.450> we<00:02:19.540> had<00:02:19.720> we<00:02:20.050> had

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
for him I think we had we had

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.500 
for him I think we had we had
opportunities<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.950> win<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.160> game<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.610> win<00:02:22.390> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
opportunities to win the game to win the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.080 
opportunities to win the game to win the
series<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.080> we<00:02:23.170> didn't<00:02:23.380> execute<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:24.010> mean<00:02:24.310> for

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
series but we didn't execute I mean for

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.640 
series but we didn't execute I mean for
48<00:02:25.450> minutes<00:02:25.570> ago<00:02:25.870> as<00:02:25.930> possible<00:02:26.320> every<00:02:26.470> game

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
48 minutes ago as possible every game

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.650 
48 minutes ago as possible every game
and<00:02:27.459> when<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:27.970> don't<00:02:28.120> do<00:02:28.240> that<00:02:28.360> against<00:02:28.570> a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
and when you don't do that against a

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.000 
and when you don't do that against a
very<00:02:28.840> experienced<00:02:29.380> team<00:02:29.530> against<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.830> team

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
very experienced team against a team

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.350 
very experienced team against a team
that's<00:02:30.220> been<00:02:30.340> around<00:02:30.490> this<00:02:30.730> block<00:02:30.940> mortal

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
that's been around this block mortal

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.870 
that's been around this block mortal
ones<00:02:31.510> they<00:02:31.690> know<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.890> can<00:02:33.040> definitely<00:02:33.190> end<00:02:33.790> up

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
ones they know you can definitely end up

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.000 
ones they know you can definitely end up
one<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.090> those<00:02:34.180> inside<00:02:34.709> first<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.770> all<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:35.890> want

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
one of those inside first of all I want

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.240 
one of those inside first of all I want
to<00:02:36.070> win<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:37.500> mean<00:02:38.500> that's<00:02:38.680> not<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.980> small

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
to win and I mean that's not a small

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.600 
to win and I mean that's not a small
anything<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:39.819> my<00:02:39.940> only<00:02:40.030> concern<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.570> mean

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
anything it's my only concern I mean

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.210 
anything it's my only concern I mean
I've<00:02:42.610> always<00:02:43.060> prided<00:02:43.810> myself<00:02:43.989> on<00:02:44.560> becoming<00:02:45.130> a

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
I've always prided myself on becoming a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.500 
I've always prided myself on becoming a
better<00:02:45.340> basketball<00:02:45.550> individually<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.420> then

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
better basketball individually and then

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.150 
better basketball individually and then
taking<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.840> too

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
taking that too

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.370 
taking that too
onto<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> court<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.690> mean<00:02:50.019> it's<00:02:50.110> all<00:02:50.200> about

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
onto the court so I mean it's all about

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.940 
onto the court so I mean it's all about
winning<00:02:50.709> for<00:02:50.739> me<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:52.540> think<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.590> Cavs<00:02:53.830> is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
winning for me and I think the Cavs is

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.180 
winning for me and I think the Cavs is
committed<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.400> doing<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:57.010> at<00:02:57.100> the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
committed to doing that and but at the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.220 
committed to doing that and but at the
same<00:02:57.340> time<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.940> know<00:02:58.060> I've<00:02:58.750> given<00:02:59.110> myself

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.520 
same time you know I've given myself
options<00:02:59.830> to<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:00.550> point<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:02.019> I'm<00:03:02.230> like<00:03:02.440> I

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
options to this point and I'm like I

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.220 
options to this point and I'm like I
said<00:03:02.590> before<00:03:02.800> I<00:03:03.010> mean<00:03:03.100> my<00:03:03.310> team<00:03:04.050> we<00:03:05.050> have<00:03:05.200> a
