 and welcome to a lovely video 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:11.219
 This time it's nothing like stars 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:15.049
 vehicle kastl with cetera but one 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.630
 something new a zombie apocalypse 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.529
 the idea behind it was that 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.710
 the surviving lisa zombie apocalypse 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:31.439
 a kind of small town as a refuge 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:33.809
 have built and this is then city 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:42.809
 at some point of the zombies 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:49.469
 attacked and of this is the one here 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:52.890
 right up front a zombie of the grade high 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.050
 still wants to climb next to the skeleton of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.440
 glory someone died dortmunder 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.190
 is or not cleared away and here still 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:09.350
 a skull to climb up then 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:13.710
 anyone else a rat and here 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.830
 one has just made machines thomann 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.720
 plates et cetera a small barricade 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.479
 built 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:26.850
 just before the zombies came and are here 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:32.610
 already two of them are currently from one 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:36.329
 assaulted the assault rifle and up here 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:42.439
 Two people like the zombies are standing there 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.439
 have done well known here 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:56.200
 share these different mini figures 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.590
 built and that 's just someone who is 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.970
 has a weapon built with firearms 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.970
 were pretty close 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:14.140
 Although this is a kind of mobile tesla coil 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:19.650
 As you can see the current shock nitrate 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:23.230
 opening to beaver's birthday 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.750
 and here comes the next one 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.900
 also fried 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.900
 here has a highly managed almost 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:54.359
 inner area different people the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.840
 to defend myself 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.970
 most of them have later because 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:13.870
 as already said firearms very much 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:16.299
 It was just here, although a few of the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:25.239
 shotgun has seen a few shot 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:30.540
 was not so often in this look from here 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:32.170
 further up a sword here 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.300
 one 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.270
 a real fool who thinks that 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.709
 can align more with two swords 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.709
 although he never had 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.830
 one who got a revolver 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.340
 but one with one sword with one 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:02.670
 ax and one with a crossbow 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:07.450
 Here is the entrance to the marketplace 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:11.410
 Here is the thematic knife pig 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:16.410
 tied up such a little else in the 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:20.769
 butcher grad with a big ax out 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:24.300
 so that's the last and here 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:29.200
 two women running downtown 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:32.350
 and here the ruins of a helicopter 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.690
 a combat helicopter during the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:41.500
 said zombie apocalypse crashed 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:44.530
 has not cleared away yet 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.430
 and as you can see a building 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.430
 smaller 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.040
 is a small hospital 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.900
 Here is an older person 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:26.660
 various cabinets unlikely 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:29.630
 because they love to plant 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:34.840
 provided but I just did not have 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:38.870
 so many at the moment that's why 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:43.760
 also probably one of the few 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.470
 zombie apocalypse box so the next one 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.090
 video will most likely be back 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.090
 be a vehicle 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.420
 Do you have the world back in the world? 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:03.950
 Overview 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:06.140
 and yes if you like the video licon 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.400
 maybe even subscribe 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.400
 and then I just do not have to say
