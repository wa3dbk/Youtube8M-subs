along<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> right<00:00:51.750> lines<00:00:51.899> cuz<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
along the right lines cuz going for a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860 
along the right lines cuz going for a
belt<00:00:53.280> gives<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.850> shape<00:00:53.879> cinches<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.719> your

waist a high heel is also the right line

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
waist a high heel is also the right line
but<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> think<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> type<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.260> belt<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> shoe

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
but I think the type of belt and shoe

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.799 
but I think the type of belt and shoe
you<00:00:59.160> did<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.640> wrong<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.149> hang<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.600> that

silhouette is there a certain place that

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.400
