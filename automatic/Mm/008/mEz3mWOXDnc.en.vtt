 the teeth armed 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.060
 So I bet it I do not like 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.350
 drop slightly lower pushing technique 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.600
 there is discretion outside of time then 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.260
 protection but I understand it as your 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.170
 answer 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:35.210

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.800
 original packaging 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:37.780

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.139

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.750

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.580

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:19.320
