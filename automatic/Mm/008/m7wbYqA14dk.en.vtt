going to use the diagonal stripe and
I've<00:01:06.390> already<00:01:06.720> cut<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:08.250> still

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
I've already cut it out and it's still

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.149 
I've already cut it out and it's still

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
laying here on my cutting plate so

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.280 
laying here on my cutting plate so
basically<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.270> stamp<00:01:12.690> set<00:01:12.930> I've<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.170> my

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
basically I have a stamp set I've got my

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
basically I have a stamp set I've got my
card<00:01:13.920> planned<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> only<00:01:15.390> other

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
card planned out and the only other

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.580 
card planned out and the only other
thing<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.170> need<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.520> press<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.729> seal

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
thing that you need is press and seal

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.440 
thing that you need is press and seal
sometimes<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.860> cut<00:01:20.520> your<00:01:20.640> plates<00:01:21.000> they

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
sometimes when you cut your plates they

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.359 
sometimes when you cut your plates they
stick<00:01:21.750> together<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.470> great<00:01:22.740> when<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
stick together and that's great when you

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.190 
stick together and that's great when you
really<00:01:23.640> want<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.329> stick<00:01:24.540> together<00:01:24.720> that's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
really want it to stick together that's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.440 
really want it to stick together that's
when<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.560> doesn't<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> falls<00:01:26.369> apart<00:01:26.700> so

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
when it doesn't and it falls apart so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.899 
when it doesn't and it falls apart so
I'm<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.899> gonna<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:29.899> little<00:01:30.899> piece<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
I'm just gonna do a little piece and

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.600 
I'm just gonna do a little piece and
then<00:01:32.909> put<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.240> sticky<00:01:33.630> side<00:01:33.899> down<00:01:34.310> I've<00:01:35.310> tried

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
then put the sticky side down I've tried

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.749 
then put the sticky side down I've tried
this<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:36.030> washi<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.930> some<00:01:37.460> painters<00:01:38.460> tape

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
this with washi and some painters tape

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.899 
this with washi and some painters tape
which<00:01:39.149> you<00:01:39.180> could<00:01:39.479> probably<00:01:39.659> use<00:01:40.110> too<00:01:40.409> but

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
which you could probably use too but

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.510 
which you could probably use too but
sometimes<00:01:41.909> I've<00:01:42.090> had<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.869> front<00:01:43.430> kind<00:01:44.430> of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
sometimes I've had the front kind of

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.639 
sometimes I've had the front kind of
shred<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.880> little<00:01:45.210> bit<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.539> I<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> front

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
shred a little bit and I want the front

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.069 
shred a little bit and I want the front
of<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.090> paper<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.539> stay<00:01:48.750> nice<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
of the of the paper to stay nice and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.260 
of the of the paper to stay nice and
smooth<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.250> press<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.880> really

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
smooth so I just press this down really

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.929 
smooth so I just press this down really
well<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.789> just<00:01:57.060> peel<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.539> up<00:01:57.630> off

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
well and then you just peel it up off

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.830 
well and then you just peel it up off
your<00:01:59.939> cutting<00:02:00.329> plate<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:02.299> it<00:02:03.299> all<00:02:03.450> sticks

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
your cutting plate and it all sticks

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.849 
your cutting plate and it all sticks
together<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:05.810> on<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:07.079> big<00:02:07.289> chunk<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
together so it's on one big chunk and

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.780 
together so it's on one big chunk and
then<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:09.149> use<00:02:09.690> some<00:02:10.440> tombow<00:02:10.770> mono<00:02:11.100> let<00:02:11.430> me<00:02:11.550> cut

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
then I use some tombow mono let me cut

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:22.190 
then I use some tombow mono let me cut
my<00:02:11.970> fold<00:02:12.600> my<00:02:13.070> card<00:02:14.070> base<00:02:14.250> here

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.750 

and<00:02:23.200> obviously<00:02:23.530> if<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.010> wanted<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.370> stick<00:02:24.610> it

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
and obviously if you wanted to stick it

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.270 
and obviously if you wanted to stick it
down<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.090> can<00:02:25.240> see<00:02:25.480> through<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.530> press

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
down you can see through that and press
