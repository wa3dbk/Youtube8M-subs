hard drive so let's go ahead and open up

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.270 
hard drive so let's go ahead and open up
the<00:01:08.640> tape<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> bottom<00:01:09.420> here

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the tape on the bottom here

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.530 
the tape on the bottom here
as<00:01:12.280> you<00:01:12.400> can<00:01:12.490> see<00:01:12.730> we<00:01:12.850> just<00:01:12.880> opened<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.450> up

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
as you can see we just opened it up

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.990 
as you can see we just opened it up
let's<00:01:13.750> put<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.200> side<00:01:14.530> real<00:01:14.710> quick

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
let's put that to the side real quick

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.650 
let's put that to the side real quick
and<00:01:16.000> so<00:01:16.390> what<00:01:16.900> we<00:01:17.020> have<00:01:17.230> here<00:01:17.260> is<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.540> thing<00:01:19.540> we

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
and so what we have here is the thing we

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.410 
and so what we have here is the thing we
just<00:01:19.690> open<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.200> up<00:01:20.320> like<00:01:20.440> this<00:01:21.300> probably<00:01:22.300> did

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
just open it up like this probably did

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.780 
just open it up like this probably did
it<00:01:22.480> the<00:01:22.540> wrong<00:01:22.690> way<00:01:22.720> exactly<00:01:23.650> so<00:01:24.400> we<00:01:24.520> open<00:01:24.730> up

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
it the wrong way exactly so we open up

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.480 
it the wrong way exactly so we open up
like<00:01:25.000> this<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.570> here<00:01:26.230> we<00:01:26.410> have<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:27.130> hard

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
like this and here we have the hard

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.450 
like this and here we have the hard
drive<00:01:27.790> itself<00:01:28.420> as<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.410> can<00:01:29.560> see<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:30.010> has<00:01:30.220> that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
drive itself as you can see it has that

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.430 
drive itself as you can see it has that
nice<00:01:30.700> aluminum<00:01:31.330> finish<00:01:31.570> I<00:01:31.840> don't<00:01:32.050> know<00:01:32.140> if

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
nice aluminum finish I don't know if

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.890 
nice aluminum finish I don't know if
it's<00:01:32.770> real<00:01:32.980> because<00:01:33.460> it's<00:01:33.700> extremely<00:01:34.330> light

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
it's real because it's extremely light

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.250 
it's real because it's extremely light
hopefully<00:01:35.650> it<00:01:35.770> is<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:37.270> let's<00:01:37.600> go<00:01:37.780> ahead<00:01:37.870> and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
hopefully it is so let's go ahead and

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.890 
hopefully it is so let's go ahead and
take<00:01:38.560> this<00:01:38.740> out<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.640> if<00:01:42.760> air<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.060> very<00:01:43.540> very

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
take this out so if air is very very

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.710 
take this out so if air is very very
nice<00:01:44.370> so<00:01:45.370> there's<00:01:45.940> nothing<00:01:46.090> else<00:01:46.330> in<00:01:46.480> the<00:01:46.570> box

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
nice so there's nothing else in the box

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.150 
nice so there's nothing else in the box
here<00:01:47.020> as<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.200> can<00:01:47.260> see<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:47.680> we're<00:01:47.800> gonna<00:01:47.920> put

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
here as you can see so we're gonna put

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
here as you can see so we're gonna put
that<00:01:48.250> to<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.460> side<00:01:50.160> so<00:01:51.160> this<00:01:51.370> is<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.760> actual

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
that to the side so this is the actual

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.290 
that to the side so this is the actual
passport<00:01:52.990> itself<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.850> I<00:01:54.910> went<00:01:55.030> ahead<00:01:55.120> and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
passport itself so I went ahead and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.490 
passport itself so I went ahead and
change<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.600> angle<00:01:55.660> so<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:55.990> guys<00:01:56.110> can<00:01:56.320> see<00:01:56.470> a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
change the angle so you guys can see a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.700 
change the angle so you guys can see a
little<00:01:56.620> bit<00:01:56.740> better<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:58.320> let's<00:01:59.320> go<00:01:59.590> ahead

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
little bit better and so let's go ahead

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.510 
little bit better and so let's go ahead
and<00:01:59.860> open<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.790> actual<00:02:01.300> casing<00:02:01.840> itself<00:02:02.520> so

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
and open the actual casing itself so

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.020 
and open the actual casing itself so
looks<00:02:03.670> like<00:02:03.850> we<00:02:04.000> have<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.150> little<00:02:04.480> tab<00:02:04.720> here<00:02:05.200> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.060 

there<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.149> go<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.929> these<00:02:11.110> two<00:02:11.350> pieces<00:02:11.590> come

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
there we go so these two pieces come

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.340 
there we go so these two pieces come
apart<00:02:12.400> as<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.790> can<00:02:12.940> see<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.840> now<00:02:14.080> let's<00:02:14.230> go

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
apart as you can see and now let's go

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.510 
apart as you can see and now let's go
ahead<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.560> take<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.710> look<00:02:14.920> at<00:02:15.130> all<00:02:15.310> these

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
ahead and take a look at all these

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.090 
ahead and take a look at all these
things<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:16.000> here<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.230> can<00:02:17.350> see<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.830> is

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
things in here so as you can see this is

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.910 
things in here so as you can see this is
the<00:02:18.340> warranty<00:02:18.940> guide<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.630> we<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.739> have

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
the warranty guide and we just have

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.840 
the warranty guide and we just have
English<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:22.000> all<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.510> stuff<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.400> we<00:02:24.459> have

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
English and all that stuff and we have

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.729 
English and all that stuff and we have
all<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.120> stuff<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.780> then<00:02:26.290> we<00:02:26.530> obviously

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
all that stuff and then we obviously

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.160 
all that stuff and then we obviously
have<00:02:27.640> our<00:02:28.739> mini<00:02:29.739> USB<00:02:30.190> port<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.180> cable<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.080> as

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
have our mini USB port and cable and as

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.350 
have our mini USB port and cable and as
you<00:02:32.290> can<00:02:32.440> see<00:02:32.560> because<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.950> blue<00:02:33.100> thing

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
you can see because of the blue thing

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.680 
you can see because of the blue thing
this<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.739> actually<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.950> super<00:02:36.880> speed<00:02:37.150> port<00:02:37.510> or<00:02:37.660> a

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
this is actually a super speed port or a

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.510 
this is actually a super speed port or a
3.0<00:02:38.200> whichever<00:02:38.590> one<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.920> wanna<00:02:39.130> call<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.340> and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
3.0 whichever one you wanna call it and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.760 
3.0 whichever one you wanna call it and
this<00:02:39.970> will<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.270> lot<00:02:40.450> faster<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:41.290> has<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.530> very

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
this will be a lot faster it has a very

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.500 
this will be a lot faster it has a very
weird<00:02:42.070> port<00:02:42.370> that's<00:02:42.940> because<00:02:43.120> it's<00:02:43.300> like

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
weird port that's because it's like

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.510 
weird port that's because it's like
double<00:02:43.870> okay<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:44.920> let's<00:02:45.130> put<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.489> the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
double okay so let's put that to the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.770 
double okay so let's put that to the
side<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.910> let's<00:02:46.060> actually<00:02:46.209> go<00:02:46.570> ahead<00:02:46.600> and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
side and let's actually go ahead and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.860 
side and let's actually go ahead and
take<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.170> look<00:02:47.470> at<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.800> hard<00:02:48.100> drive<00:02:48.280> itself

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
take a look at the hard drive itself

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.470 
take a look at the hard drive itself
okay<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.830> hard<00:02:51.010> drive<00:02:51.190> was<00:02:51.459> not<00:02:51.730> metal<00:02:52.269> it

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
okay so the hard drive was not metal it

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.540 
okay so the hard drive was not metal it
is<00:02:52.510> plastic<00:02:53.290> but<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.650> does<00:02:53.890> look<00:02:54.069> like<00:02:54.099> metal

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
is plastic but it does look like metal

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.100 
is plastic but it does look like metal
and<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:55.000> looks<00:02:55.180> very<00:02:55.360> nice<00:02:55.629> it<00:02:55.840> feels<00:02:56.019> very

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
and it looks very nice it feels very

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.250 
and it looks very nice it feels very
nice<00:02:56.470> it's<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.550> little<00:02:57.760> bit<00:02:57.849> plasticky<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:59.230> I

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
nice it's a little bit plasticky but I

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.130 
nice it's a little bit plasticky but I
think<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.769> will<00:02:59.950> do<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.910> on<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.780> back<00:03:01.930> we<00:03:02.110> just

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
think it will do so on the back we just

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.660 
think it will do so on the back we just
have<00:03:02.440> these<00:03:02.590> four<00:03:02.860> rubber<00:03:03.040> feet<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.519> feel

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
have these four rubber feet that feel

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.030 
have these four rubber feet that feel
very<00:03:03.700> nice<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.390> hopefully<00:03:05.319> yeah<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.800> will

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
very nice and hopefully yeah it will

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.729 
very nice and hopefully yeah it will
move<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:07.090> much<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:08.080> will<00:03:08.170> elevate<00:03:08.319> it<00:03:08.680> to

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
move that much and it will elevate it to

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.130 
move that much and it will elevate it to
keep<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.220> cool<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:10.299> in<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.450> back<00:03:10.599> we<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:10.810> have

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
keep it cool so in the back we just have

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.750 
keep it cool so in the back we just have
some<00:03:11.379> information<00:03:11.980> here<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.549> probably

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
some information here and I probably

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.720 
some information here and I probably
shouldn't<00:03:13.090> be<00:03:13.150> showing<00:03:13.599> you<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:14.190> okay<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.250> as

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
shouldn't be showing you that okay so as

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.250 
shouldn't be showing you that okay so as
you<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:16.000> see<00:03:16.150> we<00:03:16.239> have<00:03:16.360> nothing<00:03:16.629> on<00:03:17.110> these

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
you can see we have nothing on these

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.740 
you can see we have nothing on these
edges<00:03:17.500> all<00:03:18.280> we<00:03:18.430> have<00:03:18.610> is<00:03:18.879> this<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.390> this<00:03:19.540> is

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
edges all we have is this and this is

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.740 
edges all we have is this and this is
the<00:03:19.930> superspeed<00:03:20.470> port<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.420> by<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.599> way

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
the superspeed port so and by the way

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.110 
the superspeed port so and by the way
this<00:03:22.900> will<00:03:23.110> work<00:03:23.170> for<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> 2.0<00:03:24.130> USB<00:03:24.280> ports<00:03:24.760> too

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
this will work for a 2.0 USB ports too

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.330 
this will work for a 2.0 USB ports too
it's<00:03:25.480> backwards<00:03:25.959> compatible<00:03:26.470> it's<00:03:26.620> just<00:03:26.920> for

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
it's backwards compatible it's just for

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.509 
it's backwards compatible it's just for
people<00:03:27.579> like<00:03:27.640> me<00:03:27.849> who<00:03:27.880> do<00:03:28.360> have<00:03:28.739> 3.0<00:03:29.739> ports<00:03:30.040> so

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
people like me who do have 3.0 ports so

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.910 
people like me who do have 3.0 ports so
as<00:03:30.610> you<00:03:30.700> can<00:03:30.819> see<00:03:31.319> oops<00:03:32.319> I<00:03:32.530> have<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.769> the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
as you can see oops I have that the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.960 
as you can see oops I have that the
wrong<00:03:33.069> way<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.640> plugs<00:03:34.299> in<00:03:34.569> like<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.760> wish

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
wrong way it plugs in like so and I wish

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.670 
wrong way it plugs in like so and I wish
this<00:03:37.120> cables<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.599> little<00:03:37.840> bit<00:03:37.930> longer<00:03:38.140> but<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.500> do

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
this cables a little bit longer but I do

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.910 
this cables a little bit longer but I do
have<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.280> USB<00:03:39.579> extension<00:03:40.390> cable<00:03:40.750> ready<00:03:41.620> for

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
have a USB extension cable ready for

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.619 
have a USB extension cable ready for
that

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
that

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.360 
that
so<00:03:43.629> take<00:03:43.780> off<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.019> zip<00:03:44.260> tie<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.620> here<00:03:44.950> we<00:03:45.129> have

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
so take off the zip tie and here we have

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.240 
so take off the zip tie and here we have
the<00:03:45.610> cable<00:03:45.849> that<00:03:46.629> on<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.260> yeah<00:03:47.829> that's<00:03:48.040> pretty

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
the cable that on so yeah that's pretty

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.530 
the cable that on so yeah that's pretty
much<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.700> unboxing

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
much the unboxing

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.410 
much the unboxing
okay<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:51.530> this<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.280> life<00:03:52.610> in<00:03:52.790> boxing<00:03:53.209> we're

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420
