00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.130
 today our story begins 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.619
 at a place on a florida beach 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.529
 where by the currents a 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.200
 lots of objects many times of them 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:33.250
 strangers many times of them then 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.340
 totally irrelevant the lord called 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.230
 jin cobach and who lives near the sale 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.629
 he usually spends his time exploring and 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.510
 looking at the one that is and says that 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.839
 a lot of objects have been found 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.260
 between baseballs and obviously 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:53.010
 a lot of garbage but this time it was found 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.820
 a rarity that has turned the world 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.489
 found the eye of a giant like that is the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.940
 eye of an animal or something that up 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.299
 now it has been identified as a 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.630
 possible squid or impossible fish and still 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.640
 thus the sizes of porlamar do not coincide 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.060
 what is known as this animal type 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.009
 but as always 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.840
 that nature keeps us many 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.380
 secrets at first it was said that already 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.979
 there was a DNA test and that would be a 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.140
 swordfish but then it was rectified and 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.229
 He said I do not put a DNA test 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.560
 take if very fast one week and 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.720
 normally it takes more time and they have 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.939
 wanted to rush many universities and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.429
 give your opinions but the conclusion 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.100
 it remains the same eye of a 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.860
 giant an animal client is still 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.470
 a mystery the eye as you can 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.670
 see is the size of approximately one 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.240
 softball around a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.380
 diameter of 10 centimeters and well then 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.720
 You yourselves can have the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.840
 reference with the hands of the person 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.530
 who is taking it and this gentleman came 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.830
 as well as he did he was to realize 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.130
 that was an eye 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.730
 I take it to the freezer and then I speak 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.820
 I speak to the commission and conservation of 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.460
 fish from the USA and right now even the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.460
 noaa and several other institutions 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.530
 dedicated to the ocean are therefore very 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.630
 Attentive to some of them already say that 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.160
 are beginning to investigate in fact it's 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.860
 investigating not only the arena of 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.520
 eye but the stick or structure that has 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.320
 around there are pieces of bone that 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.530
 well with the vines I would know exactly 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.630
 what is this mystery this weird eye 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.730
 that for now he has called helping the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.130
 around the world what is 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.220
 true is that the fish is and has 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.320
 exactly the same color in it 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.070
 form not of the eye as you can see in 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.930
 these photos and well maybe it's a 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:08.730
 Extremely large swordfish 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.370
 and still it's still interesting this 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.349
 note but we'll see what happens 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.659
 all kinds of theories are worth while 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.849
 It is known that it is very good to throw out 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.780
 fly the imagination a little and we'll see 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.420
 what's going on 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.790
 for now we will be waiting for some 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.829
 DNA confirmation and we will be here 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.109
 talking and see each other in the next 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.939
 also in the next hangout that will be 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.290
 these days lately we have not 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.680
 could leave because we had 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.409
 problems with the internet with our 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.269
 servers and you do not know how the 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.000
 speed that we need so that it does not 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.400
 cut but good and we'll be soon by 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.549
 there and we see each other via twitter and also 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.349
 Well, if you want to write us already 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:54.260
 we will have an email there that we will be 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.260
