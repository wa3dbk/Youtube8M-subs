00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
light at that point in time but we knew

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.179 
light at that point in time but we knew
in<00:01:27.790> about<00:01:28.000> 15<00:01:28.420> minutes<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:28.960> look<00:01:29.110> we<00:01:30.009> haven't

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.160 
in about 15 minutes and look we haven't
even<00:01:30.280> really<00:01:30.490> seen<00:01:30.939> these<00:01:31.270> lines<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:31.900> good

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
even really seen these lines and good

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.960 
even really seen these lines and good
light<00:01:32.380> other<00:01:32.680> than<00:01:32.920> like<00:01:33.220> this<00:01:33.460> one<00:01:33.759> little

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
light other than like this one little

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.510 
light other than like this one little
photo<00:01:34.270> I<00:01:34.360> had<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.930> you<00:01:35.650> know<00:01:35.770> when<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.280> lights

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
photo I had and you know when the lights

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.310 
photo I had and you know when the lights
not<00:01:36.730> shining<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.330> a<00:01:37.360> line<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.840> can't<00:01:38.110> really

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
not shining on a line you can't really

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.740 
not shining on a line you can't really
pick<00:01:38.650> out<00:01:38.800> like<00:01:39.070> what<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.640> exactly<00:01:39.820> looks<00:01:40.540> like

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
pick out like what it exactly looks like

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.000 
pick out like what it exactly looks like
so<00:01:40.960> it's<00:01:41.080> really<00:01:41.200> hard<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:41.560> kind<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.800> make<00:01:41.980> a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
so it's really hard to kind of make a

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.520 
so it's really hard to kind of make a
game<00:01:42.280> plan<00:01:42.580> on<00:01:42.610> how<00:01:42.820> you're<00:01:43.030> gonna<00:01:43.120> ski<00:01:43.450> it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
game plan on how you're gonna ski it

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.700
