00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 and I was thinking that many times one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.710
 think about what happens to your own 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.510
 city ​​I look at Milan Expo though 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.320
 a pole should be done on the whole 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.049
 Italy 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.690
 in fact, yesterday in Rome they presented the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.310
 new city tourist logo 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.050
 in the world of graphic design 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.810
 there is always a new communication 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.480
 you never get bored crazy stuff 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.099
 the marine mayor the famous mayor 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.349
 marine and its junta that up to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.960
 a few days ago he was talking about tolerating 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.189
 prostitution in some neighborhoods 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.170
 it would be like saying only in this 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.090
 neighborhood we tolerate if you do the robberies 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.489
 the supermarkets another story anyway 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.100
 the marine mayor often has pennies 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.989
 to present the new place and the new one 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.020
 tourist graphic identity of Rome 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.670
 the word rome disappears capital is not 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.620
 that just disappears remains only 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.270
 to institutional use and here I am 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.489
 they also find quite agree visas 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.079
 the last events Rome capital but 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.390
 what capital is in the head of the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.640
 people sound bad finally appears 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 this new to note that I am a lot 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.930
 ironic when I finally say before that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.519
 for the Romans they feel this long 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.830
 these two children who are sucking 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.770
 from the heir the lube how to suck from 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.360
 been a bad image that Rome has to 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.860
 forget about that is, but kill them 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.320
 politicians in the city is not that you will have to 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.750
 eliminating another matter is the crown 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.090
 is replaced by a series of balls 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.189
 colored and now when the balls come 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.189
 associated with Italy always works 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.819
 you lose the word Roma so you lose 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.759
 Italian or Latin make room for a 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.979
 more friendly and informal English and yes 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.369
 invent this genius or genius 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.679
 the new claim the new slogan inside the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.439
 Rome tourist logo will be a rum and 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:10.549
 you that as you see with the colors of the 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.579
 frank and romy letters and new genialata 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.860
 marketing cool you go well it's nice 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.959
 Cute word game for tourists 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.360
 foreigners for a while approximate 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.790
 they seemed to be pomes and new to vodafone I will stay 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.380
 bevis massacres and enough between other then if 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.720
 one does not know English for example it 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.370
 you should read save some stuff 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.650
 would generally be the end because yes 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.069
 they would read man you seemed to be homme 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.140
 and you got the gypsy portal Roma 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.360
 this was exaggerated just to laugh 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.790
 state they have been 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.470
 the logo was presented last night at 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.290
 macro and there were complaints 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.090
 now it is not like other filthes seen in 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.769
 previous days a few pictures for 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.870
 expo that seemed made by a child 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.910
 of 12 years, however, were not lacking 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.380
 the first and foremost complaints was 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.569
 this one on the choice of language 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.480
 English because you say but damn it 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.370
 rome the latin the she-wolf says we replace 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.720
 the colosseum instead of the she-wolf because 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.400
 more oh well but the wolf girls the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.040
 symbol of the city this too 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.660
 call roma rom which by the way is 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.340
 even a city ​​in the united states does not 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.019
 I remember in Georgia if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.180
 even mussolini had given him 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.590
 a wolf these here in america because the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.989
 which one calls a city just like in 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.180
 honor of rome but I said if you ask yourself 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.700
 of Rome and that in the New York is not 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.530

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.610

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.970
 very cute ste colored palettes that you 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.890
 they transform the thousand elements young 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.959
 cool maybe a little rough there 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.190
 you have thought the most however the Romans are not 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.260
 mind in mind that the football of 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.880
 models spend the money of Rome 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.350

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.410
 was presented was also present 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.390
 study that designed it in the area and who 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.610
 want to understand understand they presented and 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.010
 they told me no since I didn't 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.019
 I like it we will do another we will do it 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.820
 force a contest but the money if any 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.410

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.510
 his money to what he wants so much 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.459
 I'm in Milan already I have my dicks with 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.740
 the only real thing he did to me 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.910
 a little bit turn up your nose but maybe 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.040
 just because I want to do that 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.830
 professional was the joke 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.540
 let's say a little bit risky from 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.430
 someone who does not understand that not 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.350
 works in the branding field of the 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.570
 communication of the councilor to 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.580
 marinelli culture that during the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.500
 presentation of this new image 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.919
 of this new brand he said with 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.229
 this new logo we want to overcome by 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.660
 by far the isle of new york brand 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.120
 there is a tent for the sector 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.310
 sounds like a blasphemy stuff here 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.850
 then he quoted the green man of the traffic lights 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.979
 of Berlin cited the 3x of Amsterdam 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.440
 etcetera etcetera etc. common wants 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.330
 intentions ie fantastic one so must 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.640
 work motivated soccer and love new york 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.930
 I'm a magnamo from Rome 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.210
 this spirit since it has been 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.060
 exceeded as number of tourists also from 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.310
 berlin a city that does not have a dick from 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.470
 visit are in four pieces of wall and 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.370
 the different bulbs in the part stands 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.930
 in the west part 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.120
 no it is not true conceal things though 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.470
 fuck compared to rome nothing you're a 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.480
 supermarket berdich and what is berlin 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.250
 so now they will surely do another one 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.560
 however, this new competition 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.210
 tourist brand for the city of Rome 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.040
 it's not that I liked it so much but I want it done 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.290
 what he always complains about is there 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.360
 cute graphically done well however a 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.700
 brand should represent values 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.680
 or at least the history of a place 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.170
 above all a brand linked to one 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.780
 city ​​and Rome of history has just one 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.310
 little bit and that 15 when there is too much to 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.020
 tell how the story of Rome 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.210
 ends up no longer tells anything see 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.100
 as you will see in the world of graphics and 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.900
 communication never gets bored 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.420
 especially in Italy where you work 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.700
 the types come out then from 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.600
 today we forget the Italian Latin 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.190
 rome becomes romanian and new rom maybe i have 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.750
 it happens the thing is a tribute to alberto 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.790
 deaf an American in rome at the end 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:17.010
 enter into more beautiful than resist his hahn 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:20.160
 air one born enel just think that already 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.660
 tiredness that then I mark for Rome 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.490
 in the end we need to bother using 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.650
 people are the squares face Sora 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.360
 lella and is made that is the one there more 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.200
 icon of the one in the world that can you 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.200
 to represent
