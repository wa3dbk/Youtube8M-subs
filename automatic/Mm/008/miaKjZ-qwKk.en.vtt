00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello welcome one more day does bad hd 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.940
 I bring you gameplay in terminal playing 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.799
 with the msr and good first thing to say that 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.630
 I feel has picked up this game so 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.880
 cinema that I hope I hope there is not 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.019
 many weird things because good and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.130
 we know what cinema mode is like in this 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.770
 game there is no more still wearing a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.630
 sniper does not really go 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.430
 you know not to be true how will 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.519
 work is going to be a game as you see 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.099
 that I start quite badly enough I do not 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.340
 I'm going to lie or I'm going to cut it because 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.019
 well I really want you to see that even 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.550
 starting badly a game can be 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.320
 you can end up winning even taking 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.809
 a carrying a sniper rifle 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 as in this case not as in how it arrives 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.440
 the msr with large chargers as you see 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.140
 I'm taking blinders diego stunners sorry 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.730
 He also carried the throwing knife and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.719
 well I go with storms of assault I go with 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.760
 him with the ub with the predictor and with him and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.489
 with the cobra look there the hit market what 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.379
 who sent me cop and as you see a start 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.149
 starting pretty pretty nefarious 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.180
 I hope that as you see here the shots do not 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.309
 they go very deviated they do not go no you are not going 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.750
 wrong in this mode movies this game to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.980
 less then good less bad 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.750
 because the truth could not be 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.310
 aggravated another way was playing by 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.960
 I played this game and I said good 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.420
 I'm going to record here here failing shots 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.100
 I take out these two that bite the dust 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.620
 that we end up seeing the dust 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.690
 I was warming my hand like 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.030
 says not the truth in the end it turned out to be 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.900
 a good game set here I already had 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.110
 three streaks 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.470
 I'm going with quick draws 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.940
 sleight of hand and shooter that for me 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.340
 Taste is the best you can bring in a 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.590
 It's a fixed card here pointing to pulled out 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.350
 shot false and maximum that shot also pass 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.100
 so in the normal game already sac 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.600
 predator I'll tie 300 here already already the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.890
 hand has warmed the truth that the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.360
 rifle goes very well I carry it with 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.610
 stability many people take it with 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.250
 speed to me is going much better with 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.660
 stability I do not know color comes advantage 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.149
 with the last advantage that can lead 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.580
 of all they give much much better than 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.580
 with that with speed but good is 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.320
 question of taste is a matter of 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.060
 question of tastes and like everything everyone 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.830
 can decide how to take it I 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.720
 speed do not notice here that one-armed 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.280
 I am very much but good is what there is 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.069
 no I'm not playing with the rifle 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.079
 Frank, I'm just starting 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.999
 to see how to get sensations 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:20.120
 to laugh and have fun 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:22.280
 here and as I say I expected that there 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.650
 much worse the departure game of the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.959
 cinema mode and rather worse I did not think that 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.950
 I was going to go so well and I hope that in black 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.389
 ops 2 go go well go as in black 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.819
 ops 1 that the true cinema mode of 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.500
 black ops 1 was a delight was quite 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.819
 pretty amazing it was like 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.250
 you were playing a normal game 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.079
 as if he achieved 6 live but without 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.310
 have to be swallowing the lag of 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.590
 record live at least as 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.739
 capturing as I say I generate 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.180
 dairy to says that he dies again 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.730
 I say that I generate laja so it is me 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.159
 impossible to capture live let's say 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.530
 I need to buy the pvr I think look 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.329
 here another one that die this man is going to 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.250
 be the protagonist in an almost 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.500
 traced at the end of the game what 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.780
 you're going to see practically traced not 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.669
 it has seems the same it seems that the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.319
 cut of stuck but it is not the case no no 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.840
 I 've done what you're going to see at the end of the 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.879
 starting here already 950 600 the truth the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.230
 it charges quite effective enough these 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.540
 men jumping here like he was the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.889
 circus I do not know very well playing here not 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.460
 I understand very well doing the one but 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.340
 good 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.950
 white market again and marquez marquez 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.480
 my mother me when they shoot me with the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.540
 franco I do not know why they always kill me 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.300
 without any contemplation without 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.120
 nothing with a bullet here you see other 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.250
 jumping doing the circus in order the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.600
 good people jumping and me passing it 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.730
 well the truth with the franc rifle 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.160
 so double a different approach to the game 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.590
 a little tired already of fixos there is that 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.120
 kidnapping that dies the truth little 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.070
 tired playing with normal weapons I do not know 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.810
 or what weapons to use there and here I'm going 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.520
 to shit fixes tried to kill him but the 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.290
 turret but he did not throw me back what 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.560
 enough he thought he did not have and he did not have 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.080
 angle and as you see one thousand 350 and 650 a 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.720
 quite interesting game 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.310
 quite fast either did not cost me 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.140
 much either I had a hard time not 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.870
 win the game 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.670
 well very very happy with the gun in the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.260
 true that I expected it worse there already 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.120
 trying to definitively come down here the 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.130
 last scene that I tell you has twist and 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.200
 this was a step before too but it's 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.000
 in the death chamber nothing so nothing 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.530
 I hope you liked it but that a 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.330
 game mole in the franc I'm going to 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.610
 try to upload more than franco start 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.260
 for one to change a bit and even 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.370
 inside the warfare mode 3 and nothing 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.540
 I hope you liked it but that it 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.320
 has molado and see you in the next 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.320
 video a greeting
