ledge without it reaching to the power I

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.449 
ledge without it reaching to the power I
have<00:02:55.299> just<00:02:55.630> one<00:02:55.840> bad<00:02:56.200> point<00:02:56.620> about<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.160> speak

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
have just one bad point about this speak

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.309 
have just one bad point about this speak
system<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.359> it's<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.720> fact<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.049> is<00:02:59.290> a

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
system and it's the fact that is a

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.699 
system and it's the fact that is a
complete<00:02:59.829> fingerprint<00:03:00.609> magnet<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:01.269> think<00:03:02.139> that

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
complete fingerprint magnet I think that

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:03.990 
complete fingerprint magnet I think that
in<00:03:02.859> this<00:03:03.069> sense<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.609> product<00:03:03.819> would<00:03:03.940> be

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
in this sense the product would be

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.819 
in this sense the product would be
better<00:03:04.329> if<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.840> had<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.989> matte<00:03:05.260> finish<00:03:05.440> rather

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
better if I had a matte finish rather

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:06.990 
better if I had a matte finish rather
than<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.130> glossy<00:03:06.370> finish

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
than a glossy finish

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.879 
than a glossy finish
apart<00:03:07.720> from<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.019> have<00:03:08.109> no<00:03:08.410> complaints
