beginners tutorial what we're going to
look<00:00:05.180> at<00:00:05.269> today<00:00:05.540> is<00:00:05.569> creating<00:00:06.229> a<00:00:06.319> simple

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
look at today is creating a simple

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.490 
look at today is creating a simple
c-sharp<00:00:07.099> script<00:00:07.639> to<00:00:08.330> change<00:00:08.570> the<00:00:08.719> color<00:00:08.929> of<00:00:09.230> an

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
c-sharp script to change the color of an

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.369 
c-sharp script to change the color of an
object<00:00:10.570> so<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:11.629> first<00:00:11.959> thing<00:00:12.110> to<00:00:12.139> do<00:00:12.289> is

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:12.379 
object so the first thing to do is

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.739 
object so the first thing to do is
create<00:00:12.559> yourself<00:00:12.830> a<00:00:12.919> new<00:00:13.099> project<00:00:13.309> and<00:00:13.910> when

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:14.749 
create yourself a new project and when

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:15.940 
create yourself a new project and when
you<00:00:14.839> do<00:00:15.019> you<00:00:15.200> should<00:00:15.379> just<00:00:15.619> come<00:00:15.799> up<00:00:15.919> with

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
you do you should just come up with

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.830 
you do you should just come up with
scene<00:00:16.430> like<00:00:16.580> this<00:00:16.730> just<00:00:17.180> a<00:00:17.270> simple<00:00:17.630> main

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
scene like this just a simple main

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.200 
scene like this just a simple main
camera<00:00:18.320> what<00:00:19.310> we're<00:00:19.430> going<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:19.580> do<00:00:19.760> is<00:00:20.000> we're

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
camera what we're going to do is we're

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.900 
camera what we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:20.330> to<00:00:20.390> add<00:00:20.570> a<00:00:21.020> new<00:00:21.800> game<00:00:22.040> object<00:00:22.220> first<00:00:22.730> of

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
going to add a new game object first of

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.410 
going to add a new game object first of
all<00:00:23.030> so<00:00:23.240> go<00:00:23.690> up<00:00:23.720> to<00:00:23.870> game<00:00:24.140> object<00:00:24.290> create<00:00:25.100> other

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
all so go up to game object create other

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.960 
all so go up to game object create other
and<00:00:26.420> choose<00:00:26.660> terrain<00:00:27.790> so<00:00:28.790> we've<00:00:28.880> got

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
and choose terrain so we've got

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.380 
and choose terrain so we've got
ourselves<00:00:29.060> a<00:00:29.330> basic<00:00:29.720> terrain<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:32.119> next

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
ourselves a basic terrain the next

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.389 
ourselves a basic terrain the next
component<00:00:32.660> if<00:00:33.410> you<00:00:33.499> go<00:00:33.620> back<00:00:33.829> to<00:00:34.039> game<00:00:34.219> object

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
component if you go back to game object

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.060 
component if you go back to game object
create<00:00:35.149> over<00:00:35.589> we're<00:00:36.589> just<00:00:36.710> going<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:36.859> choose

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
create over we're just going to choose

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.669 
create over we're just going to choose
directional<00:00:37.699> light<00:00:38.050> main<00:00:39.050> reason<00:00:39.409> for<00:00:39.440> this

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:39.679 
directional light main reason for this

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.709 
directional light main reason for this
is<00:00:39.859> just<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:40.280> it<00:00:40.460> puts<00:00:40.909> the<00:00:40.969> light<00:00:41.210> across<00:00:41.570> the

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
is just so it puts the light across the

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.209 
is just so it puts the light across the
whole<00:00:41.899> scene<00:00:42.199> so<00:00:42.710> you<00:00:42.769> can<00:00:42.949> see<00:00:43.039> what's

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
whole scene so you can see what's

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.559 
whole scene so you can see what's
happening<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:44.859> the<00:00:45.859> next<00:00:46.129> object<00:00:46.569> will

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:47.569 
happening and the next object will

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:52.899 
happening and the next object will
create<00:00:47.870> it's<00:00:48.530> just<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.859> simple<00:00:49.480> capsule<00:00:51.909> what

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
create it's just a simple capsule what

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:54.549 
create it's just a simple capsule what
you<00:00:53.030> want<00:00:53.179> to<00:00:53.239> do<00:00:53.359> is<00:00:53.420> just<00:00:53.539> position<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:54.260> on

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
you want to do is just position that on

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.599 
you want to do is just position that on
your<00:00:55.039> screen<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:56.300> can<00:00:56.539> see<00:00:56.809> it<00:00:57.519> I'm<00:00:58.519> just

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609

your screen so you can see it I'm just
going<00:00:58.789> to<00:00:58.850> move<00:00:58.999> it<00:00:59.120> around<00:00:59.149> here<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.229> it

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
going to move it around here so it

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.719 
going to move it around here so it
should<00:01:00.469> be<00:01:00.499> just<00:01:00.889> in<00:01:01.010> front<00:01:01.190> of<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.370> camera

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
should be just in front of the camera

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.740 
should be just in front of the camera

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
on the screen doesn't do anything fancy

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.490 
on the screen doesn't do anything fancy
we'll<00:01:11.719> get<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:12.380> in<00:01:12.530> later<00:01:12.950> tutorials

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
we'll get to that in later tutorials

what<00:01:15.500> we're<00:01:15.619> going<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.770> do<00:01:15.920> now<00:01:16.130> is<00:01:16.369> create<00:01:16.579> a

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
what we're going to do now is create a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.649 
what we're going to do now is create a
new<00:01:17.060> C<00:01:17.509> sharp<00:01:17.840> script<00:01:18.549> so<00:01:19.549> any<00:01:19.729> assets<00:01:20.240> just

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
new C sharp script so any assets just

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.090 
new C sharp script so any assets just
right-click<00:01:21.469> choose<00:01:21.939> create<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:24.829> C

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.359 
right-click choose create and the C
sharp<00:01:25.399> script<00:01:25.909> I<00:01:27.789> will<00:01:28.789> just<00:01:28.939> call<00:01:29.060> this<00:01:29.119> color

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
sharp script I will just call this color

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.469 
sharp script I will just call this color
it's<00:01:31.369> all<00:01:31.490> we're<00:01:31.609> going<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:31.789> do<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:32.030> change<00:01:32.240> the

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
it's all we're going to do is change the

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.039 
it's all we're going to do is change the
color<00:01:32.509> based<00:01:33.320> on<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.530> key<00:01:33.740> press<00:01:34.930> once<00:01:35.930> you

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
color based on a key press once you

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.889 
color based on a key press once you
created<00:01:36.439> it<00:01:36.680> double<00:01:37.009> click<00:01:37.899> hopefully

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
created it double click hopefully

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.550 
created it double click hopefully
that'll<00:01:39.079> open<00:01:39.229> up<00:01:39.500> in<00:01:40.280> your<00:01:40.549> application

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
that'll open up in your application

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.819 
that'll open up in your application

what<00:01:48.829> we've<00:01:48.979> got<00:01:49.250> here<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:50.000> just<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.960> very

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
what we've got here is just the very

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.889 
what we've got here is just the very
basic<00:01:51.590> layout<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.100> script<00:01:52.750> we're<00:01:53.750> going

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
basic layout of the script we're going

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.169 
basic layout of the script we're going
to<00:01:53.960> use<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.590> avoid<00:01:54.979> update<00:01:55.490> this<00:01:55.640> time<00:01:55.909> so

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
to use the avoid update this time so

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.120 
to use the avoid update this time so
this<00:01:56.359> is<00:01:56.420> called<00:01:56.780> once<00:01:57.079> per<00:01:57.289> frame<00:01:57.619> in<00:01:57.920> your

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
this is called once per frame in your

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.120 
this is called once per frame in your
game<00:01:58.689> and<00:01:59.689> it's<00:01:59.869> in<00:01:59.990> here<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.710> will<00:02:00.890> create

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
game and it's in here that will create

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.660 
game and it's in here that will create
our<00:02:01.219> first<00:02:01.520> piece<00:02:01.729> of<00:02:01.789> code<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:03.979> just<00:02:04.009> between

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
our first piece of code so just between

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.719 
our first piece of code so just between
the<00:02:05.020> brackets<00:02:06.020> here<00:02:06.259> press<00:02:06.829> Enter<00:02:07.130> make<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.579> bit

the brackets here press Enter make a bit

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.530 
the brackets here press Enter make a bit
of<00:02:07.820> space<00:02:08.440> start<00:02:09.440> by<00:02:09.560> typing<00:02:09.769> it<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.580> if<00:02:10.759> so

of space start by typing it the if so

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.699 
of space start by typing it the if so
we're<00:02:11.629> going<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.780> create<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.019> very<00:02:12.200> simple<00:02:12.560> if

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
we're going to create a very simple if

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.900 
we're going to create a very simple if
statement<00:02:13.220> if

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
statement if

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.730 
statement if
statements<00:02:14.330> just<00:02:14.480> check<00:02:14.780> what<00:02:15.260> you're<00:02:15.410> doing

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
statements just check what you're doing

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.210 
statements just check what you're doing
so<00:02:15.950> if<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.250> do<00:02:16.400> something<00:02:16.850> do<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:18.080> if<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.100> do

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
so if you do something do this if you do

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.510 
so if you do something do this if you do
something<00:02:19.400> else<00:02:19.640> do<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:22.400> what

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
something else do that and so on so what

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.920 
something else do that and so on so what
we're<00:02:22.610> going<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.790> check<00:02:22.940> here<00:02:23.240> is<00:02:23.480> if<00:02:23.690> the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
we're going to check here is if the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.190 
we're going to check here is if the
input<00:02:24.890> key<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:26.600> input<00:02:26.870> dots<00:02:27.440> get<00:02:27.920> key<00:02:28.870> down

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.620 

open<00:02:33.200> brackets<00:02:34.540> will<00:02:35.540> go<00:02:35.690> for<00:02:35.900> key<00:02:36.110> codes<00:02:37.630> dot

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
open brackets will go for key codes dot

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.150 
open brackets will go for key codes dot
R<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.150> letter<00:02:41.330> R<00:02:41.600> we<00:02:41.960> just<00:02:42.770> need<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:42.980> close

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
R so the letter R we just need to close

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.400 
R so the letter R we just need to close
off<00:02:43.370> our<00:02:43.520> brackets<00:02:44.000> best<00:02:44.930> thing<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.200> this

don't need to name it or specify we just
call<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.750> game<00:03:50.989> object<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:52.930> what<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.020> need<00:03:54.140> to

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
call it game object and what you need to

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.570 
call it game object and what you need to
do<00:03:54.350> then<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.650> come<00:03:54.770> down<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.010> couple<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.370> lines

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
and you can actually just copy this code

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.290 
and you can actually just copy this code
here<00:03:58.959> paste<00:03:59.959> it<00:04:00.170> back<00:04:00.290> in<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.730> this<00:04:02.090> time
