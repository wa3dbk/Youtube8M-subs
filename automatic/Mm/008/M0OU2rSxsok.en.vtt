interchangeable<00:01:04.140> thumb<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.189> we've<00:01:05.670> talked

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
interchangeable thumb it's we've talked

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.460 
interchangeable thumb it's we've talked
about<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.150> couple<00:01:06.330> different<00:01:06.780> systems<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.260> think

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
about a couple different systems I think

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.170 
about a couple different systems I think
we've<00:01:07.560> talked<00:01:07.680> about<00:01:07.770> switch<00:01:08.070> grip<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
we've talked about switch grip at the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.730 
we've talked about switch grip at the
time<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.540> probably<00:01:09.810> possibly<00:01:10.470> weren't

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
time we probably possibly weren't

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440 
time we probably possibly weren't
carrying<00:01:10.979> device<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.729> think<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.090> did<00:01:12.210> we

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
carrying device it I think we did we

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.030 
carrying device it I think we did we
thought<00:01:12.659> about<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.170> an<00:01:13.290> episode<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.619> two<00:01:13.860> as

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
thought about in an episode of two as

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.190 
thought about in an episode of two as
well<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.580> they're<00:01:15.210> they're<00:01:15.659> basically

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
well but they're they're basically

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.870 
well but they're they're basically
they're<00:01:16.409> interchangeable<00:01:16.680> some<00:01:17.220> system<00:01:17.640> so

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
they're interchangeable some system so

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.140 
they're interchangeable some system so
this<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:19.229> unique<00:01:19.619> case<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.520> most<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
this is one unique case but most of the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.580 
this is one unique case but most of the
time<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.450> usual<00:01:21.840> when<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.110> from<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
time is usual when you go from all the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.590 
time is usual when you go from all the
ball<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.920> get<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> exact<00:01:23.430> same<00:01:23.670> feel<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
ball you get the exact same feel and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.630 
ball you get the exact same feel and
it's<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.710> also<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:26.070> multiple

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
it's all you can also have multiple

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
it's all you can also have multiple
sides<00:01:27.150> thumbs<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.500> swell

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
sides thumbs so if you know you swell

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.920 
sides thumbs so if you know you swell
you<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.939> using<00:01:30.150> tape<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.780> have

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
against using the same equipment

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.970 
against using the same equipment
during<00:02:11.550> Uighur<00:02:12.450> tournament<00:02:12.900> gray<00:02:13.290> yeah<00:02:13.950> I

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
during Uighur tournament gray yeah I

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.470 
during Uighur tournament gray yeah I
agree<00:02:14.310> with<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.700> common<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.360> may

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
agree with the common here that you may

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.089 
agree with the common here that you may
annoy<00:02:15.690> people<00:02:16.140> you're<00:02:16.260> bowling<00:02:16.470> with<00:02:16.770> if<00:02:16.980> you

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
annoy people you're bowling with if you

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.770 
annoy people you're bowling with if you
end<00:02:17.250> up<00:02:17.370> causing<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.880> delay<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.510> actually

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
end up causing a delay and I actually

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.580 
end up causing a delay and I actually
thought<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:19.290> was<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> rule<00:02:20.120> about<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:22.260> if

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
thought there was a rule about this if

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.490 
thought there was a rule about this if
it<00:02:22.830> calls<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.190> delay<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.849> agree<00:02:24.810> most<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
it calls the delay I agree most of the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.080 
it calls the delay I agree most of the
time<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.739> should<00:02:25.860> cause<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.400> leg<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.849> guess

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
time it should cause of the leg I guess

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.940 
time it should cause of the leg I guess
the<00:02:27.209> only<00:02:27.300> way<00:02:27.420> maybe<00:02:27.810> cause<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.350> delay<00:02:28.590> as<00:02:28.800> if

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the only way maybe cause a delay as if

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.199 
the only way maybe cause a delay as if
you<00:02:29.100> were<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.340> lead<00:02:29.520> off<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.850> he<00:02:29.940> was<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
you were the lead off and he was the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.660 
you were the lead off and he was the
anchor<00:02:30.540> vice<00:02:30.780> versa<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.069> there<00:02:32.400> was<00:02:32.520> that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
anchor vice versa and there was that

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.160 
anchor vice versa and there was that
little<00:02:32.730> bit<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.090> an<00:02:33.270> overlap<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.900> otherwise

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
little bit of an overlap but otherwise

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.140 
little bit of an overlap but otherwise
it<00:02:34.440> shouldn't<00:02:34.739> cause<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.069> delay<00:02:35.190> tournament

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
it shouldn't cause of delay tournament

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.720 
it shouldn't cause of delay tournament
play<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.480> made<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.700> format<00:02:38.700> of

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
play is made because of the format of

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.949 
play is made because of the format of
the<00:02:38.850> tournament<00:02:39.300> would<00:02:39.360> may<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.569> different

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the tournament would may be different

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.809 
the tournament would may be different
than<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.170> format<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.680> lead<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.610> thought

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
than the format of a lead and I thought

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.030 
than the format of a lead and I thought
there<00:02:42.060> was<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> rule<00:02:42.450> about<00:02:42.599> delaying<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
there was a rule about delaying the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.830 
there was a rule about delaying the
speed<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.459> play<00:02:44.580> because<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.360> but<00:02:45.569> right

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
speed of play because of that but right

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.530 
speed of play because of that but right
just<00:02:46.110> don't<00:02:46.410> delay<00:02:46.739> yeah<00:02:47.040> play<00:02:47.430> if<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.150> can

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
just don't delay yeah play if you can

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.259 
just don't delay yeah play if you can
adjust<00:02:48.870> your<00:02:49.230> order<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:49.950> staggered<00:02:50.790> put

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
adjust your order just staggered put

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.370
