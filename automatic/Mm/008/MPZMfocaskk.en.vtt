00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.359
 Assassin's creed five raises many questions 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.580
 on every fan of action adventures 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.960
 wonders how it will be after the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.960
 fourth part of the series 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.910
 As we know, Assassin's creed plays 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.350
 in two times once the past 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.390
 and our present 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.770
 after the open end of the fourth part 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.510
 is the actual main story only 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.370
 even more questionable speak of the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.710
 Present in the penultimate part of the saga 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.870
 Say Assassin's creed 3 died ours 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 person of miles with the developer 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.989
 ubisoft reading slider with our 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.550
 hope to find out how 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.769
 main story will continue now 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.360
 So there are still all ways open because 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.800
 since the third part had story 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.519
 our went was unfortunately not a piece 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 brought further 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.660
 although assassin's creed 5 was not yet 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.460
 officially announced but it should be with 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.410
 safety to come for a release 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.510
 Now it is known that ubisoft with black 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.309
 are deliberately aware of many open paths 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.840
 wanted to keep free and therefore it too 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.190
 proved that we are the present 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.899
 fourth partly not without reason in the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.030
 may spend ego-perspective 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.800
 because it is clear that we are there now 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.570
 did not stand up there yet 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.920
 firmly currently leads ubisoft 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.090
 market research and surveyed the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.320
 Fans after their discretion 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.990
 It's about many different things 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.310
 Criteria, on the one hand, is whether they are 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.020
 play the rather the stealth action 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.160
 or want the orders to kill 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.050
 the other is about the 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.670
 characterization of the hero whom we 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.470
 in the fourth part were allowed to experience 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.660
 because even looks like this is up 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.220
 not sure yet today 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.759
 ubisoft himself from the pirates in the garbage too 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.440
 remove 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.910
 So that means a completely new one 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.319
 game and thus a completely new 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.660
 story assassin's creed saga 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.009
 could also emerge in the point 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.869
 the developers are all possible ways 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.819
 kept open because we in some 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.679
 to be able to discover the pcs in the 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.690
 the last part was already on it 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.160
 already a lot of allusions for this 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.170
 we find examples about possible 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.030
 Assassin's creed title which in Egypt 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.890
 or japan could take place 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.929
 fitting to this is a potential one 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.940
 period already clearly defines the 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.099
 maternal bloodline of the deceased 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.520
 Heroes of Compassion are traced 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.740
 until the twelfth century 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.570
 because from there, the uroma begins the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.220
 time which until the sixteenth 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.050
 century and under the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.970
 domination of the Chicago family is 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.099
 that means that it is possible 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.989
 is that assassin's creed 5 in japan 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.849
 plays the rumored want the 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.680
 developer ubisoft with the help of 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.930
 Market research your games so much 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.299
 that may even perfect that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.069
 leased ones could suffer that would be 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.560
 the first time that an assassin's creed 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.390
 title only after christmas appears too 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.160
