restricted<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:17.840> gas<00:01:18.840> tube<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:20.060> took<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.360> off

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
restricted the gas tube I took it off

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.200 
restricted the gas tube I took it off
for<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.740> reason<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.369> don't<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.759> know<00:01:24.030> if

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.880 
for that reason I don't really know if
that's<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> good<00:01:24.509> reason<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.200> also<00:01:25.350> took<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.770> off
