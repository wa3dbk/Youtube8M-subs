00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.620
 looks 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.270
 the moors of the bar defined as 2 stone breakwaters advancing 4 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.499
 miles inside pinning the link of the duck pond with the sea 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.810
 are located in the cities of bright river 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.859
 in north joseph 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.019
 due to the sedimentary geological formation composed mainly of sand 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.140
 and clay 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.290
 the stones used in the work of extension of the piers are extracted 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.600
 of a quarry 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.510
 located in the municipality of capão do leão 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.680
 90 kilometers from rio grande city 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.350
 with the resumption of exploration of the quarry 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.220
 shortly after knowing that it's time to delay 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.090
 the carioca evair 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.390
 bush as alternative access for transporting stones 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.820
 almost we will not wait for the next berth of ownership of the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.110
 Federal University of Pelotas 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.130
 which gives access to the 116th world number 1 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.670
 the largest located on the river 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.860
 are stored the explosives 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.180
 used in crews of rock 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.630
 the amount 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.200
 fabrics used detonation 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 on average 900 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.380
 during the detonation of the stones 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.080
 the previously isolated area 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.250
 so as not to pose risks to workers 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 and the local community 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.020
 10 after the detonation 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.310
 the equipment is re-installed at the construction site and the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.059
 workers to occupy these functions I started then 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.229
 the verification of the large volume of losses 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.879
 in the event of loss flakes being produced that are greater than intended 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:29.999
 the work of unfolding its projects is carried out using 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.999
 routers 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:41.259
 3 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.259
 d 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.170
 the stones are properly loaded from the trucks with the help of 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.509
 loaders 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:02.269
 according to the proposal this pressures of the fiscals of the second summit exist 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.429
 units with a truck board 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:09.729
 the time of arrival and all this type of stone clandestine origin 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.150
 verdão 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.230
 when they are transported immediately to their destination in Rio Grande, I am going to 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.509
 certainty of 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.099
 with that each key 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.649
 a specific location 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.649
 awaiting the moment to be thrown into the sea 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:38.509
 Brazilian maritime planning, I now have the barge 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.440
 who performs 16 trips a day 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.750
 depending on the conditions of the sea carrying six hundred and forty 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.160
 tons of stone per trip the ship's loading is done in the 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
 boat dock next to storage yard 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.079
 counts on the aid of excavating machines 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.430
 the loaded ship sails for an hour with the aid of a tug 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.669
 approximately 50 families the equivalent of 15 kilometers 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.539
 when you arrive at the launching point of the stones 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:26.259
 otavio was positioned with the help of GPS the global positioning system 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.979
 differential that eliminates the possibility of launching 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.369
 of the stones went to the place indicated in the project 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.539
 their Asian bipartite hull 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.699
 and the losses are thrown into the sea 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.919
 completing the work cycle 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:44.809
 who comes back 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:45.830
 this action 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.469
 transport this occasion 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:49.719
 the shipment 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.419
 stone throwing
