00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.889
 on low heat you can fry any 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:05.889
 fish 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.320
 because fish can be very fast 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.809
 perry fried under low heat 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.260
 you will have more time to follow 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.160
 for its cooking low temperature 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.200
 will allow to keep a maximum of moisture to that 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:31.150
 moment of frying center 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:33.160
 and the outer part does not overcook and here 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.890
 why is it hot on low heat 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.040
 ideal for tender pieces 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.040
 fish 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:47.230
 the only disadvantage of this method is 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.230
 not to get a golden crust 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.290
 for frying fish over low heat better 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.750
 use a non-stick pan 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.850
 coated 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:09.030
 if you take a stainless pan 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.030
 become then over low heat the fish will stick 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.619
 pour some oil and heat 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.619
 pan over medium heat 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.280
 for additional 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.250
 Aroma can use creamy 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:37.659
 oil as it does not burn on the weak 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:40.390
 fire surface of the fish can be slightly 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:50.350
 cover with vegetable oil so she 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:52.750
 reddened and not burned put 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.720
 fish to the pan that side down 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.890
 who will you serve her when 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.860
 fish is preparing 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.270
 you should hear such a light hissing 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.640
 sound 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.000
 remember a simple rule cook fish 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:17.110
 on the first side 2 3 of the total time 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.660
 cooking chilled fish out 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.769
 the refrigerator will heat up longer on 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.459
 the first side 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:28.019
 for cooking the back side 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.019
 it only takes a third of the time 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:37.510
 thinner pieces of fish can 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.760
 turn over as soon as the edges become 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.760
 opaque make it neat 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.980
 turn over thin pieces especially 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.070
 difficult to use better wide 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.310
 spatula as she puts on a piece 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.310
 wholly 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.080
 look at the surface of the fish not too 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.020
 hot 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:16.050
 so hold the fish with the other hand 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:18.780
 when you turn over thicker 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.690
 chunks of fish should be turned over when 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:27.030
 about half the thickness and the piece will become 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.510
 opaque remember whatever 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.160
 thickness and piece after turning 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:38.730
 take a third of all the time to 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:44.370
 full readiness and the last more often 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:47.490
 check the readiness of the fish look 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.740
 lesson basics cooking fish to 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.740
 find out how to check her readiness
