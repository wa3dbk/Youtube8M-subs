1952<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.870> think<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.730> engine<00:00:14.990> all<00:00:15.990> right<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
1952 I think is engine all right the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.260 
1952 I think is engine all right the
side<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:19.189> this<00:00:20.189> will<00:00:20.400> all<00:00:20.580> work<00:00:20.609> look<00:00:21.090> what

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
side here this will all work look what

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.400 
side here this will all work look what
looks<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.660> coal<00:00:22.020> bunker<00:00:23.119> is<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:26.130> exhaust

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
looks like a coal bunker is the exhaust

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.490 
looks like a coal bunker is the exhaust
brick<00:00:28.410> honeycomb<00:00:29.369> walls<00:00:29.670> within<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.500> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
brick honeycomb walls within this and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.049 
brick honeycomb walls within this and
the<00:00:31.740> exhaust<00:00:32.070> passes<00:00:32.489> through<00:00:32.700> each<00:00:32.850> one

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
the exhaust passes through each one

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.120 
the exhaust passes through each one
making<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.510> quieter<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.020> quieter<00:00:34.140> listen

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
making it quieter and quieter listen

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
making it quieter and quieter listen
that's<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.790> end<00:00:35.910> work<00:00:36.149> product<00:00:36.600> where<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
that's the end work product where the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.369 
that's the end work product where the
exhaust<00:00:37.530> comes<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:38.360> that<00:00:39.390> hello<00:00:39.870> check<00:00:40.050> boxes

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
exhaust comes out that hello check boxes

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.040 
exhaust comes out that hello check boxes
on<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> wall<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.430> air<00:00:41.550> intake<00:00:42.050> I've

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
on the wall that's the air intake I've

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.959 
on the wall that's the air intake I've
got<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> little<00:00:43.410> filter<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.980> there<00:00:44.190> which

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
got a little filter in there which

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700 
got a little filter in there which
there's<00:00:45.510> more<00:00:45.690> nice<00:00:45.930> comes<00:00:46.230> off<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> air

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
there's more nice comes off the air

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.279 
there's more nice comes off the air
intake<00:00:47.129> when<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.610> off<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> exhaust

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
intake when there is off the exhaust

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.160 
intake when there is off the exhaust
I'll<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.500> open<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> door<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:51.050> view<00:00:52.050> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
I'll just open the door now and view it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.650 
I'll just open the door now and view it
from<00:00:52.289> outside<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:52.980> building<00:00:55.579> just<00:00:56.579> turn<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
from outside the building just turn the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.770 
from outside the building just turn the
light<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:59.120> probably<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:01.309> my<00:01:02.780> blister

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
light on probably up here is my blister

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.160 
light on probably up here is my blister
agent<00:01:04.500> better

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
agent better

these<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.409> thermostats<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> coolant

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
these are thermostats on the coolant

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.190 
these are thermostats on the coolant
side<00:01:09.740> which<00:01:10.740> told<00:01:11.010> me<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.850> temperature<00:01:12.420> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
side which told me what temperature is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.840 
side which told me what temperature is
and<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.220> got<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.990> stainless<00:01:15.990> steel<00:01:16.140> tank

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
and we got to a stainless steel tank

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.240 
and we got to a stainless steel tank
which<00:01:17.850> has<00:01:18.030> got<00:01:18.210> coiled<00:01:18.570> coils<00:01:18.990> copper<00:01:19.860> coils

which has got coiled coils copper coils
you<00:01:20.340> say<00:01:21.020> which<00:01:23.390> actually<00:01:24.390> go<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> house

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
you say which actually go to the house

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.719 
you say which actually go to the house
which<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> 80<00:01:26.610> meters<00:01:26.880> away<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> fuel

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
which is 80 meters away this is the fuel

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.340 
which is 80 meters away this is the fuel
tank<00:01:30.200> which<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.530> pump<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.070> from<00:01:33.079> five<00:01:34.079> gallon

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
drums into the fuel tanks it's a bit

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.450 
drums into the fuel tanks it's a bit
awkward<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.380> go<00:01:37.500> um<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.920> I've<00:01:38.009> got<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.430> a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
awkward to go um so I've got this be a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.710 
awkward to go um so I've got this be a
pump<00:01:38.960> pumps<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.079> by<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.000> air<00:01:42.899> intake

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
pump pumps up by this is the air intake

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.819 
pump pumps up by this is the air intake
this<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.869> any<00:01:46.079> exchange<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.890> men<00:01:47.600> which

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
this is any exchange of men which

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.080 
this is any exchange of men which
exchanges<00:01:49.829> heat<00:01:50.250> from<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:52.729> wall<00:01:53.729> jacket

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
exchanges heat from the wall jacket

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
exchanges heat from the wall jacket
around<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.390> engine<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.140> essentially<00:01:55.829> implies

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
around the engine to essentially implies

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.139 
around the engine to essentially implies
we've<00:01:56.340> got<00:01:56.520> two<00:01:56.640> meows<00:01:57.409> I've<00:01:58.409> also<00:01:58.939> if<00:01:59.939> you

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
we've got two meows I've also if you

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.700 
we've got two meows I've also if you
look<00:02:00.360> down<00:02:00.630> there<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> stainless

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
look down there that is a stainless

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.310 
look down there that is a stainless
steel<00:02:01.890> our<00:02:02.310> exhaust<00:02:02.909> going<00:02:03.570> outside<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.170> that

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
steel our exhaust going outside to that

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.270 
steel our exhaust going outside to that
so<00:02:05.159> cold<00:02:05.460> cold<00:02:05.520> cold<00:02:05.939> won't<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.450> outside

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
so cold cold cold won't get outside

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.100 
so cold cold cold won't get outside
still<00:02:08.280> still<00:02:08.550> exhaust<00:02:08.940> which<00:02:09.450> has<00:02:09.629> got<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
exchange on the same exhaust which then

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.030 
exchange on the same exhaust which then
goes<00:02:33.269> on<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.739> expandable<00:02:34.739> join<00:02:36.799> so<00:02:37.799> it<00:02:37.859> can

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
goes on to a expandable join so it can

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.080 
goes on to a expandable join so it can
sort<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.519> involvement<00:02:39.950> hmm<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:44.489> actually<00:02:44.670> goes

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
sort of involvement hmm it actually goes

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.410 
sort of involvement hmm it actually goes
ATV<00:02:45.659> Esterhaus<00:02:46.109> all<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.459> does<00:02:47.670> because<00:02:48.239> it's

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
ATV Esterhaus all it does because it's

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.220 
ATV Esterhaus all it does because it's
so<00:02:48.629> far<00:02:49.400> it's<00:02:50.400> too<00:02:50.700> far<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.450> too<00:02:51.720> far<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:51.989> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
so far it's too far it's too far to the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.770 
so far it's too far it's too far to the
house<00:02:52.319> all<00:02:52.889> it<00:02:53.129> does<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.370> luke<00:02:53.939> warm<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
house all it does is luke warm the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.899 
house all it does is luke warm the
radius<00:02:55.250> but<00:02:56.250> also<00:02:56.430> on<00:02:57.620> expansion<00:02:58.620> tanks<00:02:59.069> so

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
radius but also on expansion tanks so

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.059 
radius but also on expansion tanks so
the<00:03:00.209> pressure<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.689> to<00:03:00.720> one<00:03:01.169> and<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.349> half<00:03:01.379> baths

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
the pressure up to one and a half baths

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.940 
the pressure up to one and a half baths
I<00:03:05.540> actually<00:03:06.540> manually<00:03:07.319> well<00:03:07.709> they'll

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
I actually manually well they'll

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.589 
I actually manually well they'll
manually<00:03:08.370> start<00:03:08.609> it<00:03:08.819> but<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.090> started<00:03:09.480> by

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
manually start it but I started by

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.990 
manually start it but I started by
pressing<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.109> so<00:03:10.260> igniting<00:03:10.769> myself<00:03:11.159> I'm

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
pressing the so igniting myself I'm

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.240 
pressing the so igniting myself I'm
going<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.299> explain<00:03:12.569> all<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.989> because<00:03:13.560> when

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
going to explain all this because when

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.679 
going to explain all this because when
it's<00:03:14.370> down<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.700> end<00:03:14.819> of<00:03:14.879> your<00:03:14.970> builds<00:03:15.389> you<00:03:15.510> be

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
it's down the end of your builds you be

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.500 
it's down the end of your builds you be
talk<00:03:15.900> which<00:03:16.709> really<00:03:16.980> help<00:03:17.189> standard<00:03:18.180> diesel

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
talk which really help standard diesel

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.530 
talk which really help standard diesel
at<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.690> moment<00:03:19.760> probably<00:03:20.760> been<00:03:21.120> about<00:03:21.329> two

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
at the moment probably been about two

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.689 
at the moment probably been about two

this<00:03:24.260> I've<00:03:25.260> got<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.739> original<00:03:26.519> stand<00:03:26.970> somatic

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
this I've got the original stand somatic

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.680 
this I've got the original stand somatic
units<00:03:28.470> but<00:03:29.190> I've<00:03:29.459> never<00:03:29.669> actually<00:03:30.030> connected

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
units but I've never actually connected

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.719 
units but I've never actually connected
it<00:03:30.810> I've<00:03:31.349> just<00:03:31.620> waited<00:03:31.859> a<00:03:32.659> three-pin<00:03:33.659> plug

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:34.729 
it I've just waited a three-pin plug

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.659 
it I've just waited a three-pin plug
into<00:03:35.729> into<00:03:36.419> the<00:03:36.949> box<00:03:37.949> that's<00:03:38.220> on<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.489> top<00:03:38.639> of

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
into into the box that's on the top of

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.099 
into into the box that's on the top of
the<00:03:38.819> generators<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.269> foreign<00:03:39.599> our<00:03:39.690> kilowatt

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
the generators the foreign our kilowatt

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:40.580 
the generators the foreign our kilowatt
generator

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
generator

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.759 
generator
I've<00:03:41.040> added<00:03:41.220> six<00:03:41.810> kilowatt<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.349> which

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
I've added six kilowatt of it which

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.770 
I've added six kilowatt of it which
makes<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.370> angel<00:03:45.239> start<00:03:45.449> to<00:03:45.540> struggle

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
makes the angel start to struggle

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.069 
makes the angel start to struggle
struggle<00:03:46.379> but<00:03:46.799> it<00:03:46.889> still<00:03:47.159> did<00:03:47.370> it

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
struggle but it still did it

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.199 
struggle but it still did it
so<00:03:49.079> nothing's<00:03:49.470> not<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.400> connected<00:03:50.849> up<00:03:51.000> as

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
so nothing's not this connected up as

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.569 
so nothing's not this connected up as
original<00:03:51.900> just<00:03:52.169> yeah<00:03:52.349> I've<00:03:53.190> learned<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.459> way

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
original just yeah I've learned the way

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.240 
original just yeah I've learned the way
that<00:03:53.699> I'm<00:03:53.819> going<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.120> do<00:03:54.239> all<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.510> but

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
that I'm going to do all that but

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.460 
that I'm going to do all that but
because<00:03:56.250> I've<00:03:56.609> got<00:03:56.819> bad<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.930> next<00:03:58.169> shaded

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
because I've got bad in the next shaded

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.860 
because I've got bad in the next shaded
side<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.889> it<00:03:59.010> I've<00:03:59.099> got<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.489> bank<00:03:59.879> of<00:04:00.090> folic

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
side of it I've got a bank of folic

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.659 
side of it I've got a bank of folic
batteries<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.590> I'm<00:04:01.769> connecting<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.489> for

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
batteries and I'm connecting to that for

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.409 
batteries and I'm connecting to that for
24<00:04:03.060> volt<00:04:03.329> so<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.810> can<00:04:04.139> actually<00:04:04.349> start<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:05.419> using

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
24 volt so I can actually start it using

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.559 
24 volt so I can actually start it using
24<00:04:06.840> volt<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.530> Dynamo<00:04:08.010> start<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.180> unit

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
24 volt and the Dynamo start a unit

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.429 
24 volt and the Dynamo start a unit
which<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.930> inside<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.349> generator<00:04:11.189> and<00:04:12.439> these

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
which is inside the generator and these

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.509 
which is inside the generator and these
pipes<00:04:13.769> here<00:04:14.009> actually<00:04:15.000> got<00:04:15.930> returned<00:04:16.680> going

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
pipes here actually got returned going

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.460 
pipes here actually got returned going
to<00:04:17.639> me<00:04:17.759> house<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.239> then<00:04:18.690> there's<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.900> central

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
to me house and then there's a central

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.030 
to me house and then there's a central
leading<00:04:19.889> pump<00:04:20.250> over<00:04:20.639> there<00:04:21.060> which<00:04:21.959> pushes<00:04:22.349> it

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
leading pump over there which pushes it

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.880 
leading pump over there which pushes it
in<00:04:24.550> there<00:04:24.940> that<00:04:25.690> goes<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.080> another<00:04:26.260> century<00:04:26.710> in

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
in there that goes to another century in

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.530 
in there that goes to another century in
viola<00:04:27.510> which<00:04:28.510> is<00:04:28.720> oil-fired<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:30.670> there's<00:04:31.120> the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
viola which is oil-fired so there's the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
viola which is oil-fired so there's the
sorrow<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.080> both<00:04:32.440> run<00:04:32.710> off<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.920> same<00:04:33.100> system

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
sorrow of both run off the same system

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.040 
sorrow of both run off the same system
right<00:04:35.670> I'll<00:04:36.670> now<00:04:37.980> push<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.010> solenoid<00:04:39.670> in

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
right I'll now push the solenoid in

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:59.050 
right I'll now push the solenoid in
manually<00:04:41.050> just<00:04:41.470> out<00:04:41.680> here

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:10.540 

about

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:06:08.500 

whoa

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.940 

just<00:06:09.510> close<00:06:09.750> the<00:06:09.780> door<00:06:12.230> like<00:06:13.230> just<00:06:13.800> come

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
just close the door like just come

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.040 
just close the door like just come
around<00:06:14.070> here<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:15.180> noise<00:06:15.390> that<00:06:15.420> you<00:06:15.660> can<00:06:15.870> hear

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
around here the noise that you can hear

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.290 
around here the noise that you can hear
now<00:06:16.550> is<00:06:17.550> that<00:06:18.140> inlet<00:06:19.610> you<00:06:20.610> cannot<00:06:20.910> hear<00:06:21.120> the

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
now is that inlet you cannot hear the

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.670 
now is that inlet you cannot hear the
exhaust<00:06:21.600> whatsoever

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
exhaust whatsoever

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.600 
exhaust whatsoever
that's<00:06:23.250> the<00:06:23.460> exhaust<00:06:23.730> there<00:06:25.340> just<00:06:26.340> feel<00:06:26.490> like

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
that's the exhaust there just feel like

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.760 
that's the exhaust there just feel like
puffing<00:06:26.970> a<00:06:27.030> little<00:06:27.330> bit<00:06:27.950> what<00:06:29.150> inlet<00:06:30.680> the<00:06:31.680> air

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
puffing a little bit what inlet the air

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.740 
puffing a little bit what inlet the air
inlet<00:06:32.160> makes<00:06:32.520> more<00:06:32.760> nicer<00:06:33.060> than<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.450> exhaust

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
inlet makes more nicer than the exhaust
