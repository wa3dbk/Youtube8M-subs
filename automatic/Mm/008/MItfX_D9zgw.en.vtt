of a pivotal it's not really a plan sir
ki<00:00:52.010> that<00:00:52.190> just<00:00:52.370> exploits<00:00:53.080> blaze<00:00:54.080> rods<00:00:54.440> in<00:00:54.620> the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
ki that just exploits blaze rods in the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.430 
ki that just exploits blaze rods in the
game<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.190> put<00:00:55.940> it<00:00:56.089> back<00:00:56.180> into<00:00:56.390> diamond<00:00:56.900> see

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
game and put it back into diamond see

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.960 
game and put it back into diamond see
here<00:00:57.710> got<00:00:57.890> quite<00:00:58.129> a<00:00:58.159> few<00:00:58.400> I've<00:00:58.549> been<00:00:58.790> running

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
here got quite a few I've been running

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.090 
here got quite a few I've been running
it<00:00:59.150> for<00:00:59.180> that<00:00:59.390> long<00:00:59.570> but<00:01:00.530> basically<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:01.070> just

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
it for that long but basically it just

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.719 
it for that long but basically it just
involves<00:01:01.519> a<00:01:01.879> Masseria<00:01:02.659> game<00:01:03.589> blaze<00:01:03.890> rods<00:01:04.250> put

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
involves a Masseria game blaze rods put

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.660 
involves a Masseria game blaze rods put
them<00:01:04.850> in<00:01:04.879> there<00:01:05.059> with<00:01:05.180> over<00:01:05.799> and<00:01:06.799> just<00:01:07.010> making

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
them in there with over and just making

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.440 
them in there with over and just making
sure<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:08.680> put<00:01:09.680> some<00:01:09.830> of<00:01:09.950> them<00:01:10.070> into<00:01:10.310> this<00:01:10.450> to

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
sure you put some of them into this to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.170 
sure you put some of them into this to
make<00:01:11.570> blaze<00:01:11.840> rods<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:13.130> go<00:01:13.250> back<00:01:13.430> in<00:01:13.610> which

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
make blaze rods to go back in which

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.090 
make blaze rods to go back in which
eventually<00:01:14.509> would<00:01:14.899> come<00:01:15.109> round<00:01:15.350> back<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.920> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
eventually would come round back to that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.209 
eventually would come round back to that
so<00:01:16.490> basically<00:01:16.960> i'll<00:01:17.960> be<00:01:18.289> jump<00:01:18.710> going<00:01:18.950> and

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
so basically i'll be jump going and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.020 
so basically i'll be jump going and
taking<00:01:19.579> part<00:01:19.880> all<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.060> this<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:21.939> building<00:01:22.939> you

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
taking part all of this and building you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.429 
taking part all of this and building you
again<00:01:23.270> show<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:23.570> how<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:23.840> can<00:01:23.960> make<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.350> so

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
again show you how you can make it so

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.130 
again show you how you can make it so

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
to do is you want to put your wooden

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.729 
to do is you want to put your wooden
pipe<00:02:43.060> there<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:43.840> going<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.989> lead<00:02:44.200> out<00:02:44.410> so

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
pipe there so it's going to lead out so

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.130 
pipe there so it's going to lead out so
make<00:02:44.890> sure<00:02:44.920> it's<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.489> side<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
make sure it's on that side and the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.350 
make sure it's on that side and the
redstone<00:02:47.739> engine<00:02:48.160> will<00:02:48.400> collect<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.269> you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
redstone engine will collect that so you

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.259 
redstone engine will collect that so you
got<00:02:49.510> lever<00:02:49.720> there<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.200> turn<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.590> on<00:02:51.120> but<00:02:52.120> it's

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
got lever there to turn it on but it's

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.069 
got lever there to turn it on but it's
not<00:02:52.390> working<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.769> can<00:02:53.920> put<00:02:54.130> your<00:02:54.370> gold

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079

puppet gold transfer pipe isn't
necessary<00:02:58.200> however<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.410> does<00:02:59.620> speed<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:01.060> up<00:03:01.120> a

necessary however it does speed it up a
lot<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:03.370> recommended<00:03:04.180> when<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.840> red

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
Sun engine in full flow so I'll power

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.809 
Sun engine in full flow so I'll power
that

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
that

summer<00:03:09.450> cobblestone<00:03:10.409> park<00:03:10.859> i<00:03:10.980> remember<00:03:11.249> up

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
summer cobblestone park i remember up

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.699 
summer cobblestone park i remember up
properly<00:03:11.999> how<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.689> loved<00:03:12.959> me<00:03:13.170> or<00:03:13.379> something

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
properly how this loved me or something

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.020 
properly how this loved me or something
like<00:03:13.859> this<00:03:14.329> its<00:03:15.329> lead<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:15.780> down<00:03:15.959> here<00:03:16.439> i<00:03:17.030> think

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
like this its lead it down here i think

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.569 
like this its lead it down here i think
it<00:03:18.150> was<00:03:18.239> an<00:03:18.359> extra<00:03:18.659> one<00:03:18.980> leader<00:03:19.980> down<00:03:20.189> here

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
it was an extra one leader down here

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.940 
it was an extra one leader down here
then<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.969> have<00:03:21.299> your<00:03:21.659> distribution<00:03:22.409> pipe

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
then you have your distribution pipe

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.720 
then you have your distribution pipe
here<00:03:24.590> what<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.709> does<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.189> it<00:03:26.400> like

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
here what this does is it like

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.470 
here what this does is it like
segregates<00:03:27.480> where<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.879> eventual<00:03:29.879> blaze<00:03:30.120> rods

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
segregates where the eventual blaze rods

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.839 
segregates where the eventual blaze rods
will<00:03:30.719> go<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:32.340> basically<00:03:32.670> this<00:03:32.879> condenser<00:03:34.849> will

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
will go so basically this condenser will

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.420 
will go so basically this condenser will
be<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.329> one<00:03:37.129> where<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:39.079> diamonds<00:03:40.079> are<00:03:40.409> so<00:03:41.370> if

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
be the one where the diamonds are so if

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.059 
be the one where the diamonds are so if
you<00:03:41.519> pop<00:03:41.790> one<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.299> one<00:03:43.260> diamond<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.769> there

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
you pop one of you one diamond is there

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.849 
you pop one of you one diamond is there
that<00:03:44.730> will<00:03:44.849> make<00:03:45.090> diamonds<00:03:45.900> as<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.650> blaze

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
that will make diamonds as the blaze

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.369 
that will make diamonds as the blaze
rods<00:03:47.069> go<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:47.489> so<00:03:48.150> basically<00:03:48.540> what<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.900> do<00:03:49.049> here

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
rods go in so basically what you do here

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.770 
rods go in so basically what you do here
is<00:03:49.409> you<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:50.010> there<00:03:50.250> make<00:03:51.090> sure<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.480> every

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
is you see there make sure that every

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.679 
is you see there make sure that every
color<00:03:52.430> apart<00:03:53.430> from<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.699> ones<00:03:53.849> that<00:03:54.150> are

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
color apart from the ones that are

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.500 
color apart from the ones that are
coming<00:03:55.019> out<00:03:55.139> or<00:03:55.439> highlights<00:03:56.040> apart<00:03:56.459> from<00:03:56.669> dark

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
coming out or highlights apart from dark

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.449 
coming out or highlights apart from dark
blue<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.049> dark<00:03:58.949> well<00:03:59.659> siam<00:04:00.859> have<00:04:01.859> one<00:04:02.189> on<00:04:02.340> them

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
blue and dark well siam have one on them

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.699 
blue and dark well siam have one on them
at<00:04:02.609> least<00:04:02.790> everyone<00:04:03.719> else<00:04:03.870> has<00:04:04.049> zero<00:04:04.349> so<00:04:04.590> what

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
at least everyone else has zero so what

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.149 
at least everyone else has zero so what
this<00:04:04.829> will<00:04:05.010> do<00:04:05.159> is<00:04:05.480> everyone<00:04:06.799> blaze<00:04:07.799> well<00:04:08.010> that

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
this will do is everyone blaze well that

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.069 
this will do is everyone blaze well that
everyone<00:04:08.359> blaze<00:04:09.359> what<00:04:09.510> does<00:04:09.659> because<00:04:09.900> that

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
everyone blaze what does because that

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.110 
everyone blaze what does because that
way<00:04:10.260> one<00:04:11.159> will<00:04:11.280> go<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.549> way<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:11.939> can

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
way one will go that way so you can

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.550 
way one will go that way so you can
measure<00:04:12.359> it<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:12.629> you<00:04:12.689> can<00:04:12.870> put<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.169> four

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
measure it so you can put like four

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.949 
measure it so you can put like four
going<00:04:13.979> that<00:04:14.129> way<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:15.090> every<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.449> go<00:04:15.689> in<00:04:15.810> that

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
going that way to every to go in that

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.409 
going that way to every to go in that
way<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.829> probably<00:04:17.489> staff<00:04:17.759> or<00:04:18.000> something<00:04:18.299> like

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
way so probably staff or something like

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.860 
way so probably staff or something like
that<00:04:18.919> so<00:04:19.919> what<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.489> have<00:04:20.519> here<00:04:20.639> is<00:04:20.909> a<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.720> of

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
that so what you have here is a it of

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.810 
that so what you have here is a it of
your<00:04:22.109> over<00:04:22.800> condenser<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:23.639> would<00:04:23.789> be

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
your over condenser and this would be

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.800 
your over condenser and this would be
filled<00:04:24.150> with<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.690> blaze<00:04:25.620> rod<00:04:26.720> basically<00:04:27.720> what

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
filled with a blaze rod basically what

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.980 
filled with a blaze rod basically what
this<00:04:27.960> does<00:04:28.229> is<00:04:28.470> because<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.400> blaze<00:04:29.669> rod<00:04:29.970> for<00:04:30.840> ya

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
this does is because a blaze rod for ya

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.300 
this does is because a blaze rod for ya
you'll<00:04:31.169> start<00:04:31.440> with<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.590> couple<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.860> plays<00:04:32.130> ones

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
you'll start with a couple of plays ones

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.830 
you'll start with a couple of plays ones
there<00:04:32.490> won't<00:04:32.729> put<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:32.909> in<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.120> axial<00:04:33.389> start

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
there won't put it in the axial start

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.820 
there won't put it in the axial start
going<00:04:34.139> i<00:04:34.400> blaze<00:04:35.400> rod<00:04:35.639> i<00:04:35.789> think<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.090> gets<00:04:36.240> five

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
going i blaze rod i think it gets five

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.439 
going i blaze rod i think it gets five
blades<00:04:37.830> but<00:04:38.130> whatever<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.520> extra<00:04:38.940> blaze<00:04:39.150> rod

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
blades but whatever the extra blaze rod

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.300 
blades but whatever the extra blaze rod
is<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:40.050> will<00:04:40.199> make<00:04:40.349> five<00:04:40.620> of<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:40.979> he'll<00:04:41.070> send

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
is it will make five of and he'll send

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.300 
is it will make five of and he'll send
them<00:04:41.520> down<00:04:41.699> there<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:43.530> can<00:04:43.680> use<00:04:43.889> that<00:04:44.039> emc

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
them down there and you can use that emc

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.189 
them down there and you can use that emc
to<00:04:44.699> make<00:04:44.849> more<00:04:45.030> blaze<00:04:45.330> rods<00:04:45.659> which<00:04:45.840> in<00:04:45.990> turn

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
to make more blaze rods which in turn

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.040 
to make more blaze rods which in turn
can<00:04:46.800> make<00:04:47.039> more<00:04:47.520> dust<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.389> some<00:04:48.690> of<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.930> goes

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
can make more dust and some of it goes

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.420 
can make more dust and some of it goes
into<00:04:49.110> there<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.590> basically<00:04:50.009> you're<00:04:50.130> making

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
into there so basically you're making

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.990 
into there so basically you're making
free<00:04:50.669> diamonds<00:04:51.229> just<00:04:52.229> takes<00:04:52.680> just<00:04:53.370> over<00:04:53.610> time

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
free diamonds just takes just over time

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.360 
free diamonds just takes just over time
if<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.810> can't<00:04:55.020> see<00:04:55.229> why<00:04:55.320> i'm<00:04:55.380> saying<00:04:55.590> kind<00:04:56.310> of

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
if you can't see why i'm saying kind of

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.310 
if you can't see why i'm saying kind of
complicated<00:04:56.880> at<00:04:57.000> first<00:04:57.030> if<00:04:57.870> you<00:04:57.990> get<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.139> sec

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
complicated at first if you get a sec

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.210 
complicated at first if you get a sec
sure<00:04:58.469> wouldn't<00:04:58.680> transport<00:04:59.550> pipe

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
sure wouldn't transport pipe

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.930 
sure wouldn't transport pipe
we<00:05:02.220> have<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:03.530> redstone<00:05:04.530> engine<00:05:04.830> circuit<00:05:05.370> pump

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
we have the redstone engine circuit pump

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.200 
we have the redstone engine circuit pump
it<00:05:06.030> up<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.240> leave<00:05:06.510> it<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.780> eventually<00:05:07.200> do<00:05:07.320> that

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
it up and leave it to eventually do that

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:15.020 
it up and leave it to eventually do that
gold<00:05:09.210> pipe<00:05:09.510> here<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:13.400> Reds<00:05:14.400> on<00:05:14.550> top<00:05:14.580> to

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
gold pipe here and the Reds on top to

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.230 
gold pipe here and the Reds on top to
power<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.740> will<00:05:16.980> lead<00:05:17.370> up<00:05:17.700> you<00:05:18.000> need<00:05:18.090> to

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
power it and will lead up you need to

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.909 
power it and will lead up you need to
lead<00:05:18.389> it<00:05:18.510> into<00:05:18.660> it<00:05:18.990> like<00:05:19.139> this<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:19.620> that

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
lead it into it like this and that

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.470 
lead it into it like this and that
somehow<00:05:20.250> I've<00:05:20.580> run<00:05:20.790> out<00:05:20.910> because<00:05:21.210> there's<00:05:21.360> one

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
somehow I've run out because there's one

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.010 
somehow I've run out because there's one
there<00:05:22.040> you<00:05:23.040> need<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.280> lead<00:05:23.460> it<00:05:23.610> up<00:05:23.790> into<00:05:24.480> the

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
there you need to lead it up into the

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.190 
there you need to lead it up into the
thing<00:05:25.260> into<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.370> grill<00:05:26.940> here<00:05:27.210> otherwise<00:05:27.990> it

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
thing into the grill here otherwise it

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.280 
thing into the grill here otherwise it
won't<00:05:28.350> work<00:05:29.389> so<00:05:30.389> everything's<00:05:30.750> got<00:05:30.870> power<00:05:31.110> so

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
won't work so everything's got power so

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.140 
won't work so everything's got power so
it<00:05:31.380> should<00:05:31.680> all<00:05:32.010> works<00:05:32.310> of<00:05:32.520> turn<00:05:32.790> on<00:05:32.970> these

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
it should all works of turn on these

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.900 
it should all works of turn on these
redstone<00:05:33.690> engines<00:05:34.190> it<00:05:35.190> will<00:05:35.370> power<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.700> would

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
redstone engines it will power the would

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.000 
redstone engines it will power the would
eventually<00:05:36.389> so<00:05:37.169> we<00:05:37.260> want<00:05:37.440> to<00:05:37.500> do<00:05:37.590> is<00:05:37.740> put

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
eventually so we want to do is put

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.960 
eventually so we want to do is put
probably<00:05:38.760> about<00:05:39.080> seven<00:05:40.250> blaze<00:05:41.250> rods<00:05:41.580> in<00:05:41.760> them

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
probably about seven blaze rods in them

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.340 
probably about seven blaze rods in them
because<00:05:42.270> they<00:05:42.510> overclock<00:05:42.840> is<00:05:42.960> when<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:43.200> is<00:05:43.320> a

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
because they overclock is when it is a

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.300 
because they overclock is when it is a
lot<00:05:43.590> faster<00:05:44.330> so<00:05:45.330> because<00:05:46.260> this<00:05:46.560> one<00:05:46.740> just<00:05:46.919> idle

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
lot faster so because this one just idle

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.710 
lot faster so because this one just idle
be<00:05:47.430> very<00:05:47.639> slow<00:05:47.850> first<00:05:48.150> but<00:05:48.360> then<00:05:48.479> when

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
be very slow first but then when

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.180 
be very slow first but then when
wrestling<00:05:49.290> is<00:05:49.440> kicking<00:05:49.830> they'll<00:05:49.979> go<00:05:50.160> up

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
wrestling is kicking they'll go up

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.250 
wrestling is kicking they'll go up
faster<00:05:50.660> it<00:05:51.660> will<00:05:51.720> power<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:53.990> blaze<00:05:54.990> powder

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
faster it will power the blaze powder

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.070 
faster it will power the blaze powder
blue<00:05:55.650> blazer<00:05:55.889> on<00:05:56.190> dust<00:05:56.430> so<00:05:56.820> that<00:05:57.060> and<00:05:57.720> it<00:05:57.960> will

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
blue blazer on dust so that and it will

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.990 
blue blazer on dust so that and it will
the<00:05:58.380> gold<00:05:58.590> power<00:05:58.800> gold<00:06:00.530> pipe<00:06:01.530> will<00:06:02.040> shoot<00:06:02.850> it

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
the gold power gold pipe will shoot it

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.480 
the gold power gold pipe will shoot it
across<00:06:03.240> faster<00:06:03.930> and<00:06:04.260> some<00:06:05.160> of<00:06:05.280> it<00:06:05.370> will<00:06:05.460> go

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
across faster and some of it will go

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.219 
across faster and some of it will go
into<00:06:05.700> that<00:06:05.880> one<00:06:06.120> which<00:06:06.660> will<00:06:06.810> power<00:06:06.990> more

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
into that one which will power more

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.350 
into that one which will power more
blades<00:06:07.440> wants<00:06:07.740> to<00:06:07.860> go<00:06:08.010> in<00:06:08.190> and<00:06:08.430> make<00:06:09.300> sure

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
blades wants to go in and make sure

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.010 
blades wants to go in and make sure
eight<00:06:09.720> and<00:06:10.320> power<00:06:11.220> and<00:06:11.630> make<00:06:12.630> some<00:06:12.840> of<00:06:12.930> them

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
eight and power and make some of them

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.150 
eight and power and make some of them
going<00:06:13.260> to<00:06:13.410> this<00:06:13.530> one<00:06:13.710> which<00:06:13.740> create<00:06:14.130> more

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
going to this one which create more

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.700 
going to this one which create more
diamonds<00:06:14.720> see<00:06:15.720> what<00:06:15.870> i<00:06:15.900> mean<00:06:15.930> so<00:06:16.050> like<00:06:16.410> EMC

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
diamonds see what i mean so like EMC

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.219 
diamonds see what i mean so like EMC
there<00:06:17.130> so<00:06:17.880> as<00:06:18.180> it<00:06:18.479> gets<00:06:18.750> faster<00:06:18.900> and<00:06:19.080> faster

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
there so as it gets faster and faster

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.310 
there so as it gets faster and faster
faster<00:06:19.710> more<00:06:19.890> more<00:06:20.669> is<00:06:20.760> created<00:06:21.210> and<00:06:21.360> more<00:06:22.140> is

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
faster more more is created and more is

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.740 
faster more more is created and more is
eventually<00:06:22.710> going<00:06:23.070> to<00:06:23.220> get<00:06:24.000> into<00:06:24.240> if<00:06:24.390> I<00:06:24.510> just

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
eventually going to get into if I just

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.830 
eventually going to get into if I just
increase<00:06:25.789> so<00:06:26.789> say<00:06:27.090> that<00:06:27.240> I<00:06:27.270> made<00:06:27.600> loads

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
increase so say that I made loads

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.260 
increase so say that I made loads
earlier<00:06:28.350> if<00:06:28.470> I<00:06:28.590> just<00:06:28.770> dump<00:06:29.610> all<00:06:29.789> of<00:06:29.850> them<00:06:30.090> in

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
earlier if I just dump all of them in

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.240 
earlier if I just dump all of them in
you'll<00:06:30.930> make<00:06:31.050> a<00:06:31.110> lot<00:06:31.350> faster<00:06:31.590> and<00:06:31.860> only

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
you'll make a lot faster and only

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.680 
you'll make a lot faster and only
diamonds<00:06:32.669> like<00:06:32.820> a<00:06:32.850> lot<00:06:33.060> quick<00:06:33.270> that<00:06:33.479> bar<00:06:33.660> a

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
diamonds like a lot quick that bar a

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.300 
diamonds like a lot quick that bar a
little<00:06:33.780> bit<00:06:34.169> faster<00:06:34.350> so<00:06:34.650> I'll<00:06:34.770> just<00:06:34.800> pause<00:06:35.280> it

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
little bit faster so I'll just pause it

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.920 
little bit faster so I'll just pause it
your<00:06:35.550> own<00:06:35.610> jump<00:06:35.820> go<00:06:36.060> and<00:06:36.210> show<00:06:36.450> you<00:06:36.510> what's<00:06:36.780> up

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
your own jump go and show you what's up

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.320 
your own jump go and show you what's up
and<00:06:37.080> in<00:06:37.169> a<00:06:37.229> couple<00:06:37.380> of<00:06:37.530> minutes<00:06:38.150> since<00:06:39.150> its

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
and in a couple of minutes since its

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.469 
and in a couple of minutes since its
data<00:06:39.510> and<00:06:39.780> show<00:06:40.050> you<00:06:40.110> what<00:06:40.229> happens<00:06:41.120> so<00:06:42.120> this

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
data and show you what happens so this

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.840 
data and show you what happens so this
is<00:06:42.510> a<00:06:42.630> bit<00:06:42.840> of<00:06:42.900> time<00:06:43.139> later<00:06:43.410> of<00:06:43.860> driver<00:06:44.340> like

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
is a bit of time later of driver like

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.430 
is a bit of time later of driver like
get<00:06:45.090> running<00:06:45.270> a<00:06:45.450> bit<00:06:45.630> it's<00:06:45.840> still<00:06:45.900> bit<00:06:46.200> slow

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
get running a bit it's still bit slow

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.620 
get running a bit it's still bit slow
cuz<00:06:46.650> I<00:06:46.710> had<00:06:46.889> to<00:06:47.130> move<00:06:47.610> it<00:06:47.880> because

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
cuz I had to move it because

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.990 
cuz I had to move it because
one<00:06:50.200> of<00:06:50.290> my<00:06:50.380> mate<00:06:50.530> avoid<00:06:51.130> be<00:06:51.280> funny<00:06:51.460> to<00:06:51.640> move<00:06:51.820> it

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
one of my mate avoid be funny to move it

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.430 
one of my mate avoid be funny to move it
even<00:06:52.300> those<00:06:52.390> before<00:06:52.690> the<00:06:52.780> charge<00:06:53.020> I<00:06:53.200> hate<00:06:53.290> to

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
even those before the charge I hate to

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.690 
even those before the charge I hate to
put<00:06:53.620> it<00:06:53.710> back<00:06:53.910> but<00:06:54.910> it<00:06:55.510> has<00:06:55.660> made<00:06:55.990> a<00:06:56.020> couple<00:06:56.700> c14

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
put it back but it has made a couple c14

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.020 
put it back but it has made a couple c14
and<00:06:58.500> they<00:06:59.500> were<00:06:59.590> just<00:06:59.710> ones<00:07:00.220> from<00:07:00.400> Allah<00:07:00.640> left

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
and they were just ones from Allah left

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.640 
and they were just ones from Allah left
over<00:07:01.300> and<00:07:01.450> see<00:07:01.780> that<00:07:01.930> bar<00:07:02.140> will<00:07:02.320> eventually

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
over and see that bar will eventually

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.550 
over and see that bar will eventually
get<00:07:02.740> power<00:07:02.950> about<00:07:03.220> as<00:07:03.400> I'm<00:07:03.550> set<00:07:04.140> yeah<00:07:05.140> that's<00:07:05.470> a

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
get power about as I'm set yeah that's a

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.560 
get power about as I'm set yeah that's a
question<00:07:05.680> where<00:07:06.040> does<00:07:06.160> that<00:07:06.280> sometimes<00:07:06.570> as

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
question where does that sometimes as

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.080 
question where does that sometimes as
I'm<00:07:07.750> saying<00:07:07.930> as<00:07:08.080> they<00:07:08.230> get<00:07:08.410> faster<00:07:09.030> it<00:07:10.030> will

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
I'm saying as they get faster it will

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.010 
I'm saying as they get faster it will
pump<00:07:10.420> it<00:07:10.690> and<00:07:11.470> they<00:07:12.340> will<00:07:12.550> be<00:07:12.870> extracted<00:07:13.870> from

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
pump it and they will be extracted from

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.960 
pump it and they will be extracted from
that<00:07:14.140> makes<00:07:14.830> her<00:07:14.920> a<00:07:14.950> lot<00:07:15.220> first<00:07:15.400> O'Neill<00:07:15.820> made
