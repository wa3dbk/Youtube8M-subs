00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
was going to happen and now isn't it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.540 
was going to happen and now isn't it
something<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.480> f4<00:01:01.020> w<00:01:01.410> online<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.129> now

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
something that f4 w online is now

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
something that f4 w online is now
reporting<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> same<00:01:03.420> piece<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.780> news<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
reporting the same piece of news that I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.460 
reporting the same piece of news that I
first<00:01:05.189> reported<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.000> isn't<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.750> something<00:01:07.020> but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
first reported on isn't it something but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
first reported on isn't it something but
this<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.860> John<00:01:08.159> Cena<00:01:08.580> wants<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> think

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
this is what John Cena wants now I think

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.390 
this is what John Cena wants now I think
this<00:01:09.810> could<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> pretty<00:01:10.680> damn<00:01:10.860> good<00:01:10.979> field

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
this could be a pretty damn good field

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.039 
this could be a pretty damn good field
and<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:11.820> actually<00:01:11.970> these<00:01:12.540> two<00:01:12.780> could<00:01:12.900> put

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and I think actually these two could put

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.780 
and I think actually these two could put
on<00:01:13.170> some<00:01:13.409> good<00:01:13.619> matches<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.159> Big<00:01:14.490> E<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
on some good matches because Big E is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.530 
on some good matches because Big E is
explosive<00:01:15.180> John<00:01:15.810> Cena<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.259> intense<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.610> I'm

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
explosive John Cena is intense and I'm

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.060 
explosive John Cena is intense and I'm
not<00:01:18.600> saying<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> five-star

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
not saying it's going to be a five-star

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.440 
not saying it's going to be a five-star
classic<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:20.790> John<00:01:21.060> Cena's

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
classic just because John Cena's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.640 
classic just because John Cena's
involved<00:01:21.750> I'm<00:01:21.869> not<00:01:22.020> seen<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.259> gonna<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
involved I'm not seen is gonna be a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.560 
involved I'm not seen is gonna be a
match<00:01:23.100> via<00:01:23.130> candidate<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> could<00:01:24.330> range

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
match via candidate but it could range

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.840 
match via candidate but it could range
from<00:01:24.810> decent<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.040> good<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.580> think<00:01:26.610> these

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
from decent to good and I think these

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
from decent to good and I think these
two<00:01:27.000> would<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.210> chemistry<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.470> know

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
two would have chemistry are you know

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.749 
two would have chemistry are you know
they<00:01:28.710> are<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.490> close

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
they are you know they are pretty close

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.249 
they are you know they are pretty close
as<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> concerned<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.720> know<00:01:30.810> probably<00:01:31.079> being
