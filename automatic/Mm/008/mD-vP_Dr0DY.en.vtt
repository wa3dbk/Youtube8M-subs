outside of the year if you've got the

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.790 
outside of the year if you've got the
shape<00:02:07.820> there<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.390> then<00:02:09.260> move<00:02:09.410> over<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.680> the

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
shape there and then move over to the

shape there and then move over to the
other<00:02:09.890> side<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.910> another<00:02:11.090> triangle<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:12.530> to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
other side and another triangle go to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.540 
other side and another triangle go to
the<00:02:12.800> top<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.010> say<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.610> here<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:15.550> then

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
the top of say this I here and then

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.580 
the top of say this I here and then
we've<00:02:16.970> got<00:02:17.090> sonic<00:02:17.330> spikes<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.110> do<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.440> we're

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
we've got sonic spikes to do so we're

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.710 
we've got sonic spikes to do so we're
going<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.770> come<00:02:18.920> up<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.490> over<00:02:20.330> here<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:25.720> you

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
going to come up and over here and you

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.250 
going to come up and over here and you
do<00:02:26.870> another<00:02:27.140> one

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
do another one

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.870 
do another one
I'm<00:02:29.709> going<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.890> bring<00:02:30.010> them<00:02:30.190> down<00:02:30.220> roughly

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
I'm going to bring them down roughly

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.550 
I'm going to bring them down roughly

because as you come down you want to
come<00:02:32.680> back<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.160> here<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.700> sort<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.510> bottom

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
come back in here to sort of the bottom

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.729 
come back in here to sort of the bottom
of<00:02:35.290> sort<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.940> circle<00:02:38.520> why<00:02:39.520> that<00:02:40.739> little

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.559 
of sort of the circle why that little
bit<00:02:41.950> there's<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.760> little<00:02:43.060> line<00:02:43.209> coming<00:02:43.450> up

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
bit there's a little line coming up

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.750 
bit there's a little line coming up
there<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.260> side<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.470> his<00:02:44.650> face<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.670> you've

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
a little sort of a circular shape here

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.090 
a little sort of a circular shape here
like<00:02:59.349> your<00:02:59.530> stomach<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.900> length<00:03:02.110> you

going to come back in like that you do
the<00:03:20.920> same<00:03:21.130> again<00:03:21.459> just<00:03:22.060> below<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.630> sign<00:03:23.350> on

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
the same again just below and sign on

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.699 
the same again just below and sign on
the<00:03:23.620> other<00:03:23.739> side<00:03:24.390> twice<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.780> then<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.470> join

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
the other side twice and then you join

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.380 
the other side twice and then you join
them<00:03:26.950> up<00:03:27.239> why<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:29.610> go<00:03:30.610> do<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.940> same<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.269> the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
them up why that go do the same on the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.780 
them up why that go do the same on the
other<00:03:31.540> leg<00:03:31.870> obviously<00:03:32.530> can't<00:03:33.069> see<00:03:33.340> all<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.489> it

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
other leg obviously can't see all of it

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.300 
other leg obviously can't see all of it
because<00:03:34.180> this<00:03:34.359> one<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:35.590> obscuring<00:03:36.100> it

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
because this one is obscuring it

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.900 
because this one is obscuring it
slightly<00:03:36.579> so<00:03:37.180> you've<00:03:37.450> got<00:03:37.690> his<00:03:38.230> socks

easy<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.530> just<00:03:44.770> do<00:03:45.690> shape<00:03:46.690> like<00:03:47.080> that<00:03:47.950> very

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
easy you just do shape like that very

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.670 
easy you just do shape like that very
big<00:03:49.030> feet<00:03:49.300> so<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:49.660> need<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:49.960> come<00:03:50.110> out<00:03:50.260> pour<00:03:50.590> it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
big feet so you need to come out pour it

across<00:05:35.170> onto<00:05:36.170> the<00:05:36.290> circle<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:37.720> you<00:05:38.720> just<00:05:38.900> do<00:05:39.080> a

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
across onto the circle and you just do a

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.620 
across onto the circle and you just do a
couple<00:05:39.530> of<00:05:39.620> lines<00:05:39.770> like<00:05:40.130> that<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:41.240> move<00:05:41.510> along

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
couple of lines like that and move along

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.040 
couple of lines like that and move along
like<00:05:41.930> that<00:05:42.140> so<00:05:42.320> you've<00:05:42.410> got<00:05:42.590> sort<00:05:43.430> of<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:44.050> curvy

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
like that so you've got sort of a curvy

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.760 
like that so you've got sort of a curvy
line<00:05:45.230> here<00:05:45.620> just<00:05:47.080> inside<00:05:48.080> that<00:05:48.320> bring<00:05:48.560> that

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
line here just inside that bring that

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.180 
line here just inside that bring that
join<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.460> two<00:05:49.850> together<00:05:50.060> for<00:05:50.480> his<00:05:50.600> hand<00:05:51.190> you

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
join the two together for his hand you

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.590 
join the two together for his hand you
can<00:05:52.310> just<00:05:52.520> do<00:05:52.640> a<00:05:52.670> little<00:05:52.880> line<00:05:53.120> there<00:05:53.150> for<00:05:53.510> his

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
can just do a little line there for his

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.790 
can just do a little line there for his
thumb<00:05:53.870> and<00:05:56.020> then<00:05:57.020> we<00:05:57.200> need<00:05:57.350> to<00:05:57.470> put<00:05:57.620> on<00:05:57.680> his

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
thumb and then we need to put on his

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.430 
thumb and then we need to put on his
tail<00:05:58.070> so<00:05:58.670> you<00:05:58.760> did<00:05:58.910> a<00:05:58.940> little<00:05:59.630> point<00:05:59.870> sticking

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
tail so you did a little point sticking

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.200 
tail so you did a little point sticking
up<00:06:00.710> just<00:06:00.980> on<00:06:01.130> under<00:06:01.340> his<00:06:01.400> cloth<00:06:01.700> doesn't<00:06:02.150> know

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210
