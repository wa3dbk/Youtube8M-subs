 the second challenge capture the six 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.280
 generators at least six generators I 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.960
 will explain you later spent 30 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.430
 thousand points for the third challenge and 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.750
 for the fourth and final challenge he 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.040
 must complete the four chests 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.660
 maximum of their abilities 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.360
 so all that I explained to you during 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.650
 this video then we will start with the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.130
 first room so where there is a 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.160
 generator 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.720
 you just need to fill it to the maximum 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.460
 just as usual 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.920
 once that is done you will have a 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.690

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.710
 reward it's a zombie center 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.280
 so these are the little differences 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.560
 could specify but here we begin 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.329
 direct to the first fashion shows 115 head 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.159
 so there's not much to explain 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.139
 is simply showing you the 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.450
 reward it's a better weapon so 

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:21.130
 this time i make sure guellil a 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.469
 other time I came across the scara h 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.020
 improved so it can depend I think 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.100
 god maybe if we do not solo I do not 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.659

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.530
 certain at the end of the month what is safe and 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.539
 certain it is a weapon 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.069

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.020
 challenge that is captured the six generators 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.609
 six generators at least that's very 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.560
 simple you are no longer obliged to 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.259

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:03.759
