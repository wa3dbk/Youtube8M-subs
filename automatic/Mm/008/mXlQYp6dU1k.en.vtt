00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.919
 And then people are going to be gay and my 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.110
 back in another video and today I'm here 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.630
 employ a new program that like you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.389
 already seen in the opening the name 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.180
 The video's low method is a topic 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.460
 time the top 10 if you prefer nothing 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.830
 more is how the name itself says a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.560
 program where I 'm going to make a top 10 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.490
 Top ten worst hotels, whatever 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.320
 for 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 anything related to the world of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.430
 games and technology in general then 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.250
 to train the program today I will 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.829
 show you the top ten 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:47.370
 most remarkable characters in the world of 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:50.190
 games do not go out let's start this 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.829
 tenth place is there where 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.390
 the resident evil 4 that marked the life of 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.370
 many gamers out there 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.469
 as well as resident evil 4 was one of the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.329
 His favorites so I could not 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.039
 cease to be on this list since it was 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.039
 protagonist of this play 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.750
 more than a beautiful woman 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 there is without a doubt one of the best 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.259
 adventures you can imagine 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.930
 beyond the incredible and challenging games 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.979
 tony hayer marked a lot of people bringing 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.979
 lara croft character 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.570
 despite being a character let's say 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.880
 recent is already managed to gain space 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.580
 among the most striking and plenty 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.100
 charismatic engaging fun and etc. 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.410
 triesman without a doubt one of the characters 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.570
 more captivating since he was able to do 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.510
 with which thousands of gamers loved him 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.160
 leading to maximum exploitation 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.710
 practically his whole life of youth 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:58.960
 to old age and is undoubtedly the 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:01.120
 Assassin's Creed Series The God of War 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.840
 is more than that mascot than the sony 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.360
 so much to do but is also one of the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.250
 marked the childhood of many people with 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.830
 all that violence and blood 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.530
 it was not difficult to win the players 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.600
 and despite being a current character is 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:23.620
 certainly very striking 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:26.080
 the architect much of the tablet as mascot 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.840
 of xbox could not miss this list 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.360
 master shifu the master uncles and reveals how 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.880
 Do you prefer to call it arisen in 2001? 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.820
 at the time of his appearance he was successful 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.760
 immediate and continues to maintain its 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.010
 pose without showing your face you are 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.100
 worthy of sixth place in that 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.100
 ranking 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.820
 occupying the fifth place is sony 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.880
 perhaps one of the most classic characters 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.130
 and one of the most famous of the games 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.110
 so much so that he even won an anime version 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.000
 unfortunately over the years he 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.160
 has lost strength and popularity but 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.020
 little is still remembered for 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:13.760
 very like the legend of zelda occupant 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.790
 fourth place on this list 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.800
 after all it's exclusive to nintendo come 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.020
 marking generations and generations 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.540
 unlike sonic has not been decaying 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.070
 but becoming better and better. 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.070
 Conquering even more fans 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.900
 entering the third place is 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.780
 clash bandicoot that although not 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.970
 have so many games like that and not be so 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.220
 known for the most current games 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.560
 he marked our childhoods with his 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.810
 adventure games and even a good 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.570
 mero cardi quest racing style 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.620
 fun funny charismatic knows 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.620
 is one of the most striking 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.290
 the second most outstanding character is with 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.450
 sure sydney the cal johnson of gt s a 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.720
 just as sandra is the 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.790
 cj galera is the most famous since besides 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.610
 charismatic was what allowed him the most 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.600
 customizations of strength and clothes and 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.100
 a lot more 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.049
 which makes people feel 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.870
 more familiar 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.940
 but you do not have much to talk about cj after all 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.600
 everyone knows and knows what I am 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.600
 talking right? 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.610
 in the first place of course it is not 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.460
 could be other than the most striking 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.470
 and that will dominate for generations and more 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.190
 generations which is undoubtedly 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.520
 since his first appearance in 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.200
 1981 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.240
 the mascot of nintendo has been conquering 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.510
 more and more mario people are simply 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.520
 unforgettable and the canopy sure 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.890
 first character to be remembered when 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.390
