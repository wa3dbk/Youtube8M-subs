00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 it consumes less water than corn and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.609
 allow you to rotate between 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.140
 every culture does not require 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.490
 nitrogen fertilizer and very little 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.830
 treatments against diseases or 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.750
 harmful soy cultivation presents of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.429
 many benefits yet she was 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.360
 divided by two since last 15 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.160
 years in France 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.869
 the southwest basin represents 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.240
 today 60 100 % of production 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.789
 French total which amounts to 110 thousand 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.800
 tons of soybeans all non-gmo 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.090
 however, we are very far from 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.369
 satisfy our own needs 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.750
 France imports massively from 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.189
 heavyweights that are the united states 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.840
 Argentina and Brazil 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.899
 so it's high time to postpone 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.309
 focus on soybean production 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.020
 especially here in Midi Pyrenees where 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.200
 all the trumps the sun the water and 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.989
 the soil exposure are gathered it's 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.670
 a priority above all for 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.370
 quality concern channels like 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.789
 important for many years and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.230
 who would like to be able to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.520
 work in their specifications so 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.620
 non-gmo soy 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.180
 gold is a big difficulty we can 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.460
 to supply in particular since 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.510
 argentine with non-gmo soy but he 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.680
 would be much more important to 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.229
 to be able to do it from home 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.020
 so we obviously support ourselves that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 non gmo crops at midday and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.740
 we think there is a largely the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.420
 place to implement a sector 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.090
 at home especially as other countries 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.790
 such as China for example 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.710
 prohibit 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.440
 the entry of soya ogm on their territory 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.290
 and despite having a production a 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.240
 dropped they have a consumption that 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.530
 is experiencing very strong rises which I 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.700
 actually believe that there is a future 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.990
 the objective is therefore to increase the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.150
 yields by increasing the surfaces 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.280
 soya crops in midi pyrénées 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.380
 for this the region accompanies the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.180
 farmers upstream and downstream of the 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.310
 production by the next ten 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.170
 years in view of the growing demand 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.330
 for human consumption the region 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.790
 hope with a favorable evolution of 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.650
 the ability to accompany the culture of 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.360
 soy in midi-pyrenees and become 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.590
 competitive in the culture of this 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.630
 food full of promise is 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.500
 today world leader in sources 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.500
 high in protein
