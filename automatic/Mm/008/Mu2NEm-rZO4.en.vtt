wheels are difficult to get straight and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:01:06.300 
wheels are difficult to get straight and
probably<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> most<00:00:33.719> fiddly<00:00:34.110> part<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.590> kit

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.969 
the alcohol had a few molding scenes
around<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.229> edge<00:01:09.350> which<00:01:09.590> means<00:01:09.829> it's

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
around the edge which means it's

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:20.200 
around the edge which means it's
something

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.390 

I<00:01:20.270> filled<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:21.170> injection<00:01:21.620> holes<00:01:21.860> as<00:01:22.100> well<00:01:22.280> as

rest<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.939> hold<00:01:39.149> came<00:01:39.420> together<00:01:39.570> nicely

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.429 

the<00:01:59.240> turret<00:01:59.570> went<00:01:59.750> together<00:01:59.869> with<00:02:00.079> only<00:02:00.320> a

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
the turret went together with only a

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
I've left the trucks off on purpose so

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.150 
I've left the trucks off on purpose so
it's<00:02:28.370> easier<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.730> paint<00:02:29.060> from<00:02:29.900> royal<00:02:30.200> 76th<00:02:30.950> in
