19,000 miles it was a real

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.700 
19,000 miles it was a real
and<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.549> thought<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> himself<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.299> know<00:01:27.420> what

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
and I thought to himself you know what

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.899 
and I thought to himself you know what
might<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:28.770> well<00:01:28.890> pull<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> trigger<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
might as well pull the trigger so I

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.510 
might as well pull the trigger so I
bought<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.920> nine<00:01:31.920> years<00:01:32.189> later<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.700> slab<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
bought it and nine years later I slab I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.039 
bought it and nine years later I slab I
think<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> design<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.509> car<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.840> really

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
think it's the design the car is really

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.660 
think it's the design the car is really
entertaining<00:01:37.440> to<00:01:37.619> drive<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.310> they're<00:01:38.549> not

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
to design cars but it didn't happen I

for<00:04:19.720> him<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.560> was<00:04:21.010> pretty<00:04:21.639> good<00:04:21.880> but<00:04:22.270> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
for him that was pretty good but the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.090 
for him that was pretty good but the
labor<00:04:22.960> force<00:04:23.260> there<00:04:23.470> had<00:04:23.620> never<00:04:23.800> built<00:04:23.979> the

car before so that was kind of a problem
for<00:04:27.639> him<00:04:27.790> I<00:04:28.030> guess<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.419> first<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:29.290> first

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.100 
weren't assembled really really well but
I<00:04:33.610> mean<00:04:33.790> if<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:33.970> think<00:04:34.000> about<00:04:34.300> it<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.720> brand<00:04:35.050> new

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:06.209 
1981 through there are a lot of reasons

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:08.209

why company went out of business towards

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.369 
why company went out of business towards
the<00:05:08.339> end<00:05:08.549> the<00:05:09.029> u.s.<00:05:09.360> was<00:05:09.659> did<00:05:09.899> an<00:05:10.110> economic

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379 
the end the u.s. was did an economic

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.529 
the end the u.s. was did an economic
downturn<00:05:10.829> so<00:05:11.759> people<00:05:12.119> weren't<00:05:12.299> buying

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
downturn so people weren't buying

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.109 
downturn so people weren't buying
anything<00:05:12.989> much<00:05:13.349> less<00:05:13.379> these<00:05:13.860> exotic<00:05:14.459> and<00:05:14.610> at

00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:15.119 
anything much less these exotic and at

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:16.999 
anything much less these exotic and at
that<00:05:15.329> time<00:05:15.569> very<00:05:15.599> expensive<00:05:16.319> cars<00:05:16.559> think<00:05:16.889> they

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
that time very expensive cars think they

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.999 
that time very expensive cars think they
went<00:05:17.219> for<00:05:17.519> in<00:05:17.819> the<00:05:17.939> mid<00:05:18.089> 20s<00:05:18.509> so<00:05:18.869> to<00:05:19.679> put<00:05:19.860> that

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
went for in the mid 20s so to put that

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.529 
went for in the mid 20s so to put that
in<00:05:20.099> perspective<00:05:20.249> at<00:05:20.729> the<00:05:20.819> delorean<00:05:21.209> costs

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
in perspective at the delorean costs

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.499 
in perspective at the delorean costs
probably<00:05:21.749> about<00:05:22.079> as<00:05:22.229> much<00:05:22.439> as<00:05:22.709> a<00:05:22.879> 911<00:05:23.879> people

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
probably about as much as a 911 people

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.449 
probably about as much as a 911 people
didn't<00:05:24.809> have<00:05:24.899> money<00:05:25.079> to<00:05:25.199> buy<00:05:25.289> them<00:05:25.649> so<00:05:25.860> sales

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:26.459 
didn't have money to buy them so sales

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.729 
didn't have money to buy them so sales
started<00:05:27.059> to<00:05:27.119> plummet<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.839> delorean<00:05:28.439> needed

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:28.739 
started to plummet the delorean needed

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:31.309 
started to plummet the delorean needed
money<00:05:28.919> for<00:05:29.219> the<00:05:29.279> company<00:05:29.699> and<00:05:29.989> the<00:05:30.989> FBI

basically set them up they had a guy

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.019 
basically set them up they had a guy
come<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.110> approach<00:05:34.529> him<00:05:34.769> and<00:05:34.979> say<00:05:35.279> that<00:05:35.729> he
