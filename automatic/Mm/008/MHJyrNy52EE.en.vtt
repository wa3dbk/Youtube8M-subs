obviously<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> lot<00:01:41.039> larger<00:01:41.280> than<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> asylum

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
obviously a lot larger than the asylum

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.520 
obviously a lot larger than the asylum
that<00:01:42.240> we're<00:01:42.360> used<00:01:42.539> to<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:43.170> terms<00:01:43.410> of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that we're used to in terms of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.529 
that we're used to in terms of
navigating<00:01:44.069> that<00:01:44.280> world<00:01:44.520> how<00:01:45.119> does<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.390> man

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
navigating that world how does that man

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.580 
navigating that world how does that man
actually<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.899> around<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> grant<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
actually get around as a grant that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.010 
actually get around as a grant that
Batman<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.250> stealing<00:01:47.459> cars<00:01:47.729> or<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.509> mean<00:01:48.959> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
Batman is it stealing cars or I mean the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.419 
Batman is it stealing cars or I mean the
great<00:01:49.170> thing<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.709> think<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.039> one<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> my

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
great thing I think this is one of my

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.919 
great thing I think this is one of my
favorite<00:01:50.789> feature<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.270> whole<00:01:51.450> game<00:01:51.690> is

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
favorite feature to the whole game is

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.080 
favorite feature to the whole game is
the<00:01:52.050> navigation<00:01:52.619> system<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.280> take<00:01:53.849> you<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the navigation system so take you to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.210 
the navigation system so take you to
fight<00:01:54.270> into<00:01:54.569> Arkham<00:01:54.929> City<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.830> much<00:01:55.860> more

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
fight into Arkham City so much more

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.160 
fight into Arkham City so much more
vertical<00:01:56.729> space<00:01:57.000> except<00:01:57.599> we<00:01:57.720> really<00:01:57.989> wanted

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
vertical space except we really wanted

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.229 
vertical space except we really wanted
to<00:01:58.319> do<00:01:58.500> was<00:01:58.530> introduced<00:01:59.520> by<00:01:59.550> how<00:01:59.819> does<00:01:59.940> Batman

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
to do was introduced by how does Batman

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:01.430 
to do was introduced by how does Batman
get<00:02:00.390> around<00:02:00.599> Gotham<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.959> wanted<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.289> answer

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
get around Gotham we wanted to answer

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.240 
get around Gotham we wanted to answer
that<00:02:01.679> question<00:02:01.739> so<00:02:02.399> fire<00:02:03.149> escapes<00:02:03.709> just<00:02:04.709> wrap

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
that question so fire escapes just wrap

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
that question so fire escapes just wrap
it<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.489> sniffing<00:02:05.849> out<00:02:05.940> here<00:02:06.179> so<00:02:06.720> we<00:02:06.750> use<00:02:06.959> this

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
it up sniffing out here so we use this

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.169 
it up sniffing out here so we use this
for<00:02:07.380> momentum<00:02:07.800> gliding<00:02:08.250> system<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.819> basically

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
for momentum gliding system so basically

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.910 
for momentum gliding system so basically
as<00:02:09.239> you're<00:02:09.360> gliding<00:02:09.539> now<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.289> die<00:02:10.530> form

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
as you're gliding now you can die form

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.800 
as you're gliding now you can die form
and<00:02:11.220> you

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
and you

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.390 
and you
momentum<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.440> glide<00:02:12.680> up<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.069> through<00:02:13.250> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
momentum to glide up and through the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.400 
momentum to glide up and through the
city<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:14.060> then<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.450> can<00:02:14.599> grapple<00:02:14.840> boost<00:02:15.200> off

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
city and then you can grapple boost off

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.020 
city and then you can grapple boost off
the<00:02:15.470> top<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.830> building<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.400> when<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.610> grapple

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
the top of building so when you grapple

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.420 
the top of building so when you grapple
you<00:02:17.540> double<00:02:17.870> tap<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.260> hold<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.130> fires

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
you double tap and hold a and it fires

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.760 
you double tap and hold a and it fires
Batman<00:02:19.880> up<00:02:20.090> off<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.450> top<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.660> buildings<00:02:20.959> so

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
Batman up off the top of buildings so

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.530 
Batman up off the top of buildings so
when<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.069> get<00:02:22.220> really<00:02:22.400> good<00:02:22.670> at<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:23.390> can

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
when you get really good at this you can

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.910 
when you get really good at this you can
glide<00:02:23.750> across<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.200> whole<00:02:24.349> of<00:02:24.380> Arkham<00:02:24.800> City

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
glide across the whole of Arkham City

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.760 
glide across the whole of Arkham City
without<00:02:25.130> even<00:02:25.610> touching<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.970> ground<00:02:26.120> that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
without even touching the ground that

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.600 
without even touching the ground that
decking<00:02:27.770> on<00:02:27.920> but<00:02:28.099> something<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.430> we<00:02:28.580> really

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
decking on but something that we really

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.270 
decking on but something that we really
really<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.510> know<00:02:29.630> worked<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.290> lot<00:02:30.440> on<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:31.099> key

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
really you know worked a lot on the key

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.160 
really you know worked a lot on the key

in Artemus tennis all right fine i will
go<00:02:47.030> for<00:02:47.269> it<00:02:47.299> in<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.660> last<00:02:47.870> game<00:02:48.019> we<00:02:48.140> spent<00:02:48.350> a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
go for it in the last game we spent a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.410 
go for it in the last game we spent a
lot<00:02:48.470> of<00:02:48.500> time<00:02:48.590> in<00:02:48.799> detective<00:02:49.220> mode<00:02:49.250> which<00:02:50.239> you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
lot of time in detective mode which you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.699 
lot of time in detective mode which you
know<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.660> was<00:02:50.840> good<00:02:50.989> gameplay<00:02:51.319> but<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.530> lot<00:02:51.680> of

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
know it was good gameplay but a lot of

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.630 
know it was good gameplay but a lot of
times<00:02:51.860> i<00:02:51.950> think<00:02:52.069> if<00:02:52.130> they<00:02:52.220> pulled<00:02:52.459> away<00:02:52.549> a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
times i think if they pulled away a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.400 
times i think if they pulled away a
little<00:02:52.850> bit<00:02:52.940> from<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.330> look<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.959> graphical

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
little bit from the look the graphical

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.440 
little bit from the look the graphical
of<00:02:54.500> aesthetic<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.069> game<00:02:55.370> has<00:02:56.090> detective

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
of aesthetic of the game has detective

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.420 
of aesthetic of the game has detective
boat<00:02:56.569> changed<00:02:57.110> at<00:02:57.319> all<00:02:57.349> in<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.709> one<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.280> what

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
