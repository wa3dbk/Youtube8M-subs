00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
unfortunately the engine appears to be

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.470 
unfortunately the engine appears to be
in<00:00:19.470> rather<00:00:19.740> poor<00:00:19.859> condition<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:21.119> looks<00:00:21.330> like

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
in rather poor condition it looks like

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.670 
in rather poor condition it looks like
it<00:00:21.600> had<00:00:21.689> been<00:00:21.779> sitting<00:00:21.990> outside<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.250 
engine that could rust or corrode has
done<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.750> all<00:00:30.929> complete

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
done so but it's all complete

done so but it's all complete
everything's<00:00:31.980> there<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.550> let's<00:00:32.730> take<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> look

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
everything's there so let's take a look

everything's there so let's take a look
at<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:35.360> okay<00:00:36.360> over<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.750> we've<00:00:36.870> got<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> little

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
at it okay over here we've got a little

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
at it okay over here we've got a little
Carbon<00:00:37.590> pile<00:00:37.770> voltage<00:00:38.219> regulator<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
Carbon pile voltage regulator and a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580 
Carbon pile voltage regulator and a
voltmeter<00:00:39.329> now<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.989> was<00:00:40.140> something<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
voltmeter now this was something that a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.470 
voltmeter now this was something that a
past<00:00:40.950> owner<00:00:41.250> had<00:00:41.460> rigged<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.820> himself<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
past owner had rigged up himself it

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.910 
past owner had rigged up himself it
didn't<00:00:42.840> come<00:00:42.960> from<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.200> factory<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.739> this

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
didn't come from the factory like this

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.610 
didn't come from the factory like this
obviously<00:00:45.140> down<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.320> we've<00:00:46.410> got<00:00:46.500> the

obviously down here we've got the
throttle<00:00:47.450> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> original<00:00:49.050> decal

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
throttle you can see the original decal

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.369 
throttle you can see the original decal
still<00:00:50.100> intact<00:00:50.430> which<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> always<00:00:51.090> nice<00:00:51.379> over

here bet the manual pull starter now the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.080 
here bet the manual pull starter now the
return<00:01:19.799> Springs<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.580> these<00:01:20.670> things<00:01:20.850> were

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
return Springs and these things were

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.539 
return Springs and these things were
notorious<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:21.810> braking<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:23.009> fact<00:01:23.220> every

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
one of these AP use I've ever come

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.810 
one of these AP use I've ever come
across<00:01:25.020> these<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.770> always<00:01:25.979> broken<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.729> that's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
across these are always broken so that's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:38.899 
across these are always broken so that's
a<00:01:27.000> very<00:01:27.150> common<00:01:27.780> issue

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.029 

okay<00:01:39.600> back<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.049> we've<00:01:40.200> got<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.439> scroll<00:01:40.740> now

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
okay back here we've got the scroll now

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.620 
okay back here we've got the scroll now
this<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.310> part<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> cooling<00:01:41.909> system<00:01:42.360> on

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.740 
cage fan that's attached to the flywheel
and<00:01:47.250> I'll<00:01:47.700> probably<00:01:47.970> do<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> separate<00:01:48.600> video

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and I'll probably do a separate video

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.389 
and I'll probably do a separate video
about<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.259> cooling<00:01:49.560> systems<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.220> these

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
about the cooling systems on these

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.690 
about the cooling systems on these
engines<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.909> how<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.210> work<00:01:52.399> here<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.549> can

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
engines and how they work here you can

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.179 
engines and how they work here you can
see<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> exhaust<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.530> advised

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
is a post-world War two modification so

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.190 
is a post-world War two modification so
if<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.849> have<00:02:18.030> one<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.360> these<00:02:18.450> engines<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.110> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
if you have one of these engines and it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.690 
if you have one of these engines and it
doesn't<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.769> bypass<00:02:20.190> then<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.580> know

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
doesn't have this bypass then you know

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.370 
doesn't have this bypass then you know
it's<00:02:20.880> still<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.330> original<00:02:21.780> World<00:02:22.019> War<00:02:22.110> two

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.759 
also used for cooling the generator here
now<00:02:54.630> right<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:54.989> have<00:02:55.079> an<00:02:55.260> hour<00:02:55.410> meter

now right here we have an hour meter

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.400 
now right here we have an hour meter
this<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.010> also<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.459> post-war<00:02:57.030> modification

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
this is also a post-war modification

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.020 
this is also a post-war modification

or not and if you look at the data plate
here<00:03:11.060> when<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.120> see<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.450> engine<00:03:12.690> serial

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
here when you see the engine serial

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.410 
here when you see the engine serial
number<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.410> are<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> three<00:03:14.280> six<00:03:14.549> three<00:03:14.639> five<00:03:15.060> so

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
number is are a three six three five so

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.030 
number is are a three six three five so
that<00:03:15.569> tells<00:03:15.810> us<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.319> engine<00:03:16.650> was<00:03:16.769> built

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
that tells us that this engine was built

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.699 
that tells us that this engine was built
by<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> ranger<00:03:17.639> during<00:03:18.180> World<00:03:18.450> War<00:03:18.540> two<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:19.109> the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
by a ranger during World War two for the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.160 
by a ranger during World War two for the
b-29<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.519> if<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.329> look<00:03:21.510> down<00:03:21.630> below<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:22.079> we

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
b-29 and if you look down below it we

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.710 
b-29 and if you look down below it we
can<00:03:22.350> see<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.769> was<00:03:22.859> overhauled<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:23.489> May<00:03:23.670> of

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
can see that it was overhauled in May of

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.720 
can see that it was overhauled in May of
1960<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.900> if<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.709> look<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.160> actual<00:03:26.430> meter

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
1960 and if you look on the actual meter

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.009 
1960 and if you look on the actual meter
itself<00:03:27.120> here<00:03:28.609> we'll<00:03:29.609> see<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:29.940> engine<00:03:30.239> has<00:03:30.359> 31

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
itself here we'll see this engine has 31

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.430 
itself here we'll see this engine has 31
hours<00:03:31.500> on<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.829> since<00:03:32.250> overhaul<00:03:32.730> now<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:34.230> put

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
hours on it since overhaul now to put

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.009 
hours on it since overhaul now to put
that<00:03:34.590> into<00:03:34.769> some<00:03:35.040> perspective<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.910> tbo<00:03:36.630> or

that into some perspective the tbo or

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.319 
that into some perspective the tbo or
time<00:03:37.440> between<00:03:37.620> overhaul<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.489> these<00:03:38.940> engines

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
time between overhaul on these engines

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.319 
time between overhaul on these engines
was<00:03:39.540> 500<00:03:40.170> hours<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.549> was<00:03:41.730> essentially<00:03:42.299> a

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
was 500 hours so this was essentially a

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.420 
was 500 hours so this was essentially a
brand-new<00:03:43.049> engine<00:03:43.260> before<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.069> was<00:03:44.190> put<00:03:44.400> out

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
brand-new engine before it was put out

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.159 
brand-new engine before it was put out
to<00:03:44.519> pasture<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.239> left<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.810> rot<00:03:47.930> well<00:03:48.930> that's<00:03:49.079> a

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
to pasture and left to rot well that's a

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.020 
to pasture and left to rot well that's a
quick<00:03:49.350> overview<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.979> apu<00:03:50.489> as<00:03:50.639> you<00:03:50.729> can<00:03:50.880> see

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
quick overview this apu as you can see

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.200 
quick overview this apu as you can see
the<00:03:51.180> engine<00:03:51.329> is

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
the engine is

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.600 
the engine is
rather<00:03:52.480> poor<00:03:52.990> condition<00:03:53.500> hopefully<00:03:54.340> we'll<00:03:54.490> be

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
rather poor condition hopefully we'll be

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.860 
rather poor condition hopefully we'll be
able<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.790> breathe<00:03:54.970> some<00:03:55.120> life<00:03:55.150> into<00:03:55.510> this<00:03:55.660> old

girl yet and I think while I'm out here

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.310 
girl yet and I think while I'm out here
I'm<00:03:58.450> going<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.690> go<00:03:58.780> ahead<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.020> pull<00:03:59.200> the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
I'm going to go ahead and pull the

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.500 
I'm going to go ahead and pull the
rocker<00:03:59.560> box<00:03:59.860> covers<00:04:00.250> off<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.430> see<00:04:01.240> what<00:04:01.390> we

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
rocker box covers off and see what we

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.360 
rocker box covers off and see what we
got<00:04:01.660> going<00:04:01.930> on<00:04:02.020> down<00:04:02.260> there<00:04:02.500> so<00:04:03.100> stand<00:04:03.490> by<00:04:03.640> one

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
all right so we got the nuts backed off

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.449 
all right so we got the nuts backed off
the<00:04:11.690> rocker<00:04:12.020> box<00:04:12.349> covers<00:04:12.739> here<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.190> these<00:04:13.400> are

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
on the studs out with them but let's

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.379 
on the studs out with them but let's
open<00:04:17.180> it<00:04:17.389> up<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:17.630> see<00:04:17.900> them<00:04:18.019> again

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
open it up and see them again

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.350 
open it up and see them again
okay<00:04:20.389> not<00:04:20.630> too<00:04:20.810> bad<00:04:21.520> now<00:04:22.520> we<00:04:22.730> seen<00:04:23.030> your<00:04:23.150> rust

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
okay not too bad now we seen your rust

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.770 
okay not too bad now we seen your rust
or<00:04:23.600> other<00:04:23.750> areas<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.680> concern<00:04:25.780> everything

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
the push rods these are the valve

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.530 
the push rods these are the valve
springs<00:04:39.680> now<00:04:40.400> there<00:04:40.550> are<00:04:40.610> two<00:04:40.760> springs<00:04:41.120> here

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
springs now there are two springs here

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.379 
springs now there are two springs here
and<00:04:41.750> enter<00:04:41.960> in<00:04:42.139> an<00:04:42.260> outer<00:04:42.440> spring<00:04:43.389> but

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
and enter in an outer spring but

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.030 
and enter in an outer spring but
everything<00:04:44.750> looks<00:04:44.930> pretty<00:04:45.139> good<00:04:45.290> to<00:04:45.620> go<00:04:45.740> here

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
everything looks pretty good to go here

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.650 
everything looks pretty good to go here
let's<00:04:46.370> go<00:04:46.610> around<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.090> other<00:04:47.210> side<00:04:47.300> and

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
let's go around to the other side and

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:56.530 
let's go around to the other side and
see<00:04:47.840> what<00:04:47.930> it<00:04:48.050> looks<00:04:48.080> like<00:04:55.180> well<00:04:56.180> that's<00:04:56.330> not

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
see what it looks like well that's not

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.070 
see what it looks like well that's not
good

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
good

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.550 
good
as<00:04:57.490> you<00:04:58.490> can<00:04:58.610> see<00:04:58.880> that<00:04:59.720> valve<00:05:00.050> spring<00:05:00.410> is

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
as you can see that valve spring is

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.740 
as you can see that valve spring is
toast

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
toast

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.000 
toast
now<00:05:02.750> these<00:05:02.900> rocker<00:05:03.200> box<00:05:03.500> covers<00:05:03.860> they

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
now these rocker box covers they

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.100 
now these rocker box covers they
actually<00:05:04.310> have<00:05:04.520> vents<00:05:05.090> built<00:05:05.330> until<00:05:05.690> which

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
actually have vents built until which

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.450 
actually have vents built until which
part<00:05:06.470> of<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.590> cooling<00:05:06.800> system<00:05:07.220> on<00:05:07.310> these

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
part of the cooling system on these

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.370 
part of the cooling system on these
engines<00:05:07.700> and<00:05:08.450> you<00:05:08.540> can<00:05:08.690> see<00:05:08.870> that<00:05:09.110> vent

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
engines and you can see that vent

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.080 
engines and you can see that vent
permitted<00:05:09.860> water<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.280> get<00:05:10.370> in<00:05:10.490> there<00:05:10.669> and<00:05:10.850> that

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
permitted water to get in there and that

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.750 
permitted water to get in there and that
valve<00:05:11.389> spring<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:11.930> gone<00:05:12.400> now<00:05:13.400> this<00:05:13.550> isn't

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
valve spring is gone now this isn't

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.100 
valve spring is gone now this isn't
something<00:05:13.910> that's<00:05:14.240> going<00:05:14.390> to<00:05:14.450> be<00:05:14.600> fatal<00:05:14.990> to

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
something that's going to be fatal to

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.810 
something that's going to be fatal to
the<00:05:15.229> engine<00:05:15.590> it's<00:05:15.830> really<00:05:16.130> no<00:05:16.280> big<00:05:16.490> deal<00:05:16.550> to

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
the engine it's really no big deal to

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.790 
the engine it's really no big deal to
change<00:05:16.850> out<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.210> valve<00:05:17.539> spring<00:05:17.690> I<00:05:18.140> can<00:05:18.650> also

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
change out a valve spring I can also

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.529 
change out a valve spring I can also
tell<00:05:19.070> by<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.310> position<00:05:19.700> of<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.060> rocker<00:05:20.240> arm

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
tell by the position of the rocker arm

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.840 
tell by the position of the rocker arm
that<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.810> valve<00:05:21.110> is<00:05:21.410> closed<00:05:21.860> so<00:05:22.460> hopefully

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
that the valve is closed so hopefully

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.310 
that the valve is closed so hopefully
none<00:05:23.000> of<00:05:23.120> that<00:05:23.270> moisture<00:05:23.630> made<00:05:23.840> it<00:05:23.960> down<00:05:24.110> there

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
none of that moisture made it down there

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.279 
none of that moisture made it down there
into<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.830> cylinder<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:25.840> speaking<00:05:26.840> of<00:05:26.960> nasty

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
into the cylinder and speaking of nasty

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.950 
into the cylinder and speaking of nasty
surprises<00:05:28.000> good<00:05:29.000> pop<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.360> little<00:05:29.570> cap<00:05:29.750> over

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
surprises good pop the little cap over

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.180 
surprises good pop the little cap over
here<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.910> as<00:05:32.000> you<00:05:32.180> can<00:05:32.210> see<00:05:32.830> filler<00:05:33.830> neck<00:05:33.979> it's

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
here and as you can see filler neck it's

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.650 
here and as you can see filler neck it's
all<00:05:34.370> kind<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.669> corrosion<00:05:34.940> going<00:05:35.300> on<00:05:35.450> down

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
all kind of corrosion going on down

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.200 
all kind of corrosion going on down
there<00:05:35.900> which<00:05:36.200> is<00:05:36.320> never<00:05:36.500> a<00:05:36.590> good<00:05:36.830> sign<00:05:37.210> however

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
there which is never a good sign however

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.570 
there which is never a good sign however
the<00:05:38.780> engine<00:05:38.960> is<00:05:39.289> still<00:05:39.590> full<00:05:40.100> of<00:05:40.220> oil

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
the engine is still full of oil

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.990 
the engine is still full of oil
albeit<00:05:41.120> very<00:05:41.360> nasty<00:05:41.690> oil<00:05:42.080> so<00:05:43.070> might<00:05:43.729> be<00:05:43.910> able

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
albeit very nasty oil so might be able

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.120 
albeit very nasty oil so might be able
to<00:05:44.090> bring<00:05:44.330> this<00:05:44.510> old<00:05:45.110> girl<00:05:45.380> back<00:05:45.560> to<00:05:45.590> life<00:05:45.860> yet
