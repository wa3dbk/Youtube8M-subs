to<00:02:11.760> me<00:02:11.880> ask<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:13.260> more<00:02:13.410> questions<00:02:13.890> ask<00:02:14.700> what

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
to me ask for more questions ask what

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.670 
to me ask for more questions ask what
the<00:02:15.060> relevance<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.630> swimming<00:02:15.959> was<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.349> my<00:02:16.500> life

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the relevance of swimming was in my life

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.770 
the relevance of swimming was in my life
now<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.280> know<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.300> different<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.690> what

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
now I know that it's different to what

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.660 
now I know that it's different to what
it<00:02:18.870> was<00:02:18.989> two<00:02:19.230> years<00:02:19.410> ago<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:20.250> different<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
it was two years ago it's different to

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.400 
it was two years ago it's different to
what<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.880> was<00:02:21.000> five<00:02:21.269> years<00:02:21.300> ago<00:02:21.540> it's

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
what it was five years ago it's

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.630 
what it was five years ago it's
different<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.800> what<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.010> was<00:02:23.130> ten<00:02:23.370> years<00:02:23.400> ago

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
different to what it was ten years ago

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.030 
different to what it was ten years ago
and<00:02:24.390> most<00:02:24.660> definitely<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.319> very<00:02:25.620> different<00:02:25.950> to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
and most definitely is very different to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.380 
and most definitely is very different to
what<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.220> was<00:02:26.370> 15<00:02:26.790> years<00:02:26.940> ago

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
what it was 15 years ago

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.130 
what it was 15 years ago
so<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:29.130> begged<00:02:29.459> another<00:02:29.880> question<00:02:30.360> what

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
so that begged another question what

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.220 
so that begged another question what
would<00:02:31.260> my<00:02:31.380> life<00:02:31.560> be<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.920> without<00:02:32.130> swimming

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
would my life be like without swimming

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.530 
would my life be like without swimming
it's<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.680> very<00:02:35.400> very<00:02:35.610> dark<00:02:35.819> question<00:02:36.269> for<00:02:36.450> me

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
it's a very very dark question for me

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.350 
it's a very very dark question for me
because<00:02:37.459> Swimming's<00:02:38.459> provided<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.030> safety

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
because Swimming's provided a safety

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.920 
because Swimming's provided a safety
blanket<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:40.260> been<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.890> security<00:02:41.540> kind<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.630> net

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
blanket it's been a security kind of net

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.990 
blanket it's been a security kind of net
for<00:02:43.170> me<00:02:43.290> when<00:02:43.950> I'm<00:02:44.220> not<00:02:44.459> certain<00:02:44.880> about

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
for me when I'm not certain about

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.150 
for me when I'm not certain about
developing<00:02:45.690> other<00:02:45.870> sides<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.380> my<00:02:46.500> life<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.980> just

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
developing other sides of my life I just

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.330 
developing other sides of my life I just
fall<00:02:47.489> straight<00:02:47.640> back<00:02:47.880> into<00:02:48.060> swimming<00:02:48.390> and

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
fall straight back into swimming and

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.479 
fall straight back into swimming and
what<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:50.489> meant<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.540> haven't<00:02:52.489> balanced

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
what it's meant is I haven't balanced

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.280 
what it's meant is I haven't balanced
out<00:02:53.610> my<00:02:53.819> life<00:02:54.060> as<00:02:54.269> well<00:02:54.450> as<00:02:54.569> what<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.750> should<00:02:55.080> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
out my life as well as what I should and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.850 
out my life as well as what I should and
so<00:02:55.819> with<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:56.970> question<00:02:57.450> being<00:02:58.140> asked<00:02:58.680> I

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
so with this question being asked I

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.120 
so with this question being asked I
realized<00:02:59.730> that<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.090> had<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.660> prioritize<00:03:01.590> other

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
realized that I had to prioritize other

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.670 
realized that I had to prioritize other
things<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.700> had<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.780> let<00:03:03.959> swimming<00:03:04.290> take<00:03:04.500> a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
things and had to let swimming take a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.360 
things and had to let swimming take a
little<00:03:04.950> bit<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.340> backseat<00:03:06.090> at<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:06.540> stage

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
little bit of a backseat at this stage

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.920 
little bit of a backseat at this stage
it's<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.430> very<00:03:08.640> important<00:03:09.180> thing<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.780> was<00:03:09.900> a

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
it's a very important thing and it was a

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.039 
it's a very important thing and it was a
very<00:03:10.410> difficult<00:03:10.739> decision<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.340> make<00:03:11.400> because

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
very difficult decision to make because

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.449 
very difficult decision to make because
swimming<00:03:13.049> has<00:03:13.200> provided<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.769> security<00:03:14.280> and

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
swimming has provided that security and

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.620 
swimming has provided that security and
I<00:03:15.090> was<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:16.140> out<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.560> my<00:03:16.920> fears<00:03:17.450> with<00:03:18.450> that

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
I was going out to my fears with that

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
I was going out to my fears with that
question<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:20.069> first<00:03:20.310> reaction<00:03:20.819> was<00:03:20.970> fear<00:03:21.650> but

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
question the first reaction was fear but

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.920 
question the first reaction was fear but
what<00:03:22.859> also<00:03:23.040> happened<00:03:23.609> was<00:03:23.819> I<00:03:23.970> was<00:03:24.209> excited<00:03:24.540> I

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
what also happened was I was excited I

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.780 
what also happened was I was excited I
was<00:03:25.260> excited<00:03:25.290> about<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.069> prospect<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.579> other

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
was excited about the prospect of other

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.979 
was excited about the prospect of other
things<00:03:27.120> being<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.930> my<00:03:28.049> life<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.850> I'm<00:03:30.600> looking

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
at a next phase and that next phase

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.250 
at a next phase and that next phase
means<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.620> I'm<00:03:35.359> realigning<00:03:36.359> what's<00:03:37.139> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
means that I'm realigning what's the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.620 
means that I'm realigning what's the
most<00:03:37.410> important<00:03:37.950> thing<00:03:38.100> for<00:03:38.220> me<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.430> do<00:03:38.549> and

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
those important things I don't want to

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.629 
those important things I don't want to
