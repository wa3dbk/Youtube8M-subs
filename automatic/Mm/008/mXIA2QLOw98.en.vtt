00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 welcome dear apple flick friends today 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.859
 we will explain how to activate the 3d maps 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.530
 the new navigator inserted in ios 6 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.809
 on your iphone 4 3gs 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.150
 so first we go to cydia 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:29.789
 and click on search we write to the hawks 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:33.540
 isles 6 map and you will immediately find the tweak 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.120
 just because the arrival of will appear 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.469
 bigboss 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.890
 just click on the 86 maps to do 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.469
 install get back the springboard and the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.500
 it's done 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:57.530
 in fact it will be enough then to go on maps and 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:02.609
 we will be able to see that the will appear 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.519
 symbol of 3d buildings like as on 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.570
 iphone 4s or 5 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:14.040
 in fact, as I must see now on 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.400
 my iphone 4 or 3d buildings with 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.700
 all the features that are up there 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.070
 on other devices 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.630
 also as I said before you can have 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.619
 the gps navigator 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.400
 just put a placeholder click 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.500
 on the car it will load the route 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.520
 a preview of the route will appear 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.000
 what we are doing 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.979
 it arrives start that we will feel of life is 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.840
 an itinerary between me and therefore 34 go 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.530
 towards south-east on via luigi vittorio 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.530
 bertarelli 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.579
 as you have heard it will be decided 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.920
 step by step directions for the whole 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.409
 way 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.380
 this is a great alternative to others 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.120
 navigators even if they are not good 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.200
 like the tomtom but free 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.320
 and without going buy hilton women 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.120
 which is not cheap 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.790
 one last tip I give you is that of 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.160
 go to map settings and click 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.500
 on small ruler sizes since 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.750
 so we can have more points than 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.310
 interest on our maps 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.800
 in fact if you try to put normal or 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.600
 big less points will reappear 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.330
 interest 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.240
 well how could you see the steps 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.020
 they are few and simple therefore if you have 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.230
 always wanted 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.490
 3d maps is a navigator without having to 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.550
 spend too much 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.410
 we advise you to follow this guide 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.530
 then we give you our appointment 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.530
 next video and lights from stefano
