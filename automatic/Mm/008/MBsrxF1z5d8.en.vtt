00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.490
 baxter and 2 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.640
 hey creatures welcome to see the 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.270
 episode of the adventures of Miami 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.500
 guarÃ­n names 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.320
 short and for having abandoned one 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.330
 week but I had to recover I was 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.590
 under a cold very very strong you 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.540
 they know that they give me allergies 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.510
 Everywhere I am allergic to oxygen at 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.900
 seem oxygen and water allergy 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.430
 it may look bad but luckily there 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.340
 many people who wished me so many that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.640
 children there were many people who were 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.129
 caring for through the eyes and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.650
 through the neurons and the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.360
 good thoughts I had my little blanket and 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.420
 I had my opitas so take care of me very 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.489
 well and I also have many successes and that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 it helped me a lot in fact I have now 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.360
 one who does mint and helped me so much 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.920
 I heard garage and this mint in 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.860
 this episode we are killing more 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.750
 loved ones and more have a very difficult 90 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.960
 let's say alone in fact 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.159
 It is as recommended and why 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.869
 that I recommend it beyond the topic of 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.100
 on the subject of the transfiguration that is 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.649
 usually for what we do these 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.840
 single bean videos is a bit more 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.229
 utility this guy has a 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.090
 possibility of voting debated very good 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.030
 36 configuration systems to order your 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.729
 quite 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.590
 for magicians of the game that is not a 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.760
 cane for magicians of fire is for everything 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.170
 kind of people we can save 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.780
 gifts but for the headlights of fire you see 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.320
 very cool in case they use canes 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.140
 Of course 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.150
 there is also a bag with gems that 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.890
 you can lot of this type and it is 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.720
 pretty good to take it out in case 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.400
 are going up a jeweler and need 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.410
 materials is pretty good to give 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.970
 to do that also this guy has 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.869
 a mission that is the master's head and 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.110
 gift that in fact you can 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.340
 nail in the first I think it also 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.720
 can nail the mentally but in the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.040
 guilds also cooler or so 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.860
 less it looked cooler at the time 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.400
 where was Carlos carlos iii to 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.330
 vote me to vote also a bag of 20 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.710
 spaces 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.540
 that means that you can 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.190
 save a little bit of gold instead of going to 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.130
 the auction you are going to access and donate 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.670
 and they take out gold, that is, a break is very 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.069
 cool 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.319
 but if you are looking like 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.150
 let's say with the bags and ccoo 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.180
 and all that, let's say you have a 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.440
 high but the same ends the 90 you 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.610
 come here because here they go to 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.340
 find a lot of great things 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.720
 that not necessarily one finds 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.209
 every day at the auction house by 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.180
 very low price or that the day are 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.040
 great to have so there they have 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.140
 basically more had is a root 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.640
 quite short in fact the only boss 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.310
 which is more had not to kill 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.319
 nothing else there are like three groups behind and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.750
 there is one more before the boss which 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.670
 does as quite a pretty function of 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.829
 doing it is a complicated us root 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.500
 in absolutely no way I do not the 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.219
 tasting would perform as complicated in fact 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.510
 you pass in this door they kill the 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.430
 to the others who are keeping more 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.829
 dear ones and you can give as 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.409
 started the meeting things are going to fall 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.840
 of the roof are going to be some 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.040
 fragments are also going to see little things in 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.109
 the dirt floor you do not know 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.389
 they should stop there but in reality the 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.340
 level 90 and if one has equipment of 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.200
 raid finder should not have 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.510
 no problem so that's 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.739
 basically booty gra so I wanted to 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.060
 do this video basically for 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.799
 place it out there to tell them 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.799
 bacteria can not be made is solitary 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.300

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:51.360
