they're<00:00:10.170> compact<00:00:10.650> pilot<00:00:11.130> forts<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.670> how

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
they're compact pilot forts and how

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.089 
they're compact pilot forts and how
they're<00:00:12.030> designed<00:00:12.450> now<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.710> about<00:00:13.920> as

they're designed now this is about as

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.919 
they're designed now this is about as
large<00:00:14.370> attractor<00:00:15.120> as<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.330> would<00:00:15.450> want<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.750> use

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
1,800 pounds of lift and they do use a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.300 
1,800 pounds of lift and they do use a
round<00:00:24.359> rod<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.230> they're<00:00:25.410> not<00:00:25.590> what's<00:00:25.949> called

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
round rod but they're not what's called

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.650 
round rod but they're not what's called
a<00:00:26.609> floating<00:00:27.230> fork<00:00:28.230> which<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.680> hate<00:00:29.099> if<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:30.300> if

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
a floating fork which I hate if you if

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.569 
a floating fork which I hate if you if
you<00:00:30.900> put<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> round<00:00:31.500> bar<00:00:31.769> at<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> top<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
you put the round bar at the top of the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.110 
you put the round bar at the top of the
fork<00:00:32.880> then<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.680> fork<00:00:35.040> will<00:00:35.309> float<00:00:35.730> in

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
fork then the the fork will float in

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.970 
fork then the the fork will float in
other<00:00:36.300> words<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.840> had<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> pallet<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> trash

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
other words if you had a pallet of trash

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.010 
other words if you had a pallet of trash
and<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.879> wanted<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.210> dump<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> into<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and you wanted to dump it into a

and you wanted to dump it into a
dumpster<00:00:40.500> when<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> gets<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.790> about<00:00:41.820> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
dumpster when it gets to about a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.779 
dumpster when it gets to about a
30-degree<00:00:42.870> angle<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.829> fork<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.520> start

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
30-degree angle the fork will just start

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.940 
30-degree angle the fork will just start
to<00:00:44.969> float<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.780> won't<00:00:45.930> let<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.410> dump<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to float out and won't let you dump it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.549 
to float out and won't let you dump it
off<00:00:47.160> into<00:00:47.789> your<00:00:47.940> Forks<00:00:48.420> these<00:00:48.960> will<00:00:49.230> let<00:00:49.350> you

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
off into your Forks these will let you

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.740 
off into your Forks these will let you
turn<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.920> totally<00:00:50.370> vertical<00:00:50.610> drop<00:00:51.510> whatever

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
turn it totally vertical drop whatever

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
turn it totally vertical drop whatever
you<00:00:52.170> want<00:00:52.350> off<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.340> want<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> put<00:00:53.730> down

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
you want off if you want to put down

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.330 
you want off if you want to put down
pressure<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.510> them<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.190> way

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
pressure on them you can and the way

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.430 
pressure on them you can and the way
that<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:56.760> work<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.300> slide<00:00:57.660> real<00:00:57.930> easy<00:00:58.140> if

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that they work they slide real easy if

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
that they work they slide real easy if
you<00:00:58.559> pick<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.489> little<00:00:59.609> bit<00:00:59.789> Kyle

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
you pick up on it a little bit Kyle

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.139 
you pick up on it a little bit Kyle
they're<00:01:00.600> hot<00:01:00.809> 100<00:01:01.410> degrees<00:01:01.739> today<00:01:02.090> okay<00:01:03.090> so

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
they're hot 100 degrees today okay so

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.750 
they're hot 100 degrees today okay so
they<00:01:03.420> slide<00:01:03.719> over<00:01:03.750> easy<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.280> keeps<00:01:05.519> them

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
they slide over easy but what keeps them

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.179 
they slide over easy but what keeps them
from<00:01:05.939> moving<00:01:06.000> around<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.950> they're

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
from moving around is that they're

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.880 
from moving around is that they're
hitting<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:09.060> they're<00:01:09.600> hitting<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
hitting here they're hitting here the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460 
hitting here they're hitting here the
pipe<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> middle<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.689> when<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> pushes

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
pipe is in the middle so when it pushes

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.460 
pipe is in the middle so when it pushes
sideways<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.490> locks<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.270> jams<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.170> can't

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
sideways it locks and jams it you can't

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.280 
sideways it locks and jams it you can't
make<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.100> go<00:01:17.310> over<00:01:17.700> unless<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.720> doesn't<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
make it go over unless it doesn't have a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.310 
make it go over unless it doesn't have a
load<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.369> slide<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.020> slides

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
load on it and you slide so it slides

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.149 
load on it and you slide so it slides
over<00:01:22.650> easy<00:01:23.009> locks<00:01:23.939> into<00:01:24.270> position<00:01:24.509> easy<00:01:25.170> works
