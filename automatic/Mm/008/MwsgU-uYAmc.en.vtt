cleaning up his house I think it's a him
i'm<00:01:09.800> not<00:01:09.950> sure<00:01:10.190> its<00:01:10.430> first<00:01:10.610> person<00:01:11.230> and

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
i'm not sure its first person and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.970 
i'm not sure its first person and
basically<00:01:12.710> that's<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:13.370> yeah<00:01:14.030> begin<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.930> game

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
basically that's it yeah begin the game

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.780 
basically that's it yeah begin the game
packing<00:01:15.980> up<00:01:16.040> your<00:01:16.100> things<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:16.550> head<00:01:16.670> out<00:01:16.760> to

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
packing up your things to head out to

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.720 
packing up your things to head out to
college<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:17.780> explore<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.320> interact<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:19.130> the

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
college you explore and interact and the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.190 
college you explore and interact and the
story<00:01:20.000> reacts<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.570> how<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.720> player<00:01:20.990> moves

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
story reacts to how the player moves

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.320 
story reacts to how the player moves
around<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:21.890> it's<00:01:22.070> pretty<00:01:22.250> open-ended<00:01:22.790> it

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
around so it's pretty open-ended it

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.800 
around so it's pretty open-ended it
seems<00:01:23.780> like<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:25.010> is<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.310> real<00:01:25.880> life<00:01:26.180> simulator

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
seems like this is a real life simulator

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.440 
seems like this is a real life simulator
but<00:01:27.170> not<00:01:27.380> quite<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.830> sims<00:01:28.130> yeah<00:01:28.670> well<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.240> mean

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
but not quite the sims yeah well I mean

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.359 
but not quite the sims yeah well I mean
look<00:01:30.020> theoretically<00:01:30.500> I'm<00:01:30.710> played<00:01:30.979> it<00:01:31.100> you

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
look theoretically I'm played it you

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.650 
look theoretically I'm played it you
could<00:01:31.520> fit<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.760> all<00:01:31.880> sorts<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.390> different

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
could fit in all sorts of different

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.300 
could fit in all sorts of different
story<00:01:33.260> I<00:01:33.530> think<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:33.979> could<00:01:34.040> be<00:01:34.160> interesting

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
story I think it could be interesting

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.550 
story I think it could be interesting
and<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:35.030> mechanic<00:01:35.509> wherein<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.170> starts<00:01:36.440> off

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
and the mechanic wherein it starts off

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.900 
and the mechanic wherein it starts off
in<00:01:36.680> black<00:01:36.830> and<00:01:37.009> white<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:37.280> as<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.640> interact

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
in black and white but as you interact

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.030 
in black and white but as you interact
with<00:01:38.150> things<00:01:38.390> they<00:01:38.660> gain<00:01:38.930> their<00:01:39.110> color<00:01:39.380> that's

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
with things they gain their color that's

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.070 
with things they gain their color that's
an<00:01:40.220> interesting<00:01:40.340> mechanic<00:01:41.240> just<00:01:41.390> by<00:01:41.600> itself<00:01:41.869> i

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
an interesting mechanic just by itself i

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.740 
an interesting mechanic just by itself i
could<00:01:42.259> see<00:01:42.790> various<00:01:43.790> other<00:01:44.000> genres<00:01:44.450> sort<00:01:44.660> of

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
could see various other genres sort of

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.030 
could see various other genres sort of
using<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:45.200> i<00:01:45.259> think<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.680> would<00:01:45.770> be<00:01:45.920> pretty

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
using that i think that would be pretty

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.430 
using that i think that would be pretty
cool<00:01:46.160> um<00:01:46.670> have<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.479> played<00:01:47.780> any<00:01:47.960> of<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.259> big

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
just like I play a lot of different

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.740 
just like I play a lot of different
genres<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.700> roots<00:01:58.880> that's<00:01:59.060> not<00:01:59.300> one<00:01:59.540> of<00:01:59.570> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750

genres on roots that's not one of the
genres<00:02:00.110> that<00:02:00.170> I'm<00:02:00.350> particularly<00:02:00.740> interested

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
genres that I'm particularly interested

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.710 
genres that I'm particularly interested
in<00:02:01.220> but<00:02:01.430> what<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.000> mean<00:02:02.300> what<00:02:02.420> do<00:02:02.480> you<00:02:02.540> think

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
in but what I mean what do you think

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.350 
in but what I mean what do you think
about<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.960> rise<00:02:03.140> of<00:02:03.470> basically<00:02:04.220> real<00:02:05.120> life

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
about the rise of basically real life

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.330 
about the rise of basically real life
simulators<00:02:05.900> I<00:02:06.260> don't<00:02:06.800> even<00:02:06.860> know<00:02:07.010> it<00:02:07.130> like<00:02:07.250> I

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
simulators I don't even know it like I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.620 
simulators I don't even know it like I
guess<00:02:07.490> it's<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.700> real-life<00:02:08.149> similar<00:02:08.450> buts

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
guess it's a real-life similar buts

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.930 
guess it's a real-life similar buts
mostly<00:02:08.989> using<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.530> video<00:02:09.649> game<00:02:09.920> engine<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.729> tell

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
mostly using a video game engine to tell

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.540 
mostly using a video game engine to tell
a<00:02:10.970> story<00:02:11.330> as<00:02:11.600> opposed<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.200> writing<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.800> or<00:02:12.980> you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
a story as opposed to writing it or you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.979 
a story as opposed to writing it or you
know<00:02:13.670> delivering<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.150> model<00:02:14.420> augurs<00:02:14.690> well<00:02:14.810> it's

like the video gamey fitness communities

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.280 
like the video gamey fitness communities
online<00:02:49.820> where<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:50.660> sort<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:50.930> like<00:02:51.019> making

online where it's sort of like making
life<00:02:51.590> into<00:02:51.830> an<00:02:51.950> RPG<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.820> real<00:02:53.000> life

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
life into an RPG and the real life

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.210 
life into an RPG and the real life
things<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.720> do<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.959> crew<00:02:54.380> experience<00:02:55.040> and

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
things you do a crew experience and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.500 
things you do a crew experience and
stuff<00:02:55.340> kind<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:55.820> appeals<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.360> lot<00:02:56.420> of

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
stuff kind that appeals to a lot of

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.390 
stuff kind that appeals to a lot of
nerds<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:57.019> think<00:02:57.290> now<00:02:57.740> when<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.040> flip<00:02:58.310> it

nerds I think now when you flip it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.370 
nerds I think now when you flip it
around<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:58.940> it's<00:02:59.120> turning<00:02:59.390> like<00:02:59.660> like<00:03:00.230> I've

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
around and it's turning like like I've

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.300 
around and it's turning like like I've
never<00:03:00.620> really<00:03:00.890> been<00:03:00.920> in

think<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.940> my<00:03:47.420> lack<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.750> interest<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.500> and

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
think that my lack of interest in it and

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.170 
think that my lack of interest in it and
me<00:03:48.920> being<00:03:48.950> much<00:03:49.489> more<00:03:49.700> in<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.880> more<00:03:50.000> traditional

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
me being much more in a more traditional

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.420 
me being much more in a more traditional
genres<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:51.019> doesn't<00:03:52.010> really<00:03:52.099> it's

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
genres that doesn't really it's

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.770 
genres that doesn't really it's
irrelevant<00:03:52.700> like<00:03:53.060> there's<00:03:53.269> there's<00:03:53.569> enough

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
irrelevant like there's there's enough

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.960 
irrelevant like there's there's enough
room<00:03:53.810> in<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.230> marketplace<00:03:54.769> for<00:03:55.130> sure<00:03:55.340> yeah<00:03:55.640> I

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970

think that you might bring in people to

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.110 
think that you might bring in people to
play<00:03:57.799> games<00:03:58.069> like<00:03:58.220> this<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:58.670> would<00:03:58.730> never

the definition a bit thin but at the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.500 
the definition a bit thin but at the

the<00:04:21.169> hump<00:04:21.289> I<00:04:21.500> guess<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:21.890> can<00:04:22.550> see<00:04:22.760> this<00:04:22.910> being

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
the hump I guess I can see this being

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.320 
the hump I guess I can see this being
very<00:04:23.419> artistic<00:04:24.050> because<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.500> does<00:04:24.680> seem<00:04:24.919> like

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
very artistic because it does seem like

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.450 
very artistic because it does seem like
it<00:04:26.330> just<00:04:27.140> from<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:27.410> trailer<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:28.010> me<00:04:28.100> it<00:04:28.280> seemed

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
it just from the trailer to me it seemed

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.340 
it just from the trailer to me it seemed
like<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.820> point<00:04:29.000> of<00:04:29.090> this<00:04:29.210> was<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.479> find<00:04:29.840> value

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
like the point of this was to find value

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.560 
like the point of this was to find value
and<00:04:30.650> little<00:04:30.919> things<00:04:30.950> around<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:32.120> your

know<00:04:34.789> it<00:04:35.060> may<00:04:35.479> seem<00:04:35.539> kind<00:04:36.320> of<00:04:36.470> mundane<00:04:36.620> but<00:04:37.010> it

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130
