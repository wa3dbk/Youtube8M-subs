that's<00:02:32.519> this<00:02:33.519> is<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.000> know<00:02:34.120> again<00:02:34.590> early<00:02:35.590> in

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
that's this is you know again early in

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.319 
that's this is you know again early in
the<00:02:35.829> construction<00:02:36.340> process<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:36.970> we<00:02:37.150> wouldn't

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
the construction process but we wouldn't

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.199 
the construction process but we wouldn't
be<00:02:37.480> able<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.810> fit<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.230> escalators<00:02:39.069> in<00:02:39.209> after

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
be able to fit the escalators in after

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.819 
be able to fit the escalators in after
we<00:02:40.329> start<00:02:40.599> putting<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.140> exterior<00:02:41.590> walls

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
we start putting in the exterior walls

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.910 
we start putting in the exterior walls
so<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:42.160> got<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.400> put<00:02:42.549> them<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.730> now
