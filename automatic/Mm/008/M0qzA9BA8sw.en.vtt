this installed yet you want to make sure
that<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.700> joint<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.270> correctly<00:00:06.690> positioned

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
that the joint is correctly positioned

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.750 
that the joint is correctly positioned
or<00:00:07.410> centered<00:00:07.799> that's<00:00:07.980> why<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.250> put<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.460> tape

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
of a constriction in the manhole here

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.620 
of a constriction in the manhole here
you<00:00:19.590> use<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.070> short<00:00:20.400> side<00:00:20.730> absolutely<00:00:21.180> pull

doing<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.069> these<00:01:44.299> okay<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.539> you<00:01:45.720> wrap<00:01:45.959> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
doing with these okay so you wrap it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.199 
doing with these okay so you wrap it
around<00:01:46.259> two<00:01:46.770> times<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.369> made<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> connection

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
around two times you made the connection

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.449 
around two times you made the connection
they've<00:01:48.450> been<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.869> take<00:01:49.560> take<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> sock<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
they've been to take take the sock and

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.660 
they've been to take take the sock and
fold<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.789> back<00:01:50.819> I<00:01:51.239> see<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:53.099> complete<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
fold it back I see and then complete the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.770 
fold it back I see and then complete the
installation<00:01:55.340> great<00:01:56.340> that's<00:01:57.239> good<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.569> see

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
installation great that's good I see

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.510 
installation great that's good I see
that<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.989> got<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.590> taken<00:01:58.950> care<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.250> but

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that you got that in taken care of but

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.830 
that you got that in taken care of but
now<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.819> this<00:01:59.939> end<00:02:00.209> we<00:02:00.299> get<00:02:00.450> some<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.750> those

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
now in this end we get some of those

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.199 
now in this end we get some of those
things<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.349> on<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.860> we've<00:02:02.250> got<00:02:02.489> some

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
things going on here we've got some

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.809 
things going on here we've got some
wires<00:02:03.450> coming<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:04.189> that<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.520> guess<00:02:05.670> you're

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
wires coming out that I guess you're

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.339 
wires coming out that I guess you're
going<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.969> tie<00:02:06.239> into<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.750> bond<00:02:06.989> and<00:02:07.289> the

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
going to tie into the bond and the

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.109 
going to tie into the bond and the
manhole<00:02:07.799> some<00:02:08.069> place<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.640> correct<00:02:08.910> yet

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
manhole some place that correct yet

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.639 
manhole some place that correct yet
we're<00:02:09.299> bringing<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> ground<00:02:09.959> outside<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.560> the

we're bringing the ground outside of the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.559 
we're bringing the ground outside of the
joint<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.430> case<00:02:11.670> what<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.239> want<00:02:12.329> to<00:02:12.450> do

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
joint in this case what we want to do

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.330 
joint in this case what we want to do
here<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.470> we're<00:02:13.889> going<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.069> treat<00:02:14.190> this

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
here is we're going to treat this

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.160 
here is we're going to treat this
exactly<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> same<00:02:15.180> we<00:02:15.660> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> connect

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
exactly the same we want to connect

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.750 
exactly the same we want to connect
connect<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> wires<00:02:16.889> to<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.310> flat<00:02:17.549> strap

connect the wires to the flat strap

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.430 
connect the wires to the flat strap
neutrals<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:18.840> case<00:02:19.049> we're<00:02:19.290> also

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
neutrals but in this case we're also

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.229 
neutrals but in this case we're also
going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.010> want<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.280> put<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.489> sealant<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.030> here

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
going to want to put a sealant in here

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.479 
going to want to put a sealant in here
to<00:02:21.900> seal<00:02:22.170> these<00:02:22.380> wires<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.889> the<00:02:22.980> outside<00:02:23.280> world

to seal these wires in the outside world

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.420 
to seal these wires in the outside world
I<00:02:23.700> got<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.620> then<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.920> kind<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.130> bent<00:02:26.340> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
I got it then you just kind of bent the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.010 
I got it then you just kind of bent the
flytrap<00:02:26.670> neutral<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:27.450> got

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
flytrap neutral and got

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.970 
flytrap neutral and got
and<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.140> gives<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.440> an<00:02:30.500> electrical

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
and it gives you an electrical

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.590 
and it gives you an electrical
connection<00:02:31.280> from<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.700> flat<00:02:31.910> straps<00:02:32.240> on<00:02:32.450> this

connection from the flat straps on this

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.290 
connection from the flat straps on this
side<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.320> grounds<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.860> joint<00:02:34.160> connects<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.270> to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
side it grounds the joint connects it to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.180 
side it grounds the joint connects it to
that<00:02:35.540> side<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.530> far<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:36.950> good

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
that side so far so good

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.000 
that side so far so good
so<00:02:37.640> far<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.120> good<00:02:38.150> not<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.140> lot<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.410> utilities

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
so far so good not a lot of utilities

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.770 
so far so good not a lot of utilities
use<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.400> flat<00:02:40.700> scrap<00:02:41.090> some<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.600> more

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
use this flat scrap some of the more

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.400 
use this flat scrap some of the more
urban<00:02:42.110> utilities<00:02:42.860> do<00:02:43.780> what<00:02:44.780> happens<00:02:45.170> if<00:02:45.290> you

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
urban utilities do what happens if you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.980 
urban utilities do what happens if you
get<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.770> more<00:02:45.950> classic<00:02:46.990> utility

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
be the same installation for copper tape

concentric<00:02:58.520> neutral<00:02:58.910> cable<00:02:59.300> how<00:02:59.390> do<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.570> deal

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
concentric neutral cable how do you deal

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.890 
concentric neutral cable how do you deal
with<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.790> shock<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.270> National<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.720> that

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
with the shock in the National on that

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.540 
with the shock in the National on that
that's<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.290> good<00:03:03.410> question<00:03:03.770> from<00:03:03.890> give<00:03:04.520> a

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
that's a good question from give a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.000 
that's a good question from give a
jacket<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:04.970> concentric<00:03:05.420> neutral<00:03:05.780> cable<00:03:06.140> we

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
jacket a concentric neutral cable we

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.560 
jacket a concentric neutral cable we
have<00:03:07.130> an<00:03:07.250> alternate<00:03:07.670> construction<00:03:08.210> for<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
have an alternate construction for the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.130 
have an alternate construction for the
joint<00:03:08.830> where<00:03:09.830> we<00:03:09.950> actually<00:03:10.370> install<00:03:11.140> neutral

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
joint where we actually install neutral

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.620 
joint where we actually install neutral
type<00:03:12.320> wires<00:03:12.590> into<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.580> joint<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.450> bring

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
type wires into the joint so you bring

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.120 
type wires into the joint so you bring
the<00:03:14.750> neutral<00:03:15.050> back<00:03:15.290> all<00:03:15.530> over<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.920> then<00:03:16.010> you

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
the neutral back all over and then you

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.010 
the neutral back all over and then you
tie<00:03:16.310> these<00:03:16.550> into<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:16.970> neutral<00:03:17.330> same<00:03:17.630> sort<00:03:17.930> of

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
tie these into the neutral same sort of

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.330 
tie these into the neutral same sort of
so<00:03:18.080> that's<00:03:18.230> correct<00:03:18.530> yeah<00:03:18.740> you<00:03:18.920> want<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.160> want

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
so that's correct yeah you want you want

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.800 
so that's correct yeah you want you want
to<00:03:19.400> tie<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.640> neutrals<00:03:20.090> back<00:03:20.300> into<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.600> neutral

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
to tie the neutrals back into a neutral

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.200 
to tie the neutrals back into a neutral
wire<00:03:21.140> added<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:21.860> cable<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.610> grounds

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
wire added of the cable and that grounds

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.510 
wire added of the cable and that grounds
the<00:03:23.390> body<00:03:23.600> of<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.900> joint<00:03:24.200> right<00:03:24.470> okay<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.250> got

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
the body of the joint right okay I got

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.810 
the body of the joint right okay I got
it

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
it

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.330 
it
I<00:03:25.850> see<00:03:26.750> that<00:03:26.960> we've<00:03:27.080> got<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.560> splice

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
I see that we've got the splice

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.640 
I see that we've got the splice
installed<00:03:28.880> Harry<00:03:29.330> we<00:03:29.540> got<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:29.810> sealed<00:03:30.110> up<00:03:30.350> but

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
installed Harry we got it sealed up but

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.740 
installed Harry we got it sealed up but
now<00:03:30.800> you<00:03:30.860> got<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.130> seal<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.120> jacket<00:03:32.660> and

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
now you got a seal of the jacket and

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.930 
now you got a seal of the jacket and
deal<00:03:32.960> with<00:03:32.990> all<00:03:33.230> these<00:03:33.410> neutral<00:03:33.920> wires<00:03:34.160> how

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
deal with all these neutral wires how

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.400 
deal with all these neutral wires how
you<00:03:35.000> gonna<00:03:35.060> do<00:03:35.270> that<00:03:35.300> yeah

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
you gonna do that yeah

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
we want to bring these neutral wires

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.180 
we want to bring these neutral wires
outside<00:03:38.390> of<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.780> joint<00:03:39.320> we're<00:03:39.830> going<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.070> do

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
outside of the joint we're going to do

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.050 
outside of the joint we're going to do
is<00:03:40.310> we<00:03:40.400> want<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.670> install<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.120> sealant<00:03:41.600> strip

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.420 

around<00:03:46.060> around<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.900> cable<00:03:47.260> this<00:03:48.070> doesn't

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
around around the cable this doesn't

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.100 
around around the cable this doesn't
look<00:03:48.550> like<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.850> normal<00:03:49.180> mastics<00:03:49.720> area<00:03:50.020> this

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
look like the normal mastics area this

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.010 
look like the normal mastics area this
is<00:03:50.170> something<00:03:50.620> weird<00:03:51.490> yeah<00:03:52.210> this<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:52.990> a

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
is something weird yeah this is a

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.550 
is something weird yeah this is a
silicon<00:03:53.950> power<00:03:54.250> gel<00:03:54.610> sealant<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.360> this<00:03:56.260> this

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
silicon power gel sealant and this this

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.380 
silicon power gel sealant and this this
is<00:03:56.620> used<00:03:57.070> in<00:03:57.340> all<00:03:57.580> of<00:03:57.610> our<00:03:57.820> cold<00:03:58.090> applied

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
is used in all of our cold applied

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.740 
is used in all of our cold applied
applications<00:03:59.250> to<00:04:00.250> seal<00:04:00.490> out<00:04:00.640> moisture<00:04:00.750> well

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
applications to seal out moisture well

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.960 
applications to seal out moisture well
this<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.680> definitely<00:04:02.980> different<00:04:03.310> I've<00:04:03.760> never

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
this is definitely different I've never

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.110 
this is definitely different I've never
seen<00:04:04.240> this<00:04:04.360> use<00:04:04.630> in<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.990> power<00:04:05.590> cable

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
seen this use in a power cable

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.180 
seen this use in a power cable
installation<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.560> has<00:04:08.860> quite<00:04:09.130> a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
installation so and it has quite a

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.010 
installation so and it has quite a
pickle<00:04:09.430> elasticity<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:10.480> quite<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.840> bit<00:04:10.990> of

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
pickle elasticity and quite a bit of

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.780 
pickle elasticity and quite a bit of
going<00:04:11.200> on<00:04:11.290> in<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.530> foundation<00:04:12.100> you<00:04:12.580> want<00:04:12.730> to

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
going on in the foundation you want to

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.510 
going on in the foundation you want to
install<00:04:13.030> this<00:04:13.210> about<00:04:13.690> an<00:04:13.810> inch<00:04:13.960> away<00:04:14.140> from<00:04:14.530> the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
install this about an inch away from the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.000 
install this about an inch away from the
edge<00:04:15.700> of<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.940> jacket<00:04:16.360> and<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.380> assume<00:04:17.830> if

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
edge of the jacket and I assume if

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.770 
edge of the jacket and I assume if
that's<00:04:18.220> compatible<00:04:18.610> with<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.060> cable<00:04:19.420> jackets

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
that's compatible with the cable jackets

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.970 
that's compatible with the cable jackets
in<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:19.930> same<00:04:20.200> like<00:04:20.350> this<00:04:20.470> this<00:04:20.680> has<00:04:20.830> been

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
in the same like this this has been

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
tested tested with the cable jackets in

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.050

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
never seen this in a medium voltage

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.080 
never seen this in a medium voltage
insulation<00:04:30.040> you're<00:04:30.160> not<00:04:30.280> using<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:30.670> in<00:04:30.940> any

rated up to 600 volts oh okay

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.790 
rated up to 600 volts oh okay
now<00:04:39.190> you're<00:04:39.340> flipping<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.240> wide<00:04:40.840> straps<00:04:41.260> you

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
now you're flipping the wide straps you

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.990 
now you're flipping the wide straps you
want<00:04:41.950> to<00:04:42.040> be<00:04:42.100> careful<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.520> fold<00:04:42.850> these<00:04:42.940> flaps

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
want to be careful to fold these flaps

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.080 
want to be careful to fold these flaps
reps<00:04:43.540> down<00:04:43.810> even<00:04:44.230> yeah<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.580> if<00:04:45.670> you<00:04:45.820> had<00:04:46.060> a

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
reps down even yeah and if you had a

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.450 
reps down even yeah and if you had a
copper<00:04:46.930> tape<00:04:47.080> shielded<00:04:47.620> cable<00:04:47.980> you'd<00:04:48.130> bring<00:04:48.340> a

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
copper tape shielded cable you'd bring a

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.010 
copper tape shielded cable you'd bring a
solder<00:04:48.700> block<00:04:48.940> braid<00:04:49.240> out<00:04:49.450> in<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.630> same<00:04:49.840> way

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
solder block braid out in the same way

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.900 
solder block braid out in the same way
that's<00:04:50.380> correct<00:04:50.680> okay<00:04:50.920> and<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.490> put<00:04:51.670> it<00:04:51.760> into

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
that's correct okay and you put it into

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.660 
that's correct okay and you put it into
jail<00:04:52.290> exactly<00:04:53.290> you<00:04:53.560> basically<00:04:53.920> want<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.370> want

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
jail exactly you basically want to want

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.490 
jail exactly you basically want to want
to<00:04:54.730> bring<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:54.970> gel<00:04:55.210> underneath<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:56.260> flats

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
to bring the gel underneath the flats

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.500 
to bring the gel underneath the flats
drop<00:04:56.800> time<00:04:57.610> down

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
drop time down

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.040 
drop time down
in<00:04:59.110> there<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.910> I<00:05:00.970> guess<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.330> red<00:05:01.510> tape<00:05:01.780> comes

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
in there and I guess the red tape comes

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.220 
in there and I guess the red tape comes
in<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.290> kit<00:05:02.530> huh<00:05:02.740> yesterday<00:05:03.750> okay<00:05:04.750> I<00:05:04.780> see<00:05:05.080> that

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
in the kit huh yesterday okay I see that

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.560 
in the kit huh yesterday okay I see that
we<00:05:05.320> got<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.590> gel<00:05:06.100> on<00:05:06.130> your<00:05:06.370> knees<00:05:06.580> here<00:05:07.030> and

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
we got the gel on your knees here and

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.240 
we got the gel on your knees here and
there<00:05:07.720> how<00:05:08.080> are<00:05:08.140> you<00:05:08.230> gonna<00:05:08.350> recover<00:05:08.770> how

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
there how are you gonna recover how

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.570 
there how are you gonna recover how
you're<00:05:09.400> gonna<00:05:09.460> cover<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:10.060> entire<00:05:10.110> joint

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
you're gonna cover the entire joint

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.190 
you're gonna cover the entire joint
Frank<00:05:12.580> we're<00:05:12.700> gonna<00:05:12.820> use<00:05:13.120> our<00:05:13.360> new<00:05:13.600> power<00:05:13.900> gel

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
Frank we're gonna use our new power gel

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.380 
Frank we're gonna use our new power gel
sealed<00:05:14.560> rejecting<00:05:15.190> sleeve<00:05:15.460> this<00:05:16.330> is

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
sealed rejecting sleeve this is

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.110 
sealed rejecting sleeve this is
something<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.870> haven't<00:05:17.050> seen<00:05:17.200> before<00:05:17.350> Harry

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
something I haven't seen before Harry

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.310 
something I haven't seen before Harry
why<00:05:19.120> don't<00:05:19.150> you<00:05:19.330> tell<00:05:19.600> me<00:05:19.690> a<00:05:19.750> little<00:05:19.810> bit<00:05:20.020> about

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
why don't you tell me a little bit about

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.050 
why don't you tell me a little bit about
it<00:05:20.560> this<00:05:20.710> looks<00:05:20.920> kind<00:05:21.160> of<00:05:21.220> strange<00:05:21.430> on<00:05:21.790> the<00:05:21.820> end

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
it this looks kind of strange on the end

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.970 
it this looks kind of strange on the end
kind<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.390> like<00:05:22.510> an<00:05:22.660> accordion<00:05:22.960> yeah<00:05:23.620> going<00:05:23.800> on

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
kind of like an accordion yeah going on

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.920 
kind of like an accordion yeah going on
there<00:05:24.190> this<00:05:24.460> is<00:05:24.610> a<00:05:24.640> corrugated<00:05:25.210> elastomeric

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
there this is a corrugated elastomeric

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.900 
there this is a corrugated elastomeric
sleeve<00:05:26.320> that<00:05:26.980> has<00:05:27.130> an<00:05:27.280> integrated<00:05:27.520> lock

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
sleeve that has an integrated lock

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.000 
sleeve that has an integrated lock
mechanism<00:05:28.510> on<00:05:28.630> both<00:05:28.780> sides<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.800> power

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
mechanism on both sides and the power

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.490 
mechanism on both sides and the power
gel<00:05:30.340> sealant<00:05:30.790> so<00:05:31.510> this<00:05:31.720> is<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:32.020> same<00:05:32.230> power

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
gel sealant so this is the same power

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.560 
gel sealant so this is the same power
gel<00:05:32.860> that<00:05:33.010> we<00:05:33.130> used<00:05:33.340> on<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.550> end<00:05:33.880> you<00:05:34.390> just

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
gel that we used on the end you just

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.510 
gel that we used on the end you just
kind<00:05:34.780> of<00:05:34.840> laid<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.200> in<00:05:35.290> there<00:05:35.650> I<00:05:35.830> understand

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
kind of laid it in there I understand

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.790 
kind of laid it in there I understand
that<00:05:36.850> I<00:05:36.880> can<00:05:37.330> see<00:05:37.510> get<00:05:37.750> it<00:05:37.870> it<00:05:38.170> stretches<00:05:38.560> a

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
that I can see get it it stretches a

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.740 
that I can see get it it stretches a
little<00:05:38.890> bit<00:05:39.220> so<00:05:39.400> I'm<00:05:39.580> gonna<00:05:39.700> over<00:05:40.000> go<00:05:40.480> over

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
little bit so I'm gonna over go over

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.470 
little bit so I'm gonna over go over
different<00:05:40.930> size<00:05:41.880> geometries<00:05:42.880> but<00:05:43.090> what<00:05:43.210> about

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
different size geometries but what about

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.420 
different size geometries but what about
the<00:05:43.840> seal<00:05:44.080> where<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.410> comes<00:05:44.620> together<00:05:44.770> the

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
the seal where it comes together the

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.100 
the seal where it comes together the
power<00:05:45.610> gel<00:05:45.880> sealant<00:05:46.240> is<00:05:46.330> actually<00:05:46.720> installed

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
power gel sealant is actually installed

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.020 
power gel sealant is actually installed
on<00:05:47.380> both<00:05:47.410> ends<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.040> then<00:05:48.580> it's<00:05:48.760> run<00:05:49.000> down

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
on both ends and then it's run down

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.440 
on both ends and then it's run down
inside<00:05:49.630> of<00:05:49.780> this<00:05:49.900> seed<00:05:50.260> and<00:05:50.700> inside<00:05:51.700> of<00:05:51.820> when

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
inside of this seed and inside of when

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.210 
inside of this seed and inside of when
this<00:05:52.540> is<00:05:52.750> closed<00:05:53.050> there's<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.650> slot<00:05:53.920> that<00:05:54.190> goes

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
this is closed there's a slot that goes

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.130 
this is closed there's a slot that goes
into<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.580> sleeve<00:05:54.970> I<00:05:55.180> got<00:05:55.360> it<00:05:55.510> that<00:05:55.630> seam<00:05:55.930> and

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
into that sleeve I got it that seam and

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.740 
into that sleeve I got it that seam and
seal<00:05:56.440> seal<00:05:57.160> on<00:05:57.370> me<00:05:57.520> hardly<00:05:57.970> around<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.330> colony

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
seal seal on me hardly around the colony

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.470 
seal seal on me hardly around the colony
on<00:05:58.960> the<00:05:59.110> ends<00:05:59.350> as<00:05:59.440> well<00:05:59.620> right<00:06:00.190> okay<00:06:00.790> how<00:06:01.330> does

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
on the ends as well right okay how does

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.030 
on the ends as well right okay how does
this<00:06:01.540> go<00:06:01.750> on<00:06:01.900> there<00:06:02.110> so<00:06:02.380> this<00:06:02.500> is<00:06:02.620> very<00:06:02.740> simple

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
this go on there so this is very simple

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.370 
this go on there so this is very simple
we<00:06:03.190> just<00:06:03.370> basically<00:06:03.520> want<00:06:03.970> a<00:06:04.000> Center<00:06:04.390> doesn't

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
we just basically want a Center doesn't

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.470 
we just basically want a Center doesn't
matter<00:06:05.650> which<00:06:05.890> ways<00:06:06.130> which<00:06:06.430> matter<00:06:07.090> which<00:06:07.300> way

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
matter which ways which matter which way

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.640 
matter which ways which matter which way
is<00:06:07.540> which<00:06:07.720> you<00:06:07.870> want<00:06:08.020> to<00:06:08.080> Center<00:06:08.350> the<00:06:08.440> sleeve

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
is which you want to Center the sleeve

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.830 
is which you want to Center the sleeve
over<00:06:08.920> the<00:06:09.010> joint<00:06:09.360> making<00:06:10.360> sure<00:06:10.540> that<00:06:10.690> the

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
over the joint making sure that the

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.570 
over the joint making sure that the
power<00:06:11.020> gel<00:06:11.290> overlaps<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:11.920> jacket<00:06:12.310> on<00:06:12.430> this

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
power gel overlaps the jacket on this

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.790 
power gel overlaps the jacket on this
side<00:06:12.790> and<00:06:13.390> overlaps<00:06:13.810> the<00:06:14.050> seal<00:06:14.260> on<00:06:14.320> this<00:06:14.560> side

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
side and overlaps the seal on this side

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.170 
side and overlaps the seal on this side
yeah<00:06:14.950> I<00:06:15.010> can<00:06:15.160> see<00:06:15.310> one<00:06:15.520> advantage<00:06:16.000> is<00:06:16.150> you

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
yeah I can see one advantage is you

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.700 
yeah I can see one advantage is you
don't<00:06:16.450> have<00:06:16.600> to<00:06:16.690> stick<00:06:16.870> this<00:06:17.050> on<00:06:17.230> the<00:06:17.260> cable

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
don't have to stick this on the cable

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.200 
don't have to stick this on the cable
before<00:06:18.040> you<00:06:18.160> start<00:06:18.430> out<00:06:18.610> very<00:06:18.880> big<00:06:19.090> advantage

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
before you start out very big advantage

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.670 
before you start out very big advantage
in

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
in

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.770 
in
whole<00:06:20.800> applications<00:06:21.490> taking<00:06:22.330> a<00:06:22.389> sleeve<00:06:22.630> that

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
whole applications taking a sleeve that

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.420 
whole applications taking a sleeve that
you<00:06:22.930> can<00:06:23.050> just<00:06:23.229> wrap<00:06:23.410> around<00:06:23.440> the<00:06:23.889> joint

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
you can just wrap around the joint

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.520 
you can just wrap around the joint
now<00:06:25.090> we're<00:06:25.210> gonna<00:06:25.330> seal<00:06:25.630> the<00:06:25.780> jacket<00:06:26.199> up<00:06:26.289> carry

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
now we're gonna seal the jacket up carry

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.379 
now we're gonna seal the jacket up carry
yeah<00:06:27.100> we're<00:06:27.430> gonna<00:06:27.550> take<00:06:27.789> this<00:06:27.970> wraparound

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
yeah we're gonna take this wraparound

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:29.969 
yeah we're gonna take this wraparound
sleeve<00:06:28.810> I'm<00:06:29.080> not<00:06:29.259> gonna<00:06:29.410> touch<00:06:29.590> it<00:06:29.770> cause<00:06:29.860> it's

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
sleeve I'm not gonna touch it cause it's

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.629 
sleeve I'm not gonna touch it cause it's
gonna<00:06:30.039> be<00:06:30.160> a<00:06:30.280> one-man<00:06:30.520> show<00:06:31.090> and<00:06:32.400> simply<00:06:33.400> slide

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 
gonna be a one-man show and simply slide

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:34.950 
gonna be a one-man show and simply slide
the<00:06:33.789> product<00:06:34.150> together<00:06:34.270> you're<00:06:34.930> just

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
the product together you're just

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.390 
the product together you're just
squeezing<00:06:35.259> that<00:06:35.530> together<00:06:35.680> with<00:06:36.009> your<00:06:36.160> hands

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
squeezing that together with your hands
