00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.240
 hello friends and jorge first search in 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.590
 today's video I will teach different 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.260
 configurations that can be made 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.570
 with a single punch the concho is worth 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.640
 I'm going to use is the poncho which 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.000
 I made the meeting the last video for the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.740
 course of the concho of a thousand texts 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.630
 we will normally carry a single mattress 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.580
 the most logical thing why I'm going to do 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.040
 configurations with a single poncho vÃ©lez 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.780
 in case we get that other 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.580
 person then carry another or we could 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.610
 do with the best refuge 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.780
 conditions and bigger then I'm going to 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.970
 teach the different types of 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.440
 conditions and I will explain in some of 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.520
 which ones work best for 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.050
 certain types of weather by 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.390
 example in big rain storms 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.979
 ok since it's a small surface 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.030
 which covers the car from depends 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.800
 also of the structure of each 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.560
 person of the size but it is 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.810
 quite small dimensions then 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.190
 the space which protects you is 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.930
 rather reduced then according to the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.610
 climatology then we will have to play 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.640
 with the height at which it is located at 8 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.320
 and the hand is not too long I'm going to do 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.970
 a series of videos I'm going to divide it by 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.250
 for refuge 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.920
 I hope you like it, so let's go there 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.220
 good friends in this configuration as 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.720
 You see, it 's totally elevated from the ground 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.970
 none of the parts of the poncho touches the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.950
 floor and this poncho is sorry this 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.450
 Poncho configuration is good 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.040
 just to cover the rain 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.200
 in case we are sitting 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.300
 below we can put our equipment 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.040
 below and thus protect us from a rain 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.870
 that fall 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.720
 in this position we could not sleep 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.909
 since as you can see 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.570
 the mattress is not placed 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.650
 on the diagonal along 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.650
 the poncho is worth 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.090
 the cap the lingerie the part that is not 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.679
 is for us ahead and there is the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.700
 party was not behind so 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.110
 both the part 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.940
 of the longest of the control of this one 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.880
 this would be the width and even the length by 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.530
 so here we could not sleep but 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.530
 yes it would be good web to cover 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.530
 let's see it like that 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.709
 good friends in this arrangement here 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.390
 As you can see, this is how it is 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.580
 contrary that the previous one is valid and 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.860
 The same thing is totally raised 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.980
 of the soil without any point of the poncho 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.720
 touching the ground is worth and here and well 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.660
 we could sleep here we could 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.250
 rest below obviously if there 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.140
 heavy rain and so on, you get wet no 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.489
 it gets a little wet obviously we notice the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.500
 just as having nothing on it does not 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.690
 but on the sides especially one 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.400
 six-foot person like me 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:02.099
 well here on the sides 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.049
 especially the long ones in the head and 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.129
 Your feet may get wet 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.049
 Tiny but as I say everything depends not 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.489
 depends on if it does not rain with wind and 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.550
 puts you under if it only rains 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.770
 totally vertical then it 's fleeting 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.630
 it depends also 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.190
 for this mini forms still do not 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.260
 might 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.750
 lift more guns labels and 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.930
 make it a little flatter the race of 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.430
 two waters of this fact a little more 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.700
 they fell referee would cover a little more 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.120
 for the sides but as you see 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.620
 perfectly here below with a cover 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.620
 live I do something because you could sleep 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.550
 well this would be the second vale 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.010
 where we would have the poncho 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.220
 totally 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.370
 lifted off the ground let's see more 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.370
 speed
