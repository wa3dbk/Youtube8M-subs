mounted up behind the seat of the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.030 
mounted up behind the seat of the
platform<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.260> water<00:01:04.500> was<00:01:04.739> popped

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
platform of it and the water was popped

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.230 
platform of it and the water was popped
all<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> way<00:01:05.430> back<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> floor<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
all the way back to the floor that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
all the way back to the floor that
normally<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.260> water<00:01:07.470> pump<00:01:07.830> would<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
normally the water pump would be on the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.370 
normally the water pump would be on the
tractor<00:01:08.909> itself<00:01:09.240> moving<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> radiators

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
tractor itself moving the radiators

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.550 
tractor itself moving the radiators
would<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.680> back<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> back<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.820> guess

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
would be back here on the back I guess

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.469 
would be back here on the back I guess
in<00:01:13.560> order<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.189> prevent<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.850> getting<00:01:14.880> clogged

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
in order to prevent it getting clogged

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.289 
in order to prevent it getting clogged
with<00:01:15.659> dust<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.200> debris<00:01:16.950> which<00:01:17.430> naturally

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
with dust and debris which naturally

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.230 
with dust and debris which naturally
there's<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.600> lot<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.080> when<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> pick<00:01:19.500> cotton

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
there's a lot of it when you pick cotton

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.429 
there's a lot of it when you pick cotton
the<00:01:21.240> water<00:01:21.420> would<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.750> popped<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the water would be popped up to the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.010 
the water would be popped up to the
radiator<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.729> pipe<00:01:23.939> back<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.840> once

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
radiator and then pipe back and once

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.060 
radiator and then pipe back and once
it's<00:01:25.170> cool<00:01:25.380> off

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it's cool off

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.660 
it's cool off
and<00:01:26.790> also<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.750> breather<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.320> popped<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.860> on

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and also the breather was popped up on

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.190 
and also the breather was popped up on
the<00:01:29.700> normally<00:01:30.450> what<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> breeder<00:01:30.930> would

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the normally what the breeder would

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.010 
the normally what the breeder would
stick<00:01:31.439> out<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> hood<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.420> popped

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
stick out from the hood it was popped

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.140 
stick out from the hood it was popped
out<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.439> sides<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.280> less<00:01:35.460> likely<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
out to the sides would be less likely to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.330 
out to the sides would be less likely to
catch<00:01:36.840> dust<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> also<00:01:37.530> make<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.890> easier<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
catch dust and also make it easier to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.050 
catch dust and also make it easier to
clean<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> filter<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:40.579> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:41.820> also

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
clean out the filter on it and then also

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.490 
clean out the filter on it and then also
unless<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:44.270> two<00:01:45.270> row<00:01:45.479> picker<00:01:46.140> most

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
unless this is a two row picker most

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.670 
unless this is a two row picker most
time<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:47.250> were<00:01:47.310> built<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.850> row<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:52.409> this

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
time they were built one row and this

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.880 
time they were built one row and this
model<00:01:53.040> also<00:01:53.460> has<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.720> water<00:01:55.049> tank<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> side

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
model also has a water tank on the side

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.520 
model also has a water tank on the side
this<00:01:56.189> water<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.790> used<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.450> help<00:01:58.140> keep<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
this water was used to help keep the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.219 
this water was used to help keep the
spindles<00:01:59.009> went<00:01:59.250> it<00:02:00.000> would<00:02:00.090> help<00:02:00.240> bond<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
spindles went it would help bond to the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.749 
spindles went it would help bond to the
cotton<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.710> Contin<00:02:02.130> pass<00:02:02.340> through<00:02:02.640> the

cotton is the Contin pass through the

cotton is the Contin pass through the
headers

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
headers

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.330 
headers
and<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.689> lot<00:02:05.259> of<00:02:05.380> times<00:02:05.590> this<00:02:05.770> would<00:02:05.950> be<00:02:06.100> mixed

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
and a lot of times this would be mixed

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.460 
and a lot of times this would be mixed
with<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.670> detergent<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.479> some<00:02:07.659> sort<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.170> make<00:02:08.349> it

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
with a detergent of some sort to make it

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.800 
with a detergent of some sort to make it
just<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.739> little<00:02:08.770> bit<00:02:09.069> sticky<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:10.509> would<00:02:10.660> help

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
just a little bit sticky it would help

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.030 
just a little bit sticky it would help
the<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:12.220> headers<00:02:13.200> grip<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.349> cotton<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:14.800> pull

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
the the headers grip the cotton and pull

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.850 
the the headers grip the cotton and pull
it<00:02:15.160> off<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.459> stock<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:17.110> then<00:02:17.260> basically<00:02:17.709> the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
it off the stock and then basically the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.920 
it off the stock and then basically the
rest<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.459> would<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:18.910> be<00:02:19.150> with<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.660> blower

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
rest of it would just be with a blower

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.720 
rest of it would just be with a blower
system<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.680> vacuum<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.280> sucked<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
system and the vacuum it sucked the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.630 
system and the vacuum it sucked the
cotton<00:02:22.090> up<00:02:22.209> as<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.599> did<00:02:22.810> pulled<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.380> off<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:24.430> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
cotton up as it did pulled it off of the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.610 
cotton up as it did pulled it off of the
common<00:02:25.000> stock<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.510> blow<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.110> up<00:02:26.200> into<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
common stock and blow it up into the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.699 
common stock and blow it up into the
basket<00:02:27.069> itself

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
basket itself

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.229 
basket itself
how<00:02:29.709> many<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.040> acres<00:02:30.550> would<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.880> be<00:02:31.000> able<00:02:31.150> to

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
how many of acres would you be able to

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.750 
how many of acres would you be able to
put<00:02:31.690> into<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.930> basket<00:02:32.230> like<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.800> or<00:02:33.069> this

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
put into a basket like that or this

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.370 
put into a basket like that or this
basket<00:02:34.300> here<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.690> would<00:02:34.840> probably<00:02:35.200> hold

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
basket here it would probably hold

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.110 
basket here it would probably hold
public<00:02:36.340> less<00:02:36.760> than<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.060> bale<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.269> cotton<00:02:39.120> which

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
public less than a bale of cotton which

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.660 
public less than a bale of cotton which
would<00:02:40.330> be<00:02:40.709> probably<00:02:41.709> around<00:02:41.920> 1,200<00:02:42.549> pound<00:02:44.670> of

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
would be probably around 1,200 pound of

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.740 
would be probably around 1,200 pound of
cotton<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.180> pull<00:02:46.480> right<00:02:46.660> off<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.019> stock<00:02:48.750> now

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
cotton you pull right off the stock now

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.390 
cotton you pull right off the stock now
Europe<00:02:50.170> you're<00:02:50.410> building<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.799> series<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.160> these

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
Europe you're building a series of these

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.030 
Europe you're building a series of these
so<00:02:51.760> yeah<00:02:52.299> I've<00:02:52.450> built<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.989> John<00:02:53.470> Deere<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.860> one

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
so yeah I've built a John Deere of one

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.190 
so yeah I've built a John Deere of one
row<00:02:54.250> John<00:02:54.549> Deere<00:02:54.790> number<00:02:55.150> 22<00:02:55.569> miles<00:02:55.840> which<00:02:56.080> is

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
row John Deere number 22 miles which is

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.339 
row John Deere number 22 miles which is
mounted<00:02:56.380> only<00:02:56.680> 530<00:02:57.370> John<00:02:57.670> Deere<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.959> then

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
mounted only 530 John Deere and then

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.620 
mounted only 530 John Deere and then
also<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.799> built<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:01.019> 6<00:03:02.019> 16<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.709> 416

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
also I built a a 6 16 a 416

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.660 
also I built a a 6 16 a 416
International<00:03:04.630> Harvester<00:03:05.590> cotton<00:03:06.519> picker

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
International Harvester cotton picker

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.410 
International Harvester cotton picker
it's<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.030> two<00:03:07.239> row<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:08.760> I've<00:03:09.760> got<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.030> few<00:03:10.299> more

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
it's a two row and I've got a few more

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.930 
it's a two row and I've got a few more
models<00:03:10.900> in<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.500> in<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.040> makings<00:03:12.489> that<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.760> want

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
models in the in the makings that I want

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.430 
models in the in the makings that I want
to<00:03:13.060> build<00:03:13.180> before<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.690> probably<00:03:13.989> get<00:03:14.170> out<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.410> a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
to build before I probably get out of a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.819 
to build before I probably get out of a
cup<00:03:14.650> picker<00:03:14.920> business<00:03:15.340> but<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:17.590> gonna<00:03:17.739> be

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
cup picker business but it's gonna be

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.699 
cup picker business but it's gonna be
part<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.280> large-scale<00:03:19.260> display<00:03:20.260> though<00:03:20.470> on

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
part of a large-scale display though on

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.410 
part of a large-scale display though on
the<00:03:20.799> field<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.819> he<00:03:21.910> probably<00:03:22.060> taught<00:03:22.299> me

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
the field and he probably taught me

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.009 
the field and he probably taught me
several<00:03:22.690> years<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.170> get<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.440> all<00:03:23.590> done<00:03:25.019> usually

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
several years to get it all done usually

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.509 
several years to get it all done usually
I've<00:03:26.230> been<00:03:26.410> turning<00:03:26.620> out<00:03:26.799> about<00:03:27.069> a<00:03:27.100> picture<00:03:27.370> a

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
I've been turning out about a picture a

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.809 
I've been turning out about a picture a
year<00:03:27.870> how<00:03:28.870> many<00:03:29.220> hours<00:03:30.220> do<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.459> put<00:03:30.670> into

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
year how many hours do you put into

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.729 
year how many hours do you put into
something<00:03:30.940> like<00:03:31.390> this<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:32.109> get<00:03:32.230> off<00:03:32.350> a<00:03:32.500> lot

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
something like this to to get off a lot

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.170 
something like this to to get off a lot
of<00:03:32.859> people<00:03:33.100> ask<00:03:33.250> me<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:33.639> really<00:03:34.000> don't

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
of people ask me that I really don't

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.890 
of people ask me that I really don't
keep<00:03:34.389> up<00:03:34.600> with<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.430> I've<00:03:36.430> been<00:03:36.489> building<00:03:36.900> for

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
keep up with it I I've been building for

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.979 
keep up with it I I've been building for
about<00:03:37.989> six<00:03:38.470> seven<00:03:38.709> years<00:03:38.829> now<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.810> it's<00:03:40.810> just

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
about six seven years now and it's just

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.229 
about six seven years now and it's just
so<00:03:41.139> easy<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.650> burn<00:03:42.010> three<00:03:42.370> or<00:03:42.430> four<00:03:42.579> hours<00:03:43.030> and

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
so easy to burn three or four hours and

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.940 
so easy to burn three or four hours and
not<00:03:43.389> get<00:03:43.569> anything<00:03:43.810> done<00:03:44.170> at<00:03:44.350> all<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:44.859> it's

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
not get anything done at all and it's

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.370 
not get anything done at all and it's
just<00:03:45.010> really<00:03:45.280> hard<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.639> keep<00:03:45.760> up<00:03:46.000> with<00:03:46.150> it

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
just really hard to keep up with it

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.080 
just really hard to keep up with it
getting<00:03:47.380> some<00:03:47.620> idea<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.400> my<00:03:48.519> spare<00:03:48.819> time

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
getting some idea this is my spare time

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.390 
getting some idea this is my spare time
I<00:03:49.120> built<00:03:49.510> this<00:03:49.630> over<00:03:49.989> about<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.799> three<00:03:50.889> months

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
I built this over about a three months

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.879 
I built this over about a three months
period<00:03:51.750> but<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.810> really<00:03:53.139> devoted<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.590> lot<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.769> my

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
period but I really devoted a lot of my

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.129 
period but I really devoted a lot of my
Saturdays<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:54.790> Sundays<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.420> nights<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:56.019> it
