00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.110
 the ear 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.010
 hello how are my darlings today the two 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.070
 Welcome to the summer flower and crazy that goes 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.330
 to be full of heat fun of 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.040
 love and a lot of good vibes and many 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.050
 entertaining activities to do in 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.059
 this summer so while we 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.820
 we take a good Christmas water with 

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:26.470
 many ice to take away from the heat 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.349
 I'm going to present the first craft 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.349
 of the summer the crazy that is about how 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.809
 dye some shirts or white cloth with 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.690
 permanent markers and alcohol is 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.000
 super mega easy and very very entertaining 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.160
 for children and adults because people like 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.130
 a magic and you when they do what 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.360
 you will see right now they will not see in the video 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.130
 they can let children do their 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.020
 own super super colorful designs 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.579
 for your shirts and you too 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.220
 they can make their own designs a 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.720
 little bit more here more serious or more 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.090
 combining nothing else the colors I eat 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.310
 I always make everything colorful and full of 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.290
 good vibes and good vibes so let's say 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.360
 we made the example as for children 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.670
 but it can be done also for large 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.770
 so if you want to know how they are made 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.990
 the awake the next tutorial and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.570
 we continue here refreshing in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.570
 this beautiful summer good vibrates 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:26.170
 we are going to need permanent markers 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.750
 one vessel white shirt leagues one 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.490
 syringe or dropper and alcohol first 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.950
 decide what part of your beach you want 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:44.980
 paint and then place the glasses by 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:47.380
 inside the shirt and hold the fabric 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.480
 with the beams make sure the fabric 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.480
 be well stretched and tight 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.720
 with all the bases that you like 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.880
 now we put some alcohol in a 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.880
 cup 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:16.170
 and then we started drawing 12 lines 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.120
 and figures in the center of each under everything 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.270
 must always go from the center to 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.270
 outside 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.389
 When our drawing is ready we take 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.719
 a little alcohol with the syringe or the 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.719
 dropper 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.120
 and we put only a few droplets in 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.140
 the center of the drawing and we'll see how 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.140
 the magic begins 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.060
 You can make different designs of 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.100
 many colors or just make a design 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.630
 two colors and repeat it in all the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.630
 t-shirt this is your 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.380
 As I tell you, just put a few drops 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.810
 of alcohol and be patient so that it 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.630
 scatter throughout the circle because if 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.820
 the other washes the ink will exceed the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.210
 league and will mix with the others 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.210
 circles 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.450
 do not 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.440
 I also recommend you collate colors 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.360
 light and dark and do not put the 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.360
 dark colors in a row 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.360
 and 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.760
 the next thing is to wait for it to dry and 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.140
 when it is dry we can remove the 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.140
 beams and take out the glasses 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:25.530
 fill the empty spaces with 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:28.290
 other smaller vessels like these and 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.260
 we can also do half circles in 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.290
 the edges like here finally when 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.229
 is well well dry iron we will do the 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.810
 T-shirt above what was painted 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.090
 five minutes with the highest heat 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.680
 this is to fix the color is 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.449
 important that when you see it your shirt 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.050
 do it separately so as not to stain 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.050
 other clothes 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.850
 and it is ready and have been me 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.680
 different designs that we did if 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.650
 you want you can choose only one and 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.510
 do the same on the whole shirt 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.770
 accommodate them in diagonal lines swap and 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.820
 you will know how to do it 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.650
