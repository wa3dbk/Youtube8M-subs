a<00:00:00.060> kazoo<00:00:00.599> G<00:00:00.870> and<00:00:01.079> I'm<00:00:01.170> back<00:00:01.290> here<00:00:01.439> with<00:00:01.500> another

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
a kazoo G and I'm back here with another

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.740 
a kazoo G and I'm back here with another
training<00:00:02.250> spot<00:00:02.580> so<00:00:02.850> right<00:00:03.060> here<00:00:03.330> it's<00:00:03.540> by

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
training spot so right here it's by

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.349 
training spot so right here it's by
stamina<00:00:04.200> or<00:00:04.410> generator<00:00:05.009> five<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:06.060> reason

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
stamina or generator five and the reason

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.120 
stamina or generator five and the reason
why<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.779> considered<00:00:06.930> good<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:07.620> because

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
why this is considered good is because

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.390 
why this is considered good is because
this<00:00:08.760> spawns<00:00:09.150> are<00:00:09.450> super<00:00:10.050> super<00:00:10.590> fast<00:00:11.070> and

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
this spawns are super super fast and

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.280 
this spawns are super super fast and
it's<00:00:11.820> not<00:00:11.969> even<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.330> hard<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.719> train<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.230> know

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
it's not even that hard to train I know

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.350 
it's not even that hard to train I know
it<00:00:13.679> looks<00:00:13.889> really<00:00:14.370> tight<00:00:14.700> at<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.880> first<00:00:15.150> glance

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
it looks really tight at a first glance

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.540 
it looks really tight at a first glance

and for the second and third guns I

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.479 
and for the second and third guns I
recommend<00:00:42.360> having<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:43.379> least<00:00:43.530> an<00:00:43.739> LMG<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.399> be

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
recommend having at least an LMG can be

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.069 
recommend having at least an LMG can be
the<00:00:44.640> MgO<00:00:44.940> weight<00:00:45.149> pack<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> punch<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.780> really

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the MgO weight pack a punch I really

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.389 
the MgO weight pack a punch I really
recommend<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.129> has<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
recommend that because it has like a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.990 
recommend that because it has like a
high<00:00:47.640> mo<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.329> maybe<00:00:49.320> even<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.219> Mouser<00:00:50.489> pack<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
high mo and maybe even the Mouser pack a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.549 
high mo and maybe even the Mouser pack a
punch<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.539> whatever<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.960> want<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> use<00:00:52.350> maybe

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
punch or whatever you want to use maybe

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.200 
punch or whatever you want to use maybe
the<00:00:52.710> mark<00:00:52.890> -<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> think<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> mark<00:00:53.850> -<00:00:54.000> would<00:00:54.120> be

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the mark - I think the mark - would be

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.360 
the mark - I think the mark - would be
better<00:00:54.390> basically<00:00:55.230> another<00:00:55.829> reason<00:00:56.190> why<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
better basically another reason why this

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.580 
better basically another reason why this
training<00:00:56.879> spot<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> good<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.690> because<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.410> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
training spot is good is because if you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.400 
training spot is good is because if you
do<00:00:59.370> feel<00:00:59.670> that<00:01:00.030> you're<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.320> this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
do feel that you're just like in this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.650 
do feel that you're just like in this
tight<00:01:01.680> space<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.609> go<00:01:02.820> down<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.359> either

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
tight space you can go down on either

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
tight space you can go down on either
side<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.379> here<00:01:04.559> by<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.769> sole<00:01:05.010> chest<00:01:05.280> or

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
side so down here by the sole chest or

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.039 
side so down here by the sole chest or
on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> other<00:01:05.850> side<00:01:06.150> where<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.420> first<00:01:06.659> enter

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
on the other side where you first enter

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.530 
on the other side where you first enter
when<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.290> unlock<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> debris<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.670> another

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
when you unlock the debris and another

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.740 
when you unlock the debris and another
tip<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.260> don't<00:01:11.159> advise<00:01:11.570> turning<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
tip is I don't advise turning on the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.810 
tip is I don't advise turning on the
generator<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.500> down<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
generator if it's down like here all the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
generator if it's down like here all the
generators<00:01:15.240> were<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.780> definitely<00:01:16.229> do

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
generators were down so definitely do

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.950 
generators were down so definitely do
not<00:01:16.470> turn<00:01:16.740> them<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.189> round<00:01:17.549> 47<00:01:18.390> because

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
not turn them on at round 47 because

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.230 
not turn them on at round 47 because
it's<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.189> worth<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.850> mean<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.119> get

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it's really not worth it I mean you get

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.550 
it's really not worth it I mean you get
to<00:01:21.390> still<00:01:21.570> use<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:21.840> purse<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> doesn't<00:01:22.470> turn

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
to still use your purse it doesn't turn

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.260 
to still use your purse it doesn't turn
the<00:01:22.740> perks<00:01:22.979> off<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> only<00:01:24.000> thing<00:01:24.180> about

reload<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.680> actually<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.009> tight

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
reload like this is actually a tight

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.340 
reload like this is actually a tight
spot<00:01:35.520> training<00:01:35.880> spots<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.020> really

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
spot training spots so I really

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.780 
spot training spots so I really
recommend<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.799> it'll<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.310> some<00:01:38.490> extra

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
recommend that it'll do some extra

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.170 
recommend that it'll do some extra
damage<00:01:38.970> double<00:01:39.900> tap<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.320> extra<00:01:40.560> perk

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
damage double tap for your extra perk

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.460 
damage double tap for your extra perk
quick<00:01:42.180> revive<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.540> solon<00:01:42.960> juggernauts

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
quick revive on solon juggernauts

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.319 
quick revive on solon juggernauts
and<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:44.189> guess<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> want<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> use<00:01:45.090> anything

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and I guess if you want to use anything

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.670 
and I guess if you want to use anything
else<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.869> ahead<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.590> as

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
else you can go ahead and do that but as

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.139 
else you can go ahead and do that but as
long<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.009> have<00:01:47.159> everything<00:01:47.520> set<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:48.000> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
long as you have everything set up it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.760 
long as you have everything set up it
should<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.360> pretty<00:01:48.630> easy<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.140> train<00:01:49.439> at<00:01:49.619> this

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
should be pretty easy to train at this

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.010 
should be pretty easy to train at this
location<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.579> mean<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> realms<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.479> go<00:01:51.869> by
