00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.430 
with less real estate to fight the boss
on<00:03:15.299> which<00:03:15.569> makes<00:03:15.810> things<00:03:16.049> more<00:03:16.260> difficult

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
on which makes things more difficult

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.530 
on which makes things more difficult
when<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.040> AOE<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.640> stuff<00:03:17.879> comes<00:03:18.090> into<00:03:18.329> play

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
when the AOE and stuff comes into play

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.849 
when the AOE and stuff comes into play
and<00:03:18.780> then<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:18.989> think<00:03:19.290> another<00:03:19.470> thing<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.769> they

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
and then I think another thing that they

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.089 
and then I think another thing that they
mentioned<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.150> simple<00:03:21.450> fact<00:03:21.750> that

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
mentioned just the simple fact that

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.069 
mentioned just the simple fact that
raids<00:03:23.099> our<00:03:23.370> hardcore<00:03:23.760> raids<00:03:24.540> are<00:03:24.720> for<00:03:24.959> the

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
raids our hardcore raids are for the

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.890 
raids our hardcore raids are for the
hardcore<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:25.620> if<00:03:25.680> you're<00:03:25.799> not<00:03:25.950> hardcore<00:03:26.900> GTFO

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
hardcore and if you're not hardcore GTFO

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.080 
hardcore and if you're not hardcore GTFO
is<00:03:28.200> pretty<00:03:28.440> much<00:03:28.620> what<00:03:28.859> they<00:03:29.040> said<00:03:29.340> they've

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
is pretty much what they said they've

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.059 
is pretty much what they said they've
made<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.329> really<00:03:30.630> plainly<00:03:31.200> obvious<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.950> this

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
made it really plainly obvious that this

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.159 
made it really plainly obvious that this
is<00:03:32.250> going<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.669> be<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.819> challenge<00:03:33.150> they<00:03:33.780> are<00:03:33.930> not

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
is going to be a challenge they are not

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.289 
is going to be a challenge they are not
catering<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.340> casual<00:03:35.760> now<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.120> will

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
catering to the casual now there will

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.509 
catering to the casual now there will
still<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.599> content<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:37.500> casual<00:03:37.980> players<00:03:38.250> and

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
still be content for casual players and

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.180 
still be content for casual players and
that<00:03:38.940> will<00:03:39.090> be<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.239> five-man<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.260> think

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
that will be the five-man I think

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.190 
that will be the five-man I think
there's<00:03:41.340> also<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:41.639> regular<00:03:42.060> 20<00:03:42.450> man<00:03:42.660> but<00:03:43.079> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
there's also just regular 20 man but the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.250 
there's also just regular 20 man but the
real<00:03:43.440> high-end<00:03:44.209> best<00:03:45.209> loot<00:03:45.569> and<00:03:45.780> most

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
real high-end best loot and most

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.690 
real high-end best loot and most
difficult<00:03:46.769> stuff<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.190> going<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.489> come<00:03:47.669> from

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
difficult stuff is going to come from

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.349 
difficult stuff is going to come from
the<00:03:48.030> 40<00:03:48.359> man<00:03:48.510> forty<00:03:48.959> man<00:03:49.500> raids<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.549> if<00:03:51.180> you

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
the 40 man forty man raids and if you

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.759

want to do that number one you got to

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.490 
want to do that number one you got to
find<00:03:52.950> 39<00:03:53.459> other<00:03:53.700> competent<00:03:54.269> people<00:03:54.500> number

find 39 other competent people number

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.650 
find 39 other competent people number
two<00:03:55.709> get<00:03:56.579> ready<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.879> get<00:03:57.000> your<00:03:57.060> butt<00:03:57.329> whooped

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
two get ready to get your butt whooped

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.280 
two get ready to get your butt whooped
you<00:03:58.230> know<00:03:58.319> this<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.329> I'm<00:04:00.329> really<00:04:00.540> excited<00:04:00.900> for

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
you know this is I'm really excited for

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.199 
you know this is I'm really excited for
this<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.650> it's<00:04:01.739> all<00:04:02.099> like<00:04:02.250> difficult<00:04:02.459> rating

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
this and it's all like difficult rating

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.670 
this and it's all like difficult rating
content<00:04:03.629> isn't<00:04:03.780> available<00:04:04.139> because<00:04:04.440> there

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
content isn't available because there

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.770 
content isn't available because there
are<00:04:04.829> very<00:04:05.069> levels<00:04:05.639> of<00:04:05.819> difficulty<00:04:06.239> in<00:04:06.540> Wow's

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
are very levels of difficulty in Wow's

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.470 
are very levels of difficulty in Wow's
rating<00:04:07.349> content<00:04:07.829> but<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.280> think<00:04:08.639> just<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.389> fact

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
rating content but I think just the fact

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.259 
rating content but I think just the fact
that<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.410> level<00:04:10.769> 20<00:04:11.220> dungeons<00:04:11.669> that<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.910> have

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
that the level 20 dungeons that I have

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.800 
that the level 20 dungeons that I have
have<00:04:12.840> been<00:04:13.139> so<00:04:13.799> challenging<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.510> point

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
have been so challenging to to the point

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.349 
have been so challenging to to the point
where<00:04:16.019> if<00:04:16.370> every<00:04:17.370> member<00:04:17.699> of<00:04:17.729> your<00:04:17.970> group<00:04:18.120> is

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
where if every member of your group is

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.449 
where if every member of your group is
not<00:04:18.510> paying<00:04:18.780> attention<00:04:18.870> even<00:04:19.560> on<00:04:19.680> trash<00:04:20.070> packs

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
not paying attention even on trash packs

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.330 
not paying attention even on trash packs
you<00:04:21.060> can<00:04:21.389> and<00:04:21.720> you<00:04:21.750> will<00:04:22.049> wipe<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.950> game

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
you can and you will wipe the game

has<00:04:44.039> been<00:04:44.219> fantastic<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.939> I'm<00:04:45.330> just<00:04:45.569> talking

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
has been fantastic and I'm just talking

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.140 
has been fantastic and I'm just talking
at<00:04:46.050> level<00:04:46.349> 20<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:47.159> is<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.520> i<00:04:47.550> have<00:04:47.819> not<00:04:48.029> even

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
at level 20 that is it i have not even

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.059 
at level 20 that is it i have not even
experienced<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.960> first<00:04:49.229> rate<00:04:49.499> in<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:49.800> game

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
experienced the first rate in this game

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.610 
experienced the first rate in this game
I'm<00:04:50.580> excited<00:04:51.029> it's<00:04:51.689> going<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:51.960> be<00:04:52.080> challenging

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
I'm excited it's going to be challenging

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.730 
I'm excited it's going to be challenging
and<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:53.159> also<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.460> lot<00:04:53.669> of<00:04:53.819> fun<00:04:53.969> the<00:04:54.659> the<00:04:55.259> PvE

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
and it's also a lot of fun the the PvE

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.080 
and it's also a lot of fun the the PvE
