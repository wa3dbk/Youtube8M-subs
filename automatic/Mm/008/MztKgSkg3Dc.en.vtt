00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
volume up here we go weather and climate

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.170 
volume up here we go weather and climate
part<00:00:29.310> two<00:00:30.199> you're<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.349> me<00:00:32.630> good<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.870> got

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
part two you're with me good it's got

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.850 
part two you're with me good it's got
here<00:00:36.210> now<00:00:36.660> we're<00:00:36.870> getting<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.170> two<00:00:37.320> fronts<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
here now we're getting on two fronts and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.729 
here now we're getting on two fronts and
how<00:00:38.399> they<00:00:38.579> relate<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.510> weather<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:40.620> we

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
how they relate to the weather here we

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.330 
how they relate to the weather here we
have<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> warm<00:00:41.879> front<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:43.110> cold<00:00:43.350> front<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.219> we

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
have a warm front and a cold front so we

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
have a warm front and a cold front so we
have<00:00:45.110> we<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.289> our<00:00:46.469> cooler<00:00:46.890> air<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:48.200> moving

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
have we have our cooler air here moving

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.830 
have we have our cooler air here moving
into<00:00:49.559> warmer<00:00:50.160> air<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:53.390> we<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.510> cooler

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
into warmer air here and we have cooler

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.619 
into warmer air here and we have cooler
air<00:00:55.489> here<00:00:56.489> don't<00:00:56.879> forget<00:00:57.120> they're<00:00:57.329> moving

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
air here don't forget they're moving

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.330 
air here don't forget they're moving
around<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.989> low-pressure<00:00:58.340> counterclockwise

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
around a low-pressure counterclockwise

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.760 
around a low-pressure counterclockwise
and<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.780> kind<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.140> an<00:01:01.260> air<00:01:01.410> moving

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and in so we kind of have an air moving

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.250 
and in so we kind of have an air moving
this<00:01:02.039> way<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.300> moving<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.870> way<00:01:03.930> this

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
this way so this is moving this way this

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.200 
this way so this is moving this way this
is<00:01:04.350> moving<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.769> way<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
is moving this way and really the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.789 
is moving this way and really the
Front's<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.810> where<00:01:07.049> you're<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> have

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
Front's is where you're going to have

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.520 
Front's is where you're going to have
kind<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:09.030> textbook<00:01:09.810> example<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.350> your

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
kind of a textbook example of your

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.310 
kind of a textbook example of your
weather<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.460> rain<00:01:12.320> precipitation

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
weather and this rain precipitation

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.880 
weather and this rain precipitation
clouds<00:01:13.619> snow<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:15.439> what<00:01:16.439> will<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.619> look<00:01:16.740> like

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
clouds snow so what will it look like

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.219 
clouds snow so what will it look like
cloud<00:01:17.400> cover<00:01:18.409> they'll<00:01:19.409> look<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:21.229> okay

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
cloud cover they'll look like this okay

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.859 
cloud cover they'll look like this okay
this<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:23.060> generally<00:01:24.060> how<00:01:24.540> you're<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
this is generally how you're going to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.690 
this is generally how you're going to
find<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> narrow<00:01:26.040> band<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.490> clouds

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
find kind of a narrow band of clouds

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.359 
find kind of a narrow band of clouds
here<00:01:26.939> probably<00:01:27.330> heavy<00:01:27.840> precipitation<00:01:28.369> wider

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
here probably heavy precipitation wider

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.149 
here probably heavy precipitation wider
band<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.150> front<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.659> precipitation<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.950> as

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
band in front of it precipitation not as

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.280 
band in front of it precipitation not as
heavy<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.180> last<00:01:33.329> longer<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.990> this

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
heavy but it will last longer and this

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.980 
heavy but it will last longer and this
whole<00:01:34.530> general<00:01:34.979> system<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.520> move<00:01:35.670> off<00:01:36.000> this

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
whole general system will move off this

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.690 
whole general system will move off this
way<00:01:37.259> pushed<00:01:37.650> by<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> planetary<00:01:38.610> winds<00:01:40.700> you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
way pushed by the planetary winds you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.020 
way pushed by the planetary winds you
with<00:01:41.880> me<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.750> lot<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.939> let's<00:01:44.939> keep

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
with me is that a lot for you let's keep

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.920 
with me is that a lot for you let's keep
going

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
going

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.010 
going
here<00:01:48.070> what<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.100> have<00:01:49.399> is<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:50.060> windward<00:01:50.719> side

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
here what you have is the windward side

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.389 
here what you have is the windward side
of<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.380> mountain<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.070> leeward<00:01:52.369> side

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
of the mountain and the leeward side

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.730 
of the mountain and the leeward side
wind<00:01:52.850> coming<00:01:53.210> this<00:01:53.329> way<00:01:53.509> when<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.229> wind<00:01:54.500> hits

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
wind coming this way when the wind hits

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.160 
wind coming this way when the wind hits
the<00:01:55.490> mountain<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.909> has<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.180> rise<00:01:56.420> up<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:56.810> goes

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
the mountain it has to rise up and goes

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.529 
the mountain it has to rise up and goes
over<00:01:57.439> as<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:58.130> rises<00:01:58.369> what<00:01:59.149> happens<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.509> a

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
over as it rises what happens to a

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.429 
over as it rises what happens to a
temperature<00:02:00.640> very<00:02:01.640> good<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.060> cools<00:02:02.360> cold<00:02:03.229> air

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
temperature very good it cools cold air

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.830 
temperature very good it cools cold air
can<00:02:03.649> hold<00:02:03.679> less<00:02:04.189> moisture<00:02:04.670> than<00:02:04.700> warm<00:02:05.119> air<00:02:05.299> so

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
can hold less moisture than warm air so

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.749 
can hold less moisture than warm air so
it<00:02:06.079> will<00:02:06.200> cool<00:02:06.439> and<00:02:06.770> cool<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.159> cool<00:02:07.340> until<00:02:07.640> it

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
it will cool and cool and cool until it

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.460 
it will cool and cool and cool until it
reaches<00:02:08.000> its<00:02:08.030> dew<00:02:08.479> point<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.349> the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
reaches its dew point that is the

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.220

that's<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.519> simple<00:03:40.760> mistake<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:41.090> lot<00:03:41.359> of<00:03:41.420> people

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
that's a simple mistake a lot of people

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.500 
that's a simple mistake a lot of people
do<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:42.650> where<00:03:43.190> am<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.519> on<00:03:43.549> that<00:03:43.970> dry<00:03:44.269> bulb

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
do so where am I on that dry bulb

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.210 
do so where am I on that dry bulb
temperature<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:45.290> 18<00:03:45.889> and<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:47.299> difference<00:03:47.840> of

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
temperature of 18 and the difference of

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.080 
temperature of 18 and the difference of
eight<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:50.090> then<00:03:50.239> I<00:03:50.359> go<00:03:50.480> down<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:50.930> column<00:03:51.230> here

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
eight so then I go down this column here

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.640 
eight so then I go down this column here
this<00:03:53.090> is<00:03:53.269> my<00:03:53.420> column<00:03:53.810> here

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
this is my column here

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.880 
this is my column here
then<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.890> go<00:03:55.010> across<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.579> 18<00:03:56.329> is<00:03:57.290> right<00:03:57.590> here

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
then I go across to the 18 is right here

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:07.530 
then I go across to the 18 is right here
so<00:03:58.519> what<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.480> my<00:03:59.930> relative<00:04:00.319> humidity<00:04:05.230> it's<00:04:06.230> 33

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
so what is my relative humidity it's 33

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.610 
so what is my relative humidity it's 33
percent<00:04:08.540> okay

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
percent okay

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.710 
percent okay
the<00:04:09.920> key<00:04:10.129> that<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:10.489> is<00:04:10.610> different<00:04:10.819> a<00:04:11.209> lot<00:04:11.599> of

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
the key that this is different a lot of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.300 
the key that this is different a lot of
kids<00:04:11.900> would<00:04:12.079> look<00:04:12.200> 18<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.829> 10<00:04:12.980> look<00:04:13.159> at<00:04:13.220> the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
kids would look 18 and 10 look at the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.770 
kids would look 18 and 10 look at the
two<00:04:13.430> numbers<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.939> then<00:04:14.329> we'll<00:04:14.420> get<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:14.599> wrong

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
two numbers and then we'll get it wrong

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.170 
two numbers and then we'll get it wrong
it's<00:04:15.739> difference<00:04:16.870> don't<00:04:17.870> forget<00:04:18.139> that<00:04:19.180> here

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
it's difference don't forget that here

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.170 
it's difference don't forget that here
we<00:04:20.359> go<00:04:20.539> here<00:04:21.019> we<00:04:21.229> have<00:04:21.530> a<00:04:21.829> station<00:04:22.430> model<00:04:22.580> air

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180

mixed<00:04:43.729> up<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.150> best<00:04:44.300> thing<00:04:44.479> to<00:04:44.510> do<00:04:44.690> is<00:04:45.320> to

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
mixed up so the best thing to do is to

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.200 
mixed up so the best thing to do is to
go<00:04:46.039> to<00:04:46.130> this<00:04:46.280> in<00:04:46.400> your<00:04:46.490> average<00:04:46.610> table<00:04:47.030> there

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
go to this in your average table there

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.870 
go to this in your average table there
is<00:04:47.240> an<00:04:47.419> example<00:04:47.750> there<00:04:48.080> this<00:04:49.010> one<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:49.370> less

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
is an example there this one is less

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.629 
is an example there this one is less
than<00:04:50.150> 500<00:04:50.810> see<00:04:50.930> all<00:04:51.080> less<00:04:51.349> than<00:04:51.500> 500<00:04:52.099> they

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
than 500 see all less than 500 they

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.060 
than 500 see all less than 500 they
added<00:04:52.910> 10<00:04:53.210> ok<00:04:53.780> cool<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:54.259> there<00:04:54.740> must<00:04:54.830> be<00:04:54.979> the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
added 10 ok cool so there must be the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.089 
added 10 ok cool so there must be the
other<00:04:55.190> more<00:04:55.580> than<00:04:55.820> 500<00:04:56.389> must<00:04:56.570> add<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:56.750> nine<00:04:57.099> do

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
other more than 500 must add a nine do

00:04:58.099 --> 00:04:59.920 
other more than 500 must add a nine do
it<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.400> way<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.789> you're<00:04:59.150> kind<00:04:59.389> of<00:04:59.449> really

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
it that way and you're kind of really

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.060 
it that way and you're kind of really
help<00:05:00.199> you<00:05:00.289> get<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:00.500> right<00:05:00.680> so<00:05:02.169> so<00:05:03.169> where<00:05:03.800> were

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
help you get it right so so where were

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.920 
help you get it right so so where were
we<00:05:04.099> here<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:04.610> our<00:05:04.699> air<00:05:04.849> pressure<00:05:05.000> I'm<00:05:05.449> going<00:05:05.870> to

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
we here so our air pressure I'm going to

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.230 
we here so our air pressure I'm going to
add<00:05:06.110> a<00:05:07.240> 10<00:05:08.240> in<00:05:08.419> front<00:05:08.539> of<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:08.900> two<00:05:09.199> three

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
add a 10 in front of that two three

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.930 
add a 10 in front of that two three
seven<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.389> a<00:05:11.900> decimal<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:12.680> that's<00:05:13.400> millibars

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
seven and a decimal and that's millibars

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.100 
seven and a decimal and that's millibars
and<00:05:14.240> then<00:05:15.110> my<00:05:15.260> wind<00:05:15.530> speed<00:05:16.360> is<00:05:17.360> going<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:17.930> be

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
and then my wind speed is going to be

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.680 
and then my wind speed is going to be
and<00:05:18.380> if<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:18.530> use<00:05:18.740> this<00:05:18.949> again<00:05:19.340> winds<00:05:19.909> be<00:05:20.090> a<00:05:20.330> long

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
and if I use this again winds be a long

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.170 
and if I use this again winds be a long
ones<00:05:20.930> ten<00:05:21.229> short<00:05:21.680> ones<00:05:21.919> five<00:05:22.130> my<00:05:22.789> wind<00:05:22.970> speed

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
ones ten short ones five my wind speed

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.810 
ones ten short ones five my wind speed
here<00:05:23.419> is<00:05:23.539> a<00:05:23.570> two<00:05:24.080> long<00:05:24.260> 25<00:05:25.039> knots<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:28.639> wind

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
here is a two long 25 knots and the wind

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.260 
here is a two long 25 knots and the wind
direction<00:05:28.940> again<00:05:30.520> I'm<00:05:31.520> going<00:05:31.760> to<00:05:31.820> use<00:05:32.030> this

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
direction again I'm going to use this

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.930 
direction again I'm going to use this
one<00:05:32.840> direction<00:05:32.990> from<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.949> southwest<00:05:34.490> it<00:05:34.760> goes

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
one direction from the southwest it goes

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.909 
one direction from the southwest it goes
this<00:05:35.180> way<00:05:35.240> towards<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:35.780> center<00:05:36.050> use<00:05:36.409> that<00:05:36.740> as

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
this way towards the center use that as

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.330 
this way towards the center use that as
it<00:05:37.099> got<00:05:37.250> as<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.460> guide<00:05:38.229> use<00:05:39.229> the<00:05:39.770> stuff<00:05:40.039> that

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
it got as a guide use the stuff that

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.939

so where was i wind direction from

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.800 
so where was i wind direction from
hopefully<00:05:55.040> you<00:05:55.130> can<00:05:55.220> see<00:05:55.370> that<00:05:55.550> from<00:05:55.850> the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
hopefully you can see that from the

the<00:06:07.280> question<00:06:07.639> would<00:06:07.790> be<00:06:07.820> this<00:06:08.060> which<00:06:08.449> one<00:06:08.960> is

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
the question would be this which one is

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.700 
the question would be this which one is
more<00:06:09.650> likely<00:06:10.040> to<00:06:10.639> have<00:06:10.910> rain<00:06:11.630> in<00:06:11.660> the<00:06:12.020> next<00:06:12.440> few

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
more likely to have rain in the next few

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.310 
more likely to have rain in the next few
hours<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:13.430> the<00:06:13.880> answer<00:06:14.270> based<00:06:15.139> on

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
hours and the answer based on

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.189 
hours and the answer based on
temperature<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:15.889> dewpoint<00:06:16.010> is<00:06:16.520> Utica<00:06:17.510> it's

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
temperature and dewpoint is Utica it's

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.800 
temperature and dewpoint is Utica it's
you<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:18.590> go<00:06:18.710> why<00:06:19.070> the<00:06:19.610> air<00:06:19.880> temperature<00:06:20.389> 60

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
you to go why the air temperature 60

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.040 
you to go why the air temperature 60
degrees<00:06:20.840> Fahrenheit<00:06:21.590> the<00:06:21.860> dew<00:06:22.040> point<00:06:22.310> is<00:06:22.400> 58

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
degrees Fahrenheit the dew point is 58

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.360 
degrees Fahrenheit the dew point is 58
again<00:06:24.050> a<00:06:24.080> dew<00:06:24.260> point<00:06:24.560> is<00:06:24.650> the<00:06:24.680> temperature<00:06:24.800> at

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
again a dew point is the temperature at

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.760 
again a dew point is the temperature at
which<00:06:25.550> CL<00:06:25.790> becomes<00:06:26.389> 100%<00:06:27.080> saturated<00:06:27.620> with

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
which CL becomes 100% saturated with

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.350 
which CL becomes 100% saturated with
moisture<00:06:27.919> and<00:06:28.400> then<00:06:28.850> you<00:06:28.940> get<00:06:29.060> and<00:06:29.210> then<00:06:29.330> you

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
moisture and then you get and then you

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.260 
moisture and then you get and then you
get<00:06:29.540> clouds<00:06:29.780> and<00:06:29.990> rain<00:06:30.169> so<00:06:31.000> only<00:06:32.000> has<00:06:32.090> to<00:06:32.180> go

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
get clouds and rain so only has to go

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.420 
get clouds and rain so only has to go
down<00:06:32.450> to<00:06:32.690> degrees<00:06:33.080> which<00:06:34.010> is<00:06:34.130> not<00:06:34.250> that<00:06:34.370> much

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
down to degrees which is not that much

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.140 
down to degrees which is not that much
this<00:06:35.000> 15<00:06:35.630> degree<00:06:35.900> difference<00:06:36.320> and<00:06:36.880> this<00:06:37.880> you

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
this 15 degree difference and this you

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.300 
this 15 degree difference and this you
have<00:06:39.250> 117<00:06:40.250> degree<00:06:40.520> difference<00:06:40.910> okay<00:06:41.630> so<00:06:42.310> you'd

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
have 117 degree difference okay so you'd

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.000 
have 117 degree difference okay so you'd
get<00:06:43.550> more<00:06:43.729> likely<00:06:44.000> to<00:06:44.090> have<00:06:44.210> rain<00:06:44.450> and<00:06:47.860> we<00:06:48.860> did

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
get more likely to have rain and we did

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.480 
get more likely to have rain and we did
that<00:06:49.160> already

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
that already

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.230 
that already
and<00:06:49.639> again<00:06:49.789> it's<00:06:49.940> you<00:06:50.000> to<00:06:50.120> go

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.510 

and<00:06:53.810> this<00:06:53.990> very<00:06:54.169> pressure<00:06:54.470> you<00:06:54.800> go<00:06:55.039> well<00:06:55.340> let's

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
and this very pressure you go well let's

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.640 
and this very pressure you go well let's
go<00:06:55.639> back<00:06:55.789> to<00:06:55.910> this<00:06:56.030> let<00:06:56.180> me<00:06:56.240> I<00:06:56.479> have<00:06:57.169> this<00:06:57.320> again

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
go back to this let me I have this again

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.969 
go back to this let me I have this again
I<00:06:57.860> use<00:06:58.250> this<00:06:58.490> this<00:06:59.419> is<00:06:59.570> less<00:06:59.780> than<00:06:59.810> 500<00:07:00.470> they

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
I use this this is less than 500 they

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.640 
I use this this is less than 500 they
added<00:07:01.220> a<00:07:01.280> 10<00:07:01.520> this<00:07:02.300> is<00:07:02.449> more<00:07:02.780> than<00:07:02.930> 500<00:07:03.169> so<00:07:03.620> I

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
added a 10 this is more than 500 so I

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.999 
added a 10 this is more than 500 so I
have<00:07:03.860> to<00:07:03.979> add<00:07:04.130> up<00:07:06.220> very<00:07:07.220> good<00:07:07.430> at<00:07:07.580> 9<00:07:08.710> 9<00:07:09.710> very

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:10.009 
have to add up very good at 9 9 very

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:24.279 
have to add up very good at 9 9 very
good<00:07:10.449> so<00:07:11.449> that<00:07:11.690> is<00:07:13.300> C<00:07:15.370> 9<00:07:16.449> 9<00:07:17.449> 9<00:07:18.380> 8<00:07:23.139> millibars<00:07:24.139> make

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:24.289 
good so that is C 9 9 9 8 millibars make

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:25.210 
good so that is C 9 9 9 8 millibars make
sure<00:07:24.350> you<00:07:24.410> have<00:07:24.500> the<00:07:24.560> decimal<00:07:24.740> in<00:07:25.039> there

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.220 
sure you have the decimal in there

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.749 
sure you have the decimal in there
that's<00:07:26.000> a<00:07:26.120> decimal<00:07:26.419> looks<00:07:26.599> crazy<00:07:27.669> you're<00:07:28.669> with

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 
that's a decimal looks crazy you're with

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:32.990 
that's a decimal looks crazy you're with
me

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.230
