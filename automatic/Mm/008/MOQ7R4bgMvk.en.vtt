can't do that so I'm debating on if i
should<00:02:22.100> retwist<00:02:22.670> it's<00:02:22.970> been<00:02:23.180> three<00:02:23.420> weeks

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
should retwist it's been three weeks

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.230 
should retwist it's been three weeks
like<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.900> said<00:02:24.640> should<00:02:25.640> all<00:02:25.760> go<00:02:25.910> ahead<00:02:26.030> with

like I said should all go ahead with

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.970 
like I said should all go ahead with
four<00:02:26.540> weeks<00:02:26.840> I've<00:02:27.080> never<00:02:27.260> done<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.500> before<00:02:27.740> I

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980
