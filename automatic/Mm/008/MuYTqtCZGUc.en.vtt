00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:11.230
 magic rooster and if the little animals with the 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.290
 calendar that we have been giving you if 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.199
 this is a chicken cheese of the cardinals 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.700
 have three months with three weeks going to 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.010
 meet four months 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.250
 all the animals are in the same 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.890
 conditions and completely healthy have 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.370
 body developments appropriate to your 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.550
 genetics no more developments or less yes 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.220
 and take into account that this type of 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.260
 calendars that we are sending you that 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.140
 it's just for the places where 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.270
 nor is there microfauna all 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.480
 nutrients that the animals are 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.010
 they need when they 're free if they 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.960
 that I recommended to them what they have been 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.720
 saying that many leave the wives 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.270
 in charge of the chicks then 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.579
 they want a calendar that fits 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.430
 those needs not good first thing 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.550
 let's start the first day of age 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.670
 vitamins is a powder that by throwing 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.680
 water in 5 minutes a gel is made a gel 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.260
 rich in semi with beneficial organisms 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.990
 to help develop and that 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.690
 they expose 100 all the genetic potential 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.460
 that the animals have that's what 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.610
 I was looking with the entrance to this what 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.100
 let's give 7 grams for 100 animals 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.260

 eat that the boy is not going to give them 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.370
 Starter food is important for 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.400
 that this day the intestinal flora is 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.020
 completely colonized with 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.180
 beneficial microorganisms instead of 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.700
 pathogens later that's going to 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.940
 give twice a week only one 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.940
 little bit if now here we will continue 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.920
 depending if in the area where we are 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.830
 we have colds problems we are going to 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.660
 insert the biotech if from the

 biotech one gram per liter of water of 5 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.860
 to 7 days 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.910
 but if we do not have colds if we go to 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.910
 give sulfa tec 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.440
 This product is very good for 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.170
 problems with plugs spilled diarrheas 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.220
 white that very high mortality that occurs 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.840
 between 5 and 21 days old and 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.780
 that many chicks die 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.780
 Exhausts the part of 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.240
 down the belly if then sulfate 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.100

 they work excellent one gram for 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.730
 liter of water a very cheap product if 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.980
 the 100 grams are worth 60 pesos 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.010
 currently and for platinum partner a lot 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.190
 cheaper if this simple product is 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.130
 low body temperature to 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.840
 animals take away the heat stress 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.240
 it helps them a lot is not recommended 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.470
 gram per liter of water can be given 20 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.660
 to 30 continuous days without any type of 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.010
 problem if we also recommend the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.250
 twin for chickens and chicks 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:02.240
 Give them the swing they can give you 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.700
 5 milliliters per liter of water 5 days 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.370
 when you go to vaccinate when 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.620
 Note of fallen in the reception can 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.020
 use five or ten milliliters until 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.540
 20 milliliters to receive them is a 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.690
 very important source of calories 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.900
 the multivitamin vl is another product 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.580
 that can help them is a complex of

 many vitamins that can be used in 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.960
 all animals and in breeding what 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.360
 Can be used together with the twin for 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.720

 a compilation we start I'll stop 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.430
 respiratory problems cooking is 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.120
 both against orange and red diarrhea 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:51.300
 if the brown diarrhea is the problem the 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.539
 whitish diarrhea fetid plugs 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.740
 your abdomen bruised all the problems 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:00.330
 digestive with sulfate 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.240
 multivitamin yes and already subsequently 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.030
 to close the cycle the probiotics with 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.680
 minerals who can put you from 2 to 5 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.139
 grams per kilo of food from 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.319
 3 months for a complete development 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:16.319
 do not forget to deworm we have the 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:20.220
 desparasite x what all the 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:22.470
 range of parasites milliliter per liter 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.039
 of water we recommend it monthly 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.379
 so that they have a correct development 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.050
 of the animals they were told by some people 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:32.639
 hear but if the children are not 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.710
 worming each month because they are 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.930
 yes, but the children are not 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.219
 eat on the land that is the problem in 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.110
 the projects here we have it in the 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.090
 earth then we will 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.349
 we recommend every month here are the 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.409
 results 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.150
 if this chick my whole flock like the 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.780
 as I have been showing them is 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.729
 same if two thousand animals on average 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.039
 of the same age 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.319
 the same bodily developments the 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.490
 same health there we also wait for you 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.430
 on the facebook where we are 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.979
 sharing pictures and the whole range 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:08.719
 silence pass friend in the chick that 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.719
 this animal is one month old 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.280
 and well in the development that already brings 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.980
 the complete well round the body 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.540
 completely healthy without catarrh or anything and 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.000
 carries the same program 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.490
 if we wait for you on facebook 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.580
 magic rooster dealer prayer 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.530
 liquidambar 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.599
 and any doubt and we are for 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:35.030
 attend them in the mail also I killed 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:35.030
 to 2005 at yahoo.com.mx 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.889
 more seriously
