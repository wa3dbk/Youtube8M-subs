00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.510
 here we defend ourselves from hitting the stick 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.510
 at the side 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.490
 the unit is put outdoor followed 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.590
 capture 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.140
 counterstrike and tap armed hands 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.760
 down to then select the shelf principle 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.279
 actions are the same as in previous 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.460
 receptions the main thing is to do everything together and without 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.460
 delays 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.390
 pay attention as always cleaned 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.250
 front foot at the time of disarming 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.629
 this is done to avoid the possible 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.090
 hitting a stick at the time of lowering 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.040
 in addition to the armed hand of the enemy 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.290
 you are moving away the enemy who can 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.210
 hit you or grab and finally from 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.230
 stepping in on your own will be easier 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.230
 finishing stick 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.550
 here we counterattack with the short end 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.590
 stick is a very strong painful blow 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.780
 holding a stick back or direct grip 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.850
 always leave space at this end 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.190
 stick first it can come in handy 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.080
 to counterattack at close range in the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.510
 second less likely to stick at 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.340
 bump or slips slip out wet 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.050
 from sweat palms in third you always 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.440
 You can take an additional second 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.510
 by hand 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.790
 to make the blow stronger especially if 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.710
 the stick is heavy and finally with such a crack 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.990
 more difficult to put blocks and counterattack 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.440
 you will notice this when working with 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.440
 partner 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.840
 now stab backhand 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.180
 if you don't succeed in getting close on 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.550
 bounce back and back and after 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.450
 strike immediately get close to the enemy 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.450
 making a block from hitting from inside
