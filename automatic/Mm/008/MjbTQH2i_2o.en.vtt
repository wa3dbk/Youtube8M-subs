million dollars for the children of
africa<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.450> i<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.560> event<00:02:04.950> went<00:02:05.189> we're

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
africa and i think the event went we're

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.249 
africa and i think the event went we're
very<00:02:05.820> well<00:02:06.000> i<00:02:06.030> don't<00:02:06.270> know<00:02:06.299> exactly<00:02:06.780> how<00:02:07.020> much

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
very well i don't know exactly how much

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.609 
very well i don't know exactly how much
was<00:02:07.920> brought<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.369> during<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:09.720> live<00:02:09.929> event<00:02:10.349> but

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
was brought in during the live event but

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.630 
was brought in during the live event but
I

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
I

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.800 
I
it<00:02:12.640> seems<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.390> might<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.660> been<00:02:13.750> a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
it seems like it might have been a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.530 
it seems like it might have been a
substantial<00:02:14.290> amount<00:02:14.710> as<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:15.850> see<00:02:16.030> here

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
substantial amount as you can see here

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.360 
substantial amount as you can see here
the<00:02:18.330> charity<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.420> almost<00:02:20.070> 400,000<00:02:21.070> out<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
the charity is almost 400,000 out of the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.170 
the charity is almost 400,000 out of the
1,000,000<00:02:21.700> goal<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.450> that's<00:02:22.750> quite<00:02:23.380> good<00:02:24.180> but

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
1,000,000 goal so that's quite good but

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.680 
1,000,000 goal so that's quite good but
yeah<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.800> event<00:02:27.040> went<00:02:27.160> really<00:02:27.520> well

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
yeah this the event went really well

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.100 
yeah this the event went really well
both<00:02:28.690> guilds<00:02:29.200> were<00:02:29.410> very<00:02:29.860> professional<00:02:31.110> we

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
both guilds were very professional we

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.620 
both guilds were very professional we
both<00:02:32.290> had<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> different<00:02:32.830> approach<00:02:33.630> method

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
both had a different approach method

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
both had a different approach method
they<00:02:35.470> went<00:02:35.740> with<00:02:35.920> their<00:02:37.170> normal<00:02:38.170> strategies

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
they went with their normal strategies

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.180 
they went with their normal strategies
normal<00:02:39.220> setup<00:02:39.490> they<00:02:40.110> ran<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.140> straight<00:02:41.710> comp

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
normal setup they ran a straight comp

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.330 
normal setup they ran a straight comp
the<00:02:42.460> whole<00:02:42.700> way<00:02:43.090> no<00:02:43.390> swap<00:02:43.690> six<00:02:44.080> yield<00:02:44.350> vodkas

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
the whole way no swap six yield vodkas

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.770 
the whole way no swap six yield vodkas
took<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.580> different<00:02:45.700> approach<00:02:45.880> where<00:02:46.360> we<00:02:46.540> were

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
took a different approach where we were

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.750 
took a different approach where we were
making<00:02:47.680> raid<00:02:47.890> swaps<00:02:48.280> /<00:02:48.910> boss<00:02:50.280> under<00:02:51.280> healing

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
making raid swaps / boss under healing

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.520 
making raid swaps / boss under healing
where<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.060> could<00:02:52.360> I<00:02:52.920> think<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:55.150> end<00:02:55.530> you

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
where we could I think in the end you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.560 
where we could I think in the end you
know<00:02:56.560> both<00:02:56.920> guilds<00:02:57.630> methods<00:02:58.630> was<00:02:59.050> of<00:02:59.890> course

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
know both guilds methods was of course

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.450 
know both guilds methods was of course
probably<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.900> safer<00:03:02.380> choice<00:03:02.410> well<00:03:03.100> obviously

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
probably the safer choice well obviously

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.660 
probably the safer choice well obviously
and<00:03:03.940> then<00:03:03.970> vodkas<00:03:04.960> was<00:03:05.140> riskier<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:06.190> did<00:03:06.490> bite

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
and then vodkas was riskier it did bite

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.900 
and then vodkas was riskier it did bite
us<00:03:06.820> in<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:06.970> ass<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:08.020> also<00:03:08.230> made<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:08.910> event

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
us in the ass but it also made the event

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.930 
us in the ass but it also made the event
in<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.360> end<00:03:10.540> where<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:11.020> could<00:03:11.170> watch<00:03:11.380> our<00:03:11.940> you

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
in the end where you could watch our you

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.180 
in the end where you could watch our you
know<00:03:12.970> strategic<00:03:13.600> play<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.930> run<00:03:14.350> this<00:03:14.530> high<00:03:14.740> dps

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
know strategic play to run this high dps

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.780 
know strategic play to run this high dps
as<00:03:15.400> we<00:03:16.090> caught<00:03:16.390> up<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.930> them<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.760> ended<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
as we caught up to them and ended the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.590 
as we caught up to them and ended the
race<00:03:19.060> with<00:03:19.890> one<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.040> most<00:03:21.220> epic<00:03:21.600> PvE

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600

my<00:04:17.799> POV<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.520> mean<00:04:19.000> just<00:04:19.150> overall<00:04:19.600> there<00:04:20.080> was<00:04:20.200> a

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
my POV I mean just overall there was a

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.200 
my POV I mean just overall there was a
massive<00:04:20.560> amount<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.370> people<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:21.729> just<00:04:21.970> came

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
massive amount of people that just came

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.070 
massive amount of people that just came
to

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
to

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.649 
to
to<00:04:23.259> see<00:04:23.439> how<00:04:23.620> this<00:04:23.770> went<00:04:23.919> down<00:04:24.069> and<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.939> think

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
to see how this went down and I think

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.020 
to see how this went down and I think
that<00:04:26.349> in<00:04:26.949> the<00:04:27.069> future<00:04:27.220> you<00:04:27.550> know<00:04:27.639> there<00:04:27.879> could

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
that in the future you know there could

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.969 
that in the future you know there could
be<00:04:28.090> room<00:04:28.810> for<00:04:28.840> more<00:04:29.229> events<00:04:29.439> like<00:04:29.710> this

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
be room for more events like this

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.219 
be room for more events like this
because<00:04:30.189> like<00:04:30.909> i<00:04:31.000> was<00:04:31.120> saying<00:04:31.270> PvE<00:04:31.629> gets<00:04:31.900> stale

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229
