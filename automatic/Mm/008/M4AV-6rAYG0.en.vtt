00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello everyone in today's video, I tell you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.629
 I'll tell you what I'm doing then when I have 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.179
 no time to pack and look right 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.969
 well for example we rush to work on 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.950
 I just wanted to study in the evening and 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.760
 go out with friends in a cafe and hair is not 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.039
 laid or there are such days when 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.750
 hair just look in different directions and 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.880
 somehow you have to fight it you know 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.760
 I'm not a fan of any super 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.910
 straight complicated styling for every day 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.430
 It is precisely for this reason that I have found for myself 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.200
 the solution is when the hairs here street should 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.320
 look beautiful then the rest 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.790
 hairstyle will look neat and so 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.950
 what do i need first 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.739
 to make styling literally 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.899
 for a couple of minutes firstly it iron them on 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.559
 using ironing and making out curls 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.280
 the outside 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.480
 further need a comb of course and 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.969
 some styling products i 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.879
 for example, I use a silhouette from schwarzkopf 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.680
 called this care and styling two in 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.050
 this one I like him because he 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.960
 does not overdry hair and possess very 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.299
 so lightly styling effect and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.540
 I will need some crab for 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.510
 that the rest of the hair does not interfere but 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.119
 intestines expose temperature for curls 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.150
 I usually use about a hundred and ninety 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.490
 200 degrees because hair is heavy and 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.380
 glasses a stranger heats up show you when 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.630
 help what ironing will do this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.500
 laying last time it was them and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.189
 I use 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.890
 this attiva is a new line from home 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.920
 professional comb carefully 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.579
 hair so that they grow well annas 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.659
 and then I separate 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:45.890
 The part of the hair I need will probably begin with 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:51.060
 of this side and here I take somewhere such 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.880
 the part can even be long left 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.740
 have your hair well decorated 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:03.149
 it is the face and everything else is fixed 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:07.380
 With the help of the crab I will highlight the first 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.800
 my strand is quite small and what am I 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.160
 do i just turn over and and here 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:21.190
 in this way 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.190
 and now very carefully am dropping down 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.930
 now it's the same i repeat on 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.610
 the second side 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.810
 I also highlight something like this 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.810
 number of strands 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.569
 now I loose my hair and it turned out 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.819
 such curls street 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.940
 you can basically add it here 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.890
 for example , the first ones are these strands, but I 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.580
 sometimes sometimes add them let 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.769
 show you more tell you how i am doing 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.069
 curl generally exists a lot 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.230
 different ways how to curl hair when 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.590
 ironing help but for my hair this one 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.129
 method has proved the most effective 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.540
 I have to clamp my hair like that first 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:29.590
 then turned the iron 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.810
 like this, I put the strand down and start 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.629
 I can scroll a little bit 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:41.680
 scroll like the iron itself so I can and 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:44.140
 just scroll your hair like this 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.940
 everything is very fast very simple and for 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.319
 long hair seems to me the most 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.519
 the best way to wind the hair 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.450
 if you're interested, I can show you 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.480
 still 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.739
 other ways how to wind your hair 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.220
 same thing you can do it from 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:09.419
 faces that is to take strands and you can face 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.130
 curling just scrolling a little bit 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.930
 iron 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.269
 that's all that's left for me 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.669
 just comb and curls so they 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.590
 very good so 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.720
 fit did not clog the street when 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.210
 this was not the effect 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.229
 too twisted such twisted 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.330
 hair 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.370
 if it is more evening version of styling 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.770
 then you can add bulk when 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.710
 relief can also be sprinkled 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.930
 curl them a lesson so that they hold out 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.000
 as long as possible ie 92 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.950
 Here is the option that I showed you 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.080
 perfect for every day and for 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.090
 work and for study 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.430
 that is, there is no pretense at the same time 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.800
 hair pretty nicely laid very 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.300
 everything looks neat and I hope
