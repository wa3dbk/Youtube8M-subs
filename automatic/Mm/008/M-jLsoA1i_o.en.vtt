we're in the mort's house in the hague
and<00:00:06.720> we're<00:00:06.960> looking<00:00:07.230> at<00:00:07.440> probably<00:00:08.099> their<00:00:08.340> most

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
and we're looking at probably their most

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.549 
and we're looking at probably their most
famous<00:00:09.059> painting<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.780> from<00:00:10.080> years<00:00:10.290> grow

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
with the Pearl Earring well I would say

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.270 
with the Pearl Earring well I would say
not<00:00:12.719> just<00:00:12.990> their<00:00:13.259> most<00:00:13.500> well-known<00:00:13.769> painting

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
not just their most well-known painting

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.709 
not just their most well-known painting
but<00:00:14.519> maybe<00:00:14.910> one<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.330> most<00:00:15.450> well<00:00:15.690> known

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
but maybe one of the most well known

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.859 
but maybe one of the most well known
paintings<00:00:16.430> generally<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:17.789> only<00:00:18.060> recently

true it's a painting that really seems

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
true it's a painting that really seems
to<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.449> ascended<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> late<00:00:22.529> 20th

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
to have ascended in the late 20th

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
to have ascended in the late 20th
century<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.670> interesting<00:00:23.939> how<00:00:24.180> our

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
century and it's interesting how our

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.470 
century and it's interesting how our
society<00:00:25.140> picks<00:00:25.769> out<00:00:26.039> certain<00:00:26.430> paintings<00:00:27.029> for

fame and that people really fall in love

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.460 
fame and that people really fall in love
with<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.670> perhaps<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.570> because<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:31.260> was

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
with and perhaps it's because this was

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.350 
with and perhaps it's because this was
the<00:00:31.590> centerpiece<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.309> film<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.940> was<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the centerpiece of a film this was the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.389 
the centerpiece of a film this was the
centerpiece<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.260> novel<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.010> perhaps

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
centerpiece of a novel and perhaps

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.700 
centerpiece of a novel and perhaps
because<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.180> know<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.630> little<00:00:36.660> about<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
because we know so little about the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.470 
because we know so little about the
painting<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.520> interesting<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.210> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
painting and it's interesting that this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.510 
painting and it's interesting that this
is<00:00:39.660> sometimes<00:00:39.899> referred<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:41.040> Dutch

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520

is sometimes referred to as that Dutch
Mona<00:00:41.940> Lisa<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.629> both<00:00:42.870> cases<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.890> bust

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
Mona Lisa in both cases we have bust

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.160 
Mona Lisa in both cases we have bust
length<00:00:44.670> portraits<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.360> women<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.899> rather

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
length portraits of women in rather

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.560 
length portraits of women in rather
indeterminate<00:00:47.039> backgrounds<00:00:47.730> now<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.420> should

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
indeterminate backgrounds now we should

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.720 
indeterminate backgrounds now we should
be<00:00:48.660> careful<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.320> because<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.070> may<00:00:50.430> look

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
be careful here because this may look

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.060 
be careful here because this may look
like<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.969> portrait<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.750> us<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.649> fact<00:00:52.710> it's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
like a portrait to us but in fact it's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.130 
like a portrait to us but in fact it's
not<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> portrait<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> Mona<00:00:53.940> Lisa<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.989> for

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
not a portrait the Mona Lisa is but for

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
not a portrait the Mona Lisa is but for
a<00:00:55.170> long<00:00:55.320> time<00:00:55.590> her<00:00:55.800> identity<00:00:56.280> wasn't<00:00:56.730> known

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
a long time her identity wasn't known

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.729 
a long time her identity wasn't known
now<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.600> pretty<00:00:57.809> confident<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.649> who

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
now we are pretty confident we know who

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.529 
now we are pretty confident we know who
the<00:00:58.890> Mona<00:00:59.039> Lisa<00:00:59.250> was<00:00:59.489> but<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.059> case<00:01:00.359> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the Mona Lisa was but in this case this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.660 
the Mona Lisa was but in this case this
is<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.320> portrait<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.309> known<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
is not a portrait this is known as a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.149 
is not a portrait this is known as a
Tony<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:04.049> representation<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
Tony that is a representation of a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.969 
Tony that is a representation of a
character<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.210> particular<00:01:06.689> type<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> person

character of a particular type of person
the<00:01:08.430> way<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.600> instance<00:01:09.659> in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the way that we have for instance in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.469 
the way that we have for instance in
modern<00:01:10.680> American<00:01:11.100> situation<00:01:11.640> comedies<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
modern American situation comedies you

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.390 
modern American situation comedies you
have<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> villain<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> hero<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
have the villain you have the hero you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550 
have the villain you have the hero you
have<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> certain<00:01:14.850> type<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> person<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.110> we

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
have a certain type of person and we

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.300 
have a certain type of person and we
think<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:18.200> exotic<00:01:19.200> type<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
think this is a exotic type because of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.429 
think this is a exotic type because of
her<00:01:20.460> turban<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.420> her<00:01:21.630> clothing<00:01:21.930> seems

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
her turban and her clothing seems

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.499 
her turban and her clothing seems
foreign<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.950> also<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.430> rather<00:01:23.790> oversized

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
foreign and also that rather oversized

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.719 
foreign and also that rather oversized
Pearl<00:01:25.020> Earring<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.040> way<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.520> see

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
Pearl Earring and the way that we see

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.760 
Pearl Earring and the way that we see
her<00:01:26.880> from<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> side<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.659> she<00:01:27.840> turns<00:01:28.110> towards

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
her from the side but she turns towards

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.710 
her from the side but she turns towards
us<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.579> there's<00:01:29.759> something<00:01:30.060> momentary

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
us and so there's something momentary

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.240 
us and so there's something momentary
there's<00:01:30.900> something<00:01:31.140> very<00:01:31.259> alluring<00:01:31.770> but

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
there's something very alluring but

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580 
there's something very alluring but
we're<00:01:32.490> not<00:01:32.670> addressing<00:01:33.180> her<00:01:33.450> directly<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
we're not addressing her directly it's a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.560 
we're not addressing her directly it's a
lot<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> Mona<00:01:35.310> Lisa<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.850> both<00:01:36.030> cases<00:01:36.299> we

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
lot like the Mona Lisa in both cases we

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.840 
lot like the Mona Lisa in both cases we
have<00:01:36.600> gazes<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.320> seem<00:01:37.530> enigmatic<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.700> are

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
have gazes that seem enigmatic what are

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.569 
have gazes that seem enigmatic what are
they<00:01:39.030> thinking<00:01:39.570> who<00:01:39.930> are<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.280> our

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
they thinking who are they what is our

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.550 
they thinking who are they what is our
relationship<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.630> her<00:01:42.810> they're<00:01:43.320> both

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
relationship to her they're both

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.139

paintings<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.520> open<00:01:45.000> up

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
paintings that really open up

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.020 
paintings that really open up
possibilities<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.829> interpretation<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.820> no

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
possibilities for interpretation with no

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.420 
possibilities for interpretation with no
one<00:01:48.360> correct<00:01:48.810> answer<00:01:49.079> well<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.009> much<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.399> that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
one correct answer well so much so that

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.100 
one correct answer well so much so that
somebody<00:01:50.790> was<00:01:51.000> able<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.299> produce<00:01:51.450> an<00:01:51.810> entire

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
somebody was able to produce an entire

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.929 
somebody was able to produce an entire
novel<00:01:52.439> based<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> single<00:01:53.460> painting<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
novel based on the single painting that

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.420 
novel based on the single painting that
we<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.540> about<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:56.189> know

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
we know so little about what we do know

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.030 
we know so little about what we do know
about<00:01:56.610> this

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
about this

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.980 
about this
thing<00:01:57.250> though<00:01:57.430> is<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:57.970> it's<00:01:58.360> technique<00:01:58.810> is

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
thing though is that it's technique is

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.050 
thing though is that it's technique is
really<00:01:59.320> quite<00:01:59.620> extraordinary<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.550> subtlety

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
really quite extraordinary the subtlety

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.210 
really quite extraordinary the subtlety
of<00:02:01.090> light<00:02:01.540> is<00:02:01.840> stunning<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.770> way<00:02:02.890> in<00:02:03.040> which

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
of light is stunning the way in which

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.310 
of light is stunning the way in which
the<00:02:03.520> reflectivity<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.390> pearl<00:02:04.660> is<00:02:04.960> cast

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
the reflectivity of the pearl is cast

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.930 
the reflectivity of the pearl is cast
against<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.890> darkness<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.520> her<00:02:06.670> neck

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
against the darkness of her neck

against the darkness of her neck
softness<00:02:07.750> of<00:02:07.930> her<00:02:07.960> features<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.649> also<00:02:09.250> the

we<00:02:12.100> know<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.310> from<00:02:12.670> your<00:02:12.850> worked<00:02:13.150> very

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
we know that from your worked very

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.940 
we know that from your worked very
slowly<00:02:13.960> some<00:02:14.320> art<00:02:14.440> historians<00:02:14.860> have

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
slowly some art historians have

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.800 
slowly some art historians have
suggested<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.550> he<00:02:15.670> only<00:02:16.000> produced<00:02:16.360> perhaps

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
suggested that he only produced perhaps

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.900 
suggested that he only produced perhaps
just<00:02:17.080> two<00:02:17.350> or<00:02:17.530> three<00:02:17.560> paintings<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.370> year<00:02:18.400> and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
just two or three paintings a year and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.970 
just two or three paintings a year and
that<00:02:19.630> his<00:02:19.960> technique<00:02:20.350> was<00:02:20.410> really

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
that his technique was really

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.100 
that his technique was really
painstaking<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.150> we<00:02:22.240> can<00:02:22.390> see<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.020> the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
painstaking and we can see that in the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.230 
painstaking and we can see that in the
care<00:02:23.410> in<00:02:23.590> which<00:02:23.770> he's<00:02:23.950> creating<00:02:24.520> form<00:02:24.880> out<00:02:25.210> of

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
care in which he's creating form out of

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.020 
care in which he's creating form out of
light<00:02:25.720> but<00:02:26.170> it's<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.500> momentary<00:02:27.250> just<00:02:27.670> like<00:02:27.880> we

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
light but it's so momentary just like we

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.880 
light but it's so momentary just like we
look<00:02:28.210> at<00:02:28.360> Dutch<00:02:28.600> landscapes<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.620> we<00:02:29.709> have<00:02:29.860> a

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
look at Dutch landscapes and we have a

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.830 
look at Dutch landscapes and we have a
sense<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.490> passage<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.060> time<00:02:31.120> as<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
sense of the passage of time as the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.350 
sense of the passage of time as the
clouds<00:02:32.020> move<00:02:32.650> across<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.190> landscape<00:02:33.400> here<00:02:34.180> we

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
clouds move across the landscape here we

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.000 
clouds move across the landscape here we
have<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.690> same<00:02:34.959> sense<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.590> figure<00:02:35.860> has

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
have that same sense of a figure has

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.280 
have that same sense of a figure has
just<00:02:36.490> turned<00:02:36.850> her<00:02:37.030> head<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:37.750> about<00:02:38.020> to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
just turned her head and it's about to

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.710 
just turned her head and it's about to
speak<00:02:38.590> with<00:02:38.800> us<00:02:38.830> or<00:02:39.070> about<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.910> engage<00:02:40.300> us<00:02:40.480> but

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
speak with us or about to engage us but

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.540 
speak with us or about to engage us but
we<00:02:40.840> don't<00:02:40.959> know<00:02:41.140> what<00:02:41.320> about<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.340> our

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
we don't know what about and that our

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.340 
we don't know what about and that our
eyes<00:02:42.790> are<00:02:42.820> just<00:02:43.120> in<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.630> process<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:44.140> focusing

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
eyes are just in the process of focusing

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.640 
eyes are just in the process of focusing
on<00:02:44.740> her<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.280> she<00:02:45.310> meets<00:02:45.940> our<00:02:46.180> gaze<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.410> we

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
on her as she meets our gaze and so we

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.310 
on her as she meets our gaze and so we
are<00:02:47.920> complicit<00:02:48.550> in<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.270> moment<00:02:49.570> anything

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
are complicit in this moment anything

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.080 
are complicit in this moment anything
the<00:02:50.440> subtlety<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.040> colour<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.820> subtlety

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
the subtlety of colour and the subtlety

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.570 
the subtlety of colour and the subtlety
of<00:02:52.330> light<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.930> intimacy<00:02:53.530> here<00:02:53.830> all<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.370> that

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
of light the intimacy here all of that

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.970 
of light the intimacy here all of that
allows<00:02:55.060> us<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.300> register<00:02:55.900> this<00:02:56.080> very<00:02:56.440> personal

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
allows us to register this very personal

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.350 
allows us to register this very personal
moment<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.489> perhaps<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.180> why<00:02:58.300> this

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
moment and perhaps this is why this

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.490 
moment and perhaps this is why this
painting<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:58.989> so<00:02:59.200> beloved

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.560 

you
