good<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> grenade<00:02:03.659> launcher<00:02:03.780> or

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
good like the grenade launcher or

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.359 
good like the grenade launcher or
something<00:02:04.500> because<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:04.950> realistic

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
something because that's realistic

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
something because that's realistic
that's<00:02:05.820> they<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.329> grenade<00:02:06.689> launchers<00:02:07.079> in

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that's they have grenade launchers in

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.809 
that's they have grenade launchers in
real<00:02:07.350> life<00:02:07.560> maybe<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.979> rocket<00:02:08.369> launcher<00:02:08.700> as

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
real life maybe a rocket launcher as

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.580 
real life maybe a rocket launcher as
well<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> Armageddon

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
well like the Armageddon

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.170 
well like the Armageddon
but<00:02:10.830> something<00:02:11.190> like<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> anti-gravity

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
but something like the anti-gravity

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.650 
but something like the anti-gravity
blaster<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.720> base<00:02:12.930> cannon<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.709> plasma

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
blaster and base cannon and the plasma

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.990 
blaster and base cannon and the plasma
rifle<00:02:15.660> PZ<00:02:16.019> one<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.470> why<00:02:17.340> would<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.790> put

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000

don't have a weapon like this you can't
even<00:02:56.220> get<00:02:56.370> them<00:02:57.920> because<00:02:58.920> you're<00:02:59.519> not<00:02:59.790> able<00:03:00.000> to

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
even get them because you're not able to

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.479 
even get them because you're not able to
go<00:03:00.299> through<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.660> wall<00:03:00.950> with<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.160> weapon<00:03:02.459> like

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
go through the wall with a weapon like

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.369 
go through the wall with a weapon like
that<00:03:02.730> product<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.239> prototype<00:03:03.660> PS<00:03:03.870> r1<00:03:04.230> is

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
that product the prototype PS r1 is

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.740 
that product the prototype PS r1 is
another<00:03:04.620> perfect<00:03:04.890> example<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.549> how<00:03:05.750> this

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
another perfect example of how this

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.940 
another perfect example of how this
should<00:03:06.810> have<00:03:07.049> never<00:03:07.170> put<00:03:07.470> overpowered

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
should have never put overpowered

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.280 
should have never put overpowered
weapons<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.760> prototype<00:03:09.150> PS<00:03:09.420> r1<00:03:09.810> was<00:03:09.989> meant<00:03:10.200> to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
weapons the prototype PS r1 was meant to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.539 
weapons the prototype PS r1 was meant to
be<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:11.329> medium-range<00:03:12.329> sniper<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.470> then<00:03:14.310> they

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
be a medium-range sniper and then they

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.670 
be a medium-range sniper and then they
put<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.420> be<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:16.220> through<00:03:17.220> wall<00:03:17.489> weapon<00:03:18.350> now<00:03:19.350> I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
put it to be a through wall weapon now I

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.770 
put it to be a through wall weapon now I
think<00:03:20.190> people<00:03:20.730> would<00:03:20.880> have<00:03:21.150> gotten<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.540> almost

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
think people would have gotten it almost

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.229 
think people would have gotten it almost
just<00:03:22.109> as<00:03:22.230> much<00:03:22.470> as<00:03:22.709> before<00:03:23.040> if<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.790> was<00:03:24.000> not

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
just as much as before if it was not

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.129 
just as much as before if it was not
through<00:03:24.630> wall<00:03:25.010> because<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.880> know<00:03:27.000> why<00:03:27.959> would

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
through wall because you know why would

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.539 
through wall because you know why would
you<00:03:28.290> have<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> sniper<00:03:28.889> that<00:03:29.010> goes<00:03:29.280> through<00:03:29.489> the

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
you have a sniper that goes through the

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.849 
you have a sniper that goes through the
wall<00:03:29.700> how<00:03:30.000> why<00:03:30.450> would<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.870> be<00:03:31.049> realistic<00:03:31.650> in

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
wall how why would that be realistic in

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.759 
wall how why would that be realistic in
any<00:03:32.310> sense

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
any sense

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.470 
any sense
now<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.829> gorilla<00:03:35.250> gorilla<00:03:35.670> rifle<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.299> meant

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
now the gorilla gorilla rifle is meant

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.780 
now the gorilla gorilla rifle is meant
to<00:03:36.599> be<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.750> short<00:03:37.200> range<00:03:37.500> sniper<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:38.400> ultimate

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
to be a short range sniper the ultimate

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.250 
to be a short range sniper the ultimate
headhunter<00:03:39.299> was<00:03:39.480> meant<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.750> be<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> longer

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
headhunter was meant to be a longer

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.860 
headhunter was meant to be a longer
range<00:03:40.560> sniper<00:03:40.859> so<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.669> prototype<00:03:41.940> esr1<00:03:42.450> would

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
range sniper so the prototype esr1 would

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.509 
range sniper so the prototype esr1 would
only<00:03:43.049> make<00:03:43.200> sense<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.709> be<00:03:43.859> a<00:03:44.630> medium<00:03:45.630> range<00:03:46.519> yet

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
only make sense to be a medium range yet

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.849 
only make sense to be a medium range yet
they<00:03:48.239> really<00:03:48.660> defeated<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.230> purpose<00:03:49.590> if<00:03:49.739> it

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
they really defeated the purpose if it

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.379 
they really defeated the purpose if it
being<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.130> medium<00:03:50.459> range<00:03:50.700> sniper<00:03:51.000> because

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
being a medium range sniper because

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.199 
being a medium range sniper because
people<00:03:51.690> just<00:03:51.840> use<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.169> in<00:03:52.290> short<00:03:52.560> range<00:03:53.209> they

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
people just use it in short range they

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.849 
people just use it in short range they
don't<00:03:54.389> they<00:03:54.569> don't<00:03:54.599> scope<00:03:55.079> with<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.560> at<00:03:55.739> all

more<00:04:28.180> than<00:04:28.330> any<00:04:28.510> other<00:04:28.690> weapons<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:30.580> know

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
more than any other weapons and you know

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.400 
more than any other weapons and you know
I<00:04:31.290> just<00:04:32.460> this<00:04:33.460> is<00:04:33.640> my<00:04:33.670> opinion<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.720> just<00:04:34.960> think

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
I just this is my opinion I just think

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.630 
I just this is my opinion I just think
that<00:04:35.560> these<00:04:35.770> weapons<00:04:36.010> should<00:04:36.340> have<00:04:36.430> never

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
that these weapons should have never

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.630 
that these weapons should have never
been<00:04:36.880> put<00:04:36.940> in<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.420> game<00:04:37.570> weapons<00:04:38.530> like<00:04:38.710> the

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
been put in the game weapons like the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.100 
been put in the game weapons like the
grenade<00:04:39.940> launcher<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.390> Armageddon<00:04:40.780> maybe

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
grenade launcher and Armageddon maybe

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.390 
grenade launcher and Armageddon maybe
could<00:04:41.350> have<00:04:41.440> stayed<00:04:41.680> just<00:04:41.740> because<00:04:42.250> they're

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
could have stayed just because they're

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.550 
could have stayed just because they're
more<00:04:42.550> realistic<00:04:43.150> like<00:04:43.440> but<00:04:44.440> like

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
more realistic like but like

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.240 
more realistic like but like
anti-gravity<00:04:44.950> blaster<00:04:45.730> it's<00:04:46.120> just<00:04:46.330> you<00:04:46.930> know

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
what's the use of having boots that

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.520 
what's the use of having boots that
increase<00:04:53.440> your<00:04:53.470> jumping<00:04:53.650> height<00:04:54.190> or<00:04:54.400> the

because you have something that goes a

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.600 
because you have something that goes a
higher<00:05:00.090> antigravity<00:05:02.040> distance<00:05:03.040> than<00:05:03.370> any
