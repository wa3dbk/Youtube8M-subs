00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
feels like a thousand megapixels

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.950

depending<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.030> how<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.239> look<00:00:57.449> at<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
depending on how you look at that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.229

caught<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.350> does<00:01:04.559> this

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
caught up to that but when it does this

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.960 
caught up to that but when it does this
is<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> dumpster
