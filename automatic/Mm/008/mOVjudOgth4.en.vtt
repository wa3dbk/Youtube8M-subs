 married mother of a child and so with 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.320
 tonight I'm a stylist and in the case 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.400
 of these sizes this second 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.950
 activity that has a real passion 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.870
 for me I participated until fischer 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.280
 new found and that's the reason for 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.890
 which I find myself in Holland and 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.890
 I am very happy to be here 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.200
 full expansion especially with the loincloth 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.660
 the Dutch wax is practically visible 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.080
 all celebrities everyone wants 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.140
 getting dressed as a bonus we see the big 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.430
 brands that age years as soon as they 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.979
 come out collections with loincloth 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.119
 whether it is at the axis level or 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.690
 really African fashion in full 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.850
 expansion and for me in the future this 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.140
 will be the loincloth will nomad the material 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 inescapable in fashion 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.210
 whether for accessories for the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.550
 clothing we will have to go through there 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.990
 all the creators who respect themselves we will 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.550
 be obliged to use the straw for 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.670
 me in theirs as a material of 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.300
 creation for me so the future of the loincloth 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.420
 of African fashion through the basket 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.130
 is in front of that that's what I think 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.430
 or that has a lot to do with the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.430
 loin cloth 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.220
 what do I think about disco and 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:07.009
 loincloths as far as products and as 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:09.140
 I told visco cops for me is the 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.819
 reference in African fashion 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.900
 it's for me it's the salt it's the 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.599
 reference in elegance 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.739
 African for me to have the loincloth by 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.580
 the loincloth of especially the Dutch loincloth 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.290
 has always been in 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.860
 mentalities in the head of as we are 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.110
 small 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.150
 the dutch loincloth the dutch wax 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:35.660
 is the height of elegance and to 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.959
 promote visco already this is the reference 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.280
 doubt who was in my head who 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.950
 continues and even better who gets 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.330
 modernize for me viscos and the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.790
 modernization of the traditional loincloth 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:53.599
 african woman in business suit 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.780
 European but with the basis the grounds 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.780
 African 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.770
 a small family workshop that I have 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.660
 inherited in from my mom my mom week 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.440
 so that is to say that as I said 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.120
 since always she is the call is 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.340
 self-taught also at the workshop by 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.650
 passion so she's been to the studio since 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.810
 that she is retired too she goes there and 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.970
 I accompany them and as she says 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.990
 it keeps the workshop for me until 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.090
 that I decide to come and do some 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.470
 sewing so I'm going I'm coming I'm 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.390
 stewardess i'm gonna come back 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.240
 when I come back I go to the workshop and 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.959
 then good for two years I got 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.170
 decided to really start managing 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.030
 because my sister is pregnant she 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.370
 was going to give birth my mother accompanied him 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.440
 and then I say good during this time 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.550
 would run the workshop and then I took 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.770
 I took a liking I would say I guibord I 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.870
 told me but why not and so 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.810
 since the beginning of this year I have 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.000
 decided at the end of this year to stop 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.700
 so I started to organize myself 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.070
 laid out a bit for my taste to be at 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.769
 comfortable in the workshop and so it's a 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.769
 small workshop with five people 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:31.690
 to see a show room ie to have a 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.030
 space where wind is where I can 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.410
 to say a space where I present 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.080
 ready-to-wear models where I have a 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.210
 other space where as I say where the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.490
 women can come to relax 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.380
 exchange because I noticed already 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.320
 with the little corner I made that the 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.110
 women like to come sit sit down from 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.330
 time beyond leaving fittings 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.660
 spend time talking relax so 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.490
 a space like when we go to the salon of 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.300
 hairstyle one relaxes or do them 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.520
 aesthetic care 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.870
 for me it's like when I do 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.870
 shopping to help me time 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.290
 because I have if I have that so it's up to 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.820
 see also a bed of customers not 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.930
 necessarily abidjan in the sub-region 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.220
 people I can to tickets for 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.870
 special occasions ie having 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.640
 a special customer party a little 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.610
 group I'm going to tickets and then 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.180
 as I say the the third tier of 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.220
 my back of my projects is to have taken 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.210
 the power to propose models online 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:47.530
 that is, stylist models of 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.330
 fame that tailors may have 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.590
 to wear and realized and rear with 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.030
 cutting plans and all that is the 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.150
 third you want who is not yet 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.150
 not at all realize 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.980
 I want an effect and I give myself the 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.720
 means to have this effect there so if he 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.700
 you have to use a material that 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.230
 allows to have this effect those used 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.370
 the material that allows to have this effect 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.140
 what does it do 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.640
 that's why I use materials a 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.430
 little different that we do not use in 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.280
 sewing like maybe some wire 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.790
 as I'm going to say or materials that 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.420
 are used 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.990
 not necessarily for the use that one 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.790
 Reserve 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.680
 I use to something else as good the 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.160
 sticky maybe but was using a 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.430
 another way 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.310
 and then as I say I like 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.500
 mix materials like leather the 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.170
 leather with loincloth in Africa but 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.330
 use differently it exists but I 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.130
 am going to use the leather a little bit 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.320
 different what will give maybe 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.280
 another look at the bi so I think 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.810
 that my particularity is to use 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.980
 different materials and 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.950
 use differently 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.680
 here we will be the models are very 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.180
 simple and I'm just looking for a little 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.080
 touch of originality with the materials 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.080
 so here we go 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.139
 if you believe you have the mind 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:16.740
 tax because for me until 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.139
 Holy Spirit 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.819
 if you think you have it me 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.819
 think there's no reason you're 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:26.159
 you even and then dark it does not take 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:27.750
 steam must darken ball make this 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:30.599
 we have deep in his heart I think 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:33.389
 for me bus co is to have the passion 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:35.819
 and then as I say a spirit sion there 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:39.919
 we see it where we do not have so much 

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:39.919
 there if we are sure that there we have to go
