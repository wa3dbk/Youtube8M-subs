for<00:01:36.209> testing<00:01:36.660> i'm<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.800> dim<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.039> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
for testing i'm going to dim to the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.980 
for testing i'm going to dim to the
bolts<00:01:38.429> here's<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:38.940> technically<00:01:39.899> your

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
bolts here's your technically your

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.559 
bolts here's your technically your
arrows<00:01:40.319> so<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> stronger<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.759> bolt<00:01:42.090> are<00:01:42.300> the

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
arrows so the stronger the bolt are the

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.270 
arrows so the stronger the bolt are the

of swords hold drink ohm would be a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.859 
of swords hold drink ohm would be a
great<00:01:56.220> example<00:01:56.429> for<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.119> hear<00:01:57.720> your

what makes this month so unique you get
your<00:02:03.959> basic<00:02:04.319> scope<00:02:04.800> right<00:02:05.099> here<00:02:05.340> which<00:02:05.550> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
your basic scope right here which is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.760 
your basic scope right here which is
basically<00:02:06.270> think<00:02:06.750> about<00:02:06.929> a<00:02:06.959> red<00:02:07.170> dot<00:02:07.349> that's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
basically think about a red dot that's

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
basically think about a red dot that's
what<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:07.979> would<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> red<00:02:08.880> dot<00:02:09.090> right

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
what this would be be a red dot right

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.690 
what this would be be a red dot right
here<00:02:10.050> would<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.380> your<00:02:10.500> column<00:02:11.039> basically<00:02:11.580> your

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
here would be your column basically your

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.370 
here would be your column basically your
sniper<00:02:11.880> rifle<00:02:12.270> scope<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:12.959> perfect

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
sniper rifle scope so this is perfect

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.589 
sniper rifle scope so this is perfect
for<00:02:13.800> long<00:02:14.010> range<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.730> doesn't<00:02:15.090> zoom<00:02:15.360> in

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
for long range but it doesn't zoom in

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.280 
for long range but it doesn't zoom in
from<00:02:15.810> what<00:02:16.079> I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
from what I

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.199 
from what I
no<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.620> may<00:02:16.950> not<00:02:17.159> be<00:02:17.310> doing<00:02:17.489> something<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.030> we'll

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
we'll get into that see I can figure it

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.920 
we'll get into that see I can figure it
out<00:02:19.760> go<00:02:20.760> ahead<00:02:20.909> stop<00:02:21.090> talking<00:02:21.420> about<00:02:21.510> them<00:02:21.750> and
