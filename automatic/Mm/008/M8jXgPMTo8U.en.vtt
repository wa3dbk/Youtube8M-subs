00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
 hi recruits 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.400
 jeyko seriously I do not like the subject of 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.150
 this week 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.460
 I can not live without my mobile 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.740
 but it's not typical of people anything 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.130
 I'm talking to my friends 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.960
 by mobile for example I have the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.960
 calendar on the mobile I like I do not have 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.009
 memory I remember my dates and things 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.989
 what do I have to do and is in the 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.789
 calendar but above I also have 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.339
 another application that of roll notitas 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.200
 post-its and you and I there I'm putting then 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:39.750
 all in fact I have up to a possible 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.430
 cravings because that's how I remember the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.530
 cravings that I have and when I go to buy 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.989
 Well controls with cravings 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.930
 in fact there are times that instead of being 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.969
 in the computer I'm in the mobile and almost 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.260
 I do not get out of bed the whole day 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.120
 because of course I have everything here 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.070
 another very typical thing that the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.050
 people is that you can not live without reading 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.930
 books without listening to music without seeing 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.170
 series without watching movies and I all everything 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.670
 everything all that I do from the mobile the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.409
 moment that I send water 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.509
 and you're already I'm going another thing 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.899
 from the mobile with which I can not live 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.670
 without without which I can not live in google 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.229
 rave some do not know what google 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.540
 drive good as a drawer in the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.460
 cloud enrique save everything and there 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.710
 I have notes of notes 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.330
 university and have those of all 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.740
 years and even on subjects that do not 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.670
 I have had but people have passed me 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.350
 notes 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.270
 I've taken it and I 've gone 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.250
 as we have space I say so I have 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.869
 and it is always done when the power 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.670
 we have to do some work or something 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.500
 the people in good plan because if you want 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.630
 we can stay one day in a class of 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.549
 empty and we can do the job and I 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.470
 I'm the plan and why do not we do it for 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.060
 google drive because the truth is that 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.190
 I prefer to work from home more 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.600
 tranquilito and with google drive like 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.100
 has the thing about this that you can 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.470
 share it with people in real time 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.659
 well, you do not have to give and see 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.659
 people do not have to 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.260
 so it seems that I prefer my mobile 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.190
 rather than see people not good then 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.920
 I'm going my cell phone and I 'm going out there 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.900
 goodbye 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.060
 and good recruits up here the video of 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.430
 today it's a little short because the subject 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.780
 I do not know if you did not like the video 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.489
 can you leave me any comments 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.590
 telling me what you can not live with 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.510
 so it also happens to you as I do not 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.830
 can live without your mobile then 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.810
 We can send things to you through 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.010
 mobile and I'll be super cool because I do not 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.709
 how we do not want to see him in person 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.209
 we put messages by mobile the friendly 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.250
 study of the nice balta 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.300
 Normally and if you want to see more videos 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.300

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.280
