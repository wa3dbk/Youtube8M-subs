00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.139
 star a craft a tutorial of 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.570
 how to customize outfits to you already know 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.949
 that those values that we put in the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.949
 books for when we do 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.059
 they can do this if they like it if they do not 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.180
 and all that if he wants to see his face easy 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.309
 so well to need a sheet 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.699
 white good post-its of the color that 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.949
 you want later you are going to need 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:50.629
 watercolor paints or colors any 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:53.000
 thing to paint glue scissors to a 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.280
 pencil and if you want some impressions of 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.980
 some buildings that leave them 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.520
 description if the download exists 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.520
 and that's what we're going to see how it 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.079
 draw draw a cloud 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.579
 and then I'm going to cut the situations 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.460
 what you want also here I have 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:17.979
 trees for all those things with this 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.390
 kind a city like that you can 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.069
 painting can do the forms that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.890
 you want and then they will have 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:26.020
 face of post-it and how they see there is like 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.270
 a separation of the glue and what does not 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.729
 has good glue they have like that 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.740
 see if if you enter the graphics glue 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.569
 code can be cut so that 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.530
 between good absorb and hit him with 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:40.270
 plastic and they have to leave it to dry 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.459
 dry until it is completely 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.489
 dry and you 're done 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.810
 that's all it's super easy it's good 

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:48.789
 when what you want to be 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.670
 great and I loved it and I also 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.069
 You can put the movie ones too 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.360
 can you put it not for a good book 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.060
 I know what you want only 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.929
 I give the idea you can transform 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.929
 they will resent it 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.370
 Otherwise, if I'm not going to send a photo to 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.370
 twitter facebook
