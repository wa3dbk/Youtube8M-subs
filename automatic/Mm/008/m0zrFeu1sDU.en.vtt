00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.500
 or the followers of andrÃ©s help this is 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.900
 a video in which we are going to compare the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.790
 performance offered by the galaxy great 2 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.570
 recently announced by wide its 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.210
 arrival in spain and the galaxy s3 a 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.730
 terminal that is something old but that 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.179
 offers similar theory performance 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.550
 which would demonstrate the new model of 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.650
 the Korean company without more let's 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.420
 run the application on your you so that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.120
 it is quite clear what is the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.790
 capacity compared exactly in the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.720
 moment of each of the terminals 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:43.100
 without further igniting each one of them 3 2 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.100
 1 there we go 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.560
 as you can see the percentage 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.410
 evolutionary and evolution of the benchmark 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.600
 it's pretty clear because the numbers 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.380
 They are very large and at this time 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.980
 is measuring the capacity of the cpu to 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.470
 the time to execute 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.950
 actions as you can see the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.409
 performance is pretty close so 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.120
 less so far 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.850
 it seems that the s3 takes a slight advantage 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.520
 at this moment that where it is followed 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.520
 analyzing the capacity of the cpu 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.110
 the new galaxy big 2 unlike the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.539
 s 3 for example to have a 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.729
 qualcomm processor while the s 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:40.320
 3 Exynos arrive and the amount of memory 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.159
 ram in the case of the big 2 is 1.5 gb and 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.100
 the drs 3 is one giga 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.890
 As you can see, he is now with the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.800
 section of the branch 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.710
 it seems that you start to distance yourself 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.450
 little the s3 although at this moment of 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.420
 multitasking should cut 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.300
 distances the big 2 because already 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.310
 it has half a gig of ram 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.310
 we talk about processors in both cases 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.399
 of 4 cores with which there should not 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.190
 find the difference and how it looks 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.310
 I think it has improved a little 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.450
 advanced the great 2 regarding s 3 I think 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.260
 that he has cut a little bit of 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.349
 distance although we continue 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.510
 with the execution of the benchmark that does not 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.510
 a lot will start to show 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.159
 and you can clearly see that the great 2 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.439
 has taken a leap and has become a tad 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.500
 ahead of ls 3 which is a very 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:42.400
 good signal although it has returned to distance 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.850
 it's a little bit rs3 has been something eventual 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.680
 We could say 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.780
 the case is that as expected and as 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.050
 we announce at the beginning of it 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.090
 of the video basically the performance is 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.690
 very even 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.690
 With which 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.170
 and we talk about this new terminal 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.470
 offered by on sunday and also by 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.470
 pleasant 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.230
 has the capacity of a high-end of already 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.760
 a few years ago now the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.320
 execution of the graphics in three 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.790
 dimensions also therefore today 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.790
 because of the games 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:24.170
 and here as you can see the frames by 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.300
 second are better in the 'big 2 almost 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.510
 without any doubt because they do not come down 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.400
 of the 25 fps at no time certain 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.130
 little ones now that you start to see many 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.250
 objects however the s3 itself has 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.560
 been below 20 and 16 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.330
 several times 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.780
 it's over already you can see the 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.700
 results we will go forward to see 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.239
 where is each one and how can you see 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.650
 the score of LEDs in 3ds 3 is 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.650
 higher at about 3000 points 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.819
 and let's see them in detail 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.970
 place to doubt the processor gets better 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.590
 performance in each case 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.470
 the branch is shown superior in s 3 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.780
 and in the graphics is also shown 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.079
 superior except in the 3d how can you 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:27.729
 see that you get a higher score of 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.729
 4 1994 large 2 x 4 thousand 562 ls 3 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.639
 well nothing this is the video in which 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.639
 We wanted to demonstrate and show you all 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.740
 you who buy a galaxy 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.160
 great 2 that just arrived in Spain as 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.690
 we said before it has a terminal that 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.100
 It can be compared perfectly with a 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.290
 it is believed to be a high-end device 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.289
 that a few years ago but that 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.969
 he still has a 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.969
 quite a way to go
