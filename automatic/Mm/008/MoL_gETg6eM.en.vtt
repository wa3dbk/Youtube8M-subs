00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.129
 hello everybody i'm tight and 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.170
 Welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.670
 let's compare here in this and the chapter 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.529
 that I bring you guys will remember you 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.810
 surely very much one that we did 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.700
 long ago in which we compared the msr 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.349
 and the 11th, well, you will ask 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.090
 tight because you say that this episode was 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.220
 It will look so much like the one we did yesterday 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.779
 for two reasons basically in the first 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.460
 place because this is going to be the second 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.680
 chapter in this section of compare 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.390
 in which we will take into account the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.460
 precision rifles to perform this 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.020
 comparison and secondly because 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.149
 normally when we do this kind of 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.530
 comparisons with this type of weapons the 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.570
 statistics that we can get to 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.340
 find to determine which is better 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.320
 which one should we use in each of the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.850
 situations is rather slim so 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.950
 So much this video has a plus of 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.630
 handicap or an added difficulty to the 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.770
 time to make this video but I'm 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.300
 sure that at the end of the video between 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.790
 we will all get a conclusion 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.440
 very successful about what sniper 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.760
 we should use in each of the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.680
 situations and depending on the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.850
 playability of each player so 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.640
 let's start with statistics 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.799
 concrete and the most specific data the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.780
 damage in both snipers is 98 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.119
 points is practically the same perhaps 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.380
 slightly higher in the 50's 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.909
 but we will not notice it is in the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.649
 belly and so we're not going to have it in 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.969
 account since multipliers of 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.859
 damage that both weapons have are going to 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.149
 equalize that small difference have in 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.249
 account that the damage does not reach its 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.990
 total ie does not exceed 100% 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:28.759
 because if not the multipliers do not 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.709
 would have no use would not serve 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.240
 for nothing and we would kill a bullet in 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.369
 any part of the body and leaving 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.840
 ice cream that 's real or not I do not think that 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.179
 be the intentionality of a game of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.159
 call of duty the mode they shoot both for 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.350
 Container is the same semiautomatic 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.729
 but the ammunition is double that of the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.560
 bar and this is a very aspect 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.929
 important since as we are going to have in 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.399
 account for little data any factor that 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.109
 surpass the other is very 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.060
 important to determine what 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.249
 sniper will be better so 30 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.439
 ammo bullets for the barret and 15 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:59.179
 for the 50th killer and keeping in mind 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.740
 that are semi automatic snipers 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.560
 ammunition is a factor that we will have 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.359
 very very much in mind the recharge more or less 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.509
 the same slightly lower in the 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.130
 the s 50 3.5 tip 3.9 we're not going to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.920
 notice practically and especially if 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.599
 we use predestination that difference is 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.030
 will be reduced practically to 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.829
 minimum and equality you see that these 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.100
 videos are very complicated, that's not why 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.200
 watch 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.030
 and making comparisons is so difficult and 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.260
 It is so complicated because when 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.910
 the lack of a weapon can be 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.800
 counteract with the advantage of a u 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.510
 another and at the same time that advantage becomes 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.060
 in a lack because it privatizes you 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.920
 have another advantage is something complicated what 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.140
 You see, it's not all very linked and chained 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.700
 let's see the zoom in weapons 50 ls 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.040
 is the man with sniper that has 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.020
 the zoom reduced to 50% compared to all 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.910
 others throughout the saga call of duty 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.680
 that's good or bad good depends on the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.560
 Crowd map 6 and for use by and 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.180
 how do you use the charger the charger in 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.470
 the barrett is double 10 bullets and that's 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.360
 very important considering that 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.740
 they are semi automatic snipers and 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.810
 that the cadence is very high and with frames 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.100
 let's delay the recharge much better on 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.930
 everything if we find a multitude of 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.610
 enemies in front of our ability 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.930
 of all the ammunition that we can 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.880
 have is twice that of the barre 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.680
 also and now it's 50 is unlocked to the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.240
 level 22 while a barre 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.860
 class when we reach level 2 is not 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.180
 in a class it's a bit sad but 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.820
 well we can start using the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.140
 sniper and if we can not 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.720
 modify it at our will when 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.370
 we reach level 4 the multipliers 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.950
 of damage are the same in both weapons 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.200
 worth in the head is for 15 that is 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.100
 multiply that damage by 15 and 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.960
 evidently 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.820
 head we will kill a bullet because that 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.620
 damage multiplied on would pass to one hundred 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.510
 per cent in the chest we would multiply 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.450
 that damage of both snipers by 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.370
 1.1 and therefore also to exceed 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.380
 those 100 points whose audio 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.630
 totality an enemy modern warfare 3 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.580
 or s also battery of a bullet in 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.170
 the chest of the head but tight where 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.060
 we do not kill a bullet in modern warfare 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.680
 3 with the slider, well, it's 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.080
 We would obtain sign that is becoming 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.980
 part impacts me against anyone 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.650
 of the extremities 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.300
 that is to say arms are legs clear when 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.480
 we have a game marker that means that 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.160
 we have left the enemy practically at 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.230
 98 percent since the damage is not 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.000
 multiply by nothing or by one as 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.010
 you want to call so it will be easy to finish 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.510
 with him pulling out a short gun that's why 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.970
 So important when we use sniper 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.580
 get to short weapons to get it out 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.260
 quickly and with a bullet from the pipe of 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.960
 a short weapon would kill him 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.280
 easily not so good summary already 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.900
 there are no more statistics to have in 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.970
 account did not find anything else because it is 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.530
 that there is nothing else normally the 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.840
 snipers and these comparisons 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.400
 they are very much depending on the player with 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.320
 which one you feel most comfortable with and how many 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.340
 used first not so it's 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.630
 difficult is difficult 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.340
 in the comments what you want 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.900
 you what you think 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.240
 I want the numerical data and 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.100
 concrete here do not have too much paper 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.120
 I think it's more with which one you feel more 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.860
 comfortable with which one you have gotten used to 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.380
 first because it says that the human mind 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.000
 It takes 21 days and we have been like 10 months 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.620
 playing this game and like the mind 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.510
 It takes 21 days for humans to get used to it 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.910
 something will be very difficult I will not change 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.380
 so well the neighborhood beats the 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.940
 departure in the ammunition aspect is 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.590
 we have seen it but at the same time it is a 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.540
 sniper that privatizes you a lot 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.520
 movement is very slow while the 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.470
 s 50 has little ammunition and is already a little 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.880
 lighter how can we counteract 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.500
 that in the neighborhood with advantages like 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.630
 presentation since it has a recharge 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.889
 also quite slow and the 50 s the 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.780
 have conspiracy we can use 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.490
 scavengers but a scavenger jump not 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.840
 We can use other advantages like 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.639
 extreme conditioning that we would go 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.710
 very well also with the sniper so 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.120
 it's more like I tell you with carlos sintáis 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.740
 more comfortable so we'll see each other in the 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.160
 next episode guys only here in 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.160
 DC
