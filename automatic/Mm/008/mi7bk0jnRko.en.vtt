00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.740
 I have taken the determination with a great 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.229
 conviction with great joy with a 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.309
 grenade with a peace in my heart of a 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:13.530
 very clear way that marked RodrÃ­guez 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.289
 closed cycle arbiter active I 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.660
 basically today 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.400
 of two of two associations that 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.009
 It interests me that I can contribute to their 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.809
 referees one of them is mexico 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.489
 obviously another from Asia that I 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.079
 I humbly consider that I think that 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.719
 we did a professional job I have the 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.780
 pleasure and satisfied of the duty fulfilled 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:36.760
 but it's not this one does not do it 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.170
 It also does a commission job 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.940
 of arbitration historically of the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.790
 soccer federation the licensee 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.440
 justino compean told me that he 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.839
 would like only months to oppose that 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.100
 only words he told me that he 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:54.070
 would like it to integrate in some future 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.570
 they do not do when the possibility of 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.400
 work for the federation in the area 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.239
 of arbitration plus however also 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.119
 Nothing concrete 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.720
 of technician that this god currently 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:06.909
 I'm practically free this is a 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.650
 reality and I do not belong to make a 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.590
 vitro in active reiterated I will be 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.110
 preparing and I will be in all kinds 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.390
 all being professionals and 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.330
 when that important opportunity comes 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.790
 will be evaluated and we will take it clearly 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.710
 good a man goes what 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.390
 beyond controversy that 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.210
 may have wrapped up because it's the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.840
 reality was always controversial 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.000
 had when he devoted himself to doing it a great 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.990
 level of arbitration there is no doubt 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.760
 of this there are very dark episodes like 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.420
 also very successful episodes of frame 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.370
 Rodriguez not everything is only to attack him 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.860
 nor to exalt what I believe for the just 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.229
 you have to nuance the things of a 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.290
 differently because when you swim 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.640
 more I personally had a problem a 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.080
 conflict and eating I said yes if not 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.850
 I'm going to catalog that if it's good or 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.619
 bad to me I thought it was a good referee 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.530
 but that has also made a great 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.240
 closure of a series of stupidities 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.840
 gigantic problems here I have when 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.760
 the minute 59 removed cards m 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.840
 simultaneous on December 13, 2011 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.840
 but you do not know where you are
