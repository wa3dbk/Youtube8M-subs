put<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.760> figure<00:01:35.000> on<00:01:35.120> then<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.780> would<00:01:35.900> sink

and it gives me a specific experience
and<00:04:18.700> perhaps<00:04:18.940> my<00:04:19.120> character<00:04:19.720> has<00:04:19.989> an

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
that away with it so if I'd played with

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.050 
that away with it so if I'd played with
the<00:04:23.290> character<00:04:23.710> in<00:04:23.950> more<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.580> these<00:04:24.670> different

the character in more of these different

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.750 
the character in more of these different
locations<00:04:25.570> it<00:04:26.440> it<00:04:26.800> would<00:04:27.010> reflect<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.490> in

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
locations it it would reflect that in

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.430 
locations it it would reflect that in
its<00:04:27.910> stats<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.450> how<00:04:28.600> it<00:04:28.750> behaves<00:04:28.870> in<00:04:29.290> those

its stats and how it behaves in those

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.920 
its stats and how it behaves in those

close to retail obviously with Super

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.400 
close to retail obviously with Super
Smash<00:05:04.220> Brothers<00:05:04.490> coming<00:05:05.150> up<00:05:05.270> quite<00:05:06.020> soon

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410

Smash Brothers coming up quite soon
that's<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.190> packaging<00:05:07.790> we're<00:05:07.910> seeing<00:05:08.210> here

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
that's the packaging we're seeing here

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.630 
that's the packaging we're seeing here
is<00:05:08.570> probably<00:05:08.750> going<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.050> be<00:05:09.110> quite<00:05:10.040> similar<00:05:10.610> to

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
is probably going to be quite similar to

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.130 
is probably going to be quite similar to
what<00:05:10.820> we'd<00:05:11.060> see<00:05:11.270> when<00:05:11.420> it<00:05:11.510> hits<00:05:11.780> stores

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
what we'd see when it hits stores

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.890 
what we'd see when it hits stores
obviously<00:05:12.470> this<00:05:12.530> isn't<00:05:12.800> final<00:05:13.280> packaging<00:05:13.900> but

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
obviously this isn't final packaging but

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.870 
obviously this isn't final packaging but
we'll<00:05:15.020> be<00:05:15.170> seeing<00:05:15.440> something<00:05:16.340> similar<00:05:16.700> I

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
we'll be seeing something similar I

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.700 
we'll be seeing something similar I
think<00:05:16.960> when<00:05:17.960> it<00:05:18.080> comes<00:05:18.260> into<00:05:18.680> stores<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:20.710> think

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
think when it comes into stores I think

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.740 
think when it comes into stores I think
this<00:05:21.830> is<00:05:21.920> quite<00:05:22.070> an<00:05:22.220> intelligent<00:05:22.820> and<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.180> well

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
this is quite an intelligent and a well

going to be important I think that they

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.670 
going to be important I think that they

don't have too many of those because

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.980 
don't have too many of those because
with<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.920> figures<00:05:46.250> being<00:05:46.670> functional<00:05:47.630> across

different games you don't really want to

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.520 
different games you don't really want to
be<00:05:49.460> buying<00:05:49.850> the<00:05:49.940> same<00:05:50.180> figure<00:05:50.390> in<00:05:50.750> different

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
be buying the same figure in different

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.800 
be buying the same figure in different
scenarios<00:05:51.650> or<00:05:52.070> have<00:05:52.220> too<00:05:52.430> many<00:05:52.520> incentives<00:05:52.910> to

buy a Mario paper same area part and

Super<00:05:56.720> Smash<00:05:56.780> Brothers<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:58.190> so<00:05:58.340> that<00:05:58.490> that's

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
Super Smash Brothers and so that that's

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.480 
Super Smash Brothers and so that that's
the<00:05:58.910> that's<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.240> challenge<00:05:59.660> of<00:05:59.840> these

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
the that's the challenge of these

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.350 
the that's the challenge of these
consumer<00:06:01.490> products<00:06:01.880> where<00:06:02.090> you've<00:06:02.210> got<00:06:02.330> a

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
consumer products where you've got a

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.900 
consumer products where you've got a
video<00:06:02.540> game<00:06:02.870> and<00:06:03.080> a<00:06:03.169> toy<00:06:03.350> is<00:06:04.250> balancing<00:06:04.760> one

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
video game and a toy is balancing one

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.130 
video game and a toy is balancing one
against<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.240> other<00:06:05.360> so<00:06:05.450> you've<00:06:05.540> got<00:06:05.660> value

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
against the other so you've got value

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.250 
against the other so you've got value
obviously<00:06:06.650> against<00:06:07.310> making<00:06:07.880> a<00:06:07.940> profit<00:06:08.260> and

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
obviously against making a profit and

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.380 
obviously against making a profit and
certainly<00:06:09.740> I<00:06:09.950> think<00:06:10.460> that<00:06:10.610> it's<00:06:10.730> it's<00:06:10.940> clever

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
certainly I think that it's it's clever

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.120 
certainly I think that it's it's clever
that<00:06:11.870> these<00:06:12.020> aren't<00:06:12.230> unlocking<00:06:12.710> characters

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
that these aren't unlocking characters

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.120 
that these aren't unlocking characters
in<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:13.340> game<00:06:13.550> and<00:06:13.850> then<00:06:14.540> that<00:06:14.780> it<00:06:15.500> works<00:06:15.860> in

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
in the game and then that it works in

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.220 
in the game and then that it works in
terms<00:06:16.280> of<00:06:16.490> value<00:06:16.880> that<00:06:17.240> this<00:06:17.360> is<00:06:17.540> an<00:06:17.660> extra
