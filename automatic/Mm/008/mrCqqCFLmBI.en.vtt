00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
scroll so hopefully doesn't take us that

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.380 
scroll so hopefully doesn't take us that
long<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.590> unique<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.579> last<00:00:44.789> time<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.059> cube

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
long to unique and we last time I cube

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.610 
long to unique and we last time I cube
to<00:00:45.870> unique<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.469> took<00:00:46.770> me<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.120> 3<00:00:48.120> cube<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.780> it's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to unique it took me like 3 cube so it's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.910 
to unique it took me like 3 cube so it's
miracle<00:00:49.950> time<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.640> hopefully<00:00:51.920> just

getting notices and another one come on

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.939 
getting notices and another one come on
it'd<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.300> cool<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.600> got<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.989> epic<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.530> legend

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
it'd be cool if we got to epic to legend

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.789 
it'd be cool if we got to epic to legend
one<00:01:05.040> cube<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:06.110> still<00:01:07.110> haven't<00:01:07.260> had<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.470> happen

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
one cube I still haven't had that happen

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.690 
one cube I still haven't had that happen
not<00:01:08.250> even<00:01:08.369> once<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:11.159> I've<00:01:11.250> been<00:01:11.400> seeing<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.670> lot

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
not even once and I've been seeing a lot

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.550 
not even once and I've been seeing a lot
of<00:01:11.850> people<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.270> from<00:01:12.479> rare<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.930> unique<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
of people go from rare to unique and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.420 
of people go from rare to unique and
like<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.979> couple<00:01:14.820> cubes<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.979> think

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
like a couple cubes so I think I think

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.100 
like a couple cubes so I think I think
the<00:01:17.490> chances<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.360> write<00:01:18.570> unique<00:01:18.930> or

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the chances of going to write unique or

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.539 
the chances of going to write unique or
a<00:01:19.170> lot<00:01:19.290> better<00:01:19.470> than<00:01:19.799> epics<00:01:20.189> legendary<00:01:20.700> so

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
a lot better than epics legendary so

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.649 
a lot better than epics legendary so
we're<00:01:23.549> gonna<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.150> go<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.330> unique

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
we're gonna have to just go to unique

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.850 
we're gonna have to just go to unique
first<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.130> not<00:01:26.280> looking<00:01:26.549> good<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:26.759> all
