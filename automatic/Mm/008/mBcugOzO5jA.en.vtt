00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hi, I'm welcome to say one more. 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.350
 video from where I'm going to compare the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.179
 book and a movie of the same name I saw one 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.090
 film in the head press one week 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.420
 before and face this sensational movie 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.480
 Kind is very very good and I left did the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.029
 Movie review la blog if you want 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.400
 know more about the history in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.130
 Yes, the movie will be there and if you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.720
 want to see is also the book but also 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.090
 here in the description the two with the two 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.820
 links because the fan of the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.190
 and the movie because there are some 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.710
 differences between the two politicians 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.510
 amazon special movie verses book 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.360
 even for those who do not know the story 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.110
 of the saga is basically so there is a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.719
 clearing in the middle of a skill and each 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.750
 one of them arrives in place or towel 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.390
 This time it was Thomas and Thomas did not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.730
 remembers nothing and there came an hour that 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.070
 a girl arrives and the first line 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.420
 to find out if this is the worst of 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.750
 everything is that it comes with a message 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.369
 writing is the last and when she 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.610
 wake up she screams thomas 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.229
 this is basically from the movie in the book is 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.560
 so different start is another one of the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.750
 more details then as you know 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.180
 a little bit of history let's face the differences 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.490
 the difference always kind everyone goes 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.220
 to perceive is the chronological order of the facts 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.130
 which happens for example the tereza she 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.909
 arrives before Thomas enters a 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.400
 maze 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.890
 already on the film only compensates the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.689
 Thomas goes to the maze and then 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.530
 child arrives a day later 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.509
 Another difference is the hole in 2002 that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.049
 you know in the book is where the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:47.159
 executioners go out every night and going 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.259
 cover in the book is a hole near a 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.750
 cliff that final day so an end 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.790
 of the maze and in the movie actually 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.340
 there is a hole and none if I sleep 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.680
 with the difference is that in books there is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.659
 the maps that all runners 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.350
 as soon as they arrive every night they 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.659
 mapped the labyrinth and then comes kind of 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.390
 cover various things about capital in the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.590
 movie does not exist these maps closer 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.750
 This is why minc created a model that 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.849
 basically i think only he awb know 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.200
 I understood this part and I 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.870
 I have to review the movie to understand 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.459
 right this question if qat danced 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.560
 but I think basically that he just 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.510
 they know this another difference is the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.250
 code to exit the maze at 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.709
 difference to parades of codes in 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.049
 that instead of being words only numbers 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.120
 I will not talk like neither is 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.160
 documents because it supports the dilma 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.590
 things in the movie both the movie and the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.330
 book then another difference is that the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.980
 TomÃ¡s is not a sin 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.470
 If you've read the book you know it has 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.230
 a part that the tone - it lets itself be 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.180
 one finger to know what 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.130
 really he was in the past a movie 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.130
 it's not basically so they can 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.620
 They hang from a hangman and are over there. 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.360
 inject the eternal information into the skin 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.910
 and after the normal race 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.190
 and then there's the flashback of remembrance 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.739
 of it all but one of the many that change 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.329
 was the theater and awb in the book 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.099
 dieckmann with a stab 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.739
 basically this is not going to tell me who it is 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.650
 that gives it to him because movie spoiler in 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.239
 a stab is a shot the awb it 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.450
 died in a different way 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.120
 in the book he dies to save again 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.269
 so those who are fleeing from the whistle already 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.230
 in the film he mother before even to welcome 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.540
 this escape 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.069
 at the time of their escape they make the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:38.060
 Rebel album he oscar and years 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.639
 thats not out of the bus at the bus book 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.840
 already in the movie is by helicopter and I think 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:45.590
 that this change made a lot of sense 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.010
 because he left that curiosity close 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.010
 movie 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.160
 already taking advantage of this part of 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.320
 helicopter you can already see 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.250
 a change that the maze is not 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.140
 underground 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.350
 the other change that we can also see 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.720
 in the same scene is that in the book too 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.050
 I think in the third says that the cruel 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.650
 seat there in the labyrinth where everything runs 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.810
 near a forest walking with snow 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.120
 something like that and not already in the book 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:23.240
 milk for everything sand and sand do not have 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.300
 Dense forest full raise we do not 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.830
 difference is that there is no vaccine 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.590
 If you 've read the book you know that 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.020
 when the one clareana stung by the verdade 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.930
 he has a type of vaccine that you 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.750
 inject this person who has been bitten and 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.570
 simply the person does not die simple 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.360
 she does not look and then she goes through 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.190
 transformation and everything in the only 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.530
 at least one movie 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.690
 the transformation happens to you receiving 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.870
 the vaccine is not the only differential is that 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.550
 you die being ricardo bueno you 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.500
 take the vaccine you do not look if you 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.020
 you want to read reviews is showing up here 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.680
 do not put if you have not read this 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.380
 Get out for everything you're doing and 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.670
 will read the movie is very good I think 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.460
 everybody should see this movie 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.790
 regardless of the age at which you read the 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.270
 book not read and see the series is 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.520
 Sensational and good. I want to thank. 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.280
 very very very very fox movies that 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.430
 he invited me to go to cabins 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.830
 and it was sensational like this. 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.350
 and if the movie is the first movie ever 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.400
 has a very high expectation of 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.230
 distributor 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.990
 but I think they bet on a movie 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.330
 from the beginning and then it was super right 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.980
 the movie has incredible special effects 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.510
 has no future - that I realized and 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.820
 Everything is very beautiful and I think 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.860
 everyone should see the sensational 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.050
 fox congratulations institute waiting

 a success you have any other 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.780
 doubt about the movie or about the book
