these<00:03:29.600> bits

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
these bits

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.080 
these bits
facing<00:03:30.680> out<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.900> end<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.620> it's<00:03:34.160> almost<00:03:34.640> muth

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
facing out the end so it's almost muth

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.900 
facing out the end so it's almost muth
pieces<00:03:35.450> not<00:03:35.690> only<00:03:35.720> faced<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:37.130> you're<00:03:37.579> done

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
pieces not only faced and you're done

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.360 
pieces not only faced and you're done
and<00:03:39.519> lastly<00:03:40.519> have<00:03:40.820> I<00:03:41.739> showed<00:03:42.739> you<00:03:42.890> how<00:03:43.070> it<00:03:43.130> work

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
and lastly have I showed you how it work

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.740 
and lastly have I showed you how it work
and<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:44.150> made<00:03:44.720> some<00:03:45.700> alimony<00:03:46.700> or<00:03:46.820> cubes<00:03:47.390> and

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
and I made some alimony or cubes and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.380 
and I made some alimony or cubes and
they<00:03:48.350> are<00:03:48.500> very<00:03:48.739> very<00:03:49.100> strong<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.880> cannot

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
they are very very strong I cannot

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.699 
they are very very strong I cannot
squish<00:03:50.840> them<00:03:51.820> now<00:03:52.820> I<00:03:53.299> think<00:03:54.109> it<00:03:54.260> works<00:03:54.470> with

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
squish them now I think it works with

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.460 
squish them now I think it works with
paper<00:03:54.980> I'm<00:03:55.489> not<00:03:55.910> really<00:03:56.120> trying<00:03:56.480> never<00:03:57.200> ever

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
paper I'm not really trying never ever

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.910 
paper I'm not really trying never ever
tried<00:03:57.859> it<00:03:58.010> serve<00:03:58.310> things<00:03:58.790> right<00:03:59.299> right<00:03:59.570> now

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.410 

you<00:04:03.640> put<00:04:03.849> something<00:04:04.060> in<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.690> hole<00:04:05.940> as<00:04:06.940> I'm

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
you put something in the hole as I'm

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.140 
you put something in the hole as I'm
using<00:04:07.599> paper<00:04:07.930> right<00:04:08.200> now<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:09.489> then<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:09.970> put

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
using paper right now and then you put

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.509 
using paper right now and then you put
it<00:04:10.269> in<00:04:10.390> make<00:04:10.959> sure<00:04:10.989> it's<00:04:11.290> like<00:04:11.890> that<00:04:12.159> and<00:04:12.340> then

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
it in make sure it's like that and then

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.689 
it in make sure it's like that and then
you<00:04:12.670> just<00:04:14.549> squeeze<00:04:15.549> it<00:04:16.949> and<00:04:17.949> then<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:18.280> do<00:04:18.489> that

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
you just squeeze it and then you do that

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:34.219 
you just squeeze it and then you do that
with<00:04:18.970> some<00:04:19.239> other<00:04:19.510> pieces<00:04:19.720> table<00:04:32.580> relaxes

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
with some other pieces table relaxes

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:56.659 
with some other pieces table relaxes
then<00:04:35.229> you<00:04:35.789> push<00:04:36.789> it<00:04:36.820> down<00:04:54.150> push<00:04:55.150> it<00:04:55.180> down

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
then you push it down push it down

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.340 
then you push it down push it down
sometimes<00:04:57.669> parts<00:04:58.389> might<00:04:58.600> fall<00:04:58.840> off<00:04:59.020> but

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
sometimes parts might fall off but

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:14.370 
sometimes parts might fall off but
that's<00:04:59.590> okay<00:05:12.539> yeah<00:05:13.539> so<00:05:13.780> if<00:05:13.990> you<00:05:14.020> push<00:05:14.349> down

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
that's okay yeah so if you push down

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.110 
that's okay yeah so if you push down
really<00:05:14.919> really<00:05:15.010> really<00:05:15.340> hard

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
really really really hard

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.600 
really really really hard
it<00:05:16.300> will<00:05:16.690> um<00:05:17.530> compact<00:05:18.370> more<00:05:18.760> easily<00:05:20.580> put<00:05:21.580> this

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
it will um compact more easily put this

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:34.380 
it will um compact more easily put this
back<00:05:21.970> in<00:05:24.570> all<00:05:25.570> this

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.870 

what<00:05:35.390> isn't<00:05:35.540> it<00:05:35.720> going<00:05:35.990> in<00:05:39.220> and<00:05:40.220> you<00:05:40.490> need<00:05:40.700> to

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
what isn't it going in and you need to

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.710 
what isn't it going in and you need to
just<00:05:41.090> push<00:05:41.420> as<00:05:41.630> hard<00:05:41.660> as<00:05:42.080> you<00:05:42.230> can<00:05:42.500> and<00:05:42.940> then<00:05:43.940> to

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
just push as hard as you can and then to

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.940 
just push as hard as you can and then to
get<00:05:44.900> it<00:05:45.050> out<00:05:45.200> like<00:05:45.560> in<00:05:45.800> my<00:05:45.920> last<00:05:46.160> video<00:05:46.490> should

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
get it out like in my last video should

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.880 
get it out like in my last video should
you<00:05:48.950> put<00:05:49.250> your<00:05:49.690> compacting<00:05:50.690> thing<00:05:51.200> in<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:51.740> way

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
you put your compacting thing in the way

00:05:51.890 --> 00:06:00.270 
you put your compacting thing in the way
you<00:05:51.950> usually<00:05:52.460> would<00:05:52.850> take<00:05:53.330> off<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:53.600> bottom

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.890 

black<00:06:01.280> step<00:06:01.970> and<00:06:02.390> then<00:06:02.810> when<00:06:02.960> you<00:06:03.080> push<00:06:07.870> well<00:06:08.870> I

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
got to compact the cubes like I said I

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.300 
got to compact the cubes like I said I
can't<00:06:12.590> push<00:06:12.890> them<00:06:13.070> anymore<00:06:13.430> so<00:06:16.300> I've<00:06:17.300> got
