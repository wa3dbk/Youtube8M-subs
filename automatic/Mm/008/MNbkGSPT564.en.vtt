00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.649
 hello guys today 

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.380
 for comparison to the world 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.450
 some days 2 or 3 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.320
 today in the frame will be more we face it 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.010
 how will i talk more about these 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.780
 devices than show what will be 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.119
 going on them on the screen 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.119
 and probably a review could have been a draw 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.600
 these two devices are practically 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.250
 identical to iron here in both 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.550
 vehicles aids 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.990
 with a tear 410 video accelerator 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.359
 Adriano 306 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.710
 the screen resolution is 1280 by 720 the new one is 5 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.700
 inch we all know how 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.950
 4 and 7 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.330
 8 megapixel main camera 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.400
 front 2 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.520
 In general, the display device is very 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.470
 cool 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.910
 and he was angry just fine 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.479
 it was not visible to all 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:53.859
 brightness and it seemed to me that 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.310
 ulyanovo little more 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.390
 In general, I do not know the world 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.950
 but not such a big difference ie stock 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.070
 brightness to them 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.740
 I seemed a little bit Ulyanovsk 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.060
 more but in general 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.960
 early 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.550
 not that important 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.240
 also or otherwise a bit more by 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.150
 size 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.820
 the whole world 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.010
 a little less we can see 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.270
 and the new region is slightly longer 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.380
 and width 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.400
 but its a little thinner 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.530
 and he has a battery 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.770
 two 300 auction bears lead principle 100 million 5 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.840
 hours and not such a big difference 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.750
 we have a very fast internet in March 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.910
 surfing and 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.920
 surfing available 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.300
 great is a pleasure 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.970
 everything works fast 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.060
 Anna of both smarts can be played and 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.290
 tough 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.470
 certainly not at maximum 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.360
 settings 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.300
 but he is still early 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.240
 here all the work is urgent 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.230
 tons on that 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.200
 battery life 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.040
 as examples 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.770
 performance views can see 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.230
 in the reviews links will be 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.530
 in the description naturally 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.490
 battery life 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.100
 but the parade and about the same 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.910
 at full load it is a dead end citadel 50 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.130
 percent of screen brightness and included in 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.760
 iphone 4 hours and in this its it 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.709
 he's about there a little bit 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.709
 almost like new four hours 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.769
 ohh habitual use not 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.159
 both devices were enough for a day 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.429
 a lot of internet they have many games calls 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:28.800
 but some calls 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.180
 I mainly use the new one 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.929
 Internet on devices 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.130
 such a file is so mobile internet 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.349
 when rt 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.659
 but when they tell me my files 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.109
 in general, both devices kept the day 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.279
 that's not bad 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.529
 also worth mentioning 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.279
 phone sound is very good 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.079
 on the dynamics we are a little easier all the time 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:51.910
 than 2 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.220
 stereo speakers 0 otherwise 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.149
 but the sound is beautiful for this parade 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:58.540
 not a big difference 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.870
 loudness difference and i think we are from this 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.009
 can not be considered 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.099
 early 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.479
 maybe me 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.769
 it just seems that way 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.949
 defines upson services 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.249
 in the headphones of the words of his apparatus to all 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:14.239
 not written with 2 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.669
 and, perhaps 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.559
 all of them are a little better but there is 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.249
 headphone setting and list 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:22.439
 there is everything and pistons 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.529
 the second ones therefore 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:26.589
 it seemed at times that the sound was improved 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:28.409
 forces but at times it also seemed to me 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.369
 that the tooth is better 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.689
 on wine 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.599
 but it depended on music different music 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.709
 some song seemed to me better on 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.519
 otherwise some villages so here I 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.999
 also did not find the words big difference 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.219
 Lenovo sales can also be played with 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.029
 bass adjuster 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.400
 and surround sound in general there is no explicit 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:50.919
 winner a 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.209
 the same smartphones are about equal 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.929
 but such trust is a little bit long 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.039
 messed up 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.559
 and in daylight both devices experience 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:02.989
 about the same here and it turns out 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.129
 good enough 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.260
 I'm not saying that this is the perfect quality. 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.739
 new it turns out 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.439
 normal 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.629
 one 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.599
 pelevin bad enough lighting rub 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.329
 room when you know at home 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.009
 some light 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.400
 score or otherwise here seems to me by 5 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.320
 a little better 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.850
 but here's a flash photo in there 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.370
 darkness or twilight 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.110
 I'm clearly victorious here by the villages 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.300
 so lukoil aero 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.389
 up a huge cant with flash it turn yellow 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.180
 and photos are obtained 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.439
 what color is about how the machine itself 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.619
 about natural premiere photo can 

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:41.110
 convince kia well I will post to the group 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.529
 VKontakte reference also in the description 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.669
 In general, the Kalmyks of Rest look at 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.300
 i.e 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.190
 for the time being we are also not entirely clear with 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.620
 one side if itâ€™s better but if not 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.110
 consider services to us 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.919
 maybe better but here too 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.539
 the winners as such, I have not found 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.749
 generally 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:03.889
 when choosing from these two phones 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.710
 the apparatus itself 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.569
 Well, I think it's worth it to take this into account. 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:09.900
 appearance 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.900
 who likes what more personally 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.270
 I like it better and I wash it maybe 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.150
 I was even left with a plan of 8 x type 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.949
 from now on 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.150
 maybe 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.159
 the seller 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:25.529
 generally 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:27.639
 when choosing words but i think choose and 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:28.229
 children 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.699
 one that prefers victory in 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.439
 Basically if the room is important to note 0 3 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:34.070
 an inch 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.110
 then you can take the wine 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.189
 as smartphones practically 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:39.670
 equally this regret 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.319
 such uses 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.270
 really i was pleased with those whom 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.330
 I personally just have a smartphone more 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.429
 did you like those of him 

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:49.729
 yellow bright color 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.169
 to them in my hand as there I lie a little in 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.729
 London 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:54.879
 in general guys 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:57.279
 and thank you all for watching if 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.889
 like this format put huskies and I will 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.650
 shoot such videos more often 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.630
 subscribe to the channel join 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.180
 VKontakte group 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.250
 thank you all bye
