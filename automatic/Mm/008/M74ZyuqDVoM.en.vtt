00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
against Boston and it was good

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.609 
against Boston and it was good
performance<00:00:18.570> today<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.289> take<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
performance today so we have to take the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.490 
performance today so we have to take the
confidence<00:00:20.660> going<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:22.109> forward<00:00:22.410> now

confidence going out going forward now

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.470 
confidence going out going forward now
we<00:00:22.980> saw<00:00:23.100> right<00:00:23.490> after<00:00:23.550> halftime<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.420> to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
we saw right after halftime they have to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.790 
we saw right after halftime they have to
hammer<00:00:24.630> down<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.930> little<00:00:25.170> bit<00:00:25.320> they're<00:00:25.470> pushing

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
hammer down a little bit they're pushing

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.080 
hammer down a little bit they're pushing
hard<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.189> saw<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.369> real<00:00:26.550> character<00:00:27.029> of

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
hard but we saw the real character of

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.310 
hard but we saw the real character of
the<00:00:27.150> boys<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.330> perhaps<00:00:27.960> that's<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the boys and perhaps that's the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.140 
the boys and perhaps that's the
difference<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.800> year<00:00:28.859> between<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.369> side<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
difference this year between the side of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.870 
difference this year between the side of
this<00:00:30.330> year<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.720> last<00:00:30.750> year<00:00:30.960> yeah<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.890> dropped

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.330 
this year and last year yeah we dropped
off<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.420> had<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:33.690> finding<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:35.100> they're

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
off we had them finding out and they're

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.560 
off we had them finding out and they're
half<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.760> now<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.000> dropped<00:00:36.180> off<00:00:36.300> couple

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
