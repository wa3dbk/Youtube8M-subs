hey<00:00:00.750> there<00:00:00.960> Nate<00:00:01.319> again<00:00:01.469> today<00:00:02.429> we're<00:00:02.730> going

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
hey there Nate again today we're going

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.860 
hey there Nate again today we're going
to<00:00:02.970> be<00:00:03.060> discussing<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:04.020> aperture<00:00:04.740> works<00:00:05.870> so

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
to be discussing how aperture works so

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.740 
to be discussing how aperture works so
what<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.589> aperture<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.220> ask<00:00:08.660> well<00:00:09.660> I'm

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
what is the aperture you ask well I'm

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.330 
what is the aperture you ask well I'm
sure<00:00:09.960> you're<00:00:10.110> probably<00:00:10.320> thinking<00:00:10.950> it's<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
sure you're probably thinking it's the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.980 
sure you're probably thinking it's the
thing<00:00:11.580> with<00:00:11.700> all<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.059> little<00:00:12.269> blades<00:00:12.570> that

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
thing with all the little blades that

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.049 
thing with all the little blades that
close<00:00:13.769> up<00:00:14.009> together<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.580> make<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.880> little

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
close up together and make that little

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.480 
close up together and make that little
circle<00:00:15.389> no<00:00:16.199> actually<00:00:16.770> that's<00:00:16.949> called<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
circle no actually that's called the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.859 
circle no actually that's called the
iris<00:00:18.500> you<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.680> see<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.570> let's<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
iris you can see it let's get the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.480 
iris you can see it let's get the
reflection<00:00:22.439> right<00:00:24.230> there<00:00:25.250> right<00:00:26.250> there<00:00:26.400> at

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
reflection right there right there at

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.070 
reflection right there right there at
the<00:00:26.580> bottom<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> frame<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.630> see<00:00:27.689> some

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the bottom of the frame you can see some

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.500 
the bottom of the frame you can see some
of<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> blades<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.769> iris<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.330> not

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
of the blades of the iris that is not

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.110 
of the blades of the iris that is not
the<00:00:30.689> aperture<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:32.090> is<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:34.320> aperture<00:00:35.120> can

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the aperture this is the aperture can

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.760 
the aperture this is the aperture can
you<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> opening<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.020> closing<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.559> that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you see it opening and closing like that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.819 
you see it opening and closing like that
I'm<00:00:37.890> doing<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.280> over<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.670> my<00:00:38.820> thumb

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
I'm doing that over here with my thumb

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.389 
I'm doing that over here with my thumb
there's<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.920> little<00:00:41.190> lever<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:42.320> here<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
there's a little lever right here on the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.260 
there's a little lever right here on the
camera<00:00:44.719> and<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> slide<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:47.640> opens<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
camera and you slide and that opens and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.470 
camera and you slide and that opens and
closes<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.719> iris<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.530> create<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.969> aperture

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
closes the iris to create the aperture

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.170 
closes the iris to create the aperture
the<00:00:51.660> word<00:00:51.960> aperture<00:00:52.410> means<00:00:52.739> hope<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.579> mean<00:00:54.030> if

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the word aperture means hope I mean if

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.220 
the word aperture means hope I mean if
you<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> dictionary<00:00:54.899> it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you look it up in the dictionary it

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.740 
you look it up in the dictionary it
means<00:00:55.260> an<00:00:55.620> opening<00:00:56.039> or<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> hole<00:00:56.539> and<00:00:57.539> that's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
means an opening or a hole and that's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.779 
means an opening or a hole and that's
exactly<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.739> hole<00:00:59.010> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
exactly what this is it's a hole that

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.090 
exactly what this is it's a hole that
opens<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.750> closes<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.199> allows<00:01:01.590> light<00:01:01.859> into

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
opens and closes and allows light into

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.700 
opens and closes and allows light into
the<00:01:02.190> camera<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.239> that's<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.559> thing

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the camera so that's that's one thing

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.960 
the camera so that's that's one thing
that<00:01:04.739> confuses<00:01:05.189> many<00:01:05.369> people<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:05.909> think

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
that confuses many people as they think

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.789 
that confuses many people as they think
that<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> iris<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.990> actually<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> aperture

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that the iris is actually the aperture

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.289 
that the iris is actually the aperture
so<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:09.920> okay<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.729> guys<00:01:12.000> know

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
so now you know okay so as you guys know

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.830 
so now you know okay so as you guys know
the<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.619> aperture<00:01:14.070> system<00:01:14.280> works<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:15.299> in

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the way the aperture system works as in

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
the way the aperture system works as in
terms<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.320> breaking<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.770> down<00:01:16.890> into<00:01:16.950> stops<00:01:17.490> is

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
terms of breaking it down into stops is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.740 
terms of breaking it down into stops is
something<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.090> still<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.479> confused

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
something I'm still a little confused

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.990 
something I'm still a little confused
about<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.890> doesn't<00:01:20.220> however<00:01:20.640> mean<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.850> I

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
about that doesn't however mean that I

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.100 
about that doesn't however mean that I
don't<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.509> how<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> use<00:01:22.890> aperture<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.990> way

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
don't know how to use aperture the way

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.350 
don't know how to use aperture the way
you<00:01:25.170> use<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.920> look<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> number

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you use it is you look at the number

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
you use it is you look at the number
that<00:01:27.630> pops<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.170> your<00:01:28.229> camera<00:01:28.710> right<00:01:28.950> here

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that pops up on your camera right here

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.840 
that pops up on your camera right here
oh<00:01:30.680> oh<00:01:31.680> there<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
oh oh there it is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.149 
oh oh there it is
oh<00:01:32.880> went<00:01:33.750> out<00:01:33.869> right<00:01:35.630> right<00:01:36.630> there<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.770> too

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
oh went out right right there if too

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.539 
oh went out right right there if too
pointy<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.420> refers<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.770> size<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
pointy so that refers to the size of the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.469 
pointy so that refers to the size of the
opening<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:43.290> aperture<00:01:43.829> oh<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.700> what<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
opening of the aperture oh and what the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.929 
opening of the aperture oh and what the
eff<00:01:45.630> means<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.740> again<00:01:47.670> I'm<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:47.880> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
eff means is that again I'm not a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.980 
eff means is that again I'm not a
hundred<00:01:48.360> percent<00:01:48.509> sure<00:01:48.810> how<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.229> works<00:01:49.500> but

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
hundred percent sure how this works but

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.840 
hundred percent sure how this works but
the<00:01:51.990> reason<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.350> called<00:01:52.409> F<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the reason it's called F is it's the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.300 
the reason it's called F is it's the
measure<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.409> some<00:01:55.649> sort<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.920> ratio

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
measure it's it's some sort of ratio

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.760 
measure it's it's some sort of ratio
it's<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> measurement<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:58.229> actual

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it's the measurement of the actual

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.819 
it's the measurement of the actual
opening<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.750> actual<00:02:01.350> size<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
opening of the actual size of the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.340 
opening of the actual size of the
aperture<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.899> focal<00:02:03.899> length<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
aperture and the focal length of the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.230 
aperture and the focal length of the
lens<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.890> some<00:02:05.070> ratio<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> two<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.119> those

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
lens it's some ratio of the two of those

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.700 
lens it's some ratio of the two of those
and<00:02:06.450> that's<00:02:06.630> how<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.229> your<00:02:07.409> aperture

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
and that's how you get your aperture

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.850 
and that's how you get your aperture
number<00:02:08.209> that's<00:02:09.209> how<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.450> get<00:02:09.660> 2.8<00:02:10.259> because

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
number that's how you get 2.8 because

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.230 
number that's how you get 2.8 because
obviously<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.209> look<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.750> too

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
obviously if you look this is too

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.580 
obviously if you look this is too
point-eight<00:02:13.570> if<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.840> can<00:02:13.960> see<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.230> opening

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
point-eight if you can see that opening

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.730 
point-eight if you can see that opening
and<00:02:14.800> then<00:02:15.460> that's<00:02:16.090> 2.8<00:02:16.690> right<00:02:16.870> there<00:02:17.050> again<00:02:17.350> so

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and then that's 2.8 right there again so

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.830 
and then that's 2.8 right there again so
it's<00:02:17.920> obviously<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.460> much<00:02:18.790> bigger<00:02:19.090> opening<00:02:19.690> as

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
it's obviously a much bigger opening as

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.960 
it's obviously a much bigger opening as
you<00:02:19.870> zoom<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.650> zoom<00:02:20.680> out<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.280> because<00:02:21.700> of

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
you zoom in and zoom out just because of

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.640 
you zoom in and zoom out just because of
the<00:02:22.090> way<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.360> glass<00:02:22.540> magnifies<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.470> stuff

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
the way the glass magnifies and stuff

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.700 
the way the glass magnifies and stuff
and<00:02:23.800> as<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> zooms<00:02:24.250> in<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:26.290> that's<00:02:26.470> how<00:02:26.650> that

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
and as it zooms in but that's how that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.040 
and as it zooms in but that's how that
works<00:02:26.920> it's<00:02:27.190> some<00:02:27.400> mathematical<00:02:27.970> formula<00:02:28.570> I'm

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
works it's some mathematical formula I'm

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.660 
works it's some mathematical formula I'm
not<00:02:29.200> 100%<00:02:29.590> sure<00:02:29.830> what<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.250> but<00:02:30.520> it's

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
not 100% sure what it is but it's

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.660 
not 100% sure what it is but it's
something<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.150> do<00:02:31.300> with<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.170> actual<00:02:32.710> width<00:02:33.370> of

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
something to do with the actual width of

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.030 
something to do with the actual width of
the<00:02:33.910> opening<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.360> iris<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.680> focal

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
the opening of the iris and the focal

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.370 
the opening of the iris and the focal
length<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.430> lens<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.540> when<00:02:37.900> we're<00:02:38.140> at<00:02:38.170> f

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
length of the lens so when we're at f

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.730 
length of the lens so when we're at f
2.8<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.850> can<00:02:40.030> see<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:41.110> when<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.260> press<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
2.8 you can see that when I press the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.310 
2.8 you can see that when I press the
depth-of-field<00:02:42.040> button<00:02:42.640> right<00:02:42.820> here

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
depth-of-field button right here

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.500 
depth-of-field button right here
the<00:02:44.320> iris<00:02:44.650> doesn't<00:02:44.890> close<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:46.000> that's

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the iris doesn't close and that's

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.200 
the iris doesn't close and that's
because<00:02:47.050> it's<00:02:47.980> as<00:02:48.130> wide<00:02:48.340> open<00:02:48.610> as<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.850> can<00:02:49.030> go

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
because it's as wide open as it can go

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.240 
because it's as wide open as it can go
but<00:02:49.960> as<00:02:50.200> your<00:02:50.650> as<00:02:51.340> your<00:02:51.580> f<00:02:51.700> number<00:02:52.150> gets<00:02:52.420> larger

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
but as your as your f number gets larger

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.920 
but as your as your f number gets larger
so<00:02:54.250> let's<00:02:54.400> say<00:02:54.520> I<00:02:54.550> go<00:02:54.790> from<00:02:54.970> 2.8<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:56.220> 5.6<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
so let's say I go from 2.8 to 5.6 the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.380 
so let's say I go from 2.8 to 5.6 the
aperture<00:02:59.530> gets<00:02:59.860> smaller<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:00.850> watch<00:03:01.210> what

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
aperture gets smaller so watch what

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.370 
aperture gets smaller so watch what
happens<00:03:01.660> when<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.810> hit<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.080> depth-of-field

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
happens when I hit the depth-of-field

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.910 
happens when I hit the depth-of-field
button<00:03:02.860> now<00:03:03.810> can<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.870> see<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.410> the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
button now can you see and the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.410 
button now can you see and the
reflections<00:03:06.670> coming<00:03:06.820> off<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.120> windows<00:03:07.390> a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
reflections coming off the windows a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.320 
reflections coming off the windows a
little<00:03:07.600> hard<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.990> see<00:03:08.790> there<00:03:09.790> that's<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.150> little

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
little hard to see there that's a little

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.180 
little hard to see there that's a little
better<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.990> can<00:03:11.140> see<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.650> when<00:03:11.740> I<00:03:11.770> let<00:03:11.950> go<00:03:11.980> it

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
better you can see and when I let go it

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.460 
better you can see and when I let go it
opens<00:03:13.180> up<00:03:13.300> again<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.540> if<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.930> were<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.080> go<00:03:17.230> even

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
opens up again so if I were to go even

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.400 
opens up again so if I were to go even
further<00:03:17.680> down<00:03:18.040> let's<00:03:18.310> say<00:03:18.520> f/8<00:03:22.020> now<00:03:23.020> it's<00:03:23.230> even

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
further down let's say f/8 now it's even

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.580 
further down let's say f/8 now it's even
smaller<00:03:23.800> than<00:03:23.890> that<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:25.510> if<00:03:25.840> we<00:03:25.960> go<00:03:26.110> all<00:03:26.320> the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
smaller than that and if we go all the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.900 
smaller than that and if we go all the
way<00:03:26.620> as<00:03:26.770> far<00:03:26.890> as<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.220> sun's<00:03:27.460> will<00:03:27.580> go<00:03:27.700> which<00:03:27.880> is

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
way as far as the sun's will go which is

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.360 
way as far as the sun's will go which is
f-22<00:03:30.870> real<00:03:31.870> tiny<00:03:32.170> itty<00:03:32.590> bitty<00:03:32.890> little<00:03:33.100> hole

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
f-22 real tiny itty bitty little hole

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.600 
f-22 real tiny itty bitty little hole
right<00:03:33.580> there<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.680> that's<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.340> way<00:03:36.490> the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
right there so that's the way the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.540 
right there so that's the way the
numbering<00:03:37.000> system<00:03:37.240> works<00:03:37.630> in<00:03:38.230> in<00:03:38.860> terms<00:03:39.310> of

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
numbering system works in in terms of

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.210 
numbering system works in in terms of
the<00:03:39.730> size<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.270> hole<00:03:40.450> as<00:03:41.350> your<00:03:42.010> aperture

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
the size of the hole as your aperture

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.780 
the size of the hole as your aperture
number<00:03:42.790> gets<00:03:43.090> larger<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:44.710> opening<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.430> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
number gets larger the opening of the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.480 
number gets larger the opening of the
aperture<00:03:46.240> shrinks<00:03:47.200> that's<00:03:48.070> something<00:03:48.370> that

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
aperture shrinks that's something that

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.980 
aperture shrinks that's something that
confuses<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.000> lot<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.180> people<00:03:49.300> that<00:03:49.570> think<00:03:49.750> oh

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
confuses a lot of people that think oh

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.380 
confuses a lot of people that think oh
well<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:50.800> f<00:03:50.950> 2.8<00:03:51.460> it's<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.730> little<00:03:51.910> tiny<00:03:52.150> hole

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
well it's f 2.8 it's a little tiny hole

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.570 
well it's f 2.8 it's a little tiny hole
and<00:03:52.750> f-22<00:03:53.140> oh<00:03:53.380> it's<00:03:53.680> real<00:03:53.830> big<00:03:54.040> no<00:03:54.430> it's

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
and f-22 oh it's real big no it's

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.340 
and f-22 oh it's real big no it's
actually<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.970> other<00:03:55.120> way<00:03:55.300> around<00:03:55.420> if<00:03:55.750> 2.8<00:03:56.260> is

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
actually the other way around if 2.8 is

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.060 
actually the other way around if 2.8 is
a<00:03:56.380> big<00:03:56.620> hole<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:57.130> if<00:03:57.850> at<00:03:58.540> 22<00:03:59.050> is<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.320> tiny<00:03:59.680> tiny

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
a big hole and if at 22 is a tiny tiny

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.670 
a big hole and if at 22 is a tiny tiny
little<00:04:00.190> aperture<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.530> hopefully<00:04:02.530> that

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
little aperture so hopefully that

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.290 
little aperture so hopefully that
cleared<00:04:02.980> up<00:04:03.070> some<00:04:03.280> confusion<00:04:03.490> I'm<00:04:03.880> sure<00:04:04.120> why

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
cleared up some confusion I'm sure why

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.030 
cleared up some confusion I'm sure why
do<00:04:04.360> you<00:04:04.510> people<00:04:04.690> want<00:04:05.320> you<00:04:05.560> guys<00:04:05.710> out<00:04:05.860> their

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
do you people want you guys out their

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.080 
do you people want you guys out their
head<00:04:06.990> okay<00:04:07.990> so<00:04:08.590> how<00:04:08.920> does<00:04:08.980> aperture<00:04:09.640> work<00:04:09.850> in

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
head okay so how does aperture work in

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.980 
head okay so how does aperture work in
regard<00:04:10.600> to<00:04:11.410> making<00:04:12.400> your<00:04:12.790> pictures<00:04:13.300> different

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
regard to making your pictures different

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.370 
regard to making your pictures different
exposures<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:15.820> way<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.030> works<00:04:16.239> is<00:04:16.510> when

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
exposures the way it works is when

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.560 
exposures the way it works is when
you're<00:04:17.560> in<00:04:17.680> aperture<00:04:17.890> such<00:04:18.250> as

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
you're in aperture such as

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.990 
you're in aperture such as
2.8<00:04:19.110> it's<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.380> wider<00:04:19.620> aperture<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.730> bigger

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
2.8 it's a wider aperture and the bigger

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.330 
2.8 it's a wider aperture and the bigger
the<00:04:21.180> aperture<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.410> more<00:04:22.680> light<00:04:22.920> you<00:04:22.950> get

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
the aperture is the more light you get

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.980 
the aperture is the more light you get
in<00:04:23.520> through<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:23.820> lens<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.270> as<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.480> closes

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
in through the lens and as it closes

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.960 
in through the lens and as it closes
like<00:04:25.200> it's<00:04:25.830> smaller<00:04:26.160> less<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.640> less<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:26.910> less

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
like it's smaller less and less and less

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.020 
like it's smaller less and less and less
than<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.240> less<00:04:27.420> and<00:04:27.570> less<00:04:28.190> that's<00:04:29.190> why<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:29.550> only

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
than the less and less that's why I only

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.390 
than the less and less that's why I only
use<00:04:30.420> F<00:04:30.720> 2.8<00:04:31.260> lenses<00:04:31.650> because<00:04:31.890> I<00:04:31.920> do<00:04:32.100> a<00:04:32.130> lot<00:04:32.370> of

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
use F 2.8 lenses because I do a lot of

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.300 
use F 2.8 lenses because I do a lot of
low-light<00:04:32.880> shooting<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:34.500> as<00:04:34.830> I'm<00:04:35.010> sure<00:04:35.040> you

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
low-light shooting and as I'm sure you

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.890 
low-light shooting and as I'm sure you
guys<00:04:35.490> have<00:04:35.520> heard<00:04:36.060> me<00:04:36.180> mention<00:04:36.390> in<00:04:36.630> my<00:04:36.720> other

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
guys have heard me mention in my other

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.770 
guys have heard me mention in my other
videos<00:04:37.230> I<00:04:37.260> used<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.890> use<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.610> 55<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.330> 200

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
videos I used to use the 55 the 200

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.110 
videos I used to use the 55 the 200
millimeter<00:04:39.930> have<00:04:40.520> 45.6<00:04:41.520> lines<00:04:41.820> which<00:04:41.970> either

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
millimeter have 45.6 lines which either

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.460 
millimeter have 45.6 lines which either
floating<00:04:42.480> aperture<00:04:42.930> that<00:04:43.110> would<00:04:43.200> go<00:04:43.290> all<00:04:43.320> the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
floating aperture that would go all the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.380 
floating aperture that would go all the
way<00:04:43.560> down<00:04:44.000> to<00:04:45.000> 5.6<00:04:45.840> meaning<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:47.360> when<00:04:48.360> I

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
way down to 5.6 meaning that when I

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.200 
way down to 5.6 meaning that when I
would<00:04:48.690> shoot<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.170> photo<00:04:49.980> with<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.610> lens<00:04:50.850> on<00:04:51.180> a

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
would shoot a photo with that lens on a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.070 
would shoot a photo with that lens on a
football<00:04:51.600> field

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
football field

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.830 
football field
I<00:04:52.170> beat<00:04:52.740> f5<00:04:53.130> point<00:04:53.430> 6<00:04:53.760> if<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.420> were<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.600> zoom<00:04:54.630> all

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
I beat f5 point 6 if I were to zoom all

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.270 
I beat f5 point 6 if I were to zoom all
the<00:04:54.870> way<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.080> 200<00:04:55.560> millimeters<00:04:55.980> would<00:04:56.100> be<00:04:56.160> at

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
the way to 200 millimeters would be at

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.320 
the way to 200 millimeters would be at
f5<00:04:56.640> point<00:04:56.910> 6

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
f5 point 6

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.860 
f5 point 6
if<00:04:57.630> I<00:04:58.350> meant<00:04:58.620> 200<00:04:59.100> millimeters<00:04:59.580> on<00:04:59.790> my<00:05:00.000> 70<00:05:00.780> to

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
if I meant 200 millimeters on my 70 to

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.600 
if I meant 200 millimeters on my 70 to
200<00:05:01.020> millimeter<00:05:01.620> lens<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.040> I'm<00:05:02.100> shooting<00:05:02.310> on

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
200 millimeter lens and I'm shooting on

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.020 
200 millimeter lens and I'm shooting on
a<00:05:02.640> football<00:05:03.000> field<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:04.110> photo<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:04.740> 4<00:05:05.280> times

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
a football field that photo is 4 times

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.400 
a football field that photo is 4 times
brighter<00:05:07.190> then<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.790> photo<00:05:09.060> with<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:09.960> lens<00:05:10.260> at

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
brighter then the photo with the lens at

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.260 
brighter then the photo with the lens at
at<00:05:10.620> 5.6<00:05:11.280> so<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.800> smaller<00:05:13.800> your<00:05:14.070> F<00:05:14.670> number<00:05:14.970> is

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
at 5.6 so the smaller your F number is

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.900 
at 5.6 so the smaller your F number is
the<00:05:15.720> brighter<00:05:16.020> your<00:05:16.170> photos<00:05:16.710> are<00:05:16.890> and<00:05:17.100> as<00:05:17.670> it

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
the brighter your photos are and as it

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.330 
the brighter your photos are and as it
shrinks<00:05:18.450> so<00:05:18.690> does<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:19.560> amount<00:05:19.710> of<00:05:19.860> light<00:05:20.100> that

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
shrinks so does the amount of light that

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.810 
shrinks so does the amount of light that
comes<00:05:20.850> into<00:05:21.030> your<00:05:21.210> lens<00:05:22.010> okay<00:05:23.010> so<00:05:23.070> I<00:05:23.430> think

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
comes into your lens okay so I think

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.420 
comes into your lens okay so I think
that<00:05:23.970> just<00:05:24.300> about<00:05:24.420> does<00:05:24.570> it<00:05:24.840> for<00:05:25.280> everything<00:05:26.280> I

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
that just about does it for everything I

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.700 
that just about does it for everything I
need<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.640> tell<00:05:26.910> you<00:05:27.030> guys<00:05:27.180> about<00:05:27.510> how<00:05:28.110> aperture

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
need to tell you guys about how aperture

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.980 
need to tell you guys about how aperture
works<00:05:29.270> something's<00:05:30.270> telling<00:05:30.510> me<00:05:30.630> I<00:05:30.690> missed

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
works something's telling me I missed

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.140 
works something's telling me I missed
something<00:05:31.200> in<00:05:31.440> there<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:32.580> if<00:05:32.730> you<00:05:32.850> think<00:05:33.030> I

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
something in there so if you think I

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.990 
something in there so if you think I
missed<00:05:33.390> anything<00:05:33.660> please<00:05:34.620> let<00:05:34.830> me<00:05:34.980> know<00:05:35.160> and

I'll explain what I can for you like I

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.000 
I'll explain what I can for you like I
said<00:05:38.520> before<00:05:38.850> I'm<00:05:39.210> not<00:05:39.560> after<00:05:40.560> is<00:05:40.680> one<00:05:40.830> of<00:05:40.920> the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
said before I'm not after is one of the

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.650 
said before I'm not after is one of the
things<00:05:41.190> that<00:05:41.310> I'm<00:05:41.430> not<00:05:41.670> a<00:05:41.880> hundred<00:05:42.540> percent

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
things that I'm not a hundred percent

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.550 
things that I'm not a hundred percent
with<00:05:44.030> like<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.120> said<00:05:45.330> with<00:05:45.540> the<00:05:46.050> way<00:05:46.170> it<00:05:46.350> breaks

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
with like I said with the way it breaks

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.380 
with like I said with the way it breaks
