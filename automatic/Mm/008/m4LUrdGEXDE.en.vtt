 Chinese subtitle production by 悠澪

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Why every princess 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Need to have a prince 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.500
 This is an old-fashioned plot 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.000
 But I don't believe this set. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.500
 Why do you keep making assumptions? 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 Men can save the big picture 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 I can be a hero 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 In my own way 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
 Why should you limit yourself and hide? 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500
 After true love 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
 I've had enough! 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 I am who I am 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.200
 I don't need men 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 He was blinded by the medicine 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.500
 Lie on the liar 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.300
 I am really lucky. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.000
 Have small feet 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
 I got a hostage complex 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 You are a spoiled little devil. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000
 Have unique talents 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 But gave up 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
 Why should you limit yourself and hide? 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.000
 After true love 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.500
 I've had enough! 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 Please trust me 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 We don't need men 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 When you fall in love 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 Fascinated 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.300
 Nothing cares 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.800
 except him 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.500
 Pursue a dream 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.000
 Even seemingly ridiculous 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.500
 When you fall in love 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.000
 Life is like a song 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 All happy endings 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.500
 No error 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 But when something went wrong 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000
 It’s a sad thing, it’s reality. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Who knows... 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 I dream of a bold adventure 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.500
 Tour the world from east to west 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 And we just sit inside 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.000
 Trapped in the impression of the princess, but 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.300
 It’s time to let everyone know 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.500
 They are wrong 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.000
 We are strong 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 show out 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 Let go of the body! 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.000
 Why every princess 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.500
 Need to have a prince 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.000
 This is an old-fashioned plot 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.500
 But I don't believe this set. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.000
 Why do you keep making assumptions? 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.500
 Men can save the big picture 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.000
 We can be heroes 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.500
 In our own way 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 Why should you limit yourself and hide? 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.500
 After true love 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 I am who I am 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 I don't need a man! 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Anna: Aisha! We should go home! (-_-#)
