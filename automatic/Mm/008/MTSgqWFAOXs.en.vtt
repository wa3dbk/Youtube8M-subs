00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.710 
eat a lot a lot of cicadas oh so he's
still<00:02:35.209> moving

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
still moving

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.550

picking them up or anything maybe later

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.430 
picking them up or anything maybe later
but<00:02:46.760> what<00:02:46.880> do<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.270> do<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:47.930> remember<00:02:48.140> that

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
but what do you do you remember that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.530 
but what do you do you remember that
these<00:02:48.770> kind<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.400> coming<00:02:49.760> out<00:02:49.880> before<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.360> is

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
these kind of coming out before this is

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.210 
these kind of coming out before this is
17<00:02:50.959> years<00:02:50.989> isn't<00:02:51.380> it<00:02:51.560> do<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.739> remember<00:02:51.920> what

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
17 years isn't it do you remember what

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.930 
17 years isn't it do you remember what
they<00:02:52.340> sounded<00:02:52.730> like

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
they sounded like

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.970 
they sounded like
all<00:02:53.209> together<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.900> actually<00:02:54.200> hear<00:02:54.500> cicadas

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
all together you actually hear cicadas

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.420 
all together you actually hear cicadas
during<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> summer<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.650> they<00:02:57.650> will<00:02:57.860> be<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.250> lot

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
during the summer and they will be a lot

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.030 
during the summer and they will be a lot
of<00:02:58.459> cicadas<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.420> this<00:02:59.750> because<00:03:00.320> it's<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.560> 17

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
of cicadas but this because it's a 17

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.430 
of cicadas but this because it's a 17
year<00:03:01.220> brood<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:02.180> will<00:03:02.570> be<00:03:02.690> very<00:03:03.260> very

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
year brood this will be very very

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.590 
year brood this will be very very
intense<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.250> will<00:03:04.340> be<00:03:04.459> very<00:03:04.640> very<00:03:04.850> loud<00:03:05.150> and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
intense so will be very very loud and

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.300 
intense so will be very very loud and
just<00:03:05.630> think<00:03:05.989> only<00:03:06.290> half<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.770> them<00:03:06.920> are<00:03:07.010> making

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
just think only half of them are making

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.830 
just think only half of them are making
the<00:03:07.400> noise<00:03:07.580> because<00:03:07.850> only<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.270> male's<00:03:08.510> make

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the noise because only the male's make

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.010 
the noise because only the male's make
the<00:03:09.050> noise<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.970> is<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.300> how<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.630> come<00:03:11.840> out

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
the noise so is this how they come out

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.620 
the noise so is this how they come out
that's<00:03:12.560> backwards<00:03:13.070> I<00:03:13.640> find<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.239> most<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.570> the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
that's backwards I find that most of the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.560 
that's backwards I find that most of the
time<00:03:14.780> you're<00:03:14.930> coming<00:03:15.050> out<00:03:15.230> backwards<00:03:16.300> so<00:03:17.300> I

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
time you're coming out backwards so I

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.390 
time you're coming out backwards so I
mean<00:03:17.780> he<00:03:17.870> looks<00:03:18.080> kind<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.470> doesn't<00:03:19.100> know<00:03:19.220> what

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
mean he looks kind of doesn't know what

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.500 
mean he looks kind of doesn't know what
he's<00:03:19.489> doing

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
he's doing

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.420 
he's doing
no<00:03:20.959> he's<00:03:21.140> a<00:03:21.200> rather<00:03:21.380> confused<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:22.010> think<00:03:22.040> I

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
no he's a rather confused I think I

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.120 
no he's a rather confused I think I
think

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
think

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.830 
think
the<00:03:25.240> experts<00:03:26.240> said<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:26.480> they<00:03:26.810> should

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
the experts said that they should

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.600 
the experts said that they should
usually<00:03:27.590> not<00:03:27.770> come<00:03:27.950> out<00:03:28.070> for<00:03:28.310> another<00:03:28.460> week

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
usually not come out for another week

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.170 
usually not come out for another week
yeah<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:30.130> he's<00:03:31.130> not<00:03:31.280> quite<00:03:31.520> sure<00:03:31.550> why<00:03:31.910> he

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
yeah and then he's not quite sure why he

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.210 
yeah and then he's not quite sure why he
goes<00:03:32.420> but<00:03:32.990> he<00:03:33.260> says<00:03:33.440> maybe<00:03:33.620> because<00:03:34.010> we<00:03:34.100> have

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
goes but he says maybe because we have

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.310 
goes but he says maybe because we have
such<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.460> large<00:03:34.700> population<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.600> them<00:03:35.720> yeah

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
such a large population of them yeah

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.370 
such a large population of them yeah
they're<00:03:36.620> actually<00:03:37.010> look<00:03:37.160> here's<00:03:37.340> one<00:03:37.490> here

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
they're actually look here's one here

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.500 
they're actually look here's one here
come<00:03:39.380> on<00:03:39.470> over<00:03:39.500> here<00:03:40.150> do<00:03:41.150> we<00:03:41.240> have<00:03:41.270> such<00:03:41.480> a

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
come on over here do we have such a

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.360 
come on over here do we have such a
large<00:03:41.720> population<00:03:41.990> a<00:03:42.560> certain<00:03:43.070> percentage

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
large population a certain percentage

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.220 
large population a certain percentage
will<00:03:43.520> come<00:03:43.700> out<00:03:43.820> early<00:03:44.270> and<00:03:44.480> then<00:03:45.020> you're

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
will come out early and then you're

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.720 
will come out early and then you're
gonna<00:03:45.350> be<00:03:45.500> finding<00:03:45.860> more<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.070> more<00:03:46.220> in<00:03:46.610> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
gonna be finding more and more in the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.820 
gonna be finding more and more in the
next<00:03:46.940> week<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.150> ten<00:03:47.480> days<00:03:47.510> they<00:03:48.410> were<00:03:48.470> gonna<00:03:48.650> be

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
next week to ten days they were gonna be

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.600 
next week to ten days they were gonna be
really<00:03:48.980> overpopulated<00:03:49.910> here<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.340> think<00:03:52.520> a

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
really overpopulated here so you think a

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.180 
really overpopulated here so you think a
week<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.940> ten<00:03:53.150> days<00:03:53.530> ten<00:03:54.530> days<00:03:54.590> he<00:03:54.890> says<00:03:55.040> you're

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
week to ten days ten days he says you're

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.330 
week to ten days ten days he says you're
gonna<00:03:55.250> be<00:03:55.370> swarming
