00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:14.099
 cds pp today I'm going to teach you 11 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.590
 radios that spend a video these days in 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.470
 facebook and generated the biggest controversy a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.350
 guy wanting to sell you a brand 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.980
 hacker for diamond for coins that in 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.300
 truth does not exist in the game is actually 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.730
 that ghost ghost is called 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.090
 coins and diamonds then it is as if 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:43.079
 had fallen into the account more or less 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.270
 999 thousand diamonds in coins or more up to 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.879
 depends on the bill 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.850
 there he launched on facebook saying that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.219
 I would sell the packages with hackers to guys 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.379
 but in fact he was lying then 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.780
 I'll prove to you how this is a lie. 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.079
 I'll use the application here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.760
 the sbm hacker application and I will type the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.010
 number of coins 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.270
 I'm not going to make diamonds because it's 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.430
 I need to spend 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 man was the diamond to be able to avoid 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.590
 modifying the coins but in fact 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.060
 this is only illusion then understood that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.060
 enter here the number of coins 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.280
 is searching the number of coins 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.930
 You see, right down there 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.560
 a lot of keys, right? 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:51.530

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:53.260
 he succeeded is to search eco is ChÃ¡vez 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.300

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.190

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.080
