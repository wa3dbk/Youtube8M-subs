00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello everyone with you internet resources on 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.100
 review dot com today we look at 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.919
 negative from intel this company 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.570
 intel ssd model 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.740
 530 in general, the test goes and we do not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.630
 scheduled 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.299
 It comes out due to the fact that on the test 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.920
 stand broke on the disk adata from s900 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.170
 This is one of the first drives that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.570
 tested at all confirmed by the boss 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.570
 this is a disc work we have almost trigon 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.130
 and in the 12th year he went out and worked in 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.500
 mainly format 24 7 that is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.390
 around the clock at a constant load 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.700
 here he worked for about three years 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 By the way, the first disk that failed for 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.719
 all the time of our testing and so 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.719
 returning to the intel disk 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.790
 the moment it costs us 8900 rubles and up 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.829
 set foot on it in our low options 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.110
 execution depending on the amount of memory 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.890
 it also has a different format but both 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.020
 all details 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.840
 In general, as I said, this disk is built 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.690
 on san Farsi and he became continuation of 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.370
 line 520 is quite popular 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.620
 rulers can this be said flagship 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.350
 ruler generally on the market for 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.519
 on the labor market technicians and here we are 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.549
 control selected with FSF 2280 11 force 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.270
 but here we are a company attempt 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.280
 breathe into this chip controller 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.340
 new life here on the basics of setting and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.950
 In general, in this plane 530 emphasis is placed 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.600
 masses on cost reduction 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.580
 but it uses all the same 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.740
 quality components intel guarantee 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.530
 for five years and reduced 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.960
 power consumption is available this drive 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 will be in several excitement index this is 8 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.600
 gigabyte 120 gigabyte one hundred eighty 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.420
 two hundred forty 360 and 480 company 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.549
 refused to drive to the headquarters 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.500
 24 hours now the wheels are cheaper but also 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.500
 still speaks objectively for the system 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.700
 there will be a lack of cutter speed 80 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.619
 would make sense 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.970
 remove by the way depending on 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.100
 increasing our volume is growing and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.610
 performance our drive is located 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.259
 about average speed 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.600
 read and write is the maximum bracket 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.100
 but average for speed 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.799
 random read record 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.439
 so here is 544 190 stated 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.039
 disk drive live for available 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.739
 format m 100 m2 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.599
 here about the same speeds they are not 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.980
 different from those here 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.379
 choose naturally for your 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.260
 preferences comes the drive in bright and 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.319
 interesting form on the package inside everything 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.810
 secured and secured in a package of 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.569
 unpainted cardboard is itself actually 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.519
 drive this quinoa salad three and a half 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.730
 inches is a set of screws 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:39.709
 this power adapter from molex she Sato 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:44.569
 This is a plastic plate to increase 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.299
 disc thickness of 7 to 9 millimeters is also in 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.489
 we have a warranty card sticker disc 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.150
 with software 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.609
 that's all we have and that's all 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.169
 and so the disc got executed in 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.540
 metal case with an interesting 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:01.819
 we have screws here 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.489
 on top and in one of the corners 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.769
 such a small curved sticker 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.870
 hiding by the way another screw when 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.530
 trying to disassemble naturally and the sticker 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.750
 will be torn and we will lose warranty on 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.810
 we have a sticker on the back 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.269
 with technical information and on the side 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.569
 parts naturally plain sata connector 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.139
 disc thickness without lining 7 millimeters 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.540
 this is enough to install 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:33.079
 drive ultrabooks or in some special 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.359
 systems with small thickness and and of course 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.030
 the most interesting thing about any pyrotechnics 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.299
 this stuffing under the cover of us is hiding 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.870
 motherboard with a new intel design here 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.299
 us all chips are labeled intel m but 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.239
 in fact here is the controller after all 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:54.919
 intel intel doesn't make controllers it 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:57.290
 chip sandforce sf 2281 is by the way 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.859
 manifest labeling power site there 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.370
 the end 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:05.419
 and here we are talking about revision controller 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.239
 both are 0 and different from normal 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:10.549
 this chip he gained us support 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.900
 able to div slip what does it give it 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.879
 deep sleep with fall 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.229
 energy consumption but at the same time 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.850
 disk performance left 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:19.400
 still high 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.990
 this sanford has built in 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.420
 it does not require a buffer for its work 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.410
 use of additional memory all 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.590
 other chips 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.950
 which is on this dress and this board 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.090
 this is flash memory installed here 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.420
 intel chips 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.030
 they contain within themselves two crystals with 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.520
 interface and made not the intel 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.760
 meanness on meter technology this 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.590
 by the way one more difference from ssd 520 there 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.720
 was used 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.730
 25 per meter process and beyond 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.940
 cheaper production actually 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.150
 us diminished and the area is the same 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.930
 by design and construction it is very similar 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.980
 on intel ssd 520 judging by the photos 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.570
 if we talk about technical 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.320
 the characteristics here on here are bright 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.340
 last charge rate 540 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:13.490
 speed saved a consistent 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:16.580
 record 490 of this disk in disk 520 this 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.290
 these speeds were low 550 and 520 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.370
 tyson naturally we will have and 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.740
 cheaper and 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.050
 only the phenomenon also said regretfully 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.060
 process I propose to connect this drive 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.890
 test bench and look at the data 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.430
 aesthetically tests and see how he does 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:35.860
 works for us if we sum up 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:39.680
 intel ssd 530 then this embodiment already 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.050
 frequently tested sanford chip 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.280
 i'm sandforce like this one of the most 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.470
 quick 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.150
 traitors nikov well and they really 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.630
 reliable but if you take it of course 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.550
 a-data 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.650
 Intel has managed to create an interesting and 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.840
 attractive ruler it is available and 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.580
 cheaper in cost but of course 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.400
 all the same disk is a little bit 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.190
 more expensive than the offer from competitor 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.280
 my more expensive only solution from samsung 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.350
 but samsung is a copy of samsung and intel 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.720
 Still, I like the intel disk 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.460
 recalled with the father was intel ssd 530 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.750
 pavement itself will discuss this model with you 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.490
 comments signature our channel ahead 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.150
 many many interesting thanks to all and 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.150
 bye Bye
