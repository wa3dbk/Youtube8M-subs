a<00:02:35.150> rattle<00:02:35.540> because<00:02:35.810> they're<00:02:35.989> opposed<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.319> be

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
a rattle because they're opposed to be

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.490 
a rattle because they're opposed to be
like<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.860> young<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:38.750> really<00:02:38.989> cute<00:02:39.230> I'm
