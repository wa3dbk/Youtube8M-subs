00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.259
 the timing but there are should 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.329
 to be all within the book I vi 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.439
 I remember that Renato Cervo and head chef 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.359
 escape capaska ok at dawn in black 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.009
 of moso and therefore this week 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.629
 together he would look for some 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.940
 deepen those that are 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.280

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.299
 Trentino Alto Adige 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.500
 then we do this job more than 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.730
 another to make it more pleasant 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.319

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.549
 which are the nerves and tendons 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.410
 we lower it slightly to the bone like this 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.590
 during cooking the meat will go to 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.239
 there was a ripple and a row left us 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.760
 something that will surely look like 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.110
 better then this could be 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.840
 a gift to make yours 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.450

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.519
 furnishing a centerpiece something 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.549

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.799
 decorate with a little imagination 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.530
