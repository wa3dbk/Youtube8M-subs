00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.140 

i'm<00:02:43.190> going<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.430> change<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:43.820> i'm<00:02:44.000> probably

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
i'm going to change this i'm probably

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.570 
i'm going to change this i'm probably
going<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.420> get<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.810> up<00:02:44.960> to<00:02:45.790> maybe<00:02:47.650> 4.50<00:02:48.650> or<00:02:49.010> just

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
going to get it up to maybe 4.50 or just

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.750 
going to get it up to maybe 4.50 or just
up<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.880> solid<00:02:50.150> solid<00:02:50.720> four<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.640> only

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
up to the solid solid four and only

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.690 
up to the solid solid four and only
reason<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.240> is<00:02:53.300> at<00:02:53.770> 7.9<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:55.100> not<00:02:55.190> at<00:02:55.340> seven

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
reason this is at 7.9 and not at seven

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.220 
reason this is at 7.9 and not at seven
or<00:02:55.880> seven<00:02:56.180> point<00:02:56.360> eight<00:02:56.480> not<00:02:56.720> seven<00:02:56.750> point

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
or seven point eight not seven point

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.710 
or seven point eight not seven point
nine<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:58.180> because<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.890> cpu<00:03:01.310> CPU<00:03:02.210> whatever<00:03:02.510> is

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
nine is because the cpu CPU whatever is

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.560 
nine is because the cpu CPU whatever is
not<00:03:02.990> overclocked<00:03:03.500> currently<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:05.330> let's<00:03:05.480> see

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
not overclocked currently so let's see

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.410 
not overclocked currently so let's see
that's<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.810> only<00:03:05.960> reason<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:08.420> processor<00:03:10.420> so

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
that's the only reason the processor so

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.950 
that's the only reason the processor so
yeah<00:03:11.570> that's<00:03:11.720> just<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.230> computer<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.100> far<00:03:13.960> my

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
yeah that's just the computer so far my

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.610 
yeah that's just the computer so far my
first<00:03:15.230> computer<00:03:15.380> build<00:03:16.870> how<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.900> built<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.380> I

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
first computer build how I built this I

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.200 
first computer build how I built this I
just<00:03:18.770> originally<00:03:19.160> saw<00:03:19.280> someone<00:03:19.670> make<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.000> video
