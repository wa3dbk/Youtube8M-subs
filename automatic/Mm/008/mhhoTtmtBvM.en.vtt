 hello friends with you again and today I am 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.620
 tell you how to export our channels 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:13.280
 import their property designer 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.929
 for our last job in the printer 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.550
 let's start the export file 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:22.160
 configuration 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.099
 so we have ready-made presets with you 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 let's create your preset let's call it 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:38.130
 squat so here we have cards gray 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.750
 orgy by our plus g plus b but we will create 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:45.660
 with you a g b let's call him 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.770
 bass put the point and then choose 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.330
 texture set and now when exporting 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.190
 textures we will have started bass with 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.890
 dash and then there will be their side of the site 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.030
 named texture set 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.859
 connect with rgb searched now see that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.770
 us purple violet shows where 

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:10.310
 what is also done for the rest of our 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.310
 channels 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.390
 so as for normal then if we are with 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.970
 you are the norm drag from here 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.729
 then it will export from our 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.650
 channel which is listed here that is with 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.600
 our 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.150
 there must be a Chinar supposedly for this 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.310
 so we donâ€™t have her 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:48.940
 surpassed normal we will choose ready 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:02:01.660

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.990
 physics from metallic glad our 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.290
 resolution 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.700
 ok so now 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.910

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.250
 choose body we now have ours 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.660
 maps because we pointed the folder here 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.420
 there in the preferences 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.420
 but first we need only normal and 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:56.040
 Heyd for what it is we will create with 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.980
 you ambient occlusion and in short 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.799
 we will need for our later 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.829
 create smart material next lesson 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:11.120
 I will talk about sports materials 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:19.979
 then we choose shorter formulas here and 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:22.290
 ambient occlusion here now if we 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.900
 open we see that the map was created shorter 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:30.300
 but it is not very bright so we remove 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:33.810
 what intensity is a fireplace and click 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:38.050
 save i already saved so i will delete 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:44.020
 and shorter bitmap 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.789
 and here it will also make Klyushin 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.500
 smaller because it was created very 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:56.590
 big shadow and we made 03 not so smart 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:05:01.440
 and click save amber is surrounded by everything 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:04.599
 save the cards now if we are with you 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:10.090

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:13.930
 we take our normal body also import 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.539
 image furs 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:21.099

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:26.319
 we can choose body magazine with you 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:29.110
 Here you are now asked to sim 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.520
 turn off even we will be less lion from 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.550
 must have stood 42 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.370
 but basically nothing has changed 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.830
 besides this is possible by fine restaurant 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.919
 programs like crazy pampa increase 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.710
 intensity is normal and it will be the same 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.310
 bulging like there was them genta plus 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.310
