00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
if you're gonna play meta I think the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.060 
if you're gonna play meta I think the
only<00:00:47.090> two<00:00:47.360> choices<00:00:47.540> you<00:00:47.870> have<00:00:47.899> our<00:00:48.380> neck<00:00:48.860> cause

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
only two choices you have our neck cause

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.250 
only two choices you have our neck cause
and<00:00:49.489> clipboards<00:00:50.149> I<00:00:50.360> don't<00:00:50.690> include<00:00:50.899> burning

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
and clipboards I don't include burning

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.069 
and clipboards I don't include burning
abyss<00:00:51.410> in<00:00:51.590> there<00:00:51.739> because<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:53.510> don't<00:00:53.899> think

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
abyss in there because I don't think

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.030 
abyss in there because I don't think
they're<00:00:54.200> strong<00:00:54.380> enough<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.649> compete<00:00:54.890> right

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
they're strong enough to compete right

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.760 
they're strong enough to compete right
now<00:00:55.190> even<00:00:55.489> with<00:00:55.670> traps<00:00:56.270> I<00:00:56.600> think<00:00:57.260> they<00:00:57.380> require

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
now even with traps I think they require

the new set and there another their last
five<00:01:01.610> cards<00:01:01.969> think<00:01:02.180> that<00:01:02.300> require<00:01:02.540> those<00:01:02.690> last

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
five cards think that require those last

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.319 
five cards think that require those last
five<00:01:03.020> cards<00:01:03.410> even<00:01:03.620> be<00:01:03.860> semi<00:01:04.280> viable<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.269> if

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
five cards even be semi viable so if

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:06.429

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
another video but that deck is so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.349 
another video but that deck is so
complicated<00:01:22.520> it's<00:01:22.850> way<00:01:23.029> more<00:01:23.060> complicated

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
complicated it's way more complicated

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.359 
complicated it's way more complicated
than<00:01:23.689> I<00:01:23.840> ever<00:01:23.869> thought<00:01:24.049> it<00:01:24.200> was<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:25.069> to<00:01:25.189> think

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
than I ever thought it was you to think

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.919 
than I ever thought it was you to think
of<00:01:25.459> so<00:01:25.579> many<00:01:25.639> things<00:01:25.789> and<00:01:26.209> the<00:01:26.450> better<00:01:26.659> player

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
of so many things and the better player

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.179 
of so many things and the better player
is<00:01:27.109> almost<00:01:27.350> always<00:01:27.529> going<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.829> win<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.009> mere

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
is almost always going to win the mere

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.649 
is almost always going to win the mere
match<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:28.670> besides<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:29.179> fact<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.389> it's<00:01:29.479> like

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
match so besides the fact that it's like

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.679 
match so besides the fact that it's like
super<00:01:29.959> expensive<00:01:30.549> just<00:01:31.549> if<00:01:31.819> you're<00:01:32.149> not<00:01:32.270> smart

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
super expensive just if you're not smart

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.539 
super expensive just if you're not smart
enough<00:01:32.749> to<00:01:32.990> play<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.319> then<00:01:33.499> I<00:01:33.859> would<00:01:34.219> not

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
enough to play it then I would not

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.059 
enough to play it then I would not
suggest<00:01:35.090> plain<00:01:35.869> it<00:01:36.109> um<00:01:36.289> cliff<00:01:36.679> boards<00:01:36.920> are<00:01:37.039> a

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
suggest plain it um cliff boards are a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.589 
suggest plain it um cliff boards are a
lot<00:01:37.219> more<00:01:37.249> linear<00:01:37.639> they're<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.450> lot<00:01:38.539> more

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:38.599 
lot more linear they're a lot more

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.469 
lot more linear they're a lot more
easily<00:01:39.380> stopped<00:01:40.219> I<00:01:40.579> mean<00:01:41.149> there's<00:01:41.299> still<00:01:41.359> a

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
easily stopped I mean there's still a

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.940 
easily stopped I mean there's still a
good<00:01:41.599> deck<00:01:41.779> i'm<00:01:41.959> not<00:01:42.079> saying<00:01:42.289> skill<00:01:42.740> list

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
good deck i'm not saying skill list

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.769 
good deck i'm not saying skill list
nothing<00:01:43.520> no<00:01:43.669> deck<00:01:43.849> is<00:01:43.939> really<00:01:44.119> autopilot<00:01:44.599> but

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:44.779 
nothing no deck is really autopilot but

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:48.069 
nothing no deck is really autopilot but
Clifford's<00:01:45.319> obviously<00:01:46.069> have<00:01:46.639> way<00:01:46.969> less<00:01:46.999> of<00:01:47.599> a

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
Clifford's obviously have way less of a

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.899 
Clifford's obviously have way less of a
learning<00:01:48.469> curve<00:01:48.709> and<00:01:49.310> if<00:01:49.579> you're<00:01:49.700> gonna<00:01:49.789> play

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
learning curve and if you're gonna play

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.149 
learning curve and if you're gonna play
meta<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:50.419> you're<00:01:50.869> not<00:01:50.990> like<00:01:51.229> quite<00:01:51.740> good<00:01:52.009> at

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
meta and you're not like quite good at

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.309 
meta and you're not like quite good at
thinking<00:01:52.759> eight<00:01:53.270> turns<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.959> or<00:01:54.139> eight

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
thinking eight turns in it or eight

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.499 
thinking eight turns in it or eight
plays<00:01:54.649> in<00:01:54.919> advance<00:01:55.279> just<00:01:55.969> flight<00:01:56.149> cliff<00:01:56.329> or

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
plays in advance just flight cliff or

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.719 
plays in advance just flight cliff or
it's<00:01:56.599> like<00:01:56.749> that's<00:01:56.869> why<00:01:57.109> easier<00:01:57.579> if<00:01:58.579> you're

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
it's like that's why easier if you're

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.459 
it's like that's why easier if you're
not<00:01:58.939> playing<00:01:59.270> one<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.509> those<00:01:59.719> two<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:00.380> you

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
not playing one of those two so you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.809 
not playing one of those two so you
don't<00:02:00.619> wanna<00:02:00.770> play<00:02:00.859> meta<00:02:01.069> you're<00:02:01.669> a<00:02:01.700> little

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
don't wanna play meta you're a little

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.870 
don't wanna play meta you're a little
bit<00:02:02.029> more<00:02:02.090> budget<00:02:02.539> um<00:02:02.779> I<00:02:03.679> mean<00:02:04.459> I<00:02:04.549> hate<00:02:04.669> using

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
bit more budget um I mean I hate using

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.089 
bit more budget um I mean I hate using
that<00:02:05.090> because<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:06.289> other<00:02:06.380> two<00:02:06.619> choices<00:02:06.829> are

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
that because the other two choices are

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:08.950 
that because the other two choices are
both<00:02:07.429> rogue<00:02:07.759> decks<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.390> hate<00:02:08.630> saying<00:02:08.869> that

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
both rogue decks and I hate saying that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.200 
both rogue decks and I hate saying that
only<00:02:09.229> budget<00:02:10.100> players<00:02:10.310> play<00:02:10.610> rogue<00:02:10.820> decks<00:02:11.060> but

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
only budget players play rogue decks but

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.809 
only budget players play rogue decks but
that's<00:02:11.390> kind<00:02:11.600> of<00:02:11.630> like<00:02:11.810> usually<00:02:12.470> road<00:02:13.010> X<00:02:13.280> cost

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
that's kind of like usually road X cost

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.989 
that's kind of like usually road X cost
less<00:02:13.969> because<00:02:14.239> they're<00:02:14.510> not<00:02:14.629> meta<00:02:15.159> but<00:02:16.159> uh<00:02:16.189> the

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:16.999 
less because they're not meta but uh the

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.670 
less because they're not meta but uh the
only<00:02:17.030> two<00:02:17.299> rogue<00:02:17.510> decks<00:02:17.719> I<00:02:17.900> think<00:02:18.290> are<00:02:18.469> viable

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
only two rogue decks I think are viable

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.039 
only two rogue decks I think are viable
are<00:02:19.189> volcanic<00:02:19.639> sand<00:02:20.150> ritual<00:02:20.599> beasts<00:02:20.780> and

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
are volcanic sand ritual beasts and

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.619 
are volcanic sand ritual beasts and
that's<00:02:21.379> not<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:22.099> because<00:02:23.060> those<00:02:23.389> are<00:02:23.510> there

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
that's not just because those are there

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.360 
that's not just because those are there
two<00:02:23.780> rogue<00:02:23.959> Dexta<00:02:24.349> i'm<00:02:24.530> personally<00:02:25.069> playing

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
two rogue Dexta i'm personally playing

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.699 
two rogue Dexta i'm personally playing
because<00:02:26.269> i<00:02:26.420> play<00:02:26.599> a<00:02:26.629> variety<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:27.049> road<00:02:27.260> x<00:02:27.469> but

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
because i play a variety of road x but

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.759 
because i play a variety of road x but
like<00:02:27.859> I<00:02:28.239> think<00:02:29.239> right<00:02:29.540> now<00:02:29.749> volcanics<00:02:30.379> are<00:02:30.560> the

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
like I think right now volcanics are the

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.330 
like I think right now volcanics are the
perfect<00:02:31.250> rogue<00:02:31.730> deck<00:02:31.969> I<00:02:32.180> made<00:02:32.629> a<00:02:32.659> deck<00:02:32.959> profile

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
perfect rogue deck I made a deck profile

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.770 
perfect rogue deck I made a deck profile
last<00:02:34.340> week<00:02:34.639> or<00:02:34.819> something<00:02:35.150> about<00:02:35.359> talking

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
last week or something about talking

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.140 
last week or something about talking
about<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:36.099> but<00:02:37.099> volcanics<00:02:37.549> of<00:02:37.639> everything

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
about that but volcanics of everything

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.970 
about that but volcanics of everything
so<00:02:38.359> they<00:02:38.480> don't<00:02:38.689> lose<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:39.049> pretty<00:02:39.500> much<00:02:39.680> any

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
so they don't lose to pretty much any

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.550 
so they don't lose to pretty much any
floodgate<00:02:40.790> besides<00:02:41.269> macro<00:02:41.810> Andy<00:02:42.049> Fisher<00:02:42.230> um

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
floodgate besides macro Andy Fisher um

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.670 
floodgate besides macro Andy Fisher um
they<00:02:43.519> don't<00:02:43.700> lose<00:02:43.909> to<00:02:44.329> a<00:02:44.780> lot<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.349> floodgate

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
they don't lose to a lot of floodgate

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.860 
they don't lose to a lot of floodgate
removal<00:02:46.189> on<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.329> play<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.780> many

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
removal on you you play so many

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.409 
removal on you you play so many
continuous<00:02:48.469> traps<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:49.010> like<00:02:49.189> MST<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:49.969> just<00:02:50.150> not

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:50.419 
continuous traps so like MST is just not

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.420 
continuous traps so like MST is just not
good<00:02:50.659> enough<00:02:50.689> so<00:02:51.049> they<00:02:51.169> have<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.379> have<00:02:51.469> like<00:02:52.069> so

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
good enough so they have to have like so

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.550 
good enough so they have to have like so
many<00:02:52.549> other<00:02:52.790> things<00:02:53.120> um<00:02:53.419> you<00:02:54.169> can<00:02:54.319> sit<00:02:54.530> on

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
emptiness very well you don't really

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.050 
emptiness very well you don't really
care<00:02:56.840> about<00:02:56.900> if<00:02:57.079> your<00:02:57.199> opponent<00:02:57.730> goes<00:02:58.730> first

don't<00:03:34.489> is<00:03:35.349> extreme<00:03:36.349> consistency<00:03:37.189> I<00:03:37.459> mean

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
don't is extreme consistency I mean

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.719 
don't is extreme consistency I mean
really<00:03:38.810> once<00:03:39.379> you<00:03:39.530> get<00:03:39.650> past<00:03:39.709> turn<00:03:40.099> 3<00:03:40.459> if

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:40.729 
really once you get past turn 3 if

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.580 
really once you get past turn 3 if
you're<00:03:40.849> still<00:03:41.120> alive<00:03:41.449> with<00:03:41.750> volcanics<00:03:42.319> you

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
you're still alive with volcanics you

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.990 
you're still alive with volcanics you
just<00:03:42.769> win<00:03:42.979> because<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:43.340> have<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:43.849> much

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
just win because you have so much

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.619 
just win because you have so much
drawing<00:03:44.389> you<00:03:45.109> have<00:03:45.199> so<00:03:45.439> much<00:03:45.759> just<00:03:46.759> resilience

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
drawing you have so much just resilience

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.719 
drawing you have so much just resilience
to<00:03:47.840> your<00:03:47.989> opponent's<00:03:48.349> plays<00:03:48.590> um<00:03:48.919> and<00:03:49.340> that's

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:49.729 
to your opponent's plays um and that's

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.429 
to your opponent's plays um and that's
when<00:03:49.909> you<00:03:50.000> start<00:03:50.329> looping<00:03:50.479> scatter<00:03:50.930> shots<00:03:51.229> and

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 
when you start looping scatter shots and

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.649 
when you start looping scatter shots and
you<00:03:51.500> just<00:03:51.590> gets<00:03:51.769> ridiculous<00:03:52.250> but<00:03:53.060> once<00:03:53.540> you

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
you just gets ridiculous but once you

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.390 
you just gets ridiculous but once you
get<00:03:53.870> past<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.169> turn<00:03:54.409> 3<00:03:54.530> marked<00:03:54.799> you<00:03:54.919> you're

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
get past that turn 3 marked you you're

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.069 
get past that turn 3 marked you you're
drawing<00:03:55.609> like<00:03:55.849> eight<00:03:56.090> cards<00:03:56.479> of<00:03:56.599> return<00:03:56.900> I

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
drawing like eight cards of return I

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.339 
drawing like eight cards of return I
know<00:03:57.199> why<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.530> say<00:03:57.829> eight<00:03:58.099> um<00:03:58.959> people<00:03:59.959> are<00:04:00.079> like

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
know why I say eight um people are like

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.860 
know why I say eight um people are like
that's<00:04:01.159> that's<00:04:01.849> an<00:04:02.000> exaggeration<00:04:02.239> it's

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
that's that's an exaggeration it's

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.399 
that's that's an exaggeration it's
really<00:04:03.109> not<00:04:03.259> because<00:04:03.650> you're<00:04:03.769> drawing<00:04:03.979> a

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
really not because you're drawing a

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.569 
really not because you're drawing a
release<00:04:06.409> your<00:04:06.560> thinning<00:04:07.129> back<00:04:07.310> by<00:04:07.459> eight

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
release your thinning back by eight

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.530 
release your thinning back by eight
cards<00:04:07.849> you're<00:04:07.939> not<00:04:08.030> always<00:04:08.150> drawing<00:04:08.389> any

cards you're not always drawing any
cards<00:04:08.780> but<00:04:08.870> like<00:04:09.019> you're<00:04:09.650> using<00:04:09.859> reload<00:04:10.759> to

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879

cards but like you're using reload to
draw<00:04:11.030> one<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.509> then<00:04:11.599> you're<00:04:11.689> acted<00:04:11.959> in<00:04:12.049> shell

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349

draw one and then you're acted in shell
too<00:04:13.329> thin<00:04:14.329> one<00:04:14.629> so<00:04:14.870> your<00:04:15.019> two<00:04:15.259> cards<00:04:15.590> into<00:04:15.919> deck

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
one or two reckless is to draw even more

your deck upstart potentially just all a
 to<00:04:31.400> get<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.819> all<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.150> your<00:04:32.360> side<00:04:32.569> deck

 to get to all of your side deck
cards<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.229> just<00:04:33.470> draw<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:34.520> many<00:04:34.699> floodgates

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
cards and just draw so many floodgates

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.670 
cards and just draw so many floodgates
that<00:04:35.389> even<00:04:35.599> if<00:04:35.659> your<00:04:35.750> opponent<00:04:35.900> has<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.409> one

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
that even if your opponent has the one

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.909 
that even if your opponent has the one
or<00:04:37.069> two<00:04:37.310> msts<00:04:37.879> we're<00:04:38.599> talking<00:04:38.870> about<00:04:38.990> turn

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
or two msts we're talking about turn

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.450 
or two msts we're talking about turn
after<00:04:40.220> turn<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.879> setting<00:04:41.449> 5<00:04:42.319> trap<00:04:42.710> cards<00:04:43.190> I

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
after turn of setting 5 trap cards I

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.369 
after turn of setting 5 trap cards I
guess<00:04:44.030> for<00:04:44.240> because<00:04:44.479> you<00:04:44.599> have<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.870> reload<00:04:45.229> up

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
guess for because you have the reload up

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.110 
guess for because you have the reload up
so<00:04:45.500> you're<00:04:45.620> setting<00:04:45.830> for<00:04:45.940> potential<00:04:46.940> flood

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
so you're setting for potential flood

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.850 
so you're setting for potential flood
gate<00:04:47.330> every<00:04:47.599> single<00:04:47.810> turn<00:04:48.229> and<00:04:48.590> that<00:04:48.740> is<00:04:48.830> just

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
gate every single turn and that is just

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.580 
gate every single turn and that is just
crazy<00:04:49.430> that's<00:04:49.729> insane<00:04:50.060> rich<00:04:51.050> will<00:04:51.199> be<00:04:51.319> to<00:04:51.470> the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
crazy that's insane rich will be to the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.300 
crazy that's insane rich will be to the
exact<00:04:51.919> opposites<00:04:52.430> ritual<00:04:52.819> beasts<00:04:53.000> are<00:04:54.310> combo

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
exact opposites ritual beasts are combo

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.219 
exact opposites ritual beasts are combo
reliant<00:04:55.789> like<00:04:55.970> neck<00:04:56.180> rods<00:04:56.419> but<00:04:56.810> they<00:04:56.930> can<00:04:57.080> play

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
reliant like neck rods but they can play

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.770 
reliant like neck rods but they can play
floodgates<00:04:57.710> um<00:04:57.979> like<00:04:58.639> d<00:04:58.970> Fisher<00:04:59.270> and<00:04:59.419> macro<00:04:59.750> or

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
floodgates um like d Fisher and macro or

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.350 
floodgates um like d Fisher and macro or
just<00:05:00.229> ridiculous<00:05:00.740> this<00:05:00.860> format<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:02.030> problem

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
just ridiculous this format the problem

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.059 
just ridiculous this format the problem
ritual<00:05:02.629> beasts<00:05:02.780> is<00:05:02.990> that<00:05:03.229> they<00:05:03.500> lose<00:05:03.830> the

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
ritual beasts is that they lose the

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.559 
ritual beasts is that they lose the
floodgates<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.580> that's<00:05:04.819> what<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.120> personally

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:05.569 
floodgates and that's what I personally

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:06.670 
floodgates and that's what I personally
don't<00:05:05.629> like<00:05:05.750> about<00:05:05.960> them<00:05:06.169> I<00:05:06.319> still<00:05:06.530> think

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
don't like about them I still think

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.760 
don't like about them I still think
they're<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:06.830> really<00:05:07.009> great<00:05:07.280> choice<00:05:07.639> but<00:05:08.030> I<00:05:08.770> so

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
they're a really great choice but I so

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.899 
they're a really great choice but I so
many<00:05:09.919> people<00:05:10.190> are<00:05:10.250> playing<00:05:10.370> floodgates<00:05:10.849> right

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
many people are playing floodgates right

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.399 
many people are playing floodgates right
now<00:05:11.120> every<00:05:11.509> Road<00:05:11.659> deck<00:05:11.810> is<00:05:11.960> playing<00:05:12.169> flood

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
now every Road deck is playing flood

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:13.629 
now every Road deck is playing flood
gates<00:05:12.620> I<00:05:12.800> mean<00:05:12.949> you're<00:05:13.099> they're<00:05:13.250> playing<00:05:13.460> the

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
gates I mean you're they're playing the

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.570 
gates I mean you're they're playing the
meta<00:05:13.789> playing<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.599> beat<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:15.009> and<00:05:16.009> I<00:05:16.219> don't<00:05:16.400> like

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
meta playing to beat it and I don't like

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.860 
meta playing to beat it and I don't like
ritual<00:05:17.030> bees<00:05:17.180> because<00:05:17.360> they're<00:05:17.509> kind<00:05:17.719> of<00:05:17.750> in

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
ritual bees because they're kind of in

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.320 
ritual bees because they're kind of in
that<00:05:17.960> middle<00:05:18.319> area<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:18.919> they're<00:05:19.039> not<00:05:19.129> meta<00:05:19.580> by

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
that middle area so they're not meta by

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.180 
that middle area so they're not meta by
any<00:05:20.509> standards<00:05:20.870> they're<00:05:21.620> definitely<00:05:21.830> rogue

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
any standards they're definitely rogue

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.159 
any standards they're definitely rogue
but<00:05:22.789> they<00:05:22.940> lose<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:23.449> same<00:05:23.629> flood<00:05:23.810> gates<00:05:23.990> at

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
but they lose to the same flood gates at

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.659 
but they lose to the same flood gates at
meadow<00:05:24.349> losses<00:05:24.710> to<00:05:24.860> they<00:05:24.979> lose<00:05:25.190> to<00:05:25.340> mistake

and I don't like that but what ritual
bees<00:05:31.880> can<00:05:32.060> do<00:05:32.210> is<00:05:32.449> they<00:05:32.659> can<00:05:32.870> put<00:05:33.800> way<00:05:34.250> more

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:34.279 
bees can do is they can put way more

bees can do is they can put way more
damage<00:05:35.060> on<00:05:35.300> board<00:05:35.659> than<00:05:35.840> volcanic<00:05:36.349> so

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500

volcanic<00:05:37.029> your<00:05:38.029> main<00:05:38.180> damage<00:05:38.389> outlet<00:05:38.870> is

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
volcanic your main damage outlet is

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.830 
volcanic your main damage outlet is
scattershot<00:05:39.469> and<00:05:39.979> poking<00:05:40.610> for<00:05:40.849> 19<00:05:41.210> or<00:05:41.389> 17

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:49.279 
mind besides the fact that one Lisa's

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.149 
mind besides the fact that one Lisa's
floodgates<00:05:49.699> and<00:05:49.819> one<00:05:50.029> doesn't<00:05:50.270> um<00:05:50.800> what<00:05:51.800> KX

say<00:05:57.620> turn<00:05:57.800> three<00:05:58.099> I<00:05:58.279> mean<00:05:58.759> your<00:05:59.029> third<00:05:59.330> turn<00:05:59.629> so

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
like that's that's the difference but

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.180 
like that's that's the difference but
like<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:02.990> greater<00:06:03.379> index<00:06:03.710> two<00:06:03.949> very<00:06:04.129> good

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
like the to greater index two very good

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.640 
like the to greater index two very good
rogue<00:06:04.550> decks<00:06:04.819> um<00:06:05.060> but<00:06:05.629> there's<00:06:06.229> my<00:06:06.379> thoughts

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
rogue decks um but there's my thoughts

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.409 
rogue decks um but there's my thoughts
on<00:06:06.889> the<00:06:06.979> four<00:06:07.340> decks<00:06:07.580> you<00:06:07.759> can<00:06:07.909> play<00:06:08.090> for<00:06:08.330> the

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
on the four decks you can play for the

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.869 
on the four decks you can play for the
next<00:06:08.509> month<00:06:08.889> obviously<00:06:09.889> things<00:06:10.009> are<00:06:10.190> bound<00:06:10.699> to

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:10.879 
next month obviously things are bound to

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.820 
next month obviously things are bound to
change<00:06:10.969> once<00:06:11.509> April<00:06:11.870> first<00:06:12.020> list<00:06:12.349> comes<00:06:12.620> out

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
change once April first list comes out

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.499 
change once April first list comes out
and<00:06:13.190> the<00:06:13.279> new<00:06:13.400> sets<00:06:13.669> come<00:06:13.849> out<00:06:14.000> but<00:06:14.240> I<00:06:14.300> think

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:14.509 
and the new sets come out but I think

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.809 
and the new sets come out but I think
right<00:06:14.690> now<00:06:14.870> if<00:06:15.110> you're<00:06:15.770> trying<00:06:16.190> to<00:06:16.370> plan<00:06:16.789> a

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
right now if you're trying to plan a

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:18.339 
right now if you're trying to plan a
competitive<00:06:17.449> level<00:06:17.479> these<00:06:17.840> are<00:06:17.990> your<00:06:18.110> best

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:18.349 
competitive level these are your best

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:21.010 
competitive level these are your best
four<00:06:18.680> options<00:06:19.210> so<00:06:20.210> hopefully<00:06:20.659> you<00:06:20.719> enjoyed
