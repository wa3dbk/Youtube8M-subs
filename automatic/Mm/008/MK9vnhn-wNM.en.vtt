00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.349
 can make 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.710
 a pack charger is included 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.539
 a wristband and a usb cable the ss the 60 100 is a nice and compact camera 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.199
 easily fitted in your pockets or your bag it also has a modern design 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.429
 with two comma 7 in it, the sp is slightly smaller than its predecessor 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.920
 for this you get a tilting and floater display in return which means you 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.560

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.230
 He has a 16 megapixels mingle and a sensor that takes care of it 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.790
 free will also in low light 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.630
 Man has twelve times optical zoom and optical 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.160
 image stabilization so that the images with both the photo and video either 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.100
 be jerky 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.390
 the extraction of the ss six or 100 is there went fold 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.570
 it has a good automatic mode, but if desired you can do the set mode 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.330
 we find below depending on the situation you are in 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.040
 even a nice panorama mode also has a number of effects to it 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.020
 give your photos that little bit more 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.340
 The big advantage is that you don't necessarily have to choose an effect in advance 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.330
 when you have taken a picture you can choose to quickly make me effects 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.940
 to go 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.860
 so you can still easily add effects arjen weeds shot photo it 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.270
 nicest of the ss there are sixteen hundred in making 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.369
 self portraits 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.100
 this is possible with this camera because of hand movements, what you can do with your hand 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.920
 a clerk when your display is rotated 180 degrees various icons 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 visible 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.740
 so you can zoom in and out 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.820
 take a photo and or start a video when your palm is on the hand in it 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.580
 center 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.470
 you can drag the camera to one of the icons to the camera 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.560
 to give instructions 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.969
 very nice and innovative technologies 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.409
 to be able to easily share your photos, nick could have 66 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.529
 equipped with a wifi receiver that connects to your smartphone or 

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:53.350
 tablet 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.710
 the sss around it is a very nice camera but is a minor drawback 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.050
 and that's sort of an effect you don't get to see the first example 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.180
 This is really to fix it on the first photo and then take it 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.710
 the minutes faster you choose ff where you do see an example 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.200
 furthermore you can get no disadvantages with the s6 s6 the hundred nice and compact 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.160
 without really good image quality and of course operate the camera via 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.580
