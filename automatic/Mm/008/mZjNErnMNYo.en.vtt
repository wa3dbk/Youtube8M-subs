00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
so from the top this is your pulley to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.609 
so from the top this is your pulley to
drive<00:00:14.070> pulley<00:00:14.429> input<00:00:14.969> pulley<00:00:15.320> this<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.470> your

drive pulley input pulley this is your

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.660 
drive pulley input pulley this is your
vent<00:00:16.890> cap<00:00:17.310> your<00:00:17.850> filler<00:00:18.210> cap<00:00:18.600> or<00:00:19.100> drain<00:00:20.100> cap<00:00:20.400> if

vent cap your filler cap or drain cap if

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.859 
vent cap your filler cap or drain cap if
you're<00:00:20.789> going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> attempt<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.420> change<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
you're going to attempt to change the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.910 
you're going to attempt to change the
flick<00:00:23.000> we're<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> get<00:00:24.439> some<00:00:25.439> snap<00:00:25.680> ring

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
flick we're going to get some snap ring

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920 
flick we're going to get some snap ring
pliers<00:00:25.949> with<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> very<00:00:26.820> fine<00:00:27.180> tip<00:00:27.449> mine<00:00:27.720> weren't

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
pliers with a very fine tip mine weren't

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.080 
pliers with a very fine tip mine weren't
fine<00:00:28.230> enough<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.310> ground<00:00:29.640> them<00:00:29.880> down<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
fine enough so I ground them down a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.389 
fine enough so I ground them down a
little<00:00:30.359> bit<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> bench<00:00:30.990> grinder<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.250> that

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
little bit on the bench grinder so that

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.240 
little bit on the bench grinder so that
they<00:00:32.520> fit<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> snap<00:00:33.360> ring<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> go

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
they fit in the snap ring so if you go

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.760 
they fit in the snap ring so if you go
on<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.399> 45<00:00:35.880> degree<00:00:36.090> angle<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.989> put<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
on a 45 degree angle to it put one of

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.660 
on a 45 degree angle to it put one of
them<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.390> open<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.480> till<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.750> gets<00:00:39.899> close<00:00:40.670> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
them in open it till it gets close and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.279 
them in open it till it gets close and
then<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.030> kind<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.300> wiggle<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
then just kind of wiggle it in and

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.260 
then just kind of wiggle it in and
double<00:00:46.289> wide<00:00:46.469> 6<00:00:46.980> when<00:00:47.309> he<00:00:47.340> did<00:00:47.610> his<00:00:47.789> he<00:00:48.059> bent

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
double wide 6 when he did his he bent

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.279 
double wide 6 when he did his he bent
the<00:00:48.360> pin<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.379> he<00:00:49.530> recommends<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.399> you

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
the pin and so he recommends that you

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.290 
the pin and so he recommends that you
roll<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.440> off<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> little<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.969> I

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
roll it off a little bit like that I

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.160 
roll it off a little bit like that I
ordered<00:00:58.170> another<00:00:58.410> pin<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.309> he<00:00:59.460> did

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
ordered another pin just because he did

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.840 
ordered another pin just because he did
so<00:01:01.170> anyway<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.770> pull<00:01:02.010> off<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> pulley<00:01:02.520> pull

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so anyway you pull off the pulley pull

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.549 
so anyway you pull off the pulley pull
off<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> fan<00:01:03.600> once<00:01:03.899> you've<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.379> off

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
off the fan once you've got that off

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.719 
off the fan once you've got that off
you've<00:01:04.739> got<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.309> clip<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.610> you're

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you've got this little clip if you're

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.580 
you've got this little clip if you're
going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.000> replacing<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.630> seals<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.380> yours

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
going to be replacing the seals if yours

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.289 
going to be replacing the seals if yours
has<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> lot<00:01:08.040> more<00:01:08.070> hours<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.090> been

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
has a lot more hours if it's been

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.580 
has a lot more hours if it's been
through<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.630> heat<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.170> want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> do

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
through more heat then you want to do

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.160 
through more heat then you want to do
that<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> same<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.360> my<00:01:12.390> l1<00:01:12.720> 10

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that this is the same as in my l1 10

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
that this is the same as in my l1 10
even<00:01:13.500> though<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.710> at<00:01:13.860> l1<00:01:14.159> 18<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.210> want<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
even though it's at l1 18 like I want to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810 
even though it's at l1 18 like I want to
eat<00:01:15.570> teens<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:16.110> bigger<00:01:16.350> engine<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.670> it's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
eat teens a lot bigger engine but it's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.609 
eat teens a lot bigger engine but it's
the<00:01:17.880> same<00:01:18.090> transmission<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.439> run

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the same transmission so you can run

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
the same transmission so you can run
into<00:01:19.770> trouble<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.310> way<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.640> definitely

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
into trouble that way it's definitely

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.420 
into trouble that way it's definitely
the<00:01:21.270> weak<00:01:21.420> link<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.409> again<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.860> thing<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> put

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the weak link so again this thing is put

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.450 
the weak link so again this thing is put
in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.850> forward<00:01:24.360> position<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:26.130> would<00:01:26.310> be

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
in the forward position that would be

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.539 
in the forward position that would be
release<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.659> would<00:01:27.930> be<00:01:28.130> forward<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
release that would be forward this is a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.060 
release that would be forward this is a
gas<00:01:29.790> pedal<00:01:30.030> forward<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.750> backward<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.320> then

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
gas pedal forward and backward and then

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.160 
gas pedal forward and backward and then
this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.520> brake<00:01:32.759> pedal<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:33.930> just

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this is your brake pedal you know just

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.690 
this is your brake pedal you know just
like<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> brakes<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> left<00:01:35.070> side<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.520> gas

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
like the brakes on the left side the gas

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.580 
like the brakes on the left side the gas
on<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.090> side<00:01:36.390> that's<00:01:36.900> how<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
on the right side that's how all this is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.490 
on the right side that's how all this is
oriented<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.130> goes<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.939> pump<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.900> then

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
oriented this goes to your pump and then

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
oriented this goes to your pump and then
the<00:01:41.040> other<00:01:41.220> ones<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.729> motor<00:01:41.939> I'll<00:01:42.150> show<00:01:42.329> you

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the other ones your motor I'll show you

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
the other ones your motor I'll show you
that<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.810> minute<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.820> oriented<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:44.970> way

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that in a minute it's oriented this way

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.660 
that in a minute it's oriented this way
in<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.590> we've<00:01:47.250> drained<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
in it so what we do is we've drained the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.749 
in it so what we do is we've drained the
fluid<00:01:47.820> by<00:01:48.570> removing<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.380> cap<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.100> then<00:01:50.670> we

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
fluid by removing this cap and then we

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.580 
fluid by removing this cap and then we
pulled<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> magnet<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:52.049> magnet<00:01:52.439> just

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
pulled the magnet out this magnet just

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.039 
pulled the magnet out this magnet just
sits<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:53.250> there's<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.090> little<00:01:54.479> opening

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
sits in there there's a little opening

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.969 
sits in there there's a little opening
in<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:56.030> where<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> oil<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.899> either<00:01:58.530> way

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979

enough for me but I had to watch them
several<00:02:46.020> times<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:47.090> do<00:02:48.090> some<00:02:48.300> teardown<00:02:48.660> and

several times and do some teardown and
go<00:02:49.080> back<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.440> watch<00:02:49.590> them<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:49.890> that's<00:02:49.950> why<00:02:50.130> I'm

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
go back and watch them so that's why I'm

loosen<00:03:36.570> all<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.750> rim<00:03:37.170> first<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.770> then

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
loosen all the rim first and then

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.030 
loosen all the rim first and then
centers<00:03:39.080> coming<00:03:40.080> off<00:03:40.230> doesn't<00:03:40.620> matter<00:03:40.800> as

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
centers coming off doesn't matter as

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.190 
centers coming off doesn't matter as
much<00:03:41.070> because<00:03:41.550> you<00:03:41.880> just<00:03:42.090> glued<00:03:42.450> on<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:42.990> hard

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
much because you just glued on so hard

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.400 
much because you just glued on so hard
it<00:03:43.470> doesn't<00:03:43.740> matter<00:03:43.890> anyway<00:03:45.110> but<00:03:46.110> when<00:03:46.260> you're

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
it doesn't matter anyway but when you're

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.630 
it doesn't matter anyway but when you're
working<00:03:46.650> with<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.800> magnesium<00:03:47.250> or<00:03:47.610> aluminum

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
working with a magnesium or aluminum

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.080 
working with a magnesium or aluminum
case<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.470> want<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.890> kind<00:03:50.580> of<00:03:50.670> go<00:03:50.760> easy<00:03:50.940> on

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
case and you want to kind of go easy on

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.260 
case and you want to kind of go easy on
that<00:03:51.240> thing<00:03:52.460> these<00:03:53.460> also<00:03:53.910> need<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.150> be

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
that thing these also need to be

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.630 
that thing these also need to be
loosened<00:03:54.830> all<00:03:55.830> of<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.130> bolts<00:03:56.370> around<00:03:56.490> the

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
loosened all of the bolts around the

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.070 
loosened all of the bolts around the
perimeter<00:03:57.090> are<00:03:57.180> going<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.390> be<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.570> same<00:03:57.810> and

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
perimeter are going to be the same and

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.700 
perimeter are going to be the same and
then<00:03:58.680> these<00:03:58.890> two<00:03:59.160> are<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.700> same<00:04:00.590> we've<00:04:01.590> got

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
then these two are the same we've got

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.210 
then these two are the same we've got
the<00:04:01.800> same<00:04:02.010> stick<00:04:02.310> out<00:04:02.460> on<00:04:02.640> them<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:04.620> just<00:04:05.010> group

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the same stick out on them so just group

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.060 
the same stick out on them so just group
them<00:04:05.540> appropriately<00:04:06.590> just<00:04:07.590> go<00:04:07.710> around<00:04:07.950> and

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
them appropriately just go around and

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.450 
them appropriately just go around and
pull<00:04:08.250> all<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.490> bolts<00:04:08.790> out<00:04:09.860> then<00:04:10.860> take<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:11.100> short

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
pull all the bolts out then take a short

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.310 
pull all the bolts out then take a short
pry<00:04:11.670> bar<00:04:11.940> you'll<00:04:12.660> notice<00:04:12.900> you've<00:04:13.050> got<00:04:13.080> these

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
pry bar you'll notice you've got these

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.900 
pry bar you'll notice you've got these
little<00:04:13.470> fins<00:04:13.830> all<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.250> way<00:04:14.340> around<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:14.760> got

little fins all the way around you got

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.500 
little fins all the way around you got

one here here here here here here

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.110 
one here here here here here here
here<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:18.860> got<00:04:19.010> them<00:04:19.130> all<00:04:19.280> over<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.640> place

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
here you got them all over the place

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.270 
here you got them all over the place
this<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:20.930> substantial<00:04:21.800> heavy-duty

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
this is a substantial heavy-duty

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.030 
this is a substantial heavy-duty
reinforced<00:04:23.060> one<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.540> this<00:04:23.870> is<00:04:23.930> also<00:04:24.290> so<00:04:24.890> I'd

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
reinforced one and this is also so I'd

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.180 
reinforced one and this is also so I'd
like<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.400> start<00:04:25.670> it<00:04:25.820> here<00:04:26.200> so<00:04:27.200> just<00:04:27.680> pry<00:04:27.950> it<00:04:27.980> up

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
like to start it here so just pry it up

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.190 
like to start it here so just pry it up
one<00:04:28.460> side<00:04:28.730> and<00:04:28.760> get<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.330> burp<00:04:29.570> you're<00:04:29.930> just

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
one side and get it to burp you're just

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.840 
one side and get it to burp you're just
going<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.350> be<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.500> lot<00:04:30.770> harder<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.220> get<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.670> go

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
going to be a lot harder to get it to go

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.030 
going to be a lot harder to get it to go
at<00:04:32.000> first<00:04:32.330> than<00:04:32.690> this<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.200> then<00:04:33.680> work<00:04:33.890> it

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
at first than this and then work it

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.070 
at first than this and then work it
through<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.430> here<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:34.910> then<00:04:35.450> go<00:04:35.630> around<00:04:35.660> to

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
through to here and then go around to

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.230 
through to here and then go around to
these<00:04:36.260> ones<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.770> then<00:04:37.520> once<00:04:37.760> you've<00:04:37.910> got<00:04:38.090> them

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
these ones and then once you've got them

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.150 
these ones and then once you've got them
all<00:04:38.330> popped<00:04:38.660> then<00:04:39.290> you<00:04:39.440> can<00:04:39.620> pull<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.860> cover

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
all popped then you can pull the cover

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.840 
all popped then you can pull the cover
or<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.700> pan<00:04:40.970> off<00:04:41.330> like<00:04:41.960> this<00:04:42.460> as<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.610> pull<00:04:43.820> the

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
or the pan off like this as you pull the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.610 
or the pan off like this as you pull the
pan<00:04:44.150> off<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.450> see<00:04:44.630> mines<00:04:44.870> all<00:04:45.200> chewed<00:04:45.470> up

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
pan off you see mines all chewed up

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.410 
pan off you see mines all chewed up
right<00:04:45.890> here<00:04:46.190> from<00:04:46.400> where<00:04:46.430> my<00:04:46.730> gears<00:04:47.030> were<00:04:47.210> just

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
right here from where my gears were just

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.720 
right here from where my gears were just
a<00:04:47.480> huge<00:04:47.690> mess<00:04:47.930> this<00:04:48.680> was<00:04:48.860> put<00:04:49.070> together<00:04:49.220> wrong

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
a huge mess this was put together wrong

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.330 
a huge mess this was put together wrong
and<00:04:50.120> it<00:04:50.590> exacerbated<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.710> problem<00:04:51.740> as<00:04:52.190> other

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
and it exacerbated the problem as other

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.100 
and it exacerbated the problem as other
people<00:04:52.700> looked<00:04:52.940> at<00:04:53.090> his<00:04:53.240> classified<00:04:53.900> and

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
people looked at his classified and

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
people looked at his classified and
drove<00:04:54.320> it<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.220> was<00:04:55.340> really<00:04:55.370> really

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
drove it so it was really really

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.440 
drove it so it was really really
knackered<00:04:58.130> I<00:04:58.250> mean<00:04:58.400> it<00:04:58.490> was<00:04:58.610> bad<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:59.360> was

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
knackered I mean it was bad it was

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.570 
knackered I mean it was bad it was
totally<00:05:00.050> for<00:05:00.260> shizzle<00:05:00.470> so<00:05:01.190> this<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.430> where

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
totally for shizzle so this is where

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.400 
totally for shizzle so this is where
your<00:05:01.760> filter<00:05:01.970> sits<00:05:02.390> there's<00:05:02.810> a<00:05:02.900> little<00:05:03.200> rubber

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
your filter sits there's a little rubber

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.400 
your filter sits there's a little rubber
seal<00:05:03.860> that's<00:05:04.850> firmly<00:05:05.510> attached<00:05:05.990> to<00:05:06.200> both

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
seal that's firmly attached to both

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.490 
seal that's firmly attached to both
sides<00:05:06.940> it's<00:05:07.940> glued<00:05:08.240> in<00:05:08.420> so<00:05:08.660> it<00:05:08.870> might<00:05:09.200> fall

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
sides it's glued in so it might fall

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.680 
sides it's glued in so it might fall
apart<00:05:09.590> on<00:05:10.010> your<00:05:10.190> old<00:05:10.310> one<00:05:10.520> just<00:05:11.210> take<00:05:11.450> that<00:05:11.630> out

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
apart on your old one just take that out

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.110 
apart on your old one just take that out
you'll<00:05:12.620> have<00:05:12.830> a<00:05:12.860> gasket<00:05:13.430> maker<00:05:13.610> all<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.030> way

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
you'll have a gasket maker all the way

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.640 
you'll have a gasket maker all the way
around<00:05:14.420> here<00:05:14.660> that<00:05:14.840> you'll<00:05:14.960> want<00:05:15.140> to<00:05:15.350> wire

brakes<00:05:46.090> can<00:05:47.090> you<00:05:47.210> see<00:05:47.420> that<00:05:47.600> that's<00:05:47.960> moving

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
brakes can you see that that's moving

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.650 
brakes can you see that that's moving
right<00:05:48.500> here<00:05:48.800> so<00:05:49.370> that<00:05:49.550> moves<00:05:49.910> and<00:05:50.300> it<00:05:50.390> shoves

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
right here so that moves and it shoves

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.600 
right here so that moves and it shoves
this<00:05:50.960> brake<00:05:51.290> pad<00:05:51.590> against<00:05:51.920> this<00:05:52.130> this<00:05:52.400> can

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
this brake pad against this this can

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.730 
this brake pad against this this can
slide<00:05:52.910> back<00:05:53.240> and<00:05:53.420> forth<00:05:53.510> it's<00:05:54.350> like<00:05:54.560> your

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
slide back and forth it's like your

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.950 
slide back and forth it's like your
caliper<00:05:55.160> bracket<00:05:55.550> on<00:05:55.670> a<00:05:55.700> car<00:05:55.970> so<00:05:56.660> when<00:05:56.840> you

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
caliper bracket on a car so when you

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.710 
caliper bracket on a car so when you
turn<00:05:57.170> that<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:58.490> binds<00:05:58.850> this<00:05:59.150> brake<00:05:59.480> pad

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
turn that it binds this brake pad

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.630 
turn that it binds this brake pad
against<00:06:00.080> this<00:06:00.290> other<00:06:00.500> one<00:06:00.770> so<00:06:01.340> we're<00:06:01.490> going<00:06:01.580> to

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
against this other one so we're going to

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.370 
against this other one so we're going to
pull<00:06:01.850> our<00:06:01.970> brake<00:06:02.180> pads<00:06:02.480> out<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:03.080> we're<00:06:03.230> going

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
pull our brake pads out and we're going

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.110 
pull our brake pads out and we're going
to<00:06:03.470> set<00:06:03.680> those<00:06:03.860> aside<00:06:03.920> you<00:06:04.460> can<00:06:04.490> see<00:06:04.790> the<00:06:04.910> wear

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
to set those aside you can see the wear

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.090 
to set those aside you can see the wear
mark<00:06:05.450> is<00:06:05.690> an<00:06:06.020> easy<00:06:06.170> way<00:06:06.380> to<00:06:06.440> remember<00:06:06.770> how<00:06:07.070> to

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
mark is an easy way to remember how to

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.480 
mark is an easy way to remember how to
do<00:06:07.310> it

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
do it

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.840 
do it
the<00:06:08.120> little<00:06:08.360> L<00:06:08.570> just<00:06:08.990> goes<00:06:09.140> like<00:06:09.290> that<00:06:09.320> so

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
the little L just goes like that so

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.670 
the little L just goes like that so
we'll<00:06:10.850> set<00:06:11.060> that<00:06:11.270> in<00:06:11.420> our<00:06:11.540> dish<00:06:11.750> pull<00:06:12.380> this<00:06:12.500> one

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
we'll set that in our dish pull this one

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.710 
we'll set that in our dish pull this one
out<00:06:12.890> again<00:06:13.130> it's<00:06:13.610> got<00:06:13.730> a<00:06:13.760> wear<00:06:13.970> mark<00:06:14.240> really

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
out again it's got a wear mark really

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.290 
out again it's got a wear mark really
easy<00:06:14.900> to<00:06:15.110> tell<00:06:15.320> a<00:06:15.560> really<00:06:16.130> low<00:06:16.340> our<00:06:16.610> tractor

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
easy to tell a really low our tractor

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.650 
easy to tell a really low our tractor
for<00:06:17.510> this<00:06:17.660> to<00:06:17.810> fail<00:06:18.170> just<00:06:18.200> really<00:06:19.100> a<00:06:19.660> head

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
for this to fail just really a head

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.630 
for this to fail just really a head
scratcher<00:06:21.080> remember<00:06:21.830> there<00:06:21.980> was<00:06:22.070> the<00:06:22.220> magnet

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
scratcher remember there was the magnet

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.550 
scratcher remember there was the magnet
and<00:06:22.760> the<00:06:22.820> cap<00:06:23.090> that<00:06:23.300> we<00:06:23.420> did<00:06:23.570> earlier<00:06:23.930> I<00:06:24.170> set

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
and the cap that we did earlier I set

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.950 
and the cap that we did earlier I set
them<00:06:24.680> over<00:06:24.770> here<00:06:25.220> we've<00:06:25.850> got<00:06:25.940> another<00:06:26.420> magnet

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
them over here we've got another magnet

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.270 
them over here we've got another magnet
that<00:06:27.410> is<00:06:27.770> in<00:06:28.130> this<00:06:28.310> slot
