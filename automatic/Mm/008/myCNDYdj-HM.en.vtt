00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.929
 with youtube friends I'm contained in 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:07.830
 this time I'm going to show you the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.469
 installation of the lake liberation proxy in 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.469
 my new helmet greg holland 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.470
 good friends, as you saw in the 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.279
 intro right now I have a new helmet 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.660
 This grex is made by the nolan group 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.470
 as we see here it has its air intakes 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.870
 it is collapsible 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.930
 and well, as we see there, I have my 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.020
 camera i do pro 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.050
 flag silver edition because this piece that 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.340
 is the one that we are going to be occupying nothing 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.340
 more I do a focus 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.040
 no it is not that 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.260
 this is curved so that it suits 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.120
 to the shape of the helmet 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.660
 you have to know where we are going to put it 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.810
 so that we have good vision we do not 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.440
 clog 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.140
 our mica the visor 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.190
 for when we have the camera there and it 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.500
 can open even when we have our 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.410
 camera set and good as I said 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.200
 we have to see that we do not get in the way 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.909
 we put it there and I'm going to put this 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.490
 add-on that makes you avoid it 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.190
 a little bit was there I do not know if it will be 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.560
 observe well 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.140
 all right 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.570
 It fits perfect and well we can put it 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.540
 here a little more in front the first 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.480
 what you have to do is clean the part of 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.490
 where are we going to put 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.040
 this is a cloth for the inter teeth 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.330
 so that it does not scratch and good because what 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.680
 we have to download 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.680
 the adhesive that brings 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.510
 we take off is a very strong adhesive not 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.580
 it falls 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.710
 that's why you have to know well where 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.360
 we are going to place it that is not dirty that is not 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.360
 have finger spots or grease 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.670
 and we fix 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.000
 how well I put it and we set squeezing 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.000
 nothing else 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.859
 as we see they have the curvature for the 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.859
 helmet 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.530
 and it is already 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.980
 what he tells us in the camera good in 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.060
 the instructions how will you adhere 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.190
 to the helmet is to wait a minimum day for 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.590
 that dries well so that it sticks well 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.330
 as we see 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.730
 is well attached and that single piece is 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.790
 piece is the one that will sustain our 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.110
 camera 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.980
 to the helmet 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.980
 in this way 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.610
 we apply the click 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:13.340
 it is already as we see it to be left aside 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:13.340
 well in front and our here 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.060
 and here 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.410
 and how good I think you are seeing me 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.050
 right now I'm going to put a 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.670
 box so you can see how that looks 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.060
 is the camera that I use to record 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.540
 this is the space that he always occupied and 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.200
 well that's the angle we have since 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.200
 our helmet 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.290
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.290
 we see for the next bye 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.400
 ah 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.620
 ah 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.620
