definitely say it's an easier way to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.020 
definitely say it's an easier way to
being<00:03:24.470> natural<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.100> know<00:03:25.190> in<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.520> beginning<00:03:25.610> I

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
being natural I know in the beginning I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.990
