00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
okay so day two with a 3d printer it

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.650 
okay so day two with a 3d printer it
seems<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.400> be<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:05.670> there<00:00:05.819> are<00:00:05.940> two<00:00:06.210> common

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
seems to be that there are two common

sticking either sticking too much or
sticking<00:00:12.330> too<00:00:12.540> little<00:00:13.190> I'm<00:00:14.190> printing<00:00:14.490> with

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
sticking too little I'm printing with

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.060 
sticking too little I'm printing with
PLA<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.480> blue<00:00:15.929> tape<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.590> first<00:00:16.830> thing<00:00:17.010> I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
PLA on blue tape and the first thing I

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.590 
PLA on blue tape and the first thing I
tried<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.340> print<00:00:17.609> came<00:00:17.970> out<00:00:18.150> looking<00:00:18.570> like

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
tried to print came out looking like

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.179 
tried to print came out looking like
that<00:00:19.880> this<00:00:20.880> was<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.720> shark<00:00:22.619> model<00:00:23.010> of

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
that this was a shark model of

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.900 
that this was a shark model of
Thingiverse<00:00:24.140> but<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.710> did<00:00:26.220> not<00:00:26.369> stick<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
Thingiverse but it did not stick to the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.060 
Thingiverse but it did not stick to the
blue<00:00:27.150> tape<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.630> peeled<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:28.170> as<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.650> printhead

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
blue tape it peeled up as the printhead

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.250 
blue tape it peeled up as the printhead
was<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.550> across<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.240> ran<00:00:30.420> into<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
was going across and ran into it and it

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.380 
was going across and ran into it and it
just<00:00:31.289> mangled<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> killed<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> print

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
just mangled it so I killed the print

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.520 
just mangled it so I killed the print

I<00:00:34.590> found<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.550> forum<00:00:36.030> post<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.450> said<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.840> way

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
I found a forum post that said the way

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.100 
I found a forum post that said the way
to<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.469> fixed<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.579> take<00:00:39.110> isopropyl

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
to get that fixed is to take isopropyl

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.979 
to get that fixed is to take isopropyl
or<00:00:40.290> rubbing<00:00:40.590> alcohol<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.480> put<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.719> cloth

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
or rubbing alcohol and put that on cloth

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.020 
or rubbing alcohol and put that on cloth
and<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.469> rub<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.800> across<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.250> blue<00:00:44.579> tape<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and just rub it across the blue tape and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.569 
and just rub it across the blue tape and
across<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> top<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.870> blue<00:00:46.020> tape<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.579> the

across the top of the blue tape and the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.250 
across the top of the blue tape and the
PLA<00:00:47.879> will<00:00:48.000> stick<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.750> tried<00:00:49.079> that

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
PLA will stick to it and I tried that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.619 
PLA will stick to it and I tried that
and<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:50.070> worked<00:00:50.370> great<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:51.059> haven't<00:00:51.420> had<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and it worked great I haven't had a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.299 
and it worked great I haven't had a
single<00:00:51.840> problem<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.500> things<00:00:52.680> not<00:00:52.890> sticking

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
single problem with things not sticking

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.779 
single problem with things not sticking
to<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> blue<00:00:53.640> tape<00:00:53.879> since

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.810 

okay<00:00:58.539> problem<00:00:58.960> number<00:00:59.140> two<00:00:59.559> I've<00:00:59.920> run<00:01:00.280> into<00:01:00.429> is

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
okay problem number two I've run into is

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.079 
okay problem number two I've run into is
the<00:01:01.719> blue<00:01:01.989> tape<00:01:02.289> doing<00:01:02.739> too<00:01:03.579> good<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:04.000> a<00:01:04.059> job

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
the blue tape doing too good of a job

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.789 
the blue tape doing too good of a job
sticking<00:01:05.019> to<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:06.189> actual<00:01:06.640> print<00:01:06.970> surface

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
sticking to the actual print surface

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.789 
sticking to the actual print surface
I<00:01:08.830> tried<00:01:09.580> printing<00:01:09.909> a<00:01:10.330> case<00:01:10.930> for<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.259> Raspberry

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
I tried printing a case for a Raspberry

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.420 
I tried printing a case for a Raspberry
Pi<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:14.110> interior<00:01:14.740> started<00:01:15.070> messing<00:01:15.340> up

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
Pi and the interior started messing up

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.620 
Pi and the interior started messing up
because<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:15.610> had<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.820> fill<00:01:16.000> rule<00:01:16.240> but<00:01:16.479> when<00:01:16.600> I

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
because I had the fill rule but when I

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.080 
because I had the fill rule but when I
went<00:01:16.840> to<00:01:16.869> go<00:01:17.020> print<00:01:17.320> pull<00:01:17.799> it<00:01:17.950> off<00:01:18.159> you'll

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
went to go print pull it off you'll

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.180 
went to go print pull it off you'll
notice<00:01:19.240> there's<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.630> very<00:01:19.840> severe<00:01:20.470> bend<00:01:20.920> in<00:01:21.159> it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
notice there's a very severe bend in it

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.430 
notice there's a very severe bend in it
from<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.880> amount<00:01:22.180> of<00:01:22.420> effort<00:01:22.780> that<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.259> took

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
from the amount of effort that it took

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.910 
from the amount of effort that it took
to<00:01:23.619> actually<00:01:23.740> get<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.220> tape<00:01:24.490> off<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.759> surface

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
to actually get the tape off the surface

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.389 
to actually get the tape off the surface
it<00:01:26.920> was<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:29.470> stuck<00:01:29.710> down<00:01:29.920> there<00:01:30.130> very<00:01:30.159> well

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
it was really stuck down there very well

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.960 
it was really stuck down there very well
so<00:01:30.880> what<00:01:31.509> I<00:01:31.780> came<00:01:32.649> up<00:01:32.830> with<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.280> try<00:01:33.490> fix<00:01:33.789> this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
so what I came up with the try fix this

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.190 
so what I came up with the try fix this
issue<00:01:34.149> is<00:01:34.679> baby<00:01:35.679> powder<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:37.509> you<00:01:37.630> can<00:01:37.810> do<00:01:37.960> is

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
issue is baby powder what you can do is

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.010 
issue is baby powder what you can do is
take<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.880> blue<00:01:40.090> tape<00:01:40.330> before<00:01:40.690> you<00:01:40.780> put<00:01:40.929> it

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
take your blue tape before you put it

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.240 
take your blue tape before you put it
down<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:42.450> put<00:01:43.450> baby<00:01:43.929> powder<00:01:44.020> in<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.740> center

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
down and put baby powder in the center

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.999 
down and put baby powder in the center
of<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.729> tape<00:01:45.940> not<00:01:46.210> on<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.509> edges<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.020> what

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
of the tape not on the edges and what

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.190 
of the tape not on the edges and what
this<00:01:48.190> will<00:01:48.399> do<00:01:48.580> is<00:01:48.819> prevent<00:01:49.299> it<00:01:49.509> from<00:01:49.690> sticking

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
this will do is prevent it from sticking

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.559 
this will do is prevent it from sticking
quite<00:01:51.190> so<00:01:51.459> much<00:01:51.640> in<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.970> middle<00:01:52.149> you<00:01:52.420> don't

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
quite so much in the middle you don't

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.600 
quite so much in the middle you don't
want<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.780> cover<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.140> but<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:53.920> will<00:01:54.009> still<00:01:54.340> leave

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
want to cover it but it will still leave

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.350 
want to cover it but it will still leave
enough<00:01:54.640> there<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.630> make<00:01:55.929> it<00:01:56.080> sticky<00:01:56.709> and<00:01:57.360> it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
enough there to make it sticky and it

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.190 
enough there to make it sticky and it
will<00:01:58.450> still<00:01:58.720> stick<00:01:59.080> on<00:01:59.380> the<00:02:00.100> ends<00:02:00.580> so<00:02:00.989> that<00:02:01.989> the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
will still stick on the ends so that the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.430 
will still stick on the ends so that the
tape<00:02:02.379> stays<00:02:02.739> in<00:02:03.009> place<00:02:03.989> but<00:02:04.989> you<00:02:05.140> can<00:02:05.259> easily

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
tape stays in place but you can easily

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.680 
tape stays in place but you can easily
remove<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.979> print<00:02:06.220> job<00:02:06.429> and<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:07.149> will<00:02:07.360> do<00:02:07.660> a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
remove the print job and I will do a

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.779 
remove the print job and I will do a
test<00:02:07.989> print<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.619> will<00:02:08.890> show<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.489> all<00:02:09.759> how

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
test print and I will show you all how

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.589 
test print and I will show you all how
it<00:02:10.179> works

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
it works

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.930 
it works
okay<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.620> print<00:02:11.860> here<00:02:12.069> is<00:02:12.220> finished<00:02:12.670> and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
okay the print here is finished and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.449 
okay the print here is finished and
let's<00:02:13.780> see<00:02:14.050> how<00:02:14.290> difficult<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.129> to<00:02:15.160> get

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
let's see how difficult it is to get

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.420 
let's see how difficult it is to get
this<00:02:15.610> thing<00:02:15.670> up<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:17.040> bottom<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.250> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
this thing up with the bottom of the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.199 
this thing up with the bottom of the
tape<00:02:18.700> head<00:02:18.940> baby<00:02:19.360> powder<00:02:19.780> some<00:02:20.970> you'll<00:02:21.970> see

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
tape head baby powder some you'll see

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.040 
tape head baby powder some you'll see
it's<00:02:22.709> still<00:02:23.709> tight<00:02:24.010> on<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.310> edges<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.959> the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
it's still tight on the edges and in the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.540 
it's still tight on the edges and in the
center<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:26.440> pops<00:02:28.379> so<00:02:29.379> it<00:02:29.530> makes<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.920> much

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
center just pops so it makes it much

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.550 
center just pops so it makes it much
easier<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:32.010> get<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.129> 3d<00:02:33.400> prints<00:02:33.819> off<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.560> then

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
easier to get the 3d prints off and then

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.979 
easier to get the 3d prints off and then
we<00:02:35.680> can<00:02:35.860> just<00:02:36.129> work<00:02:37.030> on<00:02:37.269> peeling<00:02:37.569> them<00:02:37.810> away

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
we can just work on peeling them away

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.960 
we can just work on peeling them away
from<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.319> tape<00:02:39.959> instead<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.080> trying<00:02:41.349> to<00:02:41.970> fight

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
from the tape instead of trying to fight

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.930 
from the tape instead of trying to fight
to<00:02:43.000> get<00:02:43.360> everything<00:02:43.690> off<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.260> base<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:45.670> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
to get everything off of the base in the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.520 
to get everything off of the base in the
first<00:02:46.180> place<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:47.129> bending<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.220> 3d<00:02:48.550> prints<00:02:49.530> so

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
first place and bending the 3d prints so

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.250 
first place and bending the 3d prints so
there<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.099> is
