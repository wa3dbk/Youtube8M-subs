picture<00:00:48.370> one<00:00:48.610> is<00:00:48.730> in<00:00:48.850> LA<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:50.140> the

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
picture one is in LA and the

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.020 
picture one is in LA and the
significance<00:00:50.950> of<00:00:51.070> it<00:00:51.190> is<00:00:51.400> that<00:00:51.610> I<00:00:51.640> was<00:00:51.820> looking

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
significance of it is that I was looking

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.000 
significance of it is that I was looking
through<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.240> window<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.750> I<00:00:53.140> saw<00:00:53.290> this<00:00:53.320> twenty

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
through the window and I saw this twenty

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.710 
through the window and I saw this twenty
thousand<00:00:54.400> dollar<00:00:54.520> price<00:00:54.910> tag<00:00:54.940> on<00:00:55.360> this<00:00:55.510> pair

thousand dollar price tag on this pair
of<00:00:55.750> earrings<00:00:55.960> so<00:00:56.200> I<00:00:56.320> thought<00:00:56.560> that<00:00:56.740> a<00:00:56.770> is

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
of earrings so I thought that a is

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.880 
of earrings so I thought that a is
worthy<00:00:57.760> of<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:57.910> picture<00:00:58.120> so<00:00:58.710> we're<00:00:59.710> kind<00:00:59.860> of

worthy of a picture so we're kind of

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.980 
worthy of a picture so we're kind of
going<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.130> be<00:01:00.190> focusing<00:01:00.640> in<00:01:00.760> on<00:01:00.850> that<00:01:01.000> price<00:01:01.330> in

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
going to be focusing in on that price in

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.109 
going to be focusing in on that price in
our<00:01:02.110> animation<00:01:02.680> so<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.310> then<00:01:03.430> this<00:01:03.640> one<00:01:03.880> this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
images a little bit so I'm going to go

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.230 
images a little bit so I'm going to go
up<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.750> 10%<00:01:14.110> on<00:01:14.470> our<00:01:14.860> viewing<00:01:15.820> window<00:01:16.060> over

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.780 
up to 10% on our viewing window over
here<00:01:16.270> click<00:01:17.020> on<00:01:17.110> our<00:01:17.260> first<00:01:17.440> image<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.100> I'm

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
here click on our first image and I'm

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.240 
here click on our first image and I'm
going<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.380> make<00:01:20.380> this<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.560> little<00:01:20.710> bigger<00:01:20.920> so<00:01:21.159> we

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
going to make this a little bigger so we

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.560 
going to make this a little bigger so we
can<00:01:21.370> see<00:01:21.550> it<00:01:21.870> and<00:01:22.870> we<00:01:23.140> can<00:01:23.260> actually<00:01:23.409> take<00:01:23.710> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
can see it and we can actually take and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.950 
can see it and we can actually take and
scale<00:01:25.570> this<00:01:25.720> in<00:01:25.870> a<00:01:25.900> little<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.690> guess<00:01:28.810> we'll

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
scale this in a little and I guess we'll

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.570 
scale this in a little and I guess we'll
just<00:01:28.990> make<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.560> earrings<00:01:30.010> more<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.460> the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
just make the earrings more of the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.890 
just make the earrings more of the
foreground<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.180> then<00:01:31.270> we'll<00:01:31.360> kind<00:01:31.510> of<00:01:31.600> pan

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
foreground and then we'll kind of pan

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.020 
foreground and then we'll kind of pan
over<00:01:32.230> to<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.010> pricetag<00:01:33.550> because<00:01:33.790> that'll

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
over to the pricetag because that'll

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.380 
over to the pricetag because that'll
kind<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.270> be<00:01:34.390> more<00:01:34.720> of<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.870> dramatic<00:01:35.050> effect

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
kind of be more of a dramatic effect

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.790 
kind of be more of a dramatic effect
alright<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:37.690> now<00:01:37.900> that<00:01:37.930> we<00:01:38.080> have<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.350> what<00:01:38.680> we

alright so now that we have that what we
need<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.070> do<00:01:39.250> is<00:01:39.520> take<00:01:40.150> and<00:01:40.440> scale<00:01:41.440> this<00:01:41.560> back

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
need to do is take and scale this back

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.219 
need to do is take and scale this back
up<00:01:41.950> wing<00:01:42.490> over<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.880> effects<00:01:43.270> controls<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.020> in

this one we're only going to be using
position<00:02:31.300> but<00:02:31.450> if<00:02:31.540> you're<00:02:31.690> scaling<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.230> or

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
position but if you're scaling it or

position but if you're scaling it or
you're<00:02:32.530> rotating<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:33.100> you're<00:02:33.250> going<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.460> make

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
you're rotating it you're going to make

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.450 
you're rotating it you're going to make
sure<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.910> click<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.330> stopwatch<00:02:34.660> for<00:02:34.870> those

beginning of your clip click on the
stopwatch<00:02:43.540> for<00:02:44.050> position<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.650> you'll<00:02:44.890> see<00:02:45.040> it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
stopwatch for position and you'll see it

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.940 
stopwatch for position and you'll see it
adds<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.430> keyframe<00:02:45.730> right<00:02:45.850> there<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:46.950> what

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
adds a keyframe right there and so what

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.900 
adds a keyframe right there and so what
you<00:02:48.040> want<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.220> do<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.400> make<00:02:48.550> sure<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.730> your

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
you want to do is make sure that your

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.670 
you want to do is make sure that your
image<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.270> in<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.720> spot<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.350> want<00:02:50.380> it

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
image is in the spot that you want it

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.040 
image is in the spot that you want it
for<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.190> first<00:02:51.490> spot<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.180> want<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.930> look

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
for this first spot so I want it to look

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.290 
for this first spot so I want it to look
like<00:02:53.110> this<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.440> make<00:02:54.070> sure<00:02:54.100> then<00:02:54.940> we'll<00:02:55.060> put<00:02:55.210> in

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
like this so make sure then we'll put in

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.150 
like this so make sure then we'll put in
a<00:02:55.420> keyframe<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:56.170> we'll<00:02:56.410> go<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.980> end

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
a keyframe and so we'll go to the end

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.830 
a keyframe and so we'll go to the end
and<00:02:57.520> then<00:02:58.030> what<00:02:58.150> we<00:02:58.270> want<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.570> look<00:02:58.660> like

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
and then what we want it to look like

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.620 
and then what we want it to look like
there<00:02:59.460> will<00:03:00.460> basically<00:03:00.910> just<00:03:01.090> adjust<00:03:01.480> our

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
there will basically just adjust our

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.690 
there will basically just adjust our
image<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.350> it'll<00:03:02.890> automatically<00:03:03.310> insert

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
image and it'll automatically insert

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.220 
image and it'll automatically insert
another<00:03:03.820> keyframe<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:04.510> let's<00:03:04.900> say<00:03:05.020> that<00:03:05.170> we

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
another keyframe so let's say that we

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.200 
another keyframe so let's say that we
want<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.500> focus<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.280> on<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:07.120> price<00:03:07.570> tag<00:03:09.210> so

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
want to focus in on that price tag so

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.640 
want to focus in on that price tag so
now<00:03:10.300> you<00:03:10.360> can<00:03:10.570> see<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.110> is<00:03:11.170> added<00:03:11.470> in<00:03:11.590> a

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
now you can see that it is added in a

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.020 
now you can see that it is added in a
keyframe<00:03:11.950> there<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.430> we<00:03:12.490> have<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.670> nice<00:03:12.850> little

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
keyframe there and we have a nice little

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.640 
keyframe there and we have a nice little
motion<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.050> see<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.500> motion

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
motion and you can see that the motion

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.140 
motion and you can see that the motion
is<00:03:14.860> kind<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.070> denoted<00:03:15.430> by<00:03:15.550> this<00:03:15.700> little<00:03:16.000> line

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
is kind of denoted by this little line

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.550 
is kind of denoted by this little line
here<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.630> have<00:03:16.750> this<00:03:16.840> little<00:03:17.020> crosshair

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
here and you have this little crosshair

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.760 
here and you have this little crosshair
that<00:03:17.680> kind<00:03:17.890> of<00:03:17.950> follows<00:03:18.820> along<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:20.500> show<00:03:20.680> you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
that kind of follows along to show you

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.920 
that kind of follows along to show you
exactly<00:03:21.100> where<00:03:21.370> it's<00:03:21.460> going<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.610> go<00:03:21.820> so<00:03:22.660> we'll

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
exactly where it's going to go so we'll

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.990 
exactly where it's going to go so we'll
just<00:03:23.230> do<00:03:23.410> another<00:03:23.680> one<00:03:23.920> here<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.340> have<00:03:24.730> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
just do another one here I have the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.880 
just do another one here I have the
Hollywood<00:03:25.270> sign<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:26.020> we<00:03:26.110> can<00:03:26.260> take<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.710> click

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
Hollywood sign so we can take and click

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.720 
Hollywood sign so we can take and click
on<00:03:27.040> this<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.830> we'll<00:03:29.950> probably<00:03:30.100> just<00:03:30.310> scale<00:03:30.610> it

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
on this and we'll probably just scale it

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.640 
on this and we'll probably just scale it
out<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.850> little<00:03:31.030> bit<00:03:31.240> so<00:03:31.390> we<00:03:31.480> can<00:03:31.510> see<00:03:32.470> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
out a little bit so we can see the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.500 
out a little bit so we can see the
bounding<00:03:33.040> box<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.580> so<00:03:33.880> I'm<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:34.210> going<00:03:34.420> to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
bounding box and so I'm just going to

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.750 
bounding box and so I'm just going to
take<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:37.530> maybe<00:03:38.530> started<00:03:39.040> out<00:03:39.160> here<00:03:39.490> in<00:03:39.610> like

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
take and maybe started out here in like

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.110 
take and maybe started out here in like
the<00:03:39.910> shrubs<00:03:40.240> and<00:03:41.190> then<00:03:42.190> kind<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.490> pan<00:03:42.700> it<00:03:42.850> over

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
the shrubs and then kind of pan it over

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.970 
the shrubs and then kind of pan it over
to<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.480> right<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.500> we're<00:03:44.710> just<00:03:44.740> going<00:03:44.920> to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
to the right so we're just going to

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.950 
to the right so we're just going to
going<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.610> get<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.120> very<00:03:46.300> beginning<00:03:46.480> here

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
going to get to the very beginning here

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.250 
going to get to the very beginning here
open<00:03:47.440> up<00:03:47.530> motion<00:03:47.800> hit<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.490> stopwatch<00:03:49.260> scroll

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
open up motion hit the stopwatch scroll

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.190 
open up motion hit the stopwatch scroll
to<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.650> end<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:52.360> usually<00:03:52.780> it's<00:03:52.870> like<00:03:52.900> one

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
to the end and usually it's like one

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.840 
to the end and usually it's like one
keyframe<00:03:53.680> right<00:03:53.710> before<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.370> end<00:03:54.490> that's

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
keyframe right before the end that's

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.000 
keyframe right before the end that's
actually<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.420> last<00:03:55.800> spot<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:56.920> you<00:03:56.980> can

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
actually the last spot that you can

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.130 
actually the last spot that you can
actually<00:03:57.340> put<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.520> keyframe<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.180> then<00:03:58.990> we're

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
actually put a keyframe so then we're

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.260 
actually put a keyframe so then we're
going<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.350> take<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.740> drag<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.100> over<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:01.150> we

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
going to take and drag this over so we

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.840 
going to take and drag this over so we
can<00:04:01.390> see<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.660> Hollywood<00:04:01.840> sign<00:04:02.050> and<00:04:02.730> now<00:04:03.730> we

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
can see the Hollywood sign and now we

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.730 
can see the Hollywood sign and now we
have<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> nice<00:04:04.240> little<00:04:04.450> animation<00:04:04.750> for<00:04:05.590> that

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
have a nice little animation for that

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.830 
have a nice little animation for that
too<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.010> if<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.820> click<00:04:07.090> on<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.360> window<00:04:07.510> and

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
too so if I click on this window and

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.150 
too so if I click on this window and
then<00:04:07.930> hit<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.170> little<00:04:08.290> tilde<00:04:08.650> key<00:04:08.830> which<00:04:09.010> is

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
then hit the little tilde key which is

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.040 
then hit the little tilde key which is
right<00:04:09.400> next<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.760> one<00:04:09.910> it'll<00:04:10.540> open<00:04:10.690> it<00:04:10.930> up

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
right next to the one it'll open it up

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.780 
right next to the one it'll open it up
in<00:04:11.200> full<00:04:11.470> screen<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:12.040> then<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.250> can<00:04:12.370> go<00:04:12.460> down<00:04:12.490> to

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
in full screen and then I can go down to

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.660 
in full screen and then I can go down to
like<00:04:13.060> 50%<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:13.990> show<00:04:14.710> you<00:04:14.770> guys<00:04:14.950> what<00:04:15.340> we<00:04:15.460> have

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
like 50% and show you guys what we have

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.020 
like 50% and show you guys what we have
so<00:04:15.910> now<00:04:16.090> we<00:04:16.720> have<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.870> nice<00:04:17.400> pan<00:04:18.400> over<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.730> the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
so now we have a nice pan over to the

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.320 
so now we have a nice pan over to the
pricetag<00:04:20.430> then<00:04:21.430> we<00:04:21.520> can<00:04:21.670> pan<00:04:21.910> over<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.240> the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
pricetag then we can pan over to the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.710 
pricetag then we can pan over to the
Hollywood<00:04:22.750> sign<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.610> it<00:04:24.730> really<00:04:25.000> helps<00:04:25.630> you

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
Hollywood sign so it really helps you

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.600 
Hollywood sign so it really helps you
give<00:04:25.900> especially<00:04:26.650> for<00:04:26.800> still<00:04:27.040> image<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.430> help

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
give especially for still image to help

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.930 
give especially for still image to help
help<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.300> give<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.780> much<00:04:29.230> more<00:04:29.470> cinematic

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
help you give a much more cinematic

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.060 
help you give a much more cinematic
effect<00:04:30.940> those<00:04:31.870> two<00:04:32.140> images<00:04:32.560> just

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
effect those two images just

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.290 
effect those two images just
on<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.460> screen<00:04:33.760> in<00:04:34.600> like<00:04:34.810> slideshow<00:04:36.300> version

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
on the screen in like slideshow version

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.970 
on the screen in like slideshow version
would<00:04:37.450> not<00:04:37.660> be<00:04:37.840> as<00:04:38.080> appealing<00:04:38.440> as<00:04:38.740> this

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
would not be as appealing as this

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.560 
would not be as appealing as this
definitely<00:04:39.850> gives<00:04:40.000> another<00:04:40.150> layer<00:04:40.450> of

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
definitely gives another layer of

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.010 
definitely gives another layer of
interest<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.350> your<00:04:41.620> work<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:43.660> if<00:04:43.810> you're<00:04:43.930> doing

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
interest to your work so if you're doing

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.330 
interest to your work so if you're doing
anything<00:04:44.290> with<00:04:44.440> images<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.890> would<00:04:45.010> definitely

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
anything with images I would definitely

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.880 
anything with images I would definitely
recommend<00:04:45.480> using<00:04:46.480> a<00:04:46.780> pan<00:04:47.110> effect<00:04:47.440> you<00:04:47.740> might

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
recommend using a pan effect you might

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.340 
recommend using a pan effect you might
not<00:04:48.580> have<00:04:48.790> it<00:04:48.850> as<00:04:49.150> zoomed<00:04:49.390> in<00:04:49.570> here<00:04:49.810> but<00:04:49.990> just<00:04:50.260> a

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
not have it as zoomed in here but just a

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.890 
not have it as zoomed in here but just a
little<00:04:50.470> bit<00:04:50.680> of<00:04:50.770> movement<00:04:50.920> helps<00:04:51.750> keep<00:04:52.750> the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
little bit of movement helps keep the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.040

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
showed you specifically still images but

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.470 
showed you specifically still images but
you<00:04:59.920> can<00:05:00.160> do<00:05:00.340> this<00:05:00.460> with<00:05:00.730> I'm<00:05:00.970> pretty<00:05:01.360> sure

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
you can do this with I'm pretty sure

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.210 
you can do this with I'm pretty sure
video<00:05:01.810> clips<00:05:02.140> and<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.440> know<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:02.650> can<00:05:02.860> also<00:05:03.010> do

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
video clips and I know you can also do

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.830 
video clips and I know you can also do
it<00:05:03.340> with<00:05:03.490> text<00:05:04.000> like<00:05:04.180> if<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:04.480> were<00:05:04.600> to<00:05:04.720> go<00:05:04.810> up

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
it with text like if you were to go up

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.530 
it with text like if you were to go up
and<00:05:05.080> make<00:05:05.220> titles<00:05:06.220> like<00:05:06.640> a<00:05:06.700> new<00:05:06.910> title<00:05:07.120> you<00:05:07.390> can

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
and make titles like a new title you can

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.650 
and make titles like a new title you can
take<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:07.990> animate<00:05:08.410> that<00:05:08.590> as<00:05:08.770> well<00:05:09.540> so<00:05:10.540> I<00:05:10.570> would

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
take and animate that as well so I would

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.600 
take and animate that as well so I would
definitely<00:05:11.050> recommend<00:05:11.230> using<00:05:11.770> After<00:05:12.280> Effects

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
definitely recommend using After Effects
