00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.070 
roll seven years it's fashion it's fun
but<00:01:35.539> it's<00:01:35.599> also<00:01:35.750> really<00:01:36.050> directional

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
but it's also really directional

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.110 
but it's also really directional
the<00:01:38.620> very<00:01:38.890> dramatic<00:01:39.370> fashion<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.910> there's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
the very dramatic fashion is there's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.560 
the very dramatic fashion is there's
like<00:01:40.330> Vikings<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.530> charter<00:01:42.460> hordes<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.300> I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
like Vikings and charter hordes and I

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.820 
like Vikings and charter hordes and I
think<00:01:43.900> some<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.290> things<00:01:44.560> are<00:01:44.740> very

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
think some of the things are very

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.610 
think some of the things are very
reminiscent<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:46.270> peasant<00:01:46.990> shirts<00:01:47.230> and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
reminiscent of the peasant shirts and

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.740 
reminiscent of the peasant shirts and
the<00:01:48.040> things<00:01:48.430> we<00:01:48.610> wore<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.850> lot<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.240> sixties

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
the things we wore a lot in the sixties

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.590 
the things we wore a lot in the sixties
it<00:01:50.110> comes<00:01:50.320> from<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.620> very<00:01:50.920> dramatic<00:01:51.520> part<00:01:52.360> of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
it comes from the very dramatic part of

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.000 
it comes from the very dramatic part of
the<00:01:52.870> universe<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:54.960> love<00:01:55.960> nostalgia<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.620> love

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.400 
the universe I love nostalgia I love
figuring<00:01:57.310> out<00:01:57.730> what<00:01:58.210> it<00:01:58.330> is<00:01:58.480> that's<00:01:58.750> making<00:01:58.870> me

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
figuring out what it is that's making me

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.110 
figuring out what it is that's making me
excited<00:01:59.680> when<00:01:59.980> I<00:02:00.010> look<00:02:00.250> at<00:02:00.430> it<00:02:00.550> like<00:02:00.670> what<00:02:00.940> is
