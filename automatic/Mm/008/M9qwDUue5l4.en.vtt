00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
videos were a lot of catch-up I was

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.870

slacking<00:01:54.810> before<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.649> um<00:01:55.829> felt<00:01:56.790> they

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
slacking before that but um felt they

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.280

reviews<00:01:58.649> come<00:01:59.640> over<00:01:59.820> views<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.509> think<00:02:00.719> it

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
reviews come over views now I think it

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.039 
reviews come over views now I think it
was<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.290> actually<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.780> no<00:02:03.780> speed

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
was just one actually and then no speed

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.319 
was just one actually and then no speed
arts<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.530> did<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> unboxings<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.060> stuff

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.680 
arts but I did the unboxings and stuff
so<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.530> lookout<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.009> and

want to put up actually kind of crammed

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.480 
want to put up actually kind of crammed
this<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> last<00:02:40.620> day<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> month<00:02:41.100> year

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
this in the last day of the month year

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.750 
this in the last day of the month year
so<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.630> being<00:02:42.810> said<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.440> little<00:02:44.340> late<00:02:44.520> I

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
so that being said it's a little late I

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.740 
so that being said it's a little late I
apologize<00:02:45.360> for<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:46.160> but<00:02:47.160> that's<00:02:47.670> all<00:02:48.480> good

apologize for that but that's all good
in<00:02:48.870> my<00:02:48.990> opinion<00:02:49.020> it's<00:02:49.500> better<00:02:49.680> late<00:02:49.860> than

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
in my opinion it's better late than

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.890 
in my opinion it's better late than
never<00:02:50.280> last<00:02:50.700> day<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.000> month<00:02:51.060> still<00:02:51.510> counts

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
never last day of the month still counts

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.380 
never last day of the month still counts

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.040 
of its like mash ups and stuff so I have
to<00:05:18.710> be<00:05:18.800> careful<00:05:18.979> as<00:05:19.370> to<00:05:19.630> which<00:05:20.630> ones<00:05:20.870> i'm

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
to be careful as to which ones i'm

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.469 
to be careful as to which ones i'm
allowed<00:05:21.289> to<00:05:21.319> use<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.979> fear<00:05:22.430> of<00:05:22.520> copyright<00:05:23.090> but

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
allowed to use and fear of copyright but

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.170 
allowed to use and fear of copyright but
I<00:05:23.680> previewed<00:05:24.680> a<00:05:24.740> bunch<00:05:24.949> of<00:05:25.069> them<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.490> they<00:05:26.030> all

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
I previewed a bunch of them and they all

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.719 
I previewed a bunch of them and they all
seem<00:05:26.419> to<00:05:26.479> be<00:05:26.719> a<00:05:27.020> fair<00:05:27.680> like<00:05:28.069> deviation<00:05:28.610> from

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
seem to be a fair like deviation from

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.249 
seem to be a fair like deviation from
the<00:05:28.909> original<00:05:29.270> song<00:05:29.509> so<00:05:29.810> I<00:05:29.840> don't<00:05:30.050> think<00:05:30.110> it

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
the original song so I don't think it

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.659 
the original song so I don't think it
should<00:05:30.380> be<00:05:30.409> picked<00:05:30.650> up<00:05:30.770> for<00:05:30.949> copyright<00:05:31.490> as

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
should be picked up for copyright as

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.820 
should be picked up for copyright as
that<00:05:32.270> just<00:05:32.300> makes<00:05:32.659> a<00:05:32.810> hassle<00:05:33.169> on<00:05:33.229> my<00:05:33.409> end<00:05:33.680> of
