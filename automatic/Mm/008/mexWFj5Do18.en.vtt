00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.759
 two different capsule systems with 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.830
 the same goal with perfect espresso 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.719
 a nice solid chandler today 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.300
 I compare the nespresso system with 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.269
 the capsule system of lavazza which 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.980
 These two systems have the nose in front 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.930
 Let's start with the machines price of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.550
 Price for the coffee capsule machine is 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.539
 for many customers already the first 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.730
 important criterion for a coffee capsule 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.820
 machine for nespresso capsule is from ca 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.410
 To have 90 euros 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.200
 a capsule machine from lavazza is 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.620
 already much cheaper to get 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.910
 These are available from about 40 euros 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.989
 Now I want to look at the quality of the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.690
 machines 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.969
 Overall, all machines will not care if 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.579
 lavazza or nespresso from well-known 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.140
 However, manufacturers produced make 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.210
 the coffee capsule machines for the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.270
 nespresso capsules a more stable and 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.370
 better processed impression with the la 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.289
 machine wobble some parts like 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.520
 for example, the coffee spout 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.610
 in addition, the drained weight is also low 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.110
 made of plastic at the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.600
 Nespresso machines is this off 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 metal 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.070
 The shutter lever is at both 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.900
 Machines made of metal and power 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.710
 Both machines have a stable and 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.710
 firm impression 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.770
 Next I want to go to the capsule 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.470
 price of the two systems 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.050
 a pack that costs espresso capsules 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.530
 between three euros fifty and four euros 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.280
 20 encapsulate a package of lavazza 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.140
 costs five euros 99 in the pack 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.860
 but also 16 coffee capsules 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.470
 contain 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.460
 at nespresso there are just ten 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.720
 coffee capsules at lavazza makes this 1 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.520
 capsule price of about 37 cents at 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.060
 nespresso is the capsule price 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.860
 between 35 and 42 cents priced 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.640
 the coffee capsules differ 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.500
 so not next, I'll leave 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.520
 Both machines the testing process of a 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.140
 go through espresso once 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.120
 I try the test procedure as possible 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.470
 to run parallel so that you 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.950
 a better comparison of the two 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.120
 machines also get the cafÃ© result 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.790
 I will be together afterwards 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.560
 to compare 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.600
 at the espresso machine will be with 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.690
 a button press automatically 40 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.780
 milliliter of water spent 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.519
 at the lasa, the test procedure must be more comfortable 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.850
 be stopped manually with a 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.320
 further pressure on the button 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.880
 from the volume differ 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.060
 the two machines are not much 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.090
 the nespresso fixie machine is 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.830
 but slightly louder than that 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.140
 lavazza probably at the speed of 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.830
 greens clearly wins the nespresso 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.040
 machine the test procedure is already 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.380
 be completed significantly faster 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.270
 we can wait for the machine 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.900
 I once briefly on the varieties 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.270
 enter 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.420
 at nespresso, there are 19 permanently 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.560
 are different varieties at lavazza 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.480
 it's just nine varieties now 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.970
 I finish the test at the la 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.459
 machine because the cashier is well filled 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.380
 I crushed her as I have already said 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.970
 again the taste for the coffee 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.080
 result in both machines 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.810
 very good overall 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.890
 it is a beautiful chandler on the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.890
 espresso recognizable 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.230
 the climate at the lavazza espresso here 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.290
 right in the picture is clearly darker 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:06.120
 as pronounced in the capsule nespresso 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.160
 the cream but with both the system 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.790
 ejection of the coffee capsules works 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.830
 at the la tavola not always optimal 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.380
 with the espresso pixi the capsules land 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.479
 Reliable in the collecting tank at the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.250
 lasa must now and then with his finger 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:24.390
 to be helped now we look 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.610
 but once the consumed 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.440
 coffee capsules on here once the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.260
 coffee capsule from lavazza 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:37.200
 here are the obvious holes on the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.540
 bottom was the nespresso capsule 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.860
 also punctured 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.600
 but the holes are clear here 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.040
 smaller 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.470
 the detailed report is closed 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.310
