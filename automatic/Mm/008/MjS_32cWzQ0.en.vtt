00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:10.292
Swedish FA and Aftonbladets' award for the best Swedish player of the year, Guldbollen

00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:14.160
Is awarded a player who's writing his and Sweden's history

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.166
On his own level

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:21.124
With records and titles he challanges, in the same time,

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:23.657
our age and the future

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:26.770
The 2014 trophy is awarded

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.442
Zlatan Ibrahimovic

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:06.080
What do you say after nine trophies?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.519
I don't think there is much to say

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:11.386
The trophies speak for themselves

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:15.969
I'm still living my childhood dream

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.437
All these awards that I've recieved

00:01:20.437 --> 00:01:24.332
It means that I've achieved something

00:01:24.332 --> 00:01:26.960
and that I'm good at what I'm doing but

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.403
It's overshadowed by what happened to Klas Ingesson and Pontus SegerstrÃ¶m

00:01:32.403 --> 00:01:38.820
I had a brother who passed away a couple of months ago in a similar disease

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.558
There's a life besides football that is much more important than this

00:01:45.558 --> 00:01:48.096
So... May they rest in peace

00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:51.721
And many thanks to those who've helped me on and off the pitch

00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:55.181
Without you this award wouldn't be possible
