00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.700
 number 5 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.230
 the saga of resident level has left 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.820
 mark in this world since 1996 the 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.370
 first three successes of this franchise 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.930
 they were amazing who played them 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.960
 will remember the moments when the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:42.210
 game left us pale with fright by 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.210
 example the hamsters 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.990
 colombian 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.830
 bayern munich to the severe ones with their 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.830
 casual tickets through the window 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.380
 ah 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.450
 the zombies in the windows 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.970
 i 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.070
 and of course in level 3 networks 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.070
 always this happened 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.490
 over the years it was 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.530
 evolving until you reach a shooter 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.570
 in the third person have also been taken out 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.619
 the remix of the first installment and the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.619
 Westin debut is given 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.950
 I certainly look forward to the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.950
 following deliveries of this saga 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.380
 number 4 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.150
 the walking dead ' has been and continues to be 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.030
 one of my favorite games with the best 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.160
 plot action suspense and sadness in his 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.660
 history is like watching a series of 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.090
 zombies with the exception that you 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.890
 you can handle the main character and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.340
 your decisions affect the development of 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.340
 the story 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.459
 your characters your dialogue your 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.930
 expressions are very realistic and the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.319
 time to make life decisions or 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.269
 death 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.410
 the player comes across a very dilemma 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.550
 complicated and in certain cases stressful 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.010
 with the start of the second season 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.239
 the adventures and situations are every time 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.239
 more exciting 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.810
 my favorite game with the best story of 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.810
 zombies and the position 4 of this list 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.680
 number 3 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.340
 Outlast renewed the way to play 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.160
 like other games called amnesia 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.380
 and slender since in them the players 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.150
 they have to survive without any weapons and 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.410
 go around the game running away or 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.410
 hiding from the enemy 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.460
 puts us in a state of alert to everything 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.650
 also when collecting batteries 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.510
 for the night-time conviction camera 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.790
 that without it , it is difficult for us to see 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.510
 darkness making the fire a 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.510
 true challenge 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.310
 a dlc of this title is already removed and 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.040
 answers some questions of origin 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.940
 of the same 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.940
 a great body 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.270
 number 2 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.110
 maybe a bit of controversy was created in 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.480
 my video for putting dead space after 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.070
 others but the reason for this is that dead 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.810
 space is my favorite game of 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.110
 alien survival for many 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.110
 things between them is their story their 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.000
 environment enemies and characters from the 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.310
 first delivery leaves many things to 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.830
 air with its end in the second installment 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.360
 it also leaves a bit of mystery and in the 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:14.229
 third leaves you wanting more or good 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.229
 in my case that happened 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.900
 dead space a third person shooter 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.220
 which develops in space and 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.160
 player is faced with a great 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.240
 variety of mutated aliens 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.860
 unfortunately the company that did 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.620
 this game did not get enough 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.970
 gains to continue this trilogy 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.800
 but it is said that the developers do not 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.770
 they plan to leave the trilogy there 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.090
 and maybe in the future we will see new 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.930
 deliveries of these great games 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.930
 all 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.069
 number 1 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.180
 This title has not yet come out but soon 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.610
 the players will be facing a new 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.500
 survival horror to all rule the 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.120
 producer of this game is the same as 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.419
 the review and bud and is receiving 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.669
 good reviews have already taken demos 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.050
 from him and from what I've seen this game 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.020
 will be different in the fields of 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.729
 terror and playability your enemies and your 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.949
 environment give an uncomfortable feeling and 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.540
 troubling for the player this causes 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.520
 that creates a perspective of fear and 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.310
 anguish that's what I liked about this 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.740
 title its launch is in august and 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:50.310
 I will be there to see it 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.310
 and nothing else to see it because there is no money 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.840
 I have hopes that de evÃ­n 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.840
 whiting is an excellent game 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.690
 good until my top has arrived if the
