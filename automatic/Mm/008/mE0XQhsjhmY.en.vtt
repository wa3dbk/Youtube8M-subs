00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
okay I've got this all processed there's

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.010 
okay I've got this all processed there's
a<00:02:45.550> couple<00:02:45.910> pieces<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.540> are<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.780> little<00:02:46.930> bit

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
a couple pieces that are a little bit

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.120 
a couple pieces that are a little bit
bigger<00:02:47.290> but<00:02:49.500> which<00:02:50.500> I've<00:02:50.680> got<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:50.980> there

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
bigger but which I've got in there

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.040 
bigger but which I've got in there
there's<00:02:51.640> probably<00:02:52.000> my<00:02:52.480> guess<00:02:52.660> would<00:02:52.780> be<00:02:52.840> about

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
there's probably my guess would be about

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.690 
there's probably my guess would be about
three<00:02:53.290> pounds<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.300> i'm<00:02:55.540> going<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.780> add

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
three pounds so to this i'm going to add

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.270 
three pounds so to this i'm going to add
right<00:02:57.700> around<00:02:57.940> two<00:02:58.239> cups<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.720> sugar<00:02:59.130> you<00:03:00.130> can

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
right around two cups of sugar you can

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.440 
right around two cups of sugar you can
probably<00:03:00.459> use<00:03:00.610> any<00:03:00.880> kind<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.090> sweetener<00:03:01.390> that

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
probably use any kind of sweetener that

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.030 
probably use any kind of sweetener that
you<00:03:01.690> want<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.019> if<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.230> want<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.650> use<00:03:02.800> honey

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
you want it if you want it to use honey

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.310 
you want it if you want it to use honey
you<00:03:03.220> could<00:03:03.370> probably<00:03:03.550> use<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.300> or<00:03:04.630> like<00:03:05.260> a

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
you could probably use that or like a

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.020 
you could probably use that or like a
mix<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.800> something<00:03:06.190> or<00:03:06.340> if<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.670> would<00:03:06.970> rather

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
mix of something or if you would rather

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.009 
mix of something or if you would rather
use<00:03:07.709> like<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:09.000> stevia<00:03:10.000> or<00:03:10.330> something<00:03:10.900> like

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
use like the stevia or something like

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.650 
use like the stevia or something like
that<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.260> could<00:03:11.440> probably<00:03:11.620> use<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.190> as<00:03:12.340> well

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
that you could probably use that as well

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.960 
that you could probably use that as well
but<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.720> have<00:03:14.080> sugar<00:03:14.850> lots<00:03:15.850> of<00:03:16.000> sugar<00:03:17.820> this<00:03:18.820> is

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
but I have sugar lots of sugar this is

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.490 
but I have sugar lots of sugar this is
that<00:03:19.120> these<00:03:19.269> are<00:03:19.510> Jonathan<00:03:19.810> apples<00:03:20.350> so

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
that these are Jonathan apples so

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.130 
that these are Jonathan apples so
they're<00:03:20.650> going<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.890> be<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.570> little<00:03:22.570> more<00:03:22.810> turf

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
they're going to be a little more turf

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.380 
they're going to be a little more turf
than<00:03:23.380> say<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.680> Red<00:03:24.220> Delicious<00:03:24.250> or<00:03:24.880> something<00:03:25.239> if

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
than say a Red Delicious or something if

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.729 
than say a Red Delicious or something if
you<00:03:25.510> can<00:03:25.630> use<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.810> cooking<00:03:26.110> apple<00:03:26.590> you'll

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
you can use a cooking apple you'll

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.390 
you can use a cooking apple you'll
probably<00:03:27.280> be<00:03:27.640> better<00:03:27.880> off<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.250> is<00:03:30.280> not

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
probably be better off so this is not

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.190 
probably be better off so this is not
quite<00:03:30.640> two<00:03:30.820> cups<00:03:31.120> but<00:03:31.480> about<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.720> couple<00:03:32.049> three

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
quite two cups but about a couple three

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.410 
quite two cups but about a couple three
quarters<00:03:32.560> i<00:03:32.650> guess<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.480> then<00:03:35.470> i<00:03:35.500> let<00:03:35.769> it<00:03:35.799> add

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
quarters i guess and then i let it add

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.930 
quarters i guess and then i let it add
about<00:03:37.420> 2<00:03:38.290> teaspoons<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.980> soon

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.540 

so<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:45.080> will<00:03:45.260> usually<00:03:45.500> not<00:03:45.890> real<00:03:46.100> scientific

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
so that will usually not real scientific

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.640 
so that will usually not real scientific
about<00:03:46.880> any<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.150> my<00:03:47.270> cooking<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:47.900> if<00:03:48.500> you're

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
about any of my cooking so if you're

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.820 
about any of my cooking so if you're
baking<00:03:49.100> that's<00:03:49.310> one<00:03:49.580> thing<00:03:49.760> but<00:03:49.820> just<00:03:50.830> stuff

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
baking that's one thing but just stuff

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:59.290 
baking that's one thing but just stuff
like<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:57.340> I'm<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.490> big<00:03:58.640> fan<00:03:58.820> of<00:03:58.850> cinnamon

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
all right I'm going to cook this on high

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.110 
all right I'm going to cook this on high
for<00:05:35.570> about<00:05:35.630> an<00:05:35.990> hour<00:05:36.169> then<00:05:36.760> I'm<00:05:37.760> going<00:05:37.909> to<00:05:37.940> turn

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
for about an hour then I'm going to turn

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.320 
for about an hour then I'm going to turn
it<00:05:38.270> down<00:05:38.300> on<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.720> low<00:05:39.010> and<00:05:40.010> so<00:05:40.729> this<00:05:40.940> says<00:05:41.150> like

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
it down on the low and so this says like

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.740 
it down on the low and so this says like
eight<00:05:41.659> to<00:05:41.900> ten<00:05:42.080> hours<00:05:42.229> and<00:05:43.240> other<00:05:44.240> people<00:05:44.659> have

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
eight to ten hours and other people have

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.719 
eight to ten hours and other people have
said<00:05:48.310> sometimes<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.430> takes<00:05:49.550> longer<00:05:49.669> than<00:05:49.970> that

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.879 
you get down to the point where this
starts<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:57.970> thicken<00:05:58.970> up<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.479> way<00:06:00.470> they<00:06:00.500> said
