 The body map of the most popular conversation on eplan broadcasts is Key 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:29.200
 I asked what is the best way to communicate. 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:34.090
 I am very curious to know what the answer will be after 5 answers. 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.489
 I thought it would be a tremendous answer, but his answer surprisingly 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:42.550
 Simple and commanded. 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:47.320
 Are you reminiscent of the secret to good conversation and your response to Spirit? 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.860

 The word that emphasizes attitude. 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:31.690
 I think the listing is not as easy as listening or saying. 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:37.270
 I want to talk about my own position first when I talk with the other person, 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:42.670
 I think it's a lot more open to assertion than to hear it . 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:46.920

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.970
