00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:09.269

 janne meyer and lambrasco paul 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.150
 ShockemÃ¶hle a face as if he had 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.050
 ridden himself and would be five 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.050
 Thrown out 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.970
 so the little pug cross I can do it 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.170
 hardly wait 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.210
 he does not know what is there and he will 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.980
 it's with his acrobatic one too 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.110
 0 today to leave so we too 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.590
 already the big price of aachen 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.590
 made 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.310
 that's it you have to ride in the 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.670
 combination then upswing for the 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.670
 oxer and then it works so fast 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.730
 she makes the right district step in 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.770
 she can do it three times now 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.710
 usually ride a bit though 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.040
 you will be a little too far here on the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.870
 away to the victim slight uncertainty 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.370
 documented by the easier one 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.370
 call with the hindquarters 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.900
 can be a bit plastic tape 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.810
 the court nothing serious praise 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.380
 I stepped down, I do not know 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.770
 too bad two drops today, too, we have 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.880
 limit he has tried all the arrows 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.740
 to put the black one 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.740
 At the end the suitcase was empty 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.330
 she comes fit reimann must swing 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.740
 bring up here as a horse and as a rider 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.569
 otherwise the ox will be too far in the 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.500
 three times come back immediately 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.420
 shorten 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.530
 here she is played under harmonica 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.790
 the saddle and if not 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:41.580
 works then the harmony is that 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.580
 Here is far and far and happened
