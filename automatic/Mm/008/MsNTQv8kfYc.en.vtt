let me show you how that works

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.350 
let me show you how that works
once<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.490> attach<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.969> quick-release

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
once we attach this quick-release

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.180 
once we attach this quick-release
baseplate<00:02:06.960> right<00:02:07.530> now<00:02:07.680> I'm<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.950> use<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
baseplate right now I'm going to use it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.710 
baseplate right now I'm going to use it
on<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> Canon<00:02:08.640> t4i<00:02:08.970> because<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.569> really

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
on the Canon t4i because it's really

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.860 
on the Canon t4i because it's really
targeted<00:02:10.289> for<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:11.550> consumer<00:02:12.090> market

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
targeted for the consumer market

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.390 
targeted for the consumer market
it's<00:02:13.200> more<00:02:13.379> affordable

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
it's more affordable

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.380 
it's more affordable

it's a 3.2 inch LCD back here and the
magnetic<00:03:07.859> system<00:03:08.069> back<00:03:08.459> here<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:08.909> a

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
magnetic system back here it's a

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.610 
magnetic system back here it's a
quick-release<00:03:09.569> system<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.409> what<00:03:10.530> you're

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
quick-release system so what you're

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.929 
quick-release system so what you're
going<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.769> do<00:03:10.889> is<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.099> going<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.310> pull<00:03:11.639> it<00:03:11.790> out

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
going to do is just going to pull it out

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.420 
going to do is just going to pull it out
of<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.659> back<00:03:12.840> here<00:03:13.170> now<00:03:13.799> if<00:03:13.889> you<00:03:13.950> look<00:03:14.129> closely

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
of the back here now if you look closely

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.330 
of the back here now if you look closely
the<00:03:14.700> way<00:03:14.819> this<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.180> designed<00:03:15.950> it's<00:03:16.950> got<00:03:17.069> a<00:03:17.099> huge

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
the way this is designed it's got a huge

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.670 
the way this is designed it's got a huge
magnet<00:03:17.909> back<00:03:18.060> here<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.480> attaches<00:03:18.750> behind

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
magnet back here that attaches behind

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.220 
magnet back here that attaches behind
the<00:03:19.829> quick-release<00:03:20.250> plate<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.480> actually<00:03:21.840> is

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
the quick-release plate and actually is

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.020 
the quick-release plate and actually is
very<00:03:22.500> strong<00:03:22.859> so<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.430> see<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.579> can<00:03:23.819> hold

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
very strong so you can see I can hold

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.809 
very strong so you can see I can hold
the<00:03:24.180> viewfinder<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.620> t4i<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.760> I

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
the viewfinder up with this t4i and I

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.110 
the viewfinder up with this t4i and I
have<00:03:26.970> at<00:03:27.120> oakiness<00:03:27.480> 11<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.379> 16<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.760> wouldn't

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
have at oakiness 11 to 16 so I wouldn't

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.550 
have at oakiness 11 to 16 so I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:30.239> holding<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.989> camera<00:03:31.169> this<00:03:31.409> way

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
recommend holding the camera this way

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.890 
recommend holding the camera this way
but<00:03:31.799> it<00:03:31.919> is<00:03:31.949> it<00:03:32.579> will<00:03:32.819> support<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.750> weight

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
but it is it will support the weight

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.920 
but it is it will support the weight
quite<00:03:34.379> well<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:35.190> at<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.760> same<00:03:35.940> time<00:03:36.209> when

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
quite well but at the same time when

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.680 
quite well but at the same time when
you're<00:03:37.139> not<00:03:37.440> using<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:38.010> viewfinder<00:03:38.909> you're

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
you're not using the viewfinder you're

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.509 
you're not using the viewfinder you're
just<00:03:39.810> going<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.989> pull<00:03:40.169> it<00:03:40.290> up<00:03:40.349> pull<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.250> off<00:03:41.400> the

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
just going to pull it up pull it off the

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.640 
just going to pull it up pull it off the
back<00:03:41.669> of<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:41.909> camera<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.750> it's<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.959> nice<00:03:43.109> fast

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
back of the camera so it's a nice fast

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.280 
back of the camera so it's a nice fast

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
system works very well magnet is very

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.199 
system works very well magnet is very
strong<00:03:46.650> especially<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.790> way<00:03:47.909> it<00:03:47.940> was

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
strong especially the way it was

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.360 
strong especially the way it was
designed<00:03:48.449> where<00:03:49.409> it<00:03:49.500> has<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.769> insert<00:03:50.099> into<00:03:50.280> a

your own quick-release plate system but
one<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.440> most<00:04:01.590> unique<00:04:01.979> things<00:04:02.209> about<00:04:03.209> this

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
one of the most unique things about this

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.610 
one of the most unique things about this
entire<00:04:03.720> setup<00:04:04.079> here<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:05.280> this<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.359> a<00:04:06.620> 501

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
entire setup here is that this is a 501

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.069 
entire setup here is that this is a 501
compatible<00:04:08.280> plate<00:04:08.609> that<00:04:09.510> will<00:04:09.629> work<00:04:09.780> on<00:04:10.049> a

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
compatible plate that will work on a

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.879 
compatible plate that will work on a
head<00:04:10.409> like<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.650> 701<00:04:11.750> so<00:04:12.750> if<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.019> notice<00:04:13.620> here<00:04:13.650> I

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
head like a 701 so if you notice here I

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.949 
head like a 701 so if you notice here I
can<00:04:14.099> attach<00:04:14.370> this<00:04:14.609> entire<00:04:15.419> base<00:04:15.690> plate

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
can attach this entire base plate

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.439 
can attach this entire base plate
directly<00:04:16.849> to<00:04:17.849> my<00:04:18.000> 701<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:20.760> only<00:04:21.120> thing<00:04:21.299> that

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
directly to my 701 the only thing that

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.950 
directly to my 701 the only thing that
you<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.750> be<00:04:22.610> aware<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.120> these

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
you have to be aware of is that these

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.560 
you have to be aware of is that these
brackets<00:04:25.349> back<00:04:25.800> here<00:04:26.250> won't<00:04:27.090> allow<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.360> to

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
brackets back here won't allow you to

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.190 
brackets back here won't allow you to
push<00:04:27.779> it<00:04:27.930> all

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
push it all

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.870 
push it all
all<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.410> way<00:04:28.500> forward<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.100> slide<00:04:29.400> back<00:04:29.430> and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
all the way forward and slide back and

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.780 
all the way forward and slide back and
forth<00:04:29.970> on<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:31.170> 701<00:04:31.650> head<00:04:31.830> but<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.250> plate<00:04:32.550> is

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
forth on a 701 head but the plate is

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.770 
forth on a 701 head but the plate is
compatible<00:04:33.390> when<00:04:34.320> you're<00:04:34.470> not<00:04:34.790> using<00:04:35.790> the

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
compatible when you're not using the

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.200 
compatible when you're not using the
viewfinder<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.800> course<00:04:38.160> then<00:04:38.730> you<00:04:38.880> can<00:04:39.030> push

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
viewfinder of course then you can push

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.690 
viewfinder of course then you can push
it<00:04:39.360> further<00:04:39.570> into<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.050> head<00:04:40.890> all<00:04:41.340> right<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:41.670> I

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
it further into the head all right so I

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.660 
it further into the head all right so I
just<00:04:42.060> installed<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.980> standard<00:04:43.980> Manfrotto

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
just installed the standard Manfrotto

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.540 
just installed the standard Manfrotto
quick-release<00:04:45.120> baseplate<00:04:45.890> underneath<00:04:46.890> the

quick-release baseplate underneath the
qv1<00:04:48.210> baseplate<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.350> as<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:49.590> can<00:04:49.680> see<00:04:49.800> it'll

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
qv1 baseplate so as you can see it'll

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.880 
qv1 baseplate so as you can see it'll
work<00:04:50.250> as<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.490> standard<00:04:51.360> quick-release<00:04:51.990> system

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
if you don't want to use the base plate

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.940 
if you don't want to use the base plate

thing that's going to be released is a

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.350 
thing that's going to be released is a
very<00:05:04.230> simple<00:05:04.890> rail<00:05:05.220> kit<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:06.060> will<00:05:06.150> mount

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
very simple rail kit that will mount

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.260 
very simple rail kit that will mount

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
directly to the Q view on base plate now

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.210 
directly to the Q view on base plate now
the<00:05:09.750> qv1<00:05:10.080> base<00:05:10.350> plate<00:05:10.620> is<00:05:10.650> kind<00:05:10.950> of<00:05:11.010> based

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
the qv1 base plate is kind of based

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.760 
the qv1 base plate is kind of based
around<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.580> Manfrotto<00:05:12.170> 501<00:05:13.170> PL<00:05:13.500> it's<00:05:13.710> a

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
around the Manfrotto 501 PL it's a

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.920 
around the Manfrotto 501 PL it's a
little<00:05:14.010> bit<00:05:14.100> shorter<00:05:14.520> but<00:05:15.090> it's<00:05:15.510> based<00:05:15.750> on

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
little bit shorter but it's based on

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.160 
little bit shorter but it's based on
that<00:05:16.110> so<00:05:16.320> this<00:05:16.590> one<00:05:16.860> is<00:05:17.850> kind<00:05:18.690> of<00:05:18.720> similar<00:05:18.840> to<00:05:19.050> a

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
that so this one is kind of similar to a

Mon Fratto quick-release system attaches

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.690 
Mon Fratto quick-release system attaches
very<00:05:21.600> quickly<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.800> QV<00:05:23.130> one<00:05:23.280> base<00:05:23.460> plate

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
very quickly to the QV one base plate

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.450 
very quickly to the QV one base plate
here<00:05:24.230> so<00:05:25.230> you<00:05:25.320> just<00:05:25.500> lock<00:05:25.680> this<00:05:25.890> down<00:05:26.070> all

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
here so you just lock this down all

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.310 
here so you just lock this down all
sudden<00:05:26.880> you<00:05:26.970> have<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.120> set<00:05:27.840> of<00:05:27.960> eight-inch

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
sudden you have a set of eight-inch

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.710 
sudden you have a set of eight-inch
rails<00:05:28.560> attached<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.220> your<00:05:29.400> system<00:05:30.120> and<00:05:30.240> again

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
rails attached to your system and again

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.840 
rails attached to your system and again
if<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.170> don't<00:05:31.260> want<00:05:31.350> to<00:05:31.530> use<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.980> loop<00:05:32.430> you

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
if you don't want to use the loop you

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.160 
if you don't want to use the loop you
just<00:05:32.880> pull<00:05:33.210> it<00:05:33.330> off<00:05:33.450> because<00:05:33.750> it's<00:05:33.960> magnetic

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
just pull it off because it's magnetic

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.260 
just pull it off because it's magnetic
and<00:05:34.740> then<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.250> can<00:05:35.370> attach<00:05:35.610> it<00:05:35.640> very<00:05:36.030> quickly

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
and then you can attach it very quickly

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.500 
and then you can attach it very quickly
back<00:05:36.870> onto<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.320> base<00:05:37.740> plate<00:05:37.950> here<00:05:38.160> and<00:05:38.510> then

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
back onto the base plate here and then

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.050 
back onto the base plate here and then
there<00:05:40.200> is<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.410> small<00:05:40.800> area<00:05:41.070> here<00:05:41.400> with<00:05:41.550> a<00:05:41.580> thread

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
Rebel t4i and the Nikon d600 so it will
