movement<00:00:41.430> set<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.120> WASD<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.620> left

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
movement set up for WASD here with left

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979 
movement set up for WASD here with left
control<00:00:44.250> being<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> edge<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.690> if

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
control being at the edge of it so if

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.380 
control being at the edge of it so if
you<00:00:46.110> notice<00:00:46.590> there's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> little<00:00:47.370> circle<00:00:48.000> along

you notice there's a little circle along

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.260 
you notice there's a little circle along
here<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.770> hit<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> edge<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.730> circle

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
here so if I hit the edge of that circle

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.330 
here so if I hit the edge of that circle
then<00:00:51.719> I'll<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.960> able<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.260> left<00:00:52.739> control<00:00:53.129> which

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
then I'll be able to left control which

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860 
then I'll be able to left control which
will<00:00:53.489> allow<00:00:53.610> me<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.910> sprint<00:00:54.210> I've<00:00:54.600> got<00:00:54.750> my

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
quickly I can move around with as a

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.460 
quickly I can move around with as a
mouse<00:02:58.709> on<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.940> steam<00:03:00.120> controller<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.810> don't

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
mouse on the steam controller I don't

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.800

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.750 
guess I can just like throw those all
out<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.340> have<00:03:05.520> them<00:03:05.670> all<00:03:05.790> auto<00:03:06.060> pick<00:03:06.300> up<00:03:06.420> um<00:03:07.760> so

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
out and have them all auto pick up um so

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.370 
out and have them all auto pick up um so
I<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:09.000> move<00:03:09.150> left<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.630> right<00:03:09.750> through<00:03:10.140> all<00:03:10.350> of

I can move left and right through all of
those<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.100> easily<00:03:12.260> pick<00:03:13.260> something<00:03:13.500> up<00:03:13.560> let's

some<00:05:19.120> default<00:05:19.540> controls<00:05:19.780> where<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.290> right

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
some default controls where the right

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.880 
some default controls where the right
button<00:05:21.280> is<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.550> mouse<00:05:21.700> but<00:05:22.300> then<00:05:22.450> the<00:05:23.350> left<00:05:23.560> is

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
button is the mouse but then the left is

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.180 
button is the mouse but then the left is
up<00:05:24.640> down<00:05:24.910> left<00:05:24.940> right<00:05:25.680> but<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:26.740> don't<00:05:26.890> have<00:05:27.010> as

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
up down left right but you don't have as

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.580 
up down left right but you don't have as
many<00:05:27.340> options<00:05:27.610> for<00:05:28.330> how<00:05:28.810> to<00:05:28.840> configure<00:05:29.230> it<00:05:29.410> so

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
many options for how to configure it so

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.170 
many options for how to configure it so
I<00:05:29.950> just<00:05:30.160> essentially<00:05:30.580> couldn't<00:05:30.880> play<00:05:31.030> the

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
I just essentially couldn't play the

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.630 
I just essentially couldn't play the
game<00:05:31.300> in<00:05:31.480> any<00:05:31.630> kind<00:05:31.780> of<00:05:31.840> functional<00:05:32.230> way<00:05:32.350> and

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
game in any kind of functional way and

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.070 
game in any kind of functional way and
so<00:05:33.640> what<00:05:33.760> I<00:05:33.790> had<00:05:33.940> to<00:05:33.970> end<00:05:34.180> up<00:05:34.300> doing<00:05:34.330> was<00:05:34.840> I

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
so what I had to end up doing was I

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.310 
so what I had to end up doing was I
found<00:05:35.620> out<00:05:35.800> that<00:05:35.980> if<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.460> want<00:05:37.000> to<00:05:40.110> fix<00:05:41.110> that

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
found out that if I want to fix that

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.590 
found out that if I want to fix that
what<00:05:41.560> i<00:05:41.590> could<00:05:41.680> do<00:05:41.980> is<00:05:42.180> instead<00:05:43.180> of<00:05:43.240> launching

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
what i could do is instead of launching

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.410 
what i could do is instead of launching
trying<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.620> launch<00:05:44.770> minecraft<00:05:45.150> what<00:05:46.150> you<00:05:46.270> can

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
trying to launch minecraft what you can

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.450 
trying to launch minecraft what you can
do<00:05:46.570> is<00:05:46.720> you<00:05:46.840> can<00:05:46.870> launch<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:49.560> java<00:05:50.560> executable

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
do is you can launch the java executable

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.540 
do is you can launch the java executable
and<00:05:51.720> if<00:05:52.720> you<00:05:52.930> try<00:05:53.080> to<00:05:53.110> launch<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.710> java

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
and if you try to launch the java

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.540 
and if you try to launch the java
executable<00:05:55.540> and<00:05:55.660> then<00:05:55.810> you<00:05:56.260> add<00:05:56.590> in<00:05:57.370> the

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
executable and then you add in the

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.770 
executable and then you add in the
parameters<00:05:58.000> for<00:05:58.720> steam<00:05:59.350> you<00:06:00.160> want<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.460> add

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
parameters for steam you want to add

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.320 
parameters for steam you want to add
what<00:06:01.780> is<00:06:01.900> it<00:06:02.050> it's<00:06:02.740> like<00:06:04.530> dash<00:06:05.530> jar<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:07.180> then

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
what is it it's like dash jar and then

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.540 
what is it it's like dash jar and then
space<00:06:07.600> and<00:06:07.900> then<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.320> minecraft<00:06:08.980> executable

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
space and then the minecraft executable

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.130 
space and then the minecraft executable
then<00:06:10.000> you'll<00:06:10.120> be<00:06:10.180> able<00:06:10.270> to<00:06:10.390> launch<00:06:10.570> minecraft

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
then you'll be able to launch minecraft

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.740 
then you'll be able to launch minecraft

demonstrating<00:06:22.630> everything<00:06:23.320> that<00:06:23.440> you're

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
demonstrating everything that you're

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.340 
demonstrating everything that you're
really<00:06:23.800> curious<00:06:24.370> about<00:06:24.690> from<00:06:25.690> a<00:06:25.810> first<00:06:26.200> time

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
really curious about from a first time

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.080 
really curious about from a first time
perspective<00:06:26.680> I'm<00:06:27.310> not<00:06:27.550> all<00:06:27.640> that<00:06:27.670> good<00:06:27.910> with

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
perspective I'm not all that good with

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.580 
perspective I'm not all that good with
minecraft<00:06:28.480> I<00:06:28.600> don't<00:06:28.750> necessarily<00:06:29.470> know

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
minecraft I don't necessarily know

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.740 
minecraft I don't necessarily know
everything<00:06:30.100> that's<00:06:30.250> going<00:06:30.310> on<00:06:30.520> here<00:06:30.790> at<00:06:31.390> all

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
everything that's going on here at all

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.330 
everything that's going on here at all
so<00:06:32.290> I<00:06:32.320> don't<00:06:32.410> know<00:06:32.560> really<00:06:33.040> what<00:06:33.220> I'm<00:06:33.310> looking

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
so I don't know really what I'm looking

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.370 
so I don't know really what I'm looking
for<00:06:33.820> I'm<00:06:34.300> just<00:06:34.450> kind<00:06:34.660> of<00:06:34.720> trying<00:06:35.140> to<00:06:35.200> make<00:06:35.290> a

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
for I'm just kind of trying to make a

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.840

little<00:06:35.590> bit<00:06:35.770> of<00:06:35.800> a<00:06:35.890> cave<00:06:36.130> that<00:06:36.160> I<00:06:36.400> can<00:06:36.520> hang<00:06:36.700> out

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:36.850 
little bit of a cave that I can hang out

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.410 
little bit of a cave that I can hang out
in<00:06:36.880> overnight<00:06:37.390> but<00:06:38.140> for<00:06:38.620> now<00:06:38.890> I

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420
