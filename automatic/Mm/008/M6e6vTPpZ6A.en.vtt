basically<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:54.960> build<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.530> giant<00:00:55.860> block<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
basically just build a giant block of

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.220 
basically just build a giant block of
obsidian<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.890> course<00:00:59.280> hollow<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.809> your

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
obsidian of course hollow and it's your

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.399 
obsidian of course hollow and it's your
choice<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:02.149> two<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> three<00:01:03.329> layers<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
choice to two to three layers of

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.340 
choice to two to three layers of
obsidian<00:01:05.250> would<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> best<00:01:06.240> two<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.140> three

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
obsidian would be the best two to three

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.469 
obsidian would be the best two to three
I<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.950> did<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:08.970> sake<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.210> time

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
I just did one just for the sake of time

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.530 
I just did one just for the sake of time
two<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.590> three<00:01:10.950> would<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> best<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.939> then

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
two to three would be the best and then

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.469 
two to three would be the best and then
also<00:01:13.049> cover<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.520> water<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.030> mean<00:01:15.119> like

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
also cover it with water I mean like

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.480 
also cover it with water I mean like
don't<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:15.900> put<00:01:16.080> water<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.590> air<00:01:16.740> whatever

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
don't just put water the air whatever

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
don't just put water the air whatever
you<00:01:17.670> know<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.509> cover<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.259> whole<00:01:19.530> thing

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
you know like cover the whole thing

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.380 
you know like cover the whole thing
every<00:01:20.250> single<00:01:20.549> block<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> water<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
every single block with the water and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.210 
every single block with the water and
then<00:01:21.930> every<00:01:22.290> single<00:01:22.530> block<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> sides

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
then every single block on the sides

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.520 
then every single block on the sides
with<00:01:23.430> water<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.479> way<00:01:24.840> harder<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
with water so it's way harder for a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.700 
with water so it's way harder for a
wither<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.960> also<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
wither to get in and then also on the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.490 
wither to get in and then also on the
bottom<00:01:29.220> cover<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.420> all<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.659> water<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.380> it's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
bottom cover it all with water so it's

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.060 
bottom cover it all with water so it's
like<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> whole<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.340> all<00:01:33.119> water<00:01:33.770> because<00:01:34.770> some

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
like a whole it's all water because some

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.539 
like a whole it's all water because some
bedrock<00:01:35.490> soar<00:01:35.900> high<00:01:36.900> don't<00:01:37.439> high<00:01:37.829> rated

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
bedrock soar high don't high rated

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.450 
bedrock soar high don't high rated
donators<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.720> fly<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.040> there's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
donators can just fly and then there's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.399 
donators can just fly and then there's
no<00:01:41.640> water<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:42.600> ender<00:01:43.020> pearl<00:01:43.229> in

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
no water here and then ender pearl in

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.950 
no water here and then ender pearl in
easily<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> cover<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.720> all<00:01:45.899> with

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
easily so you need to cover it all with

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.370 
easily so you need to cover it all with
water<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:47.399> inside<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.329> base<00:01:48.509> I'm<00:01:49.259> going

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
and steel which is what how you like in

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.340

water<00:03:55.769> how<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.160> rate<00:03:56.430> them<00:03:56.810> shift<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.140> then

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
water how you rate them shift and then

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.680 
water how you rate them shift and then
like<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:59.040> can't<00:03:59.280> even<00:03:59.430> get<00:03:59.610> them<00:03:59.760> see<00:04:00.540> they

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
like you can't even get them see they

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.460 
like you can't even get them see they
just<00:04:00.900> die

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
just die

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.940 
just die
see<00:04:01.739> like<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:02.040> can't<00:04:02.280> even<00:04:02.370> get<00:04:02.579> him<00:04:03.739> they<00:04:04.739> just

died right before nope nothing

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.340 
died right before nope nothing
so<00:04:10.350> that's<00:04:10.530> one<00:04:10.829> method<00:04:11.070> which<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.850> very

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
so that's one method which is very

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.930 
so that's one method which is very
useful<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.500> easy<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.070> then<00:04:14.579> here's<00:04:14.850> the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
useful and easy and then here's the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.390 
useful and easy and then here's the
other<00:04:15.060> it's<00:04:15.390> dispensers<00:04:16.229> instead<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:16.829> chests

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
other it's dispensers instead of chests

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.880 
other it's dispensers instead of chests
so<00:04:18.150> if<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.479> really<00:04:18.660> like<00:04:18.900> chests<00:04:19.260> just<00:04:19.440> do

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
to make an Opie unreadable factions base

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.870 
to make an Opie unreadable factions base
right<00:05:00.300> here<00:05:00.360> very<00:05:00.990> simple<00:05:01.560> just<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.310> block<00:05:02.670> of

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
right here very simple just a block of

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.720 
right here very simple just a block of
obsidian<00:05:03.380> block<00:05:04.380> of<00:05:04.710> covered<00:05:05.280> chests<00:05:05.550> or
