lotion if both to minimize your pores so
I<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:56.009> take<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.540> my<00:01:57.950> fingers<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.579> I

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
I just take that on to my fingers and I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.760 
I just take that on to my fingers and I
just<00:01:59.969> apply<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:00.990> areas<00:02:01.500> where<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
just apply that to the areas where I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.730 
just apply that to the areas where I
feel<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:02.520> pores<00:02:02.880> are<00:02:03.740> drastically

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740

larger<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
larger and

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.590 
larger and
the<00:02:07.780> reason<00:02:08.259> being<00:02:08.289> why<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.039> apply<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.880> serum

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.920 
the reason being why I apply the serum
first<00:02:10.899> is<00:02:11.260> because<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.540> suppose<00:02:13.540> you're

first is because it is suppose you're

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.540 
first is because it is suppose you're
supposed<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.290> use<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> serum<00:02:14.830> first<00:02:15.070> let<00:02:15.400> that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550
