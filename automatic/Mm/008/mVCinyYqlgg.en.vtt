00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060

think<00:01:06.690> about<00:01:06.899> what<00:01:07.050> you'd<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.649> a<00:01:07.740> guitar

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
think about what you'd like in a guitar

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.460 
think about what you'd like in a guitar
so<00:01:08.399> I<00:01:08.429> thought<00:01:08.700> well<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.910> know<00:01:09.080> if<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.289> could

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
so I thought well you know if I could

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.130 
so I thought well you know if I could
come<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.679> with<00:01:10.800> a<00:01:10.920> guitar<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.369> could<00:01:11.850> get

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
come up with a guitar that could get

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.749 
come up with a guitar that could get
something<00:01:13.140> close<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.009> consider<00:01:14.190> the

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
something close to what I consider the

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.150 
something close to what I consider the
three<00:01:15.090> iconic<00:01:15.750> sounds<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.440> guitar<00:01:16.770> which<00:01:17.009> is

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
three iconic sounds of guitar which is

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.700 
three iconic sounds of guitar which is
basically<00:01:17.429> a<00:01:17.550> Les<00:01:17.759> Paul<00:01:17.789> a<00:01:18.509> Les<00:01:19.200> Paul<00:01:19.229> kind<00:01:19.649> of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
basically a Les Paul a Les Paul kind of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.540 
basically a Les Paul a Les Paul kind of
a<00:01:19.770> jazz<00:01:20.039> sound<00:01:20.429> and<00:01:20.940> then<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:22.289> strat<00:01:22.979> sound<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
a jazz sound and then a strat sound a

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.760 
a jazz sound and then a strat sound a
Fender<00:01:23.850> Strat<00:01:24.149> sand<00:01:24.539> and<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> Telecaster<00:01:25.530> sound

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
Fender Strat sand and a Telecaster sound

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.279 
Fender Strat sand and a Telecaster sound
that<00:01:26.670> would<00:01:26.789> be<00:01:26.909> something<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.200> we

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
that would be something and I think we

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.309 
that would be something and I think we
got<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.149> so<00:01:30.149> basically<00:01:30.929> as

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
got it here with this so basically as

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:32.630 
got it here with this so basically as
you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.679> people<00:01:31.830> often<00:01:32.159> ask<00:01:32.340> me<00:01:32.550> about

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
you can see people often ask me about

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.770 
you can see people often ask me about
the<00:01:33.539> strange-looking<00:01:34.500> pickup<00:01:35.190> configuration

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
the strange-looking pickup configuration

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.170 
the strange-looking pickup configuration
so<00:01:36.780> these<00:01:36.899> are<00:01:37.079> Seymour<00:01:37.439> Duncan<00:01:37.649> pickups<00:01:38.180> but

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
so these are Seymour Duncan pickups but

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.069 
so these are Seymour Duncan pickups but
this<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.930> Seymour<00:01:40.890> Duncan<00:01:41.040> jazz<00:01:41.460> pickup

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
this one is a Seymour Duncan jazz pickup

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.170 
this one is a Seymour Duncan jazz pickup
so<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.950> they<00:01:44.100> say<00:01:44.340> well<00:01:44.520> why<00:01:44.700> did<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.970> put

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
so and they say well why did you put

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.999 
so and they say well why did you put
that<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.899> humbucker<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> neck<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that one the humbucker at the neck and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.520

not<00:01:47.189> down<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.060> said<00:01:48.719> well<00:01:48.930> because<00:01:48.960> this

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
not down here I said well because this

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.100 
not down here I said well because this
is<00:01:49.590> where<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.250> get<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> jazz<00:01:50.790> sound<00:01:51.180> from<00:01:51.509> so

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
is where you get the jazz sound from so

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
is where you get the jazz sound from so
I<00:01:52.140> wanted<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> put<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> humbucker<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.549> there

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I wanted to put the humbucker up there

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:02.300 
I wanted to put the humbucker up there
for<00:01:54.119> my<00:01:54.210> jazz<00:01:54.540> sound<00:01:59.780> jazz<00:02:00.780> sound<00:02:01.219> and<00:02:02.219> it

for my jazz sound jazz sound and it
works<00:02:02.520> also<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:03.000> an<00:02:03.119> over<00:02:03.420> driven<00:02:03.719> sound<00:02:03.990> as

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140

well

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.710 

so<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.340> good<00:02:26.490> versatility<00:02:27.270> just<00:02:27.510> out<00:02:27.690> of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
so this is good versatility just out of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.510 
so this is good versatility just out of
that<00:02:27.900> one<00:02:27.960> pickup<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:28.980> from<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.250> warm

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
that one pickup you can go from a warm

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.240 
that one pickup you can go from a warm
jazz<00:02:30.420> sound<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> kind<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.680> over<00:02:31.950> driven

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250

jazz sound to a kind of over driven
blues<00:02:32.460> sound<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.480> then<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:33.930> get<00:02:34.080> into<00:02:34.320> these

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
blues sound and then we get into these

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.510 
blues sound and then we get into these
cool<00:02:35.580> rails<00:02:36.080> pickups<00:02:37.080> we<00:02:37.920> get<00:02:38.130> more<00:02:38.310> than<00:02:38.460> a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
cool rails pickups we get more than a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:03:00.110 
cool rails pickups we get more than a
twang<00:02:38.880> e<00:02:38.910> strat<00:02:39.690> sound<00:02:58.459> that's<00:02:59.459> more<00:02:59.700> strat

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
twang e strat sound that's more strat

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:15.470 
twang e strat sound that's more strat
kind<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.630> rhythm<00:03:01.020> sound<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:15.090> that's<00:03:15.300> actually

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
kind of rhythm sound so that's actually

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.990 
kind of rhythm sound so that's actually
a<00:03:15.660> blend<00:03:16.020> between<00:03:16.320> these<00:03:16.770> two<00:03:16.980> pickups<00:03:17.400> then

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
a blend between these two pickups then

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.540 
a blend between these two pickups then
the<00:03:18.090> further<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.540> go<00:03:18.690> down<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:19.830> goes<00:03:20.070> more

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
the further you go down it goes more

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:30.460 
the further you go down it goes more
strat<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.480> more<00:03:21.660> Telecaster<00:03:22.470> connoisseur

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.580 

more<00:03:31.470> single<00:03:31.950> coil<00:03:32.220> e<00:03:32.840> then<00:03:33.840> we<00:03:34.019> get<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.560> a

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
more single coil e then we get this is a

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:43.000 
more single coil e then we get this is a
cross<00:03:35.340> between<00:03:35.519> these<00:03:35.880> two<00:03:36.060> pickup

lot of different styles and so I wanted

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.339 
lot of different styles and so I wanted
to<00:04:08.950> have<00:04:09.950> one<00:04:10.340> guitar<00:04:10.579> that<00:04:11.420> could<00:04:11.629> cover<00:04:11.989> a

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
to have one guitar that could cover a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
broad range of styles and then I think

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:23.260 
broad range of styles and then I think
we<00:04:14.569> got<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:14.810> with<00:04:15.079> with<00:04:15.349> this<00:04:15.440> guitar<00:04:22.090> this<00:04:23.090> is

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
we got it with with this guitar this is

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.490 
we got it with with this guitar this is
a<00:04:23.300> short<00:04:23.660> scale<00:04:24.039> neck<00:04:25.810> suck<00:04:26.810> about<00:04:27.050> twenty

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
a short scale neck suck about twenty

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.439 
a short scale neck suck about twenty
five<00:04:27.740> twenty<00:04:28.639> five<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.030> half<00:04:29.180> something

the reason I like this is because

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.510 
the reason I like this is because
there's<00:05:38.120> just<00:05:38.300> less<00:05:38.950> cumbersome<00:05:39.950> parts<00:05:40.340> on<00:05:40.490> it

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
it does the job really well it's just

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.120 
it does the job really well it's just
less<00:05:43.670> Engineering<00:05:44.570> less<00:05:44.870> bits<00:05:45.470> of<00:05:45.650> metal<00:05:45.830> and

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
less Engineering less bits of metal and

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.790 
less Engineering less bits of metal and
you<00:05:46.850> know<00:05:47.000> screw<00:05:47.600> pieces<00:05:48.080> a<00:05:48.110> plus<00:05:48.440> the<00:05:48.650> other

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
you know screw pieces a plus the other

you know screw pieces a plus the other
thing<00:05:49.010> I<00:05:49.100> really<00:05:49.430> like<00:05:49.580> about<00:05:49.610> it<00:05:50.060> is<00:05:50.630> it<00:05:50.960> you

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
thing I really like about it is it you

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.730 
thing I really like about it is it you
string<00:05:51.650> it<00:05:51.800> through<00:05:53.050> it<00:05:54.050> goes<00:05:54.260> through<00:05:54.590> the

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
string it through it goes through the

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.770 
string it through it goes through the
