00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.480
 physiological quality from the south to the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.200
 physiological quality of the south 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.780
 is the call height height she goes 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.049
 to distinguish the so-called 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.289
 called south acute high pitched sound 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.510
 is a low frequency sound 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.730
 a high frequency sound 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.160
 then're a question to give me 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.590
 example two sounds if he wants to know who 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.679
 is the most serious that the most acute polio 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.280
 frequency higher frequency more acute 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.329
 sound lower frequency more serious is the sound 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.399
 OK 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.640
 this means that the height is 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.670
 related to frequency okay 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.010
 there is a quantity called the interval 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.500
 whenever you want to calculate the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.320
 interval between 2 11 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.050
 just divide and frequent 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.510
 frequencies today. 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.090
 being that the frequency of above it has 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.800
 be greater than or equal to the frequency of 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.619
 low is right 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.799
 now if the 2 11 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.750
 they have the same frequency and not 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.720
 It means that the interval is equal to one 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.640
 and when interval between 2 today is equal 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.520
 the one we have sounds in it in the grandchild and if 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.200
 the top frequency is twice the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 low frequency 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.540
 logically the result of this division is 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.290
 equal to 2 and always the interval between 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.240
 two sounds equals 2 we have one 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.920
 okay okay 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.369
 so if I have a frequency sound 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.119
 equal to an octave above 100 Hz of 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.890
 10 2011 octave bass 50 reais 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.210
 then okay if I have a dream 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.860
 frequency x 1 octave above 2 x 1 8a 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.979
 low x over two is okay the second 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.399
 physiological quality of sound is called 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.250
 intensity the intensity it goes 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.159
 differentiate the so-called loud sound from 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.920
 called weak sound strong sound 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.550
 it has a large amplitude the weak sound 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.740
 it has a small amplitude while 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.830
 height it is related to 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.190
 recognize the intensity it is 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.740
 related to amplitude okay 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.530
 the grandson how is it that in an issue I go 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.960
 to differentiate the height of intensity 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.160
 simple height is quality intensity is 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.770
 amount 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.630
 so everything that gives you idea of ​​quantity 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.540
 such as power 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.830
 that quantity if the quantity is 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.620
 intensity 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.130
 understood for example if you hit with 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.010
 more and more strength in the key of a piano 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.230
 hit hard if the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.210
 quantity is intensity 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.800
 okay I think the best word 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.000
 that exists to designate quantity is the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.920
 volume word 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.220
 that is why the whole 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.460
 sound has a little button called 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.520
 volume then increase the southern volume 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.530
 it is not letting the loudest sound is leaving the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.770
 stronger sound 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.680
 It's ok, it's okay, we have one. 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.980
 greatness called physical intensity 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.720
 the physical intensity is as follows here 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.080
 we have a surface 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.620
 this surface it has a certain area and 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.510
 she is being crossed by a wave, right? 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.960
 we know that what characterizes 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.860
 a wave the wave carries energy then 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.020
 for you to calculate the intensity 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.750
 intensity what is energy per unit 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.180
 of area per unit time 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.660
 All right, but notice what appears here. 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.600
 energy divided by the time it takes 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.660
 by definition it is power 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.750
 so I can say that the intensity 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.320
 it will be the power divided by 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.480
 area 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.870
 So sure is the unity of the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.860
 intensity does not win is hate per meter 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.200
 square, right? 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.660
 one unit of power per one unit 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.810
 area is right 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.330
 here we have two thousand we have the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.900
 threshold of audi bility we 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.060
 represents by e and 0 it corresponds to 10 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.300
 - 12 great 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.050
 the square is right below that 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.980
 total silence 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.490
 beauties and the threshold of pain is a great 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.490
 Dotted square moment if you hear a sound 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.180
 Of this intensity I 'm going to feel pain is the 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.410
 next is the question is not the intensity 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.590
 yes it is the exposure time and one person 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.930
 the answer arises from this 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.300
 of this intensity does not choose per meter 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.490
 square is greater than this. 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.310
 may have a hearing problem 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.229
 because noise pollution is different from 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.600
 other professions because it does not 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.840
 in the middle is like the other 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.889
 position does not cause noise pollution 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.020
 a human being is irritation stress 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:19.530
 insomnia and so on 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.990
 It's okay, now, imagine here. 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.770
 putin form right source 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.500
 and this source the fact that it is of form 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.970
 it is emitting waves in all 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.729
 generations and senses 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.720
 then it will be in 2011 in all directions 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.200
 and senses 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.470
 she will create around her a sphere is 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.280
 an imaginary sphere then and it is observed 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.470
 from ac 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.620
 actually when he is listening to this 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.680
 He is listening to 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.229
 surface of this imaginary sphere all 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.169
 well when I got her intensity 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:58.830
 will be the power divided by the area and 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:01.680
 area of ​​a sphere is 4 pr squared 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.440
 the radius of the sphere in the case and 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.930
 distance from source to observer 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.630
 so what you have is the calculation 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.260
 intensity of a source hungry 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.919
 It's okay if the power over four 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.500
 pe 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:19.470
 times square, that's okay. 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.200
 say that the intensity it decreases one 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.910
 square of distance is right then if 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.729
 one person stands one meter from a source 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.700
 she hears the sound of intensity and 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:32.039
 if it goes two meters 2 to the 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.889
 square is 4 she will hear a sound of 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.539
 this density and 4 if it is a 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.240
 distance of three meters 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:41.070
 3 to the square and 9 the intensity that it 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.280
 will listen and will it be 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.100
 over 9 okay in intensity of one 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.570
 source of hunger varies with the 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.350
 distance square 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.500
 all right all right timbre timbre is 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:59.220
 quality that allows you to differentiate 2 eleven 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:02.340
 same height, same intensity and 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.770
 from different sources 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:08.280
 That's right, it's the ring that lets 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.980
 to differentiate my voice from the voice of the oil is 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.710
 timbre which distinguish the 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.930
 solvent a guitar or if I am comes from 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.440
 a saxophone is fine 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:23.490
 quality that allows you to differentiate 2/11 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:26.630
 of same height same density cast 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:29.730
 by different source is the doorbell okay 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:32.280
 height related to the frequency of 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.260
 intensity related to the amplitude 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.360
 and the doorbell 

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.630
 it is related to that he is 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.820
 related to the waveform with the 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:45.000
 profile of this wave 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.730
 It's only right that the waveform is 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.090
 connected to a thing called that 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.970
 harmonics 

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:54.390
 then it means that the doorbell is 

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:57.840
 related to the presence of 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:08:02.810
 harmonic with the wave form tá 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.810
 Okay a hug until the next videoula
