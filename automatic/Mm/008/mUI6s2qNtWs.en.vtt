cereal<00:00:37.770> system<00:00:38.750> at<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.809> time<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.410> any<00:00:40.559> time<00:00:40.890> I

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
cereal system at that time of any time I

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.250 
cereal system at that time of any time I

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
think only four out of five kids that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.700 
think only four out of five kids that
aids<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> cereal<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.309> diabetes<00:00:51.710> better
