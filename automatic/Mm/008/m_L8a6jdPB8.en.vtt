00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
this is perhaps the car thing there's a

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.919 
this is perhaps the car thing there's a
lot<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.609> lanes<00:01:39.789> going<00:01:40.060> into<00:01:40.359> it<00:01:40.450> making<00:01:40.689> it<00:01:40.899> a

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
lot of lanes going into it making it a

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.809 
lot of lanes going into it making it a
very<00:01:41.229> muscular<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:42.130> modern<00:01:42.640> at<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.759> same

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
very muscular and modern at the same

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.020 
very muscular and modern at the same
time<00:01:43.149> this<00:01:43.990> is<00:01:44.289> particularly<00:01:45.250> nice<00:01:45.460> there's<00:01:45.939> a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
time this is particularly nice there's a

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.510 
time this is particularly nice there's a
circle<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.170> sweep<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.770> line<00:01:48.100> going<00:01:48.429> across

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
circle and a sweep of line going across

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.690 
circle and a sweep of line going across
it<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.210> matches<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.659> one<00:01:49.750> front<00:01:50.219> come<00:01:51.219> on<00:01:51.340> just

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
it it matches the one front come on just

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.969 
it it matches the one front come on just
what<00:01:51.850> is<00:01:51.939> it<00:01:52.060> there's<00:01:52.780> one<00:01:52.869> small<00:01:53.170> issue<00:01:53.289> the

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
what is it there's one small issue the

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.219 
what is it there's one small issue the
food<00:01:54.189> is<00:01:54.340> actually<00:01:54.459> quite<00:01:54.939> shot<00:01:55.209> so<00:01:55.719> open<00:01:56.140> it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
food is actually quite shot so open it

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.699 
food is actually quite shot so open it
up<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:58.000> door<00:01:58.209> aperture<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.689> very<00:01:59.109> small<00:01:59.469> I

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
up the door aperture is very small I

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.080 
up the door aperture is very small I
mean<00:01:59.859> there's<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.369> lot<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.579> space<00:02:00.759> in<00:02:00.819> there
