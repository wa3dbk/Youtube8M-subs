00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.120
 g well choice I think it's a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.160
 mistake to think that policies are 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.639
 helpless or unable or 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.290
 do not understand as if by doing 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.190
 as if it served the public interest and 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.080
 to serve the general interest 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.210
 actually they are not good if we 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.189
 reverses perspective by understanding 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.330
 that finally these people serve them 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.460
 interests of those who made them and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.590
 and who are the richest 1% 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.820
 of the population at that moment it is 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.930
 not at all a disaster for them 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.840
 disasters but it's a success 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.510
 great everything goes as planned the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.309
 social security and unravel unemployment 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.630
 doing wonderfully allowing you 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.430
 drown wages and have low 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.290
 wages so waters so benefits all 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.450
 is going well from the point of view 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.700
 1% they stuff themselves like never 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.930
 the banks that should be in jail 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.000
 for fraudulent bankruptcy 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.110
 their bosses are better paid than 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.700
 never and now comes to 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.190
 governments of different countries 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.809
 I find that the situation is not 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.030
 all catastrophic for those who 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.949
 finance the election campaigns of 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.989
 elected and I find that the wind of this 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.300
 point of view it's pretty logical the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.070
 hollandists r the interests of those who 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.689
 have who got him elected by doing it 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.640
 go on TV and in the newspapers and 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.380
 why a bank buys 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.680
 liberation why a bank buys the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.830
 world 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.150
 why a bank buys the southern quarter 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.070
 is why mutual credit buys the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.840
 quarter of the daily press 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.729
 regional is to win elections 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.560
 and then the elect make 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.240
 accounts to those who elect them 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.840
 the problem is that our elected representatives 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.070
 do not owe anything to voters 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.240
 you were voting you were not this 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.470
 may not you it will be another 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.970
 those who will vote those who watch 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.290
 television that are not politicized it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.670
 he had to spend a lot of time 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.530
 television you watch the sliders 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.240
 it's amazing the similarity that has 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.079
 between the crossing curves were the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.390
 election results 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.850
 simply raise the cursor of the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.649
 challengers wanted to go up to 10 15% 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.149
 it will give the impression of topicality and 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.799
 then the two parts that on the same 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.180
 hard right politics that's called 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.619
 left and right in fact they have the same 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.270
 policy for industrialists and 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.009
 bankers the multinationals makes it a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.060
 but you put them to the slider more 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.140
 up and they 're going to be elected one or 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.890
 the other one actually no matter they go 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.630
 do the same policy 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.659
 so obviously people are nice 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.649
 they believe these zealous believe in them 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.270
 fangs the candidates at the time of the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.590
 election campaigns and that's it it's 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.750
 our kindness that makes the disappointment 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.710
 after the child after 200 years of failure of 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.730
 Universal suffrage 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.230
 which allows the rich to buy the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.820
 political power since since they 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.590
 write the constitutions these people there 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.510
 have put a system in place first 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.830
 censitaire there me it was clear then 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.810
 universal when they are sighted 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.640
 tocqueville was saying very early so a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.840
 early nineteenth century I said 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.370
 do not fear universal suffrage 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.950
 people will vote as they say and that 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.450
 works it works very well 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.980
 appointing masters instead 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.550
 to vote laws is a sham 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.930
 policy 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.550
 we are not in a democracy 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.500
 democracy we would vote our laws we 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.100
 same a wine a man a voice for 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.110
 vote the laws 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.700
 not to designate masters the fact of 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.570
 we impose to designate masters is 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.820
 a trickery 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.230
 it gives a rather practical result 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.440
 with the rich who runs since 200 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.450
 years 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.830
 so today is the day we arrive 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.390
 in a crisis because capitalism 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.500
 can not pay enough 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.150
 salary to sell their junk 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.640
 so actually they claim that 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.830
 the system is in crisis in crisis like 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.890
 if it was an accident was not 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.240
 everything an accident things happen 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.470
 as usual with impotence 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.820
 politics you're right about the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.320
 political power and this helplessness 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.750
 political it is programmed there is a 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.460
 where it says that the people 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.660
 has no power it's called the 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.950
 constitution the problem is that everything 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.510
 the world does not care we do not care 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.100
 the constitution is well done for 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.540
 we are not the fault of the ugly 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.160
 directs it's our fault we do not 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.690
 not write our constitution in 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.120
 which we foresaw our power 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.130
 do theirs and popular fergani 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.470
 elections without a candidate or 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.390
 elections with primaries and with 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.880
 the impossibility for them 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.240
 convicts to represent themselves and 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.240
 this is the the helplessness 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.100
 our resignation from the constituent process 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.990
 being glad we're chatting about what 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.050
 do the political representatives 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.730
 who are the representatives of the rich 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.150
 we miss the cause of our 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.340
 problems 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.440
 it seems to me that by refocusing the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.150
 problem feeling the reflection on 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.600
 the cause of our problems we come to 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.600
 find solutions
