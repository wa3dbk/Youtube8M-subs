00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.489
 Roos van Acker the head of the world cause 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.730
 children playing beans from 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.640
 answer the spanish city works the same way all over the world 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.980
 The great thing about it if you have to race like music you don't need the language 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.279
 to speak on the worst 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.599
 it's i can't help it 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:21.949
 horvÃ¡th and jens 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.880
 to play collateral in the municipal fund 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.269
 as the singer 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.869
 create by drawing communicate 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.560
 people who depend on the hand 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.360
 or origin to stay 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.860
 my employer work around the world 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 That is what we had brought beautiful 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.600
 catching up was the 26 year old huizer 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.590
 so I don't have that much stuff anymore we see Frank Lampard 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.340
 as it say 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.810
 but the field 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.930
 when i went to study and delft 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.310
 I was very interested in fashion designer that came to love 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.420
 abyss for the profession 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.560
 but that is usually not as reliable as a city has a history 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.539
 it was the eleventh texts at the source 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.369
 its even though the craziness is being real 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.770
 just do 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.830
 that tells the singer 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.690
 then vincent van der is 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.860
 nightfall here 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.580
 in addition, you can go to Amsterdam from all sides last year 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.540
 it stood in the way 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.550
 so it was great fine avoid basic 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.120
 on a row 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.320
 as a Dutchman in the car the business 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 September 20 is trying to conquer a third place 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.470
 then you look for some advice when the owner was just 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.840
 three years ahead of me 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 to ask the stentor for advice 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.920
 panicked when I was out of the interview as an intern with demente 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 the elderly and AIDS 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.549
 the water to work and if there is no unexpected nuisance it is waiting for 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.600
 the english newspaper the mirror or case was people have 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.930
 Geneva Operetta have helped each other a bit 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.989
 come unique experience the price of the season come to get the system 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.559
 the city 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.719
 and worse has always been fantastic that area 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.560
 it's a bit of a coincidence that I am a cover myself 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.459
 its desired effect 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.560
 with that there are six sets of music make people from the us sit here 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.749
 bit good to process 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.950
 gent j the chance to be a spastic said both directions bas well it 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:34.929
 not on the other two basel 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:39.469
 so it is so you can always look for that kind of 10 which is wrong 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.839
 mountain house comes we have a good band in which was played 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.520
 6 7 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.499
 I am definitely in it 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.499
 and I thought it was a good band, a child agreed 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.899
 merelbeke audi got off the ground and ten years on 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.419
 and I think we both learned a lot from 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:00.139
 of a special relationship 30 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.589
 parliament activity 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:03.839
 that third time 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.129
 a pure resident I am 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.279
 it is as it is as a possible return 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.299
 i am to be 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.700
 That's an overweight drinker who begs the tax 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.549
 all top 100 is that was informing in the clear and therefore still 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.549
 always the intention thus the city is hard to say 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.150
 a third of the biggest competitors and serge or do you have a hot tip 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.879
 have been running the basic version for ten years 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.429
 it is a natural talent I have said try to copy sketches 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:40.429
 the among others to learn to draw with you 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.519
 the young people are there and still do not asscher as with everything 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.279
 so in the second class 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:50.829
 3 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.319
 You should be denied anything less worth the clock 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.089
 because there are so many moments in my career 4 that are nevertheless difficult for that 

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:59.589
 different reasons 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:03.559
 and if you don't have a very strong passion from animals that transfers 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.709
 then you had finished 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.239
 the foundation your own 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.179
 good positive 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:14.519
 And that works you should especially enjoy it as long as you can 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:18.379
 to attempt 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:20.620
 to look at yourself objectively 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.999
 I give an added value 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.279
 give tomorrow morning the inspiration it needs 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:30.229
 you can work keep you creative you still have good ideas and at the moment 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.610
 that you feel that you know you 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.659
 drop out 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:36.900
 that must stop 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.860
 but it is hard to say because it is a pinch 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.050
 the 27 year old sprinter and there are big differences between the walls and the winter 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.309
 the end is 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:48.460
 it doesn't work that way 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.529
 a perfect starting point 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:51.179
 a record
