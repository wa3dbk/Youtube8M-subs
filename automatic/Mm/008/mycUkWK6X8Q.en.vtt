questions<00:00:04.830> before<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.160> start<00:00:05.400> playing<00:00:05.609> though

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
questions before I start playing though

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.750 
questions before I start playing though
you<00:00:06.390> guys<00:00:06.509> had<00:00:06.660> asked<00:00:06.839> about<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.049> price<00:00:07.290> range

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
you guys had asked about the price range

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.270 
you guys had asked about the price range
fits<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:08.880> about<00:00:09.090> 195<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:10.019> 250<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.800> all

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
fits in about 195 to 250 and all

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.459 
fits in about 195 to 250 and all
retailers<00:00:11.820> vary<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:13.139> know<00:00:13.230> check<00:00:13.440> your

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
retailers vary so you know check your

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.169 
retailers vary so you know check your
prices<00:00:13.980> but<00:00:14.190> if<00:00:14.429> you're<00:00:14.730> paying<00:00:14.910> more<00:00:15.150> than

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
prices but if you're paying more than

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.180 
prices but if you're paying more than
250<00:00:15.690> you're<00:00:15.839> probably<00:00:16.139> getting<00:00:16.410> ripped<00:00:16.680> off

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
250 you're probably getting ripped off

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.599 
250 you're probably getting ripped off
so<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.810> samp<00:00:19.020> retail<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:19.619> 195<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.189> 250

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
so the samp retail is about 195 to 250

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.450 
so the samp retail is about 195 to 250
or<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:20.910> about<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> foot<00:00:22.260> pedals<00:00:22.619> there<00:00:23.310> are

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
or so about the foot pedals there are

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.980 
or so about the foot pedals there are
two<00:00:23.730> foot<00:00:24.029> pedals<00:00:24.330> available<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> know

two foot pedals available that I know

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.929 
two foot pedals available that I know

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
for this amp one of them has two

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.790 
for this amp one of them has two
switches<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.900> them<00:00:28.019> has<00:00:28.140> four<00:00:28.500> and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
switches and one of them has four and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.279 
switches and one of them has four and
the<00:00:29.400> options<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:29.880> our<00:00:30.359> channel<00:00:30.840> which

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the options you have our channel which

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680 
the options you have our channel which
is<00:00:31.320> your<00:00:32.130> distortion<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.420> clean

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
is your distortion and your clean

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
is your distortion and your clean
channel<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:35.040> other<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.760> reverb

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
channel the other one is your reverb

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.990 
channel the other one is your reverb
switch<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.870> forp<00:00:37.170> stop<00:00:37.559> pedal<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.280> for

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
switch and the forp stop pedal is for

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.630 
switch and the forp stop pedal is for
the<00:00:39.180> X<00:00:39.360> mode<00:00:39.750> which<00:00:40.469> cuts<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> bit<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the X mode which cuts out a bit of the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.900 
the X mode which cuts out a bit of the
mids<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:43.200> overdrive<00:00:43.950> switch<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
mids and the overdrive switch on the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.819 
mids and the overdrive switch on the
clean<00:00:45.180> channel<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.200> adds<00:00:46.350> those<00:00:46.590> two

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
clean channel so it just adds those two

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.920 
clean channel so it just adds those two
with<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> four<00:00:47.280> pedal<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:48.450> not<00:00:48.600> sure<00:00:48.809> how

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
with the four pedal I'm not sure how

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.410 
with the four pedal I'm not sure how
much<00:00:49.050> those<00:00:49.289> pedals<00:00:49.649> cost<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.219> most<00:00:51.120> readers

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
much those pedals cost but most readers

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.799 
much those pedals cost but most readers
do<00:00:51.629> sell<00:00:51.870> them<00:00:51.930> separately<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.629> other

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
do sell them separately and see other

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.410 
do sell them separately and see other

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.700 
about 25% I won't reveal any of my mix
settings<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.259> guys<00:01:55.409> should<00:01:55.649> be

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
settings because you guys should be

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.370 
settings because you guys should be
developing<00:01:56.159> your<00:01:56.310> own<00:01:56.430> sound<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:58.020> is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
developing your own sound but this is

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.649 
developing your own sound but this is
without<00:01:59.130> too<00:01:59.579> much<00:01:59.850> mixing<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
without too much mixing a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.539 
without too much mixing a
straightforward<00:02:01.320> clean<00:02:01.920> tone<00:02:02.219> from<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
straightforward clean tone from the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:33.470 
straightforward clean tone from the
clean<00:02:02.729> Channel

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.510 

and<00:02:34.410> here's<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.770> clean<00:02:35.040> setting<00:02:35.400> with<00:02:35.489> a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
and here's that clean setting with a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:03:01.160 
and here's that clean setting with a
little<00:02:35.849> bit<00:02:35.970> more<00:02:36.090> gain<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.629> it<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.989> no<00:02:37.980> reverb

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.110 

okay<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.160> what<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> clean<00:03:02.730> channel

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
okay now this is what the clean channel

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.520 
okay now this is what the clean channel
with<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.300> gain<00:03:03.510> up<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.900> little<00:03:04.110> bit<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
with the gain up a little bit and the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.500 
with the gain up a little bit and the
overdrive<00:03:05.010> button<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:06.150> would<00:03:06.330> probably

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
overdrive button in this would probably

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:30.819 
overdrive button in this would probably
be<00:03:06.720> for<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> pop<00:03:07.380> punk<00:03:07.650> modern<00:03:08.190> rock<00:03:08.370> style

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.380 

again<00:03:31.829> this<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.129> Klean<00:03:32.430> channel<00:03:32.909> with<00:03:33.120> the

again this is the Klean channel with the

overdrive button Preston and the gain a

overdrive button Preston and the gain a
little<00:03:35.040> bit<00:03:35.159> hotter<00:03:35.400> than<00:03:35.549> before<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.629> a
