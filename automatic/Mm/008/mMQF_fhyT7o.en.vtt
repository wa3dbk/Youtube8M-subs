00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.080
 today we are with gabriel market in the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.309
 previous match with good arsenal 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.599
 it had been a long time since we spoke with 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.400
 we wanted to know how you are 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.360
 going through this moment this moment 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.490
 also from the team where you are 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.100
 pointer and fighting on all three fronts 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.740
 before championships you dispute yes 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.630
 really really very very happy for 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.039
 all this present so we are 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.949
 living so 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.950
 who is very happy and also very 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.590
 illusion for everything that comes 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.690
 which no doubt it will be very difficult 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.510
 but if we continue on this path 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.030
 I think our idea is to try 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.890
 follow with chances and reach with 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 serious chances at the end of the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.620
 competitions both the cup tournament 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 Argentina and South American Cups and that 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.330
 just beginning is a great start on 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.770
 that we had but but good is that 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.680
 keep working because this continues 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.140
 until at the club does a lot and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.080
 secured already being unquestioned holder 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.580
 in your position you feel a bit in spite 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.970
 that you are very young also for a little 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.700
 reference of this river not what I feel 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.520
 is that we have a great relationship between 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.140
 everyone here maybe you do not notice the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.850
 difference between the largest and the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.650
 more guys 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.730
 the climate of the wardrobe that we 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.730
 We really have a nice 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.130
 we get along very well together and that 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.650
 makes it later reflected inside 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.360
 of the playing field how we defend ourselves 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.390
 how we help each other and the commitment that 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.650
 we have with this institution so what 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.170
 good one maybe for 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.810
 already have some more matches at first 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.540
 try to advise the younger ones of 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.630
 help them push them and 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.060
 to give some advice that perhaps one 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.100
 in another moment of life he lived it that way 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.850
 that try to help each other 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.340
 and not without another afternoon 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.700
 I told you earlier not the word 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.820
 referring but late 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.759
 to accompany the smallest and among the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.039
 bigger try to take that 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.130
 responsibility what good that which 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.740
 we have to assume 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.330
 Freshly he made a locker room talking 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.100
 weeks we talk with MatÃ­as Kranevitter 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.660
 and he told us that you were in charge of 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.660
 the music of the wardrobe we would like 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.400
 know a little bit of privacy to see 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.110
 who is the most funniest who 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.450
 is always in a good mood who sees a 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.230
 once in the morning half asleep 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.230
 like then nobody 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.830
 and one of the funniest 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:37.200
 vangioni and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.080
 the seasickness there are nice characters 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.990
 Really 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.590
 it is very like the climate that we live here 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.530
 like very good 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.660
 Menicon likes to train usually the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.210
 tomorrow listened to music but allah 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.120
 at noon after training but 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.540
 but let's say there are times you have to put 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.280
 several things because you saw 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.709
 everyone likes the same music 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.909
 so it 's good because it's a group 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.630
 varied the days that we are 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.670
 concentrated usually 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.950
 they usually put folklore then listen 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.770
 folklore so it's a team and a group 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.110
 that is listening to very varied music 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.850
 we have heard many times cumbia and 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.260
 someone who does not like cumbia 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.260
 for nothing that complains about that 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.209
 well we know that the peeling aguirre a 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.549
 piscu are very rockers like it a lot 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.549
 rock and roll but you have to 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.170
 adapt in capturing because most of 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.680
 Most likes likes to listen 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.359
 cumbia and usually is 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.420
 not only here but in all 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.680
 costumes that musical style predominates 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.500
 so 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.480
 more than anything else during the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.939
 minutes of the matches and it is usually 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.530
 listen enough to the morning just you 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.810
 he asked is there someone who is 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.400
 particularly a little more grumpy 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.780
 that the rest of these birds do not 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.790
 you have to talk you do not have to say 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.269
 nothing 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.549
 and it's hard for me to find one but so 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:07.030
 general as we are used to 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.439
 come with breakfast time and good 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.349
 always try to share those 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:14.650
 moments before training or taking a few 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.690
 mates chat we usually have a 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.030
 good weather we do not have around here it has 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.769
 been identified to one by for being one 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.930
 of those who come in a bad mood to the 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.460
 tomorrow so usually in this 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.430
 appearance 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.810
 everyone has concentration with a 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.780
 arsenal in the monumental 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.160
 we imagine that a Saturday afternoon does not 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.780
 there is so much more to do than be 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.759
 inside the club that is what they do 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.530
 how it happens in time how they have fun 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.229
 how they entertain themselves and also good 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.919
 concentrate not for matches yes good 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.280
 usually in the afternoon comes the 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.520
 doctor sandra do some jobs 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.490
 We usually go down to the stadium to take 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.430
 some mates to clear us a little there 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.660
 several guys who like to play polish 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.900
 to ping-pong 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.180
 there is also a play and some are 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.530
 play the play too but and 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.940
 we also take the opportunity to look at 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.620
 parties you see that usually the 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.139
 previous days on Saturdays or 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.750
 Friday there are no matches then be of 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.259
 nation around first we look at each other 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.970
 and with that, I already know everything is covered 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.370
 the day and good enough 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.680
 fast so it's a day also that 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.940
 we take the opportunity to share good 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.139
 last one asks you and I ask you if I 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.270
 you can remember the river fans 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.710
 what are your official social networks 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.360
 so they can follow you we know that 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.570
 this is one of the few that has 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:39.520
 facebook twitter and instagram also if 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:41.620
 good you twitter is gabe madrid that 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.260
 for the good where I am from 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.350
 puerto madryn 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.320
 instagram if I remember correctly there was 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.870
 marked 25 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.940
 on facebook as my name so I think 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.110
 that I do not miss any social network 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.060
 I imagine that in all you follow the 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.190
 official accounts of the club no yes yes yes 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.900
 we are in all we follow and we are 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.600
 Attentive to all the information that 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.680
 they are going up so if that is 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.680
 we are constantly looking at it
