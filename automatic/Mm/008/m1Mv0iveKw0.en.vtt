00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 but there is the lazio forward with felipe 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.750
 anderson left end 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.700
 rejected and then the goal the Lazio in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.900
 advantage to and to the Colombian to the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.179
 twenty-fifth minute 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.160
 here the parma goalkeeper does not 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.190
 convinces however the shot of felipe anderson 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.359
 the was anything but irresistible 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.449
 rejected 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.359
 we probably repeat again 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.279
 of the clash that after a few seconds 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.439
 perhaps it has crippled him 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.779
 irregular for felipe anderson the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.800
 limit control of the penalty area not 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.930
 he was irresistible 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.350
 then it was cool good for ea 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.600
 observe the position of the goalkeeper and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.270
 left half-height to beat it is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.610
 so much parma forward parolo conclusion 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.430
 out of his tern just the insertion 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.800
 vertically he would like the corner kick 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.480
 cassano wanted the move in 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 effects the corner kick to this 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.190
 providential point of intervention in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.170
 slip of people and Lazio 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.059
 cassani cross from the right biabiany 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.910
 in front of the goalkeeper you had agents 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.920
 the 1 to 1 biabiany tie slipped 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.310
 he checked cassani put one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.310
 interesting biabiany solissimo ball 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.960
 think he slipped he got up ha 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.729
 controlled the ball with the right 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.700
 without that no player knit 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.110
 biancoceleste dared to disturb it there 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.799
 conclusion did not leave a chance to 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.470
 berisha 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.030
 all the 43rd who quit the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.890
 ball for gargano conclusion on the fly 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.759
 high just a little 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.530
 very good gargano in the insertion 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.509
 good cassano to see it coming 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.280
 high ball on the right wing here 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.259
 paladin touching his first ball 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 is placed there comes the cross and 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.890
 cassano moves there is an opportunity 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.720
 of insertion once again parolo 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.950
 then I hunched the colossus to be empty 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.200
 the ball was elected the retrieval 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.329
 miracle on the goal line and succeeded 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.850
 to neutralize the conclusion in 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.530
 sansone practice was there palladino era 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.790
 ready for a successful split attempt 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.140
 Sansone and Palladino have had 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.770
 the opportunity but still the parma 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.079
 palladino 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.030
 here sansone again Lazio is wrong 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.229
 the referral to a super berisha has saved 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.759
 the result now sees the ball 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.920
 similar to just outside 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.049
 compared to the crossing of poles with his 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.660
 right the parma the action built it 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.180
 diaz ahead of all then all us 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.360
 ratio that now relies on candreva la 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.460
 its descent on the right 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.340
 that is with candreva the cross comes and goes to 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.770
 however, stamp the marchionni shank 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.780
 two minutes of recovery on the contrary Lazio 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.090
 forward attempt to pass by 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.650
 felipe anderson the wrong disengagement 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.420
 of cassani 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.190
 Anderson could find the conclusion 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.050
 from outside this is not a header 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.760
 return by parolo near him 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.010
 There is also the further back Marchioni 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.450
 gargano with coop service attempt 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.880
 for candreva cross in the penalty area 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.530
 then marchionni the ball to see the 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.910
 Lazio goal 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:51.430
 all at minute number 44 rather to the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.670
 45th body shot of perea Ã¨ 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.810
 the man probably left Lazio 2 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.760
 parma 1 that started and above all that 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.250
 errors in defense free kick 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.350
 attention in favor of the santonja we are 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.480
 away from the door for a conclusion 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.480
 direct however the predictable text of 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.980
 cassano could suggest a cross 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.770
 within the penalty area 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.380
 Also the concierge is based in the 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.769
 Cassano is waiting for his opponent's penalty 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.530
 all the parma goalkeeper included in the 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.750
 attempt to hit the head e 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.519
 to threaten the safety to bring 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.380
 lazio then empty the bait of 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.940
 head out probably the last one 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.790
 occasion of the match like this and indeed 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.140
 Lazio accesses the quarter-finals 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.290
 will meet the winner of Naples 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.600
 atalanta scheduled tomorrow that is 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.750
 set the bet away the parma more than 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.060
 win then lazio beats parma 2 to 1 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.280
 thanks for the paolo technical assistance 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.860
 naldi we remind you of the succession of the 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.080
 nets at 25th the first time for itself at 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.460
 43rd always from the first fraction away 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.640
 viani and minutes 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.730
 the recovery the decisive goal always of 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.860
 well has naturally match winner 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.810
 tonight for a Lazio that accesses 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.760
 Italian Cup quarter-final from 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.370
 daniele fortuna and giovanni scaramuzzino 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.570
 of course thanks for listening in 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.570
 line that returns to saxa rubra
