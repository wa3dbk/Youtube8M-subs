here somewhere
thanks<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.320> there<00:02:54.860> there's<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.130> little

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
thanks just in there there's a little

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.160 
thanks just in there there's a little
notch<00:02:55.550> let's<00:02:56.239> get<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.540> off<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:02.630> there<00:03:02.840> we<00:03:02.959> go

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.130 
notch let's get this off and there we go
so<00:03:03.769> a<00:03:04.069> little<00:03:04.760> bit<00:03:04.880> cheap<00:03:05.150> feeling<00:03:05.360> but<00:03:06.019> not

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
so a little bit cheap feeling but not

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.979 
so a little bit cheap feeling but not
too<00:03:06.350> bad<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:07.370> wonder<00:03:07.970> if<00:03:08.060> that's<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.390> NFC<00:03:08.840> this

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
too bad I wonder if that's the NFC this

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.840 
too bad I wonder if that's the NFC this
phone<00:03:09.290> has<00:03:09.500> got<00:03:09.650> NFC<00:03:10.040> built<00:03:10.280> into<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:10.790> I'm

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
phone has got NFC built into it so I'm

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.070 
phone has got NFC built into it so I'm
guessing<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:11.180> something<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.600> do<00:03:11.720> with<00:03:11.840> that

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
guessing that something to do with that

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.600 
guessing that something to do with that
they're<00:03:13.060> also<00:03:14.060> Bluetooth<00:03:14.450> GPS<00:03:14.890> also<00:03:15.890> LTE<00:03:16.370> as

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
they're also Bluetooth GPS also LTE as

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.509 
they're also Bluetooth GPS also LTE as
well<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.120> 4G<00:03:17.510> phone<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:19.310> got<00:03:19.489> a

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
well so it is 4G phone and it's got a

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.770 
well so it is 4G phone and it's got a
dual<00:03:19.760> band<00:03:20.450> Wi-Fi<00:03:20.720> as<00:03:21.079> well<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.560> B<00:03:21.799> G<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.070> n<00:03:22.780> okay

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
dual band Wi-Fi as well a B G and n okay

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.500 
dual band Wi-Fi as well a B G and n okay
so<00:03:23.840> Justin<00:03:24.410> here<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:24.799> where<00:03:25.400> your<00:03:25.579> micro<00:03:26.150> SIM

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
so Justin here is where your micro SIM

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.610 
so Justin here is where your micro SIM
card<00:03:26.840> goes<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.530> just<00:03:28.459> there<00:03:28.700> it's<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.620> standard

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
card goes and just there it's a standard

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.509 
card goes and just there it's a standard
micro<00:03:31.430> SD<00:03:31.910> memory<00:03:32.180> card<00:03:32.900> which<00:03:33.170> is<00:03:33.380> up<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:34.040> 64

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
micro SD memory card which is up to 64

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.970 
micro SD memory card which is up to 64
gigabytes<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:36.230> let's<00:03:36.380> get<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.560> battery<00:03:36.890> in

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
gigabytes so let's get the battery in

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.770 
gigabytes so let's get the battery in
there<00:03:38.440> now<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:39.590> phone<00:03:39.950> weighs<00:03:40.299> 180<00:03:41.299> grams

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
there now this phone weighs 180 grams

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.420 
there now this phone weighs 180 grams
total<00:03:42.230> including<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.070> weight<00:03:43.220> of<00:03:43.370> the

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
total including the weight of the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.729 
total including the weight of the
battery<00:03:43.850> so<00:03:44.690> it's<00:03:44.840> not<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.109> lightest<00:03:45.530> phone

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
battery so it's not the lightest phone

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:46.930 
battery so it's not the lightest phone
in<00:03:45.859> the<00:03:45.920> world<00:03:46.070> but<00:03:46.190> then<00:03:46.340> again<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.609> is<00:03:46.730> quite

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
in the world but then again it is quite

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.900 
in the world but then again it is quite
large<00:03:47.209> it's<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> bit<00:03:48.049> larger<00:03:48.440> than<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.910> Galaxy

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
large it's a bit larger than the Galaxy

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.990 
large it's a bit larger than the Galaxy
Note<00:03:50.120> one<00:03:50.570> as<00:03:50.780> well<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:52.310> screen<00:03:52.609> size<00:03:52.850> has

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
720 by 1280 giving you a pixel density

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.670

of<00:04:06.790> 267<00:04:07.790> pixels<00:04:08.090> per<00:04:08.480> inch<00:04:08.510> it<00:04:09.320> should<00:04:09.620> be

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
of 267 pixels per inch it should be

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.750 
of 267 pixels per inch it should be
quite<00:04:09.890> tough<00:04:10.130> as<00:04:10.250> well<00:04:10.430> because<00:04:10.609> it<00:04:10.730> is

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
quite tough as well because it is

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.330 
quite tough as well because it is
supporting<00:04:11.750> well<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.170> has<00:04:12.320> got<00:04:12.620> Gorilla<00:04:13.160> Glass

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
supporting well it has got Gorilla Glass

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.360 
supporting well it has got Gorilla Glass
2<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:15.350> actual<00:04:15.560> front<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.920> it<00:04:16.039> so<00:04:16.070> it<00:04:16.220> should

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
2 in the actual front of it so it should

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.219 
2 in the actual front of it so it should
be<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.459> bit<00:04:16.700> tougher<00:04:17.030> than<00:04:17.120> previous<00:04:17.570> so<00:04:18.019> let's

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
be a bit tougher than previous so let's

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.629 
be a bit tougher than previous so let's
just<00:04:18.380> peel<00:04:18.590> that<00:04:18.769> off

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.850 

and<00:04:22.729> get<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.150> powered<00:04:23.389> up<00:04:23.479> so<00:04:24.319> press<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.710> hold

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
and get it powered up so press and hold

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.200 
and get it powered up so press and hold
the<00:04:25.189> side<00:04:25.460> button<00:04:26.409> and<00:04:27.789> there<00:04:28.789> we<00:04:28.879> go<00:04:28.999> and<00:04:29.120> it's

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
the side button and there we go and it's

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.159 
the side button and there we go and it's
just<00:04:29.270> pairing<00:04:29.629> up<00:04:29.749> now<00:04:31.509> so<00:04:32.509> that's<00:04:32.779> pairing<00:04:33.080> up

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
just pairing up now so that's pairing up

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.689 
just pairing up now so that's pairing up
I'll<00:04:33.259> tell<00:04:33.379> you<00:04:33.439> about<00:04:33.499> the<00:04:33.620> processor<00:04:34.189> it's

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
I'll tell you about the processor it's

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.959 
I'll tell you about the processor it's
got<00:04:34.759> 1.6<00:04:35.689> gigahertz<00:04:36.050> quad-core<00:04:36.770> cortex<00:04:37.759> a9

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:37.969 
got 1.6 gigahertz quad-core cortex a9

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.920 
got 1.6 gigahertz quad-core cortex a9
processor<00:04:38.680> so<00:04:39.680> plenty<00:04:40.550> of<00:04:40.580> power<00:04:40.879> also<00:04:41.870> to

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
processor so plenty of power also to

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.749 
processor so plenty of power also to
help<00:04:42.169> it<00:04:42.379> along<00:04:42.409> it's<00:04:42.770> got<00:04:42.889> 2<00:04:43.129> gigabytes<00:04:43.639> of

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
help it along it's got 2 gigabytes of

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.760 
help it along it's got 2 gigabytes of
RAM<00:04:44.090> so<00:04:44.749> this<00:04:44.930> phone<00:04:45.169> should<00:04:45.409> be<00:04:45.499> an<00:04:45.590> absolute

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
RAM so this phone should be an absolute

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.219 
RAM so this phone should be an absolute
screamer<00:04:46.610> I've<00:04:47.419> just<00:04:47.629> quickly<00:04:47.810> skipped

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
screamer I've just quickly skipped

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.890 
screamer I've just quickly skipped
straight<00:04:48.620> ahead<00:04:49.039> to<00:04:49.729> the<00:04:50.090> main<00:04:50.360> phone<00:04:50.629> because

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
straight ahead to the main phone because

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.379 
straight ahead to the main phone because
the<00:04:51.020> setup<00:04:51.289> stage<00:04:51.499> is<00:04:51.620> pretty<00:04:51.830> boring<00:04:52.009> and

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
the setup stage is pretty boring and

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.029 
the setup stage is pretty boring and
here<00:04:53.389> we<00:04:53.509> have<00:04:53.689> it<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:54.050> screen<00:04:54.409> straightaway

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
here we have it the screen straightaway

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.640 
here we have it the screen straightaway
looks<00:04:55.279> absolutely<00:04:55.840> amazing<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.529> looks

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
looks absolutely amazing and it looks

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.659 
looks absolutely amazing and it looks
very<00:04:57.979> snappy<00:04:58.490> to<00:04:58.789> begin<00:04:59.060> with<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.539> if<00:05:00.199> we<00:05:00.379> go

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
very snappy to begin with and if we go

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.730 
very snappy to begin with and if we go
into<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:02.810> gallery<00:05:02.990> see<00:05:03.409> if<00:05:03.469> there's<00:05:03.590> any

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
into the gallery see if there's any

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.140 
into the gallery see if there's any
standard<00:05:04.069> photos<00:05:04.370> on<00:05:04.490> there<00:05:04.669> and<00:05:04.819> there<00:05:04.969> is

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
standard photos on there and there is

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.679 
standard photos on there and there is
which<00:05:05.419> is<00:05:05.569> good<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:09.759> cancel<00:05:10.759> that<00:05:10.909> off<00:05:11.060> let's

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:11.689 
which is good and cancel that off let's

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.140 
which is good and cancel that off let's
tilt<00:05:11.990> it<00:05:12.080> on<00:05:12.169> its<00:05:12.319> side<00:05:12.729> I'm<00:05:13.729> gonna<00:05:13.849> bring<00:05:14.029> this

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
tilt it on its side I'm gonna bring this

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.490 
tilt it on its side I'm gonna bring this
a<00:05:14.240> bit<00:05:14.360> closer<00:05:14.569> to<00:05:14.659> see<00:05:14.750> if<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.080> can<00:05:15.199> see<00:05:15.409> it

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
a bit closer to see if you can see it

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.890 
a bit closer to see if you can see it
any<00:05:15.589> better<00:05:15.800> there<00:05:16.550> we<00:05:16.639> go<00:05:16.789> I<00:05:16.819> mean<00:05:17.029> what

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
any better there we go I mean what

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.360 
any better there we go I mean what
you're<00:05:18.020> seeing<00:05:18.319> isn't<00:05:18.439> doing<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:18.860> justice<00:05:19.189> but

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
you're seeing isn't doing it justice but

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.499 
you're seeing isn't doing it justice but
it<00:05:19.460> is<00:05:19.550> very<00:05:19.969> very<00:05:20.419> crisp<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.669> swiping<00:05:22.669> it's

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
it is very very crisp and swiping it's

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.529 
it is very very crisp and swiping it's
very<00:05:23.810> easy<00:05:24.050> very<00:05:24.379> smooth<00:05:25.539> pinch-to-zoom

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
very easy very smooth pinch-to-zoom

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.189 
very easy very smooth pinch-to-zoom
works<00:05:26.990> all<00:05:27.139> really<00:05:27.349> well<00:05:27.469> as<00:05:27.710> well<00:05:28.479> and<00:05:29.479> if<00:05:30.080> we

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
works all really well as well and if we

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:36.070 
works all really well as well and if we
get<00:05:30.289> the<00:05:30.409> S<00:05:30.589> Pen<00:05:30.830> out<00:05:34.539> you<00:05:35.539> can<00:05:35.689> see<00:05:35.930> I've<00:05:36.050> done

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
get the S Pen out you can see I've done

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.240 
get the S Pen out you can see I've done
everything<00:05:36.349> quite<00:05:36.650> tell<00:05:36.919> but<00:05:37.189> it<00:05:37.310> is<00:05:37.430> tracking

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
everything quite tell but it is tracking

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.860 
everything quite tell but it is tracking
the<00:05:40.250> tiny<00:05:40.550> little<00:05:40.729> dot<00:05:41.029> we're<00:05:41.240> just<00:05:41.419> tracking

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
the tiny little dot we're just tracking

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.619 
the tiny little dot we're just tracking
the<00:05:42.379> s-pen<00:05:42.979> exactly<00:05:43.789> where<00:05:44.360> I'm<00:05:44.449> pointing

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
the s-pen exactly where I'm pointing

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.809 
the s-pen exactly where I'm pointing
it's<00:05:44.990> tracking<00:05:45.379> it<00:05:45.500> then<00:05:46.279> if<00:05:46.399> you<00:05:46.460> can<00:05:46.610> tell

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:46.819 
it's tracking it then if you can tell

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.829 
it's tracking it then if you can tell
that<00:05:47.000> so<00:05:47.750> if<00:05:47.810> we<00:05:47.930> go<00:05:48.080> back<00:05:48.370> to<00:05:49.419> say<00:05:50.419> for<00:05:50.539> example

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:50.839 
that so if we go back to say for example

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.360 
that so if we go back to say for example
there<00:05:51.020> I'm<00:05:51.620> not<00:05:51.770> actually<00:05:51.889> touching<00:05:52.339> the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
there I'm not actually touching the

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.459 
there I'm not actually touching the
screen<00:05:52.729> and<00:05:53.029> it's<00:05:53.719> just<00:05:53.899> tracking<00:05:54.229> my

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:54.469 
screen and it's just tracking my

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:56.170 
screen and it's just tracking my
movement<00:05:54.860> with<00:05:54.979> a<00:05:55.069> pen<00:05:55.310> so<00:05:55.819> you<00:05:55.849> can<00:05:56.000> see<00:05:56.149> a

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
movement with a pen so you can see a

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.809 
movement with a pen so you can see a
preview<00:05:56.919> see<00:05:57.919> if<00:05:57.979> it<00:05:58.099> works<00:05:58.250> for<00:05:58.399> that<00:05:58.490> one<00:05:58.669> you

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
preview see if it works for that one you

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:04.110 
preview see if it works for that one you
have<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.120> tap<00:05:59.330> on<00:05:59.449> that<00:05:59.479> one<00:06:01.089> and<00:06:02.089> there<00:06:02.449> it<00:06:02.569> is

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
have to tap on that one and there it is

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.129 
have to tap on that one and there it is
also<00:06:05.120> in<00:06:05.360> fact<00:06:05.539> let<00:06:05.629> me<00:06:05.659> go<00:06:05.779> back<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:06.050> that

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
also in fact let me go back to that

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:15.659 
also in fact let me go back to that
video<00:06:06.349> clip<00:06:10.419> start<00:06:11.419> playing

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.450 

and<00:06:16.240> I<00:06:16.479> can<00:06:16.659> actually<00:06:16.749> start<00:06:17.280> looking<00:06:18.280> through

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
and I can actually start looking through

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.850 
and I can actually start looking through
with<00:06:18.909> the<00:06:19.060> s-pen<00:06:19.539> and<00:06:20.319> go<00:06:20.499> to<00:06:20.560> a<00:06:20.680> particular

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
with the s-pen and go to a particular

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.390 
with the s-pen and go to a particular
point<00:06:21.280> if<00:06:21.490> I<00:06:21.580> want<00:06:21.759> to<00:06:22.740> just<00:06:23.740> by<00:06:23.860> moving<00:06:24.129> it

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
point if I want to just by moving it

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.350 
point if I want to just by moving it
across<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:24.969> then<00:06:25.090> tapping<00:06:26.939> and<00:06:27.939> there<00:06:28.150> it<00:06:28.270> is

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
across and then tapping and there it is

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.969 
across and then tapping and there it is
and<00:06:28.569> again<00:06:28.749> it's<00:06:28.810> not<00:06:29.080> doing<00:06:29.319> it<00:06:29.409> justice<00:06:29.770> how

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
and again it's not doing it justice how

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.739 
and again it's not doing it justice how
clear<00:06:30.490> that<00:06:30.520> is<00:06:30.699> you're<00:06:31.300> probably<00:06:31.449> getting<00:06:31.629> a

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:31.749 
clear that is you're probably getting a
