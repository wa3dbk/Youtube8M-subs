00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 Hello everyone, now I will do 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:10.110
 unpacking it again for xbox 360 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.790
 and just today bought and video price 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.859
 amounted to 2590 rubles so let's 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.010
 let's get started 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:26.720
 the box looks like a clearing it still 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.720
 for a long time I did not take off the surgeon film 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.600
 very convenient to tear off this film 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.560
 rarity 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:18.880
 some small film remained 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:24.040
 such a sticker and barcode so as not to 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:28.090
 were able to steal the game in the store let's 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.990
 read what is written on the box here 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.990
 backside 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.900
 here is the front side 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:02:00.750
 Once again, here it is written on the side 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:04.490
 grand five after five so there is still 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:12.569
 some film is now her too 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:22.650
 I hide as I understood she must herself 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:29.330
 tear so here so here it seems everything is very 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:33.650
 tight and hold the fishing line and here it is gta 5 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.650
 let's look at these booklets 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:46.459
 aside as you can read 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.459
 click on pause, I'll show you everything 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:44.819
 and it was all a message page 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:44.819
 and see what else is there 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:04:01.840
 addition to the game on the back 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:07.989
 code is written now I will cover and show 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:16.560
 what's on the back of it 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:16.560
 much like it would be difficult to cover up the way 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.950
 how many gloves 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:35.039
 Here in general, and here the map 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:38.479
 so i will show you later first show 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:45.509
 drives look like and then show 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:49.939
 fully map everything very tight 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.939
 holding on even their drive to break 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:57.569
 wait click on pause 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:00.090
 with great difficulty, I was able to pull out 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.990
 drive and I thought to be honest with him 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:09.770
 just the most 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:16.050
 let's see how it looks like this 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:18.319
 watermarks with the x-box on the second 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.319
 disk 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:29.619
 so now I'll show you a card like this 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:35.169
 here's a map here for comparison 

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:40.499
 drive next here such a drive such a card from 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.499
 only one side yet there are also 2 

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:46.499
 here it is all painted where what 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.499
 located 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.180
 and now I will turn the other side care 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.180
 you have the other side of the card 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.700
 so here he sees apparently she will 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:25.080
 very big by the way forgot to say 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:29.460
 that x-box Armenians I specifically bought 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:34.980
 her to make a review possible at the end 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:37.820
 of the month I'll buy myself an Xbox 360 on this 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:40.020
 unpacking gta 5 is complete 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.290
