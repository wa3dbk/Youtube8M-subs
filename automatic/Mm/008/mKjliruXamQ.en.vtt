00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
in the towel and then i used the Delphic

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.770 
in the towel and then i used the Delphic
am<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.370> then<00:03:48.520> we<00:03:48.640> don't<00:03:48.730> need<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:48.940> bench<00:03:49.209> but<00:03:49.570> we

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
am and then we don't need a bench but we

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.720 
am and then we don't need a bench but we
can<00:03:50.050> use<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.230> bench<00:03:50.470> but<00:03:50.650> we<00:03:50.770> don't<00:03:50.920> need<00:03:51.040> one<00:03:51.190> so

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
can use a bench but we don't need one so

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.670 
can use a bench but we don't need one so
yeah<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.209> basically<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.110> hybrid<00:03:53.500> that

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
yeah that is basically the hybrid that

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.190 
yeah that is basically the hybrid that
i'm<00:03:53.800> using<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.700> minute<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.810> be<00:03:55.900> honest

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
in my opinion it's probably one of the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.520 
in my opinion it's probably one of the
best<00:03:58.390> ones<00:03:58.600> i've<00:03:58.750> been<00:03:58.870> using<00:03:59.020> for<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.350> while
