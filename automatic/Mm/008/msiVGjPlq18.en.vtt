00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
we're trying to loop the loop and then

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.310 
we're trying to loop the loop and then
pull<00:00:15.890> hopefully<00:00:16.890> not<00:00:17.760> fresh<00:00:18.090> but<00:00:18.199> you<00:00:19.199> know

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
know what it's called also come up

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
know what it's called also come up
almost<00:00:47.040> all<00:00:49.790> know<00:00:50.809> we<00:00:51.809> try<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:53.750> so

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
almost all know we try it on that so

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.030 
almost all know we try it on that so
that<00:00:54.930> i<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.500> find<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:56.010> what<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.340> called<00:00:56.640> I

made<00:00:59.040> amazing<00:01:03.350> right<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.380> I'm<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> try

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
made amazing right now I'm going to try

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.700 
made amazing right now I'm going to try
to<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.520> off<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> shortest<00:01:06.330> jump<00:01:06.630> which<00:01:07.440> is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
to go off the shortest jump which is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.330 
to go off the shortest jump which is
probably<00:01:08.750> this<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.200> from<00:01:10.680> mm<00:01:11.040> I'm

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
probably this one right here from mm I'm

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.680 
probably this one right here from mm I'm
in<00:01:11.550> front<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.170> wait<00:01:13.170> no<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> trunk<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
in front of it wait no the trunk and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.070 
in front of it wait no the trunk and
trying<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.780> put<00:01:16.160> back<00:01:17.160> to<00:01:17.369> probably<00:01:17.610> go<00:01:18.270> there

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
trying to put back to probably go there

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.940 
trying to put back to probably go there
goes<00:01:22.009> maybe<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.160> should<00:01:23.490> move<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> Rayleigh

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
goes maybe I should move the Rayleigh

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.730 
goes maybe I should move the Rayleigh
might<00:01:25.950> help<00:01:26.250> by<00:01:26.550> just<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.300> little<00:01:27.600> cat
