 per second 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.060
 designed to supply water from 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.230
 remote source to the fire 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.040
 the source may be a fire pond

 ms 140 production of JSC Kurganmashzavod 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.900
 has a particular advantage due to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.820
 high cross on snow and 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.540
 in swampy areas can be used 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.670
 all year round 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.479
 the pump is driven by 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.089
 independent engine yamz-238 b14 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.350
 rated at 300 horsepower which for 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.960
 easier start in winter 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.000

 also by specialists who operate this 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.950
 Kunga design technique also have 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.630
 features allowing to increase 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.550
 operational qualities of the superstructure he 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.230

 between kung board broadside rubber 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.760
 ensuring tightness 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.980
 passing water obstacles doors 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.200
 swing type also have seals 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.510
 fixed Kung folding brackets 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.280
 set in the corners so for 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.830
 dismounting the kunga is enough to open 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.900
 four staples screen remove kung for what 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.620
 provided eye quantity bolts 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.230

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.530
 four thousand kilograms payload 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.569
 pull the building has its own 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.310
 independent power supply and independent 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.840
 fuel tank and also has 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.810
 highway system interventions 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.900
 that is, completely autonomous machine 4 ohm 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.209
 140 is equipped with a fire carriage LSD y 60 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.420
 water flow through the nozzle at pressure 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.220
 10 atmospheres 60 liters per second 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.700
 range of a continuous jet is 80 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.739
 meters 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.900
 carriage control is carried out 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.320
 remotely from the control panel drive 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.489
 control electric 24 volt 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.140
 bearing bearing units are made with 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.300
 the use of polyamide plastic 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.860
 stainless steel that provides 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.320
 low friction and corrosion resistance 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.209
 lack of lubrication of bearing units 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.320
 ensures reliable operation of the mechanism 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.330
 at low temperatures 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.190
 original bearing arrangement 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.540
 knots led to a decrease in hydraulic 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.580
 losses in the barrel and boosted it 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.530
 efficiency of such 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.720
 way in the design of fire pump 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.480
 station on the basis of a floating swamp h 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.920
 spending m140 we tried to provide for 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.500
 people operating this technique 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.630
 maximum convenience ease and accessibility 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.320
 maintenance of the machine itself at the level of 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.320
 base chassis
