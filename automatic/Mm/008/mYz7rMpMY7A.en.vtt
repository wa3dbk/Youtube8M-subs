00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.700
 I am july issue and track nutritionist 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.100
 I'm going to talk about soft drinks in summer and 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.440
 hydration gone an article recently 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.820
 journalistic in which it is implied that 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.920
 to hydrate in summer we can 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.449
 turn the whole mind to evil 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.760
 called soda because I say more 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.770
 called because despite the refreshments 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.780
 is the legal name collect a 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.300
 regulation in Spain in other places not 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.890
 I do not like the word at all 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.649
 soda because it gives a connotation 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.510
 positive that we can not give at all 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.370
 those sugary drinks an exception 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.450
 I like it a lot more because it helps 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.579
 to sugary crumbs because they have 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.649
 very much sugar for example a typical 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.780
 stylized bottle of 50 centiliters of 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.770
 the tail life has 50 grams of 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.870
 sugar inside it is to say 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.180
 about 12 teaspoons 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.160
 sugar nobody would put on his coffee in his 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.809
 healthy judgment 12 teaspoons of sugar 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.430
 because surely someone did in fact 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.680
 would stop the hand before finishing and that's 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.329
 what exactly is there in a famous 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.340
 tail weakness and there may be 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.649
 much more if it's a drink of 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.830
 orange or is a lemon drink that are 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.200
 usually consumed by books 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.840
 but what is the question that makes me 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.850
 I advised them to drink 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.650
 sugary in summer as a source of 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.200
 hydration in fact I'm not the only one 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.630
 he says it by the way because good is based on 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.490
 that sugary drinks get fat is 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 a fat word precisely and that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.780
 worth the redundancy and that what 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.370
 we apply with this category for 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.380
 sugary drinks because we know 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.750
 convincingly that the habitual consumption 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.120
 of this type of drink is increased to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.910
 a very high risk of overweight 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.410
 or obesity over the years only 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.150
 it means that we can never take 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.470
 but if it means we have to be 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.350
 aware that to hydrate us 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.000
 we have to resort to water if it 's the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.530
 tap water while our 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.850
 municipality tell us that it is drinking water 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.930
 there is no problem and in fact 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.479
 we are doing the environment a favor 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.710
 environment because bottled waters 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.870
 contribute to polluting the environment 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.670
 ambient 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.190
 again we can apply the same to the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.980
 ice cream to smoothies to soft drinks a 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.120
 the horchatas or the organized ones are 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.100
 foods that consumed so 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.869
 casual does not have any harm to 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.190
 health but consumed in a way 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.930
 habitual in a society like ours 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.360
 in which so much obesity can 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.590
 contribute in a remarkable way to suffer 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.930
 excess weight and pathologies 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.280
 relational I insist to hydrate 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.280
 water greetings
