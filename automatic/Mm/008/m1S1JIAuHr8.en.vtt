00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
custom paint it it comes in two colors

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.530 
custom paint it it comes in two colors
that<00:02:04.079> normal<00:02:04.469> green<00:02:04.770> there<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.759> tan<00:02:06.119> I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
that normal green there and a tan I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.219 
that normal green there and a tan I
think<00:02:06.899> Michael<00:02:07.380> Manette<00:02:07.590> Harvard

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
think Michael Manette Harvard

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.550 
think Michael Manette Harvard
and<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.679> black<00:02:08.920> version<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:10.720> does<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.110> job<00:02:11.349> I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
and a black version it does the job I

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.440 
and a black version it does the job I
would<00:02:11.709> recommend<00:02:12.220> wearing<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.610> heart<00:02:12.879> above

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
would recommend wearing a heart above

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.550 
would recommend wearing a heart above
this<00:02:13.750> because<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:15.459> don't<00:02:15.670> want<00:02:15.940> your<00:02:16.090> head

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
this because you don't want your head

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.809 
this because you don't want your head
shocked<00:02:17.560> cause<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:17.950> will<00:02:18.159> hurt<00:02:18.400> if<00:02:18.610> your

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
shocked cause that will hurt if your

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.240 
shocked cause that will hurt if your
head<00:02:18.940> gets<00:02:19.180> shot<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.560> guns<00:02:20.769> are<00:02:20.980> strong

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
head gets shot if the guns are strong

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.420 
head gets shot if the guns are strong
that's<00:02:22.239> all<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.599> say<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.959> comes<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.290> little<00:02:23.440> air

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
that's all to say it comes a little air

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.509 
that's all to say it comes a little air
mat<00:02:24.730> here<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:26.019> for<00:02:26.260> easy<00:02:26.379> breathing<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.220> the

only<00:02:27.879> con<00:02:28.510> about<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.160> mesh

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
only con about this is that it the mesh

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.710 
only con about this is that it the mesh
it<00:02:31.150> does<00:02:31.360> not<00:02:31.510> give<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.870> two<00:02:32.260> let's<00:02:33.010> see<00:02:33.220> I

other con about it that was the look on

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.690 
other con about it that was the look on
that<00:02:52.590> when<00:02:53.590> it's<00:02:53.739> in<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:53.980> day<00:02:54.160> now<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.579> it

very long to put it on it darkens the
whole<00:02:59.470> day<00:02:59.769> up<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.310> sometimes<00:03:00.519> it's<00:03:00.910> actually

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
whole day up so sometimes it's actually

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.110 
whole day up so sometimes it's actually
your<00:03:01.959> vision<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.709> become<00:03:02.950> quite<00:03:03.489> blurry<00:03:03.910> when

it starts to get dark and that's

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.759 
it starts to get dark and that's
basically<00:03:07.030> it

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
basically it

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.809 
basically it
there<00:03:08.769> are<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:08.920> only<00:03:09.129> really<00:03:09.400> things<00:03:09.670> you

there are the only really things you
need<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:10.030> talk<00:03:10.269> about<00:03:10.450> it's<00:03:10.660> just<00:03:10.720> standard

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
mask and it works fine like I've been

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.309 
mask and it works fine like I've been
using<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.470> for<00:03:14.910> about<00:03:15.910> nine<00:03:16.000> scotches<00:03:16.569> now<00:03:17.109> and

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
using it for about nine scotches now and

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.740 
using it for about nine scotches now and
it<00:03:17.410> works<00:03:17.590> grind<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:19.239> don't<00:03:19.419> need<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.599> buy

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
it works grind you don't need to buy

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.920 
it works grind you don't need to buy
these<00:03:19.810> fancy<00:03:21.329> goggles<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.540> one<00:03:22.690> thing

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
these fancy goggles and the one thing

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.390 
these fancy goggles and the one thing
the<00:03:23.319> reason<00:03:23.440> why<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.739> bought<00:03:23.980> these<00:03:24.130> mesh

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
the reason why I bought these mesh

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.280 
the reason why I bought these mesh
goggles<00:03:24.849> is<00:03:24.940> because<00:03:25.299> they<00:03:25.450> do<00:03:25.510> not<00:03:25.720> follow<00:03:25.989> up

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
goggles is because they do not follow up

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.210 
goggles is because they do not follow up
on<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:26.709> goggles<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:28.650> think<00:03:29.650> he<00:03:29.739> can<00:03:29.919> get<00:03:30.010> other

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
on like goggles I think he can get other

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.220 
on like goggles I think he can get other
versions<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.790> these<00:03:31.000> mesh<00:03:31.450> goggles<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:31.900> come

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
versions of these mesh goggles that come

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.379 
versions of these mesh goggles that come
just<00:03:32.530> right<00:03:32.799> here<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:36.639> thing<00:03:36.849> is<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.209> can

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
just right here and the thing is you can

just right here and the thing is you can
take<00:03:37.599> this<00:03:37.750> off<00:03:37.989> if<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.290> don't<00:03:38.440> want<00:03:38.680> this

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
take this off if you don't want this

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.890 
take this off if you don't want this
here<00:03:39.250> if<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:39.700> want<00:03:39.849> to<00:03:39.940> breathe<00:03:40.239> properly<00:03:40.599> you

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
can take this off and just leave the

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.420 
can take this off and just leave the
mesh<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.060> that's<00:03:43.269> about<00:03:43.510> it

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
mesh and that's about it

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.830 
mesh and that's about it
yeah<00:03:45.430> I'd<00:03:45.549> recommend<00:03:45.970> buying<00:03:46.239> these<00:03:46.480> because
