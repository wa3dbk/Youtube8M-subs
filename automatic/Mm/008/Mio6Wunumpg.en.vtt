00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
back and we just continue to spread out

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.020 
back and we just continue to spread out
until<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:59.350> next<00:02:59.650> set<00:02:59.890> of<00:03:00.100> what<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.850> note

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
until the next set of what is to note

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.640 
until the next set of what is to note
that<00:03:01.060> when<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.570> eases<00:03:01.930> do<00:03:02.140> come<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.530> you've

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
that when the eases do come in you've

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.110 
that when the eases do come in you've
got<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.770> make<00:03:02.980> sure<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.550> kill<00:03:03.820> them<00:03:04.000> as

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
got to make sure that you kill them as

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.790 
got to make sure that you kill them as
fast<00:03:04.390> as<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.660> can<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.290> uses<00:03:05.650> is

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
fast as you can one of the uses is

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.800 
fast as you can one of the uses is
because<00:03:06.100> once<00:03:06.610> they<00:03:06.760> get<00:03:06.910> too<00:03:07.090> close<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.660> each

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
because once they get too close to each

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.540 
because once they get too close to each
other<00:03:07.989> they<00:03:08.320> will<00:03:08.470> start<00:03:08.830> healing<00:03:09.190> each<00:03:09.310> other

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
other they will start healing each other

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.979 
other they will start healing each other
isn't<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:09.940> right<00:03:10.090> that's<00:03:10.420> right<00:03:10.720> you've<00:03:10.900> got

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
isn't that right that's right you've got

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.150 
isn't that right that's right you've got
to<00:03:11.020> make<00:03:11.200> sure<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.380> get<00:03:11.470> straight<00:03:11.830> on<00:03:11.980> those

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
to make sure you get straight on those

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.710 
to make sure you get straight on those
inside<00:03:12.370> doing<00:03:12.760> damage<00:03:13.060> yeah<00:03:13.270> but<00:03:13.480> they<00:03:13.570> have

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
inside doing damage yeah but they have

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.690 
inside doing damage yeah but they have
to<00:03:13.810> be<00:03:13.900> extremely<00:03:14.140> close<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:15.040> mean<00:03:15.070> your<00:03:15.310> DPS

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
to be extremely close I mean your DPS

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.370 
to be extremely close I mean your DPS
should<00:03:15.880> have<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.060> be<00:03:16.180> pretty<00:03:16.570> low<00:03:16.840> for<00:03:17.110> them<00:03:17.200> to

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
should have to be pretty low for them to

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.810 
should have to be pretty low for them to
start<00:03:17.620> healing<00:03:17.769> each<00:03:18.010> other<00:03:18.220> they<00:03:18.370> only<00:03:18.489> start

start healing each other they only start
healing<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.150> trouble<00:03:19.420> when<00:03:19.540> they're<00:03:19.660> very

everyone's already sand on one point

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.810 
everyone's already sand on one point
then<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.860> ads<00:03:45.010> will<00:03:45.160> all<00:03:45.250> go<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.430> look<00:03:45.670> like

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
then the ads will all go to look like

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.750 
then the ads will all go to look like
clump<00:03:46.150> onto<00:03:46.450> one<00:03:46.600> point<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.200> you<00:03:47.350> can<00:03:47.760> notice

clump onto one point and you can notice
oh<00:03:49.030> this<00:03:49.269> is<00:03:49.390> actually<00:03:49.570> quite<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.959> nice<00:03:50.320> combo

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
oh this is actually quite a nice combo

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.380 
oh this is actually quite a nice combo
too<00:03:50.860> as<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.519> can<00:03:51.640> see<00:03:51.820> from<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.060> bosses

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390

health it's already quite low

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.340 
health it's already quite low
yeah<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.820> goes<00:03:55.000> down<00:03:55.269> fairly<00:03:55.600> quick<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:56.200> mean

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
green together is very bad because we've

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.580

right<00:04:13.830> behind<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.220> boss<00:04:14.400> but<00:04:14.790> with<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> green

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420

one as well you're taking Splash Damage
so<00:04:18.150> everyone<00:04:18.510> needs<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.840> spread<00:04:19.079> out<00:04:19.200> for

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470

so everyone needs to spread out for
yards<00:04:19.920> but<00:04:20.220> then<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.489> also<00:04:20.609> take<00:04:20.940> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
yards but then you also take the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.090 
yards but then you also take the
additional<00:04:21.480> damage<00:04:21.750> from<00:04:21.870> red<00:04:22.109> yeah<00:04:22.560> if<00:04:22.980> you

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
additional damage from red yeah if you

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.400 
additional damage from red yeah if you
get<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.280> purple<00:04:23.790> a<00:04:23.910> red<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.750> green<00:04:24.780> that's

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
get a purple a red and a green that's

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.260 
get a purple a red and a green that's
horrible<00:04:25.860> that's<00:04:26.010> worst-case<00:04:26.580> scenario<00:04:27.000> but

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
horrible that's worst-case scenario but

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.390 
horrible that's worst-case scenario but
still<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.320> scenario<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.950> would<00:04:29.130> still

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
still in that scenario I would still

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.490 
still in that scenario I would still
recommend<00:04:29.580> killing<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.420> purple<00:04:30.870> definitely

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
recommend killing the purple definitely

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.260 
recommend killing the purple definitely
because<00:04:31.800> even<00:04:32.310> though<00:04:32.520> there<00:04:32.760> will<00:04:32.880> be<00:04:32.910> more

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
because even though there will be more

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.460 
because even though there will be more
damage<00:04:33.600> going<00:04:33.780> out<00:04:33.960> you're<00:04:34.080> just<00:04:34.110> gonna<00:04:34.320> have
