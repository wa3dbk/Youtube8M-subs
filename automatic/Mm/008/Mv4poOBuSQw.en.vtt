people<00:01:04.890> say<00:01:05.129> don't<00:01:05.189> use<00:01:05.430> ghost<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.850> i'm<00:01:05.909> just

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
people say don't use ghost but i'm just

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.429 
people say don't use ghost but i'm just
saying<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> pretty<00:01:06.780> decent<00:01:07.200> stealth

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
saying this is a pretty decent stealth

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.200 
saying this is a pretty decent stealth
gun<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:07.920> great<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.490> map<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
gun and it's great for this map for the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.730 
gun and it's great for this map for the
reason<00:01:09.780> being<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.560> still

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
reason being is because it is still

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.039 
reason being is because it is still
somewhat<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.790> dangerous<00:01:12.330> gun<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.840> pretty

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
somewhat of a dangerous gun is pretty

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
somewhat of a dangerous gun is pretty
strong<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.740> close<00:01:14.070> quarters<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.909> guys<00:01:15.060> can

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
strong at close quarters as you guys can

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.630 
strong at close quarters as you guys can
tell<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:16.409> even<00:01:16.650> more<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.009> promise<00:01:17.430> when

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
tell it's even more of a promise when

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330 
tell it's even more of a promise when
it's<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:18.090> got<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> most<00:01:18.920> fastest<00:01:19.920> rate<00:01:20.220> of

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it's not got the most fastest rate of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.999 
it's not got the most fastest rate of
spire<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.880> guess<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.470> always<00:01:22.590> makes<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
spire I guess so that always makes it

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.260 
spire I guess so that always makes it
great<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.430> map<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
great for this map like when you have to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
great for this map like when you have to
drop<00:01:24.450> down<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.770> run<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.100> real

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
the game so it was a decent gameplay I

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.039 
the game so it was a decent gameplay I
wasn't<00:03:32.000> really<00:03:32.090> playing<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.510> objective<00:03:32.599> too

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
wasn't really playing the objective too

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.150 
wasn't really playing the objective too
much<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.410> killstreaks<00:03:33.829> were<00:03:33.950> really

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
much the killstreaks were really

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.860 
much the killstreaks were really
suppressing<00:03:34.609> them<00:03:34.700> though<00:03:34.879> so<00:03:35.569> that<00:03:35.690> was<00:03:35.840> uh

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
suppressing them though so that was uh

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.569 
suppressing them though so that was uh
that's<00:03:36.319> kind<00:03:36.500> of<00:03:36.560> like<00:03:36.680> why<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:36.980> wasn't<00:03:37.430> messing

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.520 
that's kind of like why I wasn't messing
