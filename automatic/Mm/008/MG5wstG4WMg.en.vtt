 twenty first century spaceships 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.580
 plowing open spaces of the Novorizhskoye highway 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.849
 here in one of the same space ships 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:26.169
 and the food machine is called land rover 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:28.960
 range rover wog with e 44 engine 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:34.540
 liters turbo diesel capacity 339 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:37.390
 horsepower according to my feelings is like 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.810
 locomotive that was sucked into Shibe you 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.570
 you press the gas pedal and it is an article about a 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.910
 him an image shoot 69 seconds 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.370
 up to a hundred for a second we lead 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.130
 car that weighs more than two 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.130
 tons to be exact almost 2 and 3 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.770
 quite dynamic trunk is 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.480
 single song 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.280
 the fact is that it opens 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.780
 electronically not needed here 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.360
 make no effort 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.210
 below this part there is a button you 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.540
 just click on it and the trunk itself 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.670
 opens the same way opens and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.090
 the lower part is rich press the button 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 can push by hand accordingly 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.490
 it opens if you want it 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.119
 close push the button it sucks 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.270
 his brother the same goes up 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.560
 pressed 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.750
 and music 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.189
 it produces a cosmic sensation 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.530
 apparatus as the car rides worth 6 2 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.350
 million rubles who goes she just 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.380
 unrealistically 339 horsepower accelerates 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.420
 Range Rover up to a hundred in 6 and 9 seconds for 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.170
 understanding now we drive 40 I now 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.170
 Iâ€™m pushing 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.820
 80 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.430
 120 again 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.020
 140 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.940
 he I think beyond the meaning of repentance for 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.950
 it still drive on Russian roads 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.050
 can't 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.450
 romero level two screens classic 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.580
 dashboard with some scales 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.650
 arrows he does not have them in fact it 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.450
 high resolution monitor on which 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.640
 so the picture is displayed which is needed in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.890
 the moment here can be shown 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.959
 navigation can show what you have 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.670
 radio stations or as it is called 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.190
 composition that plays with your 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.450
 iphone 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.190
 Naturally there is a classic 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.720
 tachometer 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.680
 classic speedometer down 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.500
 shows the level of fuel in the tank 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.970
 at the same time, unlike a conventional car 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.640
 which is the case when the fuel 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.350
 is ending 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.300
 to meanwhile he is some kind of light bulb without faces 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.300
 rather go to the gas station refuel 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.030
 Range Rover will do otherwise he is in Russian 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.860
 language you see the inscription that in your 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.170
 car fuel runs out and 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.480
 offer to drive to the nearest gas station 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.760
 while on the second screen it will show all 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.980
 refueling en route and it will be possible to 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:09.600
 they pave the way 22-inch wheels 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.120
 for a second 275 to 4022 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.650
 this is low profile tires when we 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.239
 went on an expedition we are very 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.410
 worried because we were driving by 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.950
 Russian roads 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.930
 and the Russian roads are known to be broken 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.910
 as practice has shown machines 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.830
 almost does not feel we drove by 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.290
 it was very much the most different roads 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.280
 comfortable with the way he keeps 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.950
 chic rulitsya input in turn rolls 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.569
 almost not felt so well 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.130
 probably the only thing that wouldn't be worth it 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.940
 do on this rubber then go 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.860
 some dirt 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.720
 after all this car is shod for roads 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.090
 need a normal traveler in 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.769
 comfortable any car of course 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.250
 a refrigerator and he is here 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.989
 open the lid get the second lid and 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.569
 find here the capacity which 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.849
 can fit several bottles 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.690
 some sandwiches shove something else 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.069
 10 on / off button and 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.690
 by the way here is the water of one of 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.299
 Sponsors of our company expedition 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.700
 Russian springs here on the cold water in 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.430
 hot day from very nice driver 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.160
 adaptive light what does it mean it 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.919
 does it mean that when the car is in mode 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.150
 cars on a dark road for example she has 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.889
 the high beam is lit she sees a haircut 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.960
 it is felt itself to be near 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.600
 blind the same thing happens when you 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.520
 someone catching up to bends these lights 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.620
 illuminate the sidewalls and if you 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.449
 turn left turns on here in 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.090
 left side if right to right 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.699
 side there are of course angel eyes 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.620
 which is well just essentially made for 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.759
 order to see the car on the road 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.370
 for 1 for beauty 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.120
 number level so-called multifunction 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.110
 there are a lot of buttons on it here 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.889
 can adjust all major 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.479
 options 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:59.930
 cruise control on the left side 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.240
 working with navigation system with sound 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.039
 you can make it louder quieter switch 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.320
 tunes tunes 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.210
 here you have voice control 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.620
 you can click on the button and voice give 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.690
 near the machine, next to the phone button, you 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.720
 click on the call and on the screen 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.310
 the last dialed numbers are shown 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.289
 where you can call 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.870
 voice will go through the speakerphone and 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:27.410
 you can comfortably talk we 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.960
 we start the car after that from 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.940
 the console comes out so beautiful blyamba 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.570
 which allows you to control modes 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.449
 the box has classic modes here 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.340
 parking rear neutral drive 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:45.470
 the last one seems to me to be a sport 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:47.180
 the same regime that Dushin Shamaich but 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:52.510
 you can only switch to it 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:55.610
 pressing a little drowning and turning the button 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.940
 well and in a nutshell general impressions of 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.490
 This machine is generally on the Windows world want 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.090
 same 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.650
 well honestly on our expedition 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.870
 gold ring recover in 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.270
 different hotels in one of them was 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.729
 air conditioners in other refrigerators 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.919
 before rover there is both this 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.190
 insanely comfort is not very pleasant in 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:21.690
 driving a very powerful quiet car 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:24.030
 cool music in general well this car for 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.800
 its 62 million stuffed with everything 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.660
 do not misunderstand me maybe 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.660
 there is simply nothing to complain about
