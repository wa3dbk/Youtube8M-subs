00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730

on any transformer but not really a
backpack<00:00:40.210> pretty<00:00:40.600> solid<00:00:41.050> figure<00:00:41.380> overall

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
backpack pretty solid figure overall

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.820 
backpack pretty solid figure overall
doesn't<00:00:43.150> look<00:00:43.270> as<00:00:43.450> good<00:00:43.720> as<00:00:43.990> the<00:00:44.290> leader<00:00:44.530> class

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
doesn't look as good as the leader class

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.610 
doesn't look as good as the leader class
does<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:46.390> um<00:00:46.570> he's<00:00:46.810> still<00:00:46.840> pretty<00:00:47.140> good<00:00:47.350> and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
does but um he's still pretty good and

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.170 
does but um he's still pretty good and
considering<00:00:48.280> he's<00:00:48.430> less<00:00:48.640> than<00:00:48.670> half<00:00:49.000> the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
considering he's less than half the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.590 
considering he's less than half the
price<00:00:49.450> definitely<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.740> good<00:00:51.010> buy<00:00:51.360> again<00:00:52.360> we

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
price definitely a good buy again we

it's<00:00:56.110> supposed<00:00:56.290> to<00:00:56.350> be<00:00:56.470> a<00:00:56.500> gun<00:00:56.800> since<00:00:57.310> iron

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
it's kind of got a weird joint this has

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.619 
it's kind of got a weird joint this has
a<00:02:18.909> a<00:02:20.040> pin<00:02:21.040> joint<00:02:21.280> right<00:02:21.790> there<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.359> then<00:02:22.510> it's

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
a a pin joint right there and then it's

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.619

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.030 
got the ball joint inside the forearm
it's<00:02:25.629> not<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:25.959> bad<00:02:26.079> it<00:02:26.469> works<00:02:26.739> pretty<00:02:26.920> well

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
it's not so bad it works pretty well

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.910 
it's not so bad it works pretty well
we've<00:02:27.549> got<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> bicep<00:02:28.269> swivel<00:02:28.689> in<00:02:28.840> here<00:02:29.140> it's

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
we've got a bicep swivel in here it's

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.740 
we've got a bicep swivel in here it's
really<00:02:30.219> stiff<00:02:30.579> but<00:02:30.879> it's<00:02:31.030> in<00:02:31.180> there<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:34.150> chest

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
really stiff but it's in there the chest

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750 
really stiff but it's in there the chest
is<00:02:34.930> pretty<00:02:35.170> much<00:02:35.349> accurate<00:02:35.620> compared<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.549> what

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
is pretty much accurate compared to what

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.240 
is pretty much accurate compared to what
the<00:02:36.879> past<00:02:37.120> ones<00:02:37.359> have<00:02:37.510> been<00:02:37.859> I'm<00:02:38.859> not<00:02:38.980> sure<00:02:39.189> I

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
the past ones have been I'm not sure I

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.259 
the past ones have been I'm not sure I
don't<00:02:39.400> remember<00:02:39.519> from<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.879> movie<00:02:39.970> if<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
don't remember from the movie if the

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.520 
don't remember from the movie if the
wheels<00:02:40.450> are<00:02:40.629> supposed<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.930> be<00:02:40.989> in<00:02:41.079> they're<00:02:41.230> not

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
wheels are supposed to be in they're not

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.379 
wheels are supposed to be in they're not
but<00:02:41.859> they<00:02:41.980> are<00:02:42.099> for<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.370> toy<00:02:42.579> and<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.180> doesn't

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
but they are for the toy and it doesn't

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:44.490 
but they are for the toy and it doesn't
really<00:02:43.480> take<00:02:43.750> too<00:02:43.870> much<00:02:43.989> away<00:02:44.139> from<00:02:44.409> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
really take too much away from the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.020 
really take too much away from the
figure<00:02:44.799> I<00:02:44.980> don't<00:02:45.069> mind<00:02:45.400> them<00:02:45.519> being<00:02:45.639> in<00:02:45.849> there

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
figure I don't mind them being in there

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.220 
figure I don't mind them being in there
they<00:02:46.209> fill<00:02:46.359> it<00:02:46.480> out<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:46.750> they<00:02:46.810> don't<00:02:46.900> look<00:02:47.079> too

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
they fill it out and they don't look too

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.300 
they fill it out and they don't look too
bad<00:02:48.180> no<00:02:49.180> waist<00:02:49.389> articulation<00:02:49.599> on<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.409> guy<00:02:50.560> he

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
bad no waist articulation on this guy he

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.250 
bad no waist articulation on this guy he
can't<00:02:51.549> turn<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:54.209> that's<00:02:55.209> okay<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.750> don't

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
can't turn but that's okay you don't

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.020 
can't turn but that's okay you don't
really<00:02:56.349> need<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.799> guess<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.370> just<00:02:57.579> really

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
really need that I guess I just really

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.860 
really need that I guess I just really
loose<00:02:58.239> on<00:02:58.419> mine

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
loose on mine

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.909 
loose on mine
hopefully<00:02:59.290> it's<00:02:59.409> not<00:02:59.439> like<00:02:59.709> that<00:02:59.859> for

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
hopefully it's not like that for

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.420 
hopefully it's not like that for
everyone<00:03:00.370> else<00:03:00.720> but<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:02.049> can<00:03:02.409> put<00:03:03.040> up<00:03:03.159> with<00:03:03.310> that

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
everyone else but I can put up with that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.490 
everyone else but I can put up with that
because<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.879> head<00:03:04.030> sculpt<00:03:04.419> is<00:03:04.540> awesome<00:03:05.079> looks

because the head sculpt is awesome looks
really<00:03:05.889> really<00:03:06.129> good<00:03:06.280> compared<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.819> past

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
really really good compared to past

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.449 
really really good compared to past

I haven't done it before and I will tell
you<00:03:40.269> about<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.599> vehicle<00:03:40.930> mode<00:03:42.120> okay<00:03:43.120> we<00:03:43.449> have

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
you about the vehicle mode okay we have

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.809 
you about the vehicle mode okay we have
Ironhide<00:03:44.290> transform<00:03:44.979> took<00:03:45.280> me<00:03:45.489> probably

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
Ironhide transform took me probably

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.550 
Ironhide transform took me probably
about<00:03:46.000> 10<00:03:46.329> minutes<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.720> get<00:03:46.840> him<00:03:46.959> done<00:03:47.169> not

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
about 10 minutes to get him done not

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.500 
about 10 minutes to get him done not
because<00:03:47.949> it's<00:03:48.129> difficult<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.669> transform<00:03:49.209> just

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
because it's difficult to transform just

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.899 
because it's difficult to transform just
because<00:03:50.049> like<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.409> said<00:03:50.470> with<00:03:50.709> Megatron<00:03:50.979> the

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
because like I said with Megatron the

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.399 
because like I said with Megatron the
instructions<00:03:52.540> are<00:03:52.780> not<00:03:52.840> easy<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.919> follow<00:03:55.409> once

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 
instructions are not easy to follow once

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:57.869 
instructions are not easy to follow once
you<00:03:56.590> transform<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.159> sky<00:03:57.310> one<00:03:57.519> so<00:03:57.669> you<00:03:57.729> won't

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
you transform the sky one so you won't

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.159 
you transform the sky one so you won't
have<00:03:57.970> any<00:03:58.030> trouble<00:03:58.299> doing<00:03:58.599> it<00:03:58.720> again

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
have any trouble doing it again

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.670 
have any trouble doing it again
really<00:03:59.620> simple<00:03:59.949> transformation<00:04:00.729> really<00:04:01.030> nice

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
really simple transformation really nice

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.009 
really simple transformation really nice
very<00:04:02.680> solid<00:04:03.250> could<00:04:03.970> be<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.150> regular<00:04:04.569> truck<00:04:04.780> toy

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
very solid could be a regular truck toy

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.009 
very solid could be a regular truck toy

purpose<00:04:12.129> I<00:04:12.459> guess<00:04:12.669> they<00:04:12.819> needed<00:04:13.060> more

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269

gimmicks to try to make more money but I

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.259 
gimmicks to try to make more money but I
don't<00:04:16.900> like<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.699> it<00:04:18.699> seems<00:04:18.849> a<00:04:18.940> little<00:04:19.030> bit

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
don't like it it seems a little bit

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.449 
don't like it it seems a little bit

let me know I don't feel like digging

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.980 
let me know I don't feel like digging
out<00:04:33.310> all<00:04:33.340> my<00:04:33.610> old<00:04:33.640> stuff<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:34.330> check<00:04:34.570> but<00:04:34.900> he

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
out all my old stuff to check but he

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.120 
out all my old stuff to check but he
does<00:04:35.140> seem<00:04:35.290> a<00:04:35.350> little<00:04:35.440> bit<00:04:35.650> smaller<00:04:35.890> than

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
does seem a little bit smaller than

does seem a little bit smaller than
before<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.730> don't<00:04:37.510> really<00:04:37.690> mind<00:04:37.930> because<00:04:38.170> it's

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
before I don't really mind because it's

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.140 
before I don't really mind because it's
a<00:04:38.530> great<00:04:38.710> figure<00:04:38.920> overall<00:04:39.460> while<00:04:39.970> I<00:04:40.000> was

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
a great figure overall while I was

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150 
a great figure overall while I was
transforming<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:40.840> kept<00:04:41.020> thinking<00:04:41.170> this<00:04:41.920> is

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
transforming and I kept thinking this is

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.010 
transforming and I kept thinking this is
really<00:04:42.190> good<00:04:42.550> transformation<00:04:43.210> and<00:04:43.510> very<00:04:43.750> nice

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
really good transformation and very nice

really good transformation and very nice
engineering<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:44.710> this<00:04:45.010> one<00:04:45.960> only<00:04:46.960> bad<00:04:47.170> part

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
engineering in this one only bad part

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.440 
engineering in this one only bad part
really<00:04:47.590> is<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.800> truck<00:04:48.010> bed<00:04:48.220> can't<00:04:49.180> really

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
really is the truck bed can't really

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.660 
really is the truck bed can't really
looks<00:04:50.290> like<00:04:50.350> transformer<00:04:50.980> underneath<00:04:51.340> but

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
looks like transformer underneath but

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.030 
looks like transformer underneath but
every<00:04:52.390> other<00:04:52.480> part<00:04:52.810> of<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:52.990> not<00:04:53.500> too<00:04:53.710> bad<00:04:53.890> at

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
every other part of it not too bad at

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.190 
every other part of it not too bad at
all<00:04:54.160> a<00:04:54.370> lot<00:04:54.550> of<00:04:54.580> good<00:04:54.790> detail<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.750> can<00:04:55.840> see<00:04:56.080> the

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
all a lot of good detail you can see the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.170 
all a lot of good detail you can see the

supposed to be Voyager Class maybe a

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.960 
supposed to be Voyager Class maybe a
little<00:05:18.220> bit<00:05:18.400> bigger

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
I'm gonna go same with Megatron eight

I'm gonna go same with Megatron eight
out<00:05:20.860> of<00:05:20.890> ten<00:05:21.220> great<00:05:21.520> transform

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
out of ten great transform

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.270 
out of ten great transform
transformation<00:05:22.750> good<00:05:23.410> robot<00:05:23.770> mode<00:05:23.980> good

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
vehicle mode really the only complaint

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.610

is<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.430> new<00:05:27.640> met<00:05:28.630> tech<00:05:30.630> stupid<00:05:31.630> thing<00:05:31.810> so

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
is the new met tech stupid thing so

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.660 
is the new met tech stupid thing so
there<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:32.800> go<00:05:32.980> eight<00:05:33.160> out<00:05:33.280> of<00:05:33.310> ten<00:05:33.520> for
