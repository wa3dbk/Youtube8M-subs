00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.539 
that goes forward while you want the
hook<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.810> go<00:02:41.930> forward<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:42.860> like<00:02:43.129> that<00:02:43.370> with

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
hook to go forward I just like that with

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.370 
hook to go forward I just like that with
this<00:02:44.530> basically<00:02:45.530> that's<00:02:45.650> what<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:45.890> does<00:02:47.380> so

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
this basically that's what it does so

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.080 
this basically that's what it does so
this<00:02:48.500> will<00:02:48.709> go<00:02:48.799> on<00:02:48.890> any<00:02:49.130> ear<00:02:49.579> holes

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
