years as I went into it isalways thing

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.119 
years as I went into it isalways thing
cuz<00:00:33.720> I<00:00:33.780> never<00:00:33.839> I'm<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.650> rules<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.949> made

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
cuz I never I'm one of the rules I made

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.319 
cuz I never I'm one of the rules I made
I<00:00:35.159> said<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.489> never<00:00:35.579> listened<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> tapes

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

I said I never listened to the tapes
back<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.989> think<00:00:37.589> when<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.829> finish<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> tape<00:00:38.400> I

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
back I think when I finish the tape I

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.860 
back I think when I finish the tape I
put<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.820> away<00:00:38.909> and<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> never<00:00:39.239> listened<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
put it away and I never listened to it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.399 
put it away and I never listened to it
out<00:00:40.589> of<00:00:40.739> curiosity<00:00:41.040> or<00:00:41.339> whatever<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:43.350> I

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
out of curiosity or whatever it is so I

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:44.719 
out of curiosity or whatever it is so I
put<00:00:43.589> them<00:00:43.680> away<00:00:43.769> and<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.220> kept<00:00:44.519> stacking

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
put them away and I just kept stacking

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.250 
put them away and I just kept stacking
off<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.180> after<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.449> had<00:00:45.600> maybe<00:00:45.870> twenty<00:00:46.229> or

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
off and after I had maybe twenty or

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.619 
off and after I had maybe twenty or
thirty<00:00:46.589> of<00:00:46.680> them<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.949> said<00:00:47.159> I'm<00:00:47.640> probably<00:00:48.449> have

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
thirty of them I said I'm probably have

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.000 
thirty of them I said I'm probably have
some<00:00:48.750> pretty<00:00:48.960> interesting<00:00:49.049> stuff<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.799> there

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
some pretty interesting stuff on there

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910 
some pretty interesting stuff on there
now<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:51.720> I<00:00:51.750> probably<00:00:51.989> started

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
now and that's when I probably started

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.210 
now and that's when I probably started
formulating<00:00:53.369> an<00:00:53.729> idea<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.299> book<00:00:54.710> but<00:00:55.710> even

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
formulating an idea for a book but even

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.740 
formulating an idea for a book but even
then<00:00:56.400> like<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.970> just<00:00:57.180> got<00:00:57.299> bigger<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.689> bigger

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
then like it just got bigger and bigger

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.420 
then like it just got bigger and bigger
and<00:00:57.960> bigger<00:00:58.049> and<00:00:58.470> like<00:00:58.589> this<00:00:58.710> much<00:00:58.920> my<00:00:59.309> own

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and bigger and like this much my own

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.850 
and bigger and like this much my own
story<00:00:59.790> got<00:01:00.119> like<00:01:00.750> higher<00:01:01.409> and<00:01:01.589> higher<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
story got like higher and higher and

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.740 
story got like higher and higher and
higher<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.400> I<00:01:02.430> kind<00:01:02.729> of<00:01:02.759> thought<00:01:02.939> it's<00:01:03.570> only

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
higher so I kind of thought it's only

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.130 
higher so I kind of thought it's only
gonna<00:01:03.930> make<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.409> tapes<00:01:04.769> more<00:01:05.360> more<00:01:06.360> vital<00:01:07.020> now

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.160 

well<00:01:11.140> I<00:01:11.170> thought<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:12.460> know<00:01:12.580> for<00:01:12.850> me<00:01:12.970> um<00:01:13.600> I

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
well I thought you know for me um I

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.790 
well I thought you know for me um I
might<00:01:15.130> be<00:01:15.160> maybe<00:01:15.910> less<00:01:16.570> easy<00:01:17.140> for<00:01:17.500> people<00:01:17.620> to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
might be maybe less easy for people to

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.060 
might be maybe less easy for people to
remember<00:01:18.700> me<00:01:18.880> as<00:01:19.030> well<00:01:19.480> 10<00:01:20.320> years<00:01:20.530> from<00:01:20.680> now<00:01:20.770> or

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
remember me as well 10 years from now or

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.050 
remember me as well 10 years from now or
15<00:01:21.400> years<00:01:21.640> now

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
15 years now

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.760 
15 years now
uh<00:01:22.090> actually<00:01:22.660> my<00:01:22.870> whole<00:01:23.170> idea<00:01:23.470> was<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.590> always

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
uh actually my whole idea was to always

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.440 
uh actually my whole idea was to always
get<00:01:23.860> it<00:01:23.950> done<00:01:24.070> as<00:01:24.160> quickly<00:01:24.550> as<00:01:24.730> possible<00:01:25.180> I

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
get it done as quickly as possible I

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.940 
get it done as quickly as possible I
just<00:01:25.780> didn't<00:01:26.110> know<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.200> it'd<00:01:26.440> take<00:01:26.590> me<00:01:26.710> seven

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
just didn't know that it'd take me seven

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.990 
just didn't know that it'd take me seven

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
this should I do that

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.000 
this should I do that
and<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.570> kind<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:43.229> sort<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:43.920> I'm

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
and I kind of you sort of see what I'm

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.620 
and I kind of you sort of see what I'm
dealing<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.370> all<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> time<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.600> I

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
dealing with all the time the way I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.080 
dealing with all the time the way I
dealt<00:01:46.110> with<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.440> at<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.830> time<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.850> think

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
dealt with it at the time and I think

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.359 
dealt with it at the time and I think
like<00:01:48.900> as<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.229> example<00:01:49.320> you've<00:01:49.890> always<00:01:50.040> asked

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
like as an example you've always asked

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.359 
like as an example you've always asked
me<00:01:50.780> but<00:01:51.780> when<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> punch<00:01:52.229> Vince<00:01:52.500> McMahon<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
me but when I punch Vince McMahon and

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.710 
me but when I punch Vince McMahon and
knocked<00:01:53.820> him<00:01:53.970> out<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> dressing<00:01:54.630> room
