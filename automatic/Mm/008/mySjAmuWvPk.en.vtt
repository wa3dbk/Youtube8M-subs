00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:09.120
 ceiling systems from af have been standing by 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.990
 Generations for quality simple 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.170
 Assembly and timeless design of the system 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.100
 f as a freely suspended system is connected to 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.070
 at 250 spans the ideal solution for 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.699
 corridors the finished ceiling appears 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.340
 particularly large area us homogeneous 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.529
 our chosen variant is f2 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.000
 for subsequent installation work 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.980
 each ceiling plate individually removable 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.219
 a perfect blanket is the crowning glory 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.960
 conclusion for every room with it too 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.960
 give them an excellent result 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.539
 is already successful in transport and at 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.730
 storage of ceiling components 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.860
 cleanliness and drought 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.760
 the pad must be to the same 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.879
 be designed 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.340
 to avoid damage diane 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.329
 plates may not be mounted until 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.040
 Plaster and screed work are finished 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.590
 after the maximum of two feet fifty 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.720
 the room has to be measured 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.320
 cover the mirror so the optical 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.210
 design of the ceiling 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 starting from the middle corridor is the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.790
 division in elements width 4b 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.950
 please pay attention to that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.930
 no cuts smaller than half 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.920
 slab width arise there as this 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.439
 visually are usually not very appealing 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.330
 Now it is up to the montage at the 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.369
 of course, attention to cleanliness 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.320
 must become 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.750
 in the desired ceiling height is 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.390
 attached to the edge angle throughout 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.820
 depending on the plate type weight and format 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.149
 There are different edge angles 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.149
 selection 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.670
 after that also the minimum is directed 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.500
 installation corner training you are in 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.280
 usually as he and cuts 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.280
 perform 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.780
 now they are the first ones 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.400
 Ceiling elements in the row 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.520
 usually starts with a bleed 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.340
 depending on the corridor dimension and 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.770
 Division of the room all imap mineral 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.570
 plates can be easily with a 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.370
 commercial carpet knife too 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.660
 to cut 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.030
 pay attention to the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.140
 Minimum circulation area of â€‹â€‹two-thirds 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.390
 charging also thigh 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.270
 Careful handling of the plates is 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.700
 essential due to the element lengths 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.050
 the plates must be handled ambidextrous 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.540
 be relocated to us 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.420
 the publisher's direction at ours 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.360
 chosen variant f2 always takes place with 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:53.720
 the so-called known to the processor 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.520
 the plate must not sag 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.280
 So you have a suitable one 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.250
 bracing profile ready for you with 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.990
 a hand reach that equipment 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.570
 profile is now inserted and 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.820
 stabilizes the plate it stands 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.190
 different profile cross sections for 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.720
 available depending on the corridor 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.030
 dimensions are to be selected 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.290
 a corresponding span-wide table 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.120
 You can find it on the internet at www 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.400
 grafenau de 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.320
 the assembly of the other plates takes place 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.080
 now always in rows with the 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.209
 associated removal profile without 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.200
 this may not be placed on a plate 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.510
 become 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.150
 the individual elements are only light 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.970
 without putting any effort on each other 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.440
 this ensures the unproblematic 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.450
 dismantling at a later date 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.120
 supported by two slopes can one 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.130
 Recessed or other fittings in 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.769
 a ceiling plate to be installed 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.380
 the maximum cut-out size can be 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.019
 not exactly define we recommend 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.349
 a fairly wide of at least 80 mm 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:07.099
 and its remaining length of at least 200 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:09.290
 mm is the penultimate ceiling slab 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.390
 inserted and the distance to the wall 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.599
 measured 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.590
 then the plate is removed 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.690
 then the last plate 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.990
 cut and with a Radfeder 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:27.460
 assembled last is the penultimate 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.460
 plate inserted again 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.800
 next to the exchangeable plates of the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.680
 Variant f2 are also available to them 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.710
 variants f1 with longitudinal edges used 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.410
 and the variant f3 with recessed longitudinal 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.900
 Cards available for a perfect 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.900
 Result is so nothing in the way
