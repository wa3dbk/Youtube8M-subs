of paper folding the film is actually

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.069 
of paper folding the film is actually
less<00:00:41.739> about<00:00:42.070> origami<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:43.090> more<00:00:43.360> about<00:00:43.600> the

to paper folding on both the scientific

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.939 
to paper folding on both the scientific
and<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.790> artistic<00:00:52.089> ends<00:00:52.809> and<00:00:53.470> there's<00:00:53.739> also

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
and the artistic ends and there's also

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.310 
and the artistic ends and there's also
the<00:00:54.129> metaphor<00:00:54.730> of<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:55.059> single<00:00:55.510> square<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.140> then

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
the metaphor of a single square and then

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.410 
the metaphor of a single square and then
many<00:00:56.710> many<00:00:56.949> things<00:00:57.250> that<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.550> can<00:00:57.579> become<00:00:57.850> so

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
many many things that it can become so

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.750 
many many things that it can become so
we<00:00:58.540> kind<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:58.839> use<00:00:59.589> that<00:00:59.620> metaphor<00:01:00.309> on<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:00.489> film

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
we kind of use that metaphor on the film

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.560 
we kind of use that metaphor on the film
if<00:01:01.420> this<00:01:01.570> is<00:01:01.750> your<00:01:01.899> frame<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:04.300> will

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
if this is your frame and it will

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.740 
if this is your frame and it will
actually<00:01:04.839> stand<00:01:05.500> if<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.670> unfold<00:01:07.149> the<00:01:07.330> back

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
actually stand if you unfold the back

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.070 
actually stand if you unfold the back
flap<00:01:08.200> or<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.979> side<00:01:09.280> flaps<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.660> idea<00:01:10.990> of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
flap or the side flaps and the idea of

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.650 
flap or the side flaps and the idea of
taking<00:01:11.229> one<00:01:11.619> piece<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:12.039> paper<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:12.630> folding<00:01:13.630> it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
taking one piece of paper and folding it

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.520 
taking one piece of paper and folding it
too<00:01:13.990> many<00:01:14.410> different<00:01:15.039> objects<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:17.350> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
too many different objects that's the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.710 
too many different objects that's the
magical<00:01:17.920> part<00:01:18.160> because<00:01:19.030> it's<00:01:19.300> hard<00:01:19.600> to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
magical part because it's hard to

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.529 
magical part because it's hard to
imagine<00:01:19.930> but<00:01:20.440> so<00:01:21.280> many<00:01:21.490> things<00:01:21.970> can<00:01:22.210> be<00:01:22.330> made

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
imagine but so many things can be made

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.300 
imagine but so many things can be made
from<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.899> single<00:01:23.200> piece<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.410> paper<00:01:26.310> another

envelope pressure

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.390 
envelope pressure
it's<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.210> smaller<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.150> made<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:33.360> smart<00:01:34.400> when

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
it's a smaller and we made a smart when

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.990 
it's a smaller and we made a smart when
I<00:01:35.430> pulled<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.820> away<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:38.070> froggy<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.850> can

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
I pulled it away and the froggy that can

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.710 
I pulled it away and the froggy that can
jump

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
and when I'm done with it I get

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.180 
and when I'm done with it I get
something<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:10.020> kind<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.320> fun<00:02:10.740> to<00:02:10.770> look<00:02:10.979> at
