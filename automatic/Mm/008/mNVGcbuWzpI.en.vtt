00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.070
 222 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.859
 I will introduce you briefly about the Three Kingdoms 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:20.990
 Three Zhang Bao international development turns cecum 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:24.289
 The regime is a mobile strategy game 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:29.590
 The basic framework is that the monarch has both secretion and quantity 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.590
 It is a bean k that creates a troop and rushes into the other side 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.780
 It has become more mobile -optimized and trend- 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.490
 I will 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.370
 It's a three- country game, so I'll have to prove it . 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.710
 Try to dive through the enemy base 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:51.550
 This is a bad character. 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:57.220
 The combination of longevity gives you a special passive skill 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:01.239
 Having a passive skill properly is a shortcut to victory. 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:07.600
 When the up-level experience obtained further increased contrast 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:10.030
 This unification is very obvious excitement before the party did so once chilled Kingdoms 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.979
 I 'll see everyone. 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.970
 If you take over the surrounding forces through the unified mode of the world, you will be able to pay more taxes 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.100
 You are 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:28.050
 Also sometimes guilty of such adversity or heungsu occurs and a commitment of other princes 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.050
 I need you to do the manor, and I will use it. Give it to you. God. Go to my land. 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.620
 This is a game that can make history for the Three Kingdoms . 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.350
 If the rough a lot of growth 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.890
 Corps How about you try it? 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.590
 I got my reputation through the retro bong dungeon. 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.030
 I wish you a favor on the previous day. 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.439
 I 'll explain this to you through Dunn's video. 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.880
 Centuries before the refrigeration of the Three Kingdoms in various customs strategy 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.880
 I'm waiting for you
