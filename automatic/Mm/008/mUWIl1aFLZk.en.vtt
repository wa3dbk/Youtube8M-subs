00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.749 
for some reason the news I guess because
of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> shootings<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.310> something<00:01:35.610> they<00:01:35.729> feel

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
of the shootings or something they feel

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.609 
of the shootings or something they feel
the<00:01:36.090> need<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.360> pick<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.689> gamers<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:37.470> some

the need to pick on gamers for some

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.530 
the need to pick on gamers for some
reason<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.729> even<00:01:39.210> if<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.420> something

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
reason and so even if it's something

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.899 
reason and so even if it's something
like<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.020> deep<00:01:40.350> DVT<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.340> happen<00:01:41.520> during

which<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.100> get<00:02:48.489> what<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.670> guess<00:02:48.850> technically

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
which is get what I guess technically

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.360 
which is get what I guess technically
this<00:02:49.300> game<00:02:49.540> other<00:02:50.500> risk<00:02:50.830> factors<00:02:50.980> for

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
this game other risk factors for

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.370 
this game other risk factors for
developing<00:02:51.610> these<00:02:52.180> DVTs<00:02:52.720> include<00:02:53.080> smoking

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
developing these DVTs include smoking

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.830 
developing these DVTs include smoking
obesity<00:02:53.980> heart<00:02:54.280> disease<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.880> cancer<00:02:54.940> so

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
obesity heart disease and cancer so

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.570 
obesity heart disease and cancer so
basically<00:02:56.350> if<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.709> are<00:02:56.890> incredibly

yeah<00:03:03.580> like<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.850> said<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.090> think<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.540> this<00:03:04.660> is

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
yeah like I said I think that this is

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.930 
yeah like I said I think that this is
overhyped<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.530> think<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.190> for<00:03:06.700> some<00:03:06.910> reason

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
overhyped I think that for some reason

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.630 
overhyped I think that for some reason
despite<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.780> fact<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:08.350> gaming<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.400> not

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
despite the fact that like gaming is not

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.539 
despite the fact that like gaming is not
something<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.300> weird<00:03:10.989> nerds<00:03:11.590> do<00:03:12.070> now<00:03:12.340> in

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
something that weird nerds do now in
