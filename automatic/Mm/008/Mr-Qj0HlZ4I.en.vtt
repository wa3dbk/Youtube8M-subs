okay<00:00:02.010> here's<00:00:02.280> another<00:00:02.370> silent<00:00:03.270> vibrato

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
okay here's another silent vibrato

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.260 
okay here's another silent vibrato
exercise<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.470> you<00:00:04.589> can<00:00:04.770> do<00:00:04.980> without<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.940> cello

like<00:00:47.219> doing<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:48.059> particular<00:00:48.450> vibrato

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
like doing this particular vibrato

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.229 
like doing this particular vibrato
exercise<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.100> helps<00:00:50.340> me<00:00:50.460> feel<00:00:50.730> two

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
exercise is because it helps me feel two

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.319 
exercise is because it helps me feel two
specific<00:00:51.809> things<00:00:52.340> one<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.610> helps<00:00:53.850> me<00:00:54.000> feel<00:00:54.180> if

do is feel how my thumb balances my my
other<00:01:13.530> whatever<00:01:14.040> fingers<00:01:14.369> vibrating<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.570> here

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
other whatever fingers vibrating so here

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740 
other whatever fingers vibrating so here
I<00:01:15.840> am<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.290> first<00:01:16.590> finger<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.150> my<00:01:18.150> first<00:01:18.540> finger

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
I am on first finger and my first finger

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.800 
I am on first finger and my first finger
is<00:01:19.020> basically<00:01:19.500> across<00:01:19.740> from<00:01:19.950> thumb<00:01:20.450> then<00:01:21.450> I'll

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
is basically across from thumb then I'll

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.859 
is basically across from thumb then I'll
switch<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.740> second<00:01:23.250> finger<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.759> lo<00:01:24.750> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
switch to second finger and lo and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.289 
switch to second finger and lo and
behold<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.710> second<00:01:26.220> finger<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:26.729> right

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
behold my second finger is now right

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390 
behold my second finger is now right
across<00:01:27.420> from<00:01:27.689> thumb<00:01:27.900> okay<00:01:28.799> now<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> third<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
across from thumb okay now the third and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.859 
across from thumb okay now the third and
fourth<00:01:29.729> finger<00:01:30.000> might<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> little<00:01:30.659> further

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
fourth finger might be a little further

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
fourth finger might be a little further
down<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.350> my<00:01:31.439> hand<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.189> still<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.820> feel

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
down on my hand but still you can feel

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.910 
down on my hand but still you can feel
how<00:01:33.210> when<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.509> go<00:01:33.659> from<00:01:33.840> first<00:01:34.200> finger<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
how when you go from first finger to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.429 
how when you go from first finger to
let's<00:01:35.460> say<00:01:35.610> third<00:01:35.909> finger<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.770> thumb<00:01:40.909> does

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
let's say third finger the thumb does

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
let's say third finger the thumb does
change<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.860> balance<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.250> your<00:01:44.310> hand<00:01:44.610> now<00:01:44.880> I'm

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
change the balance of your hand now I'm

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.580 
change the balance of your hand now I'm
actually<00:01:45.329> leaving<00:01:45.659> my<00:01:45.899> thumb<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.439> same

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
actually leaving my thumb in the same

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.100 
actually leaving my thumb in the same
place<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> case<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.270> opposite

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
place so in this case is the opposite

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.480

side of my hand is doing the balancing
it's<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.820> little<00:01:51.090> different<00:01:51.270> from<00:01:51.450> real

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
it's a little different from real

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.139 
it's a little different from real
comprado<00:01:51.990> um<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.909> sort<00:01:54.030> of

comprado um but just a you know sort of
a<00:01:54.210> different<00:01:54.509> way<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.689> feeling<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.520> now<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
a different way of feeling this now I

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.639 
a different way of feeling this now I
can<00:01:56.969> also<00:01:57.479> concentrate<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.500> this

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
can also concentrate here on this

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.889 
can also concentrate here on this
exercise<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.640> when<00:01:59.880> I'm<00:02:00.000> changing<00:02:00.299> fingers

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
exercise that when I'm changing fingers

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.429 
exercise that when I'm changing fingers
that<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.979> Grotto<00:02:02.460> motion<00:02:03.060> does<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.600> stop<00:02:04.020> so

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
that my Grotto motion does not stop so

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.980 
that my Grotto motion does not stop so
my<00:02:04.560> arm<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.219> my<00:02:05.369> arm<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.640> going

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
my arm is going my arm is going

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.719 
my arm is going my arm is going
is<00:02:06.290> going<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:07.280> don't<00:02:07.430> even<00:02:07.610> necessarily

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
is going and you don't even necessarily

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.660 
is going and you don't even necessarily
see<00:02:08.569> when<00:02:09.259> I<00:02:09.289> change<00:02:09.679> from<00:02:09.920> finger<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.340> thinker

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
see when I change from finger to thinker

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.900 
see when I change from finger to thinker
right<00:02:11.170> because<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.319> does<00:02:12.530> not<00:02:12.709> interrupt<00:02:13.160> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
right because it does not interrupt the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.460 
right because it does not interrupt the
vibration<00:02:14.510> at<00:02:14.810> all<00:02:15.550> okay<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:17.209> um<00:02:17.569> have<00:02:18.410> fun

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
vibration at all okay so um have fun

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.380 
vibration at all okay so um have fun
with<00:02:18.770> this<00:02:18.890> make<00:02:19.190> sure<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.880> don't<00:02:20.060> feel<00:02:20.209> any

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
anywhere you can and I bet your vibrato

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.780 
anywhere you can and I bet your vibrato
is<00:02:27.440> going<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.890> get<00:02:28.220> really<00:02:28.700> good<00:02:28.880> really<00:02:29.420> soon
