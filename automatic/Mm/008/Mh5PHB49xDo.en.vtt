up<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.360> front<00:02:52.570> panel<00:02:52.900> they<00:02:53.020> have<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> gear<00:02:53.440> I

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
up in the front panel they have a gear I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.530 
up in the front panel they have a gear I
guess<00:02:53.740> that's<00:02:53.890> where<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.100> fits<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:55.210> let's

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
guess that's where it fits and let's

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.510 
guess that's where it fits and let's
check<00:02:55.750> out

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.180 

let's<00:03:02.030> check<00:03:02.330> out<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.690> triangles<00:03:03.290> again<00:03:04.070> I'm

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
let's check out the triangles again I'm

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.640 
let's check out the triangles again I'm
on<00:03:04.310> my<00:03:04.340> phone<00:03:04.670> here<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:04.960> this<00:03:05.960> is<00:03:06.140> another<00:03:06.410> like

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
on my phone here so this is another like

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.820 
on my phone here so this is another like
last<00:03:07.160> minute<00:03:07.370> impromptu<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:12.410> that's<00:03:12.620> what<00:03:12.770> it

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
last minute impromptu so that's what it

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.980 
last minute impromptu so that's what it
looks<00:03:12.890> like<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.460> just<00:03:14.030> got<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.450> left<00:03:14.630> blinker

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
looks like I just got the left blinker

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:22.780 
looks like I just got the left blinker
on<00:03:17.110> really<00:03:18.110> nice<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.670> has<00:03:20.440> an<00:03:21.440> LED<00:03:22.220> stripe

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
on really nice so it has an LED stripe

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.390 
on really nice so it has an LED stripe
and<00:03:23.030> then<00:03:23.150> one<00:03:23.390> two<00:03:23.750> three<00:03:24.230> light-up<00:03:24.620> sequence

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:37.490 

let's<00:03:28.400> check<00:03:28.610> out<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.880> front

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:50.480 

my<00:03:38.500> camera's<00:03:38.830> only<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.100> few<00:03:39.340> data

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.100 

cool<00:03:51.740> let's<00:03:52.740> get<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:52.980> little<00:03:53.190> detail<00:03:53.610> in<00:03:53.760> here

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
cool let's get a little detail in here

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.080 
cool let's get a little detail in here
I'll<00:03:55.590> go<00:03:55.800> in<00:03:55.950> there<00:03:56.070> turn<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> hazards<00:03:56.760> on<00:03:56.910> and

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
I'll go in there turn the hazards on and

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.240 
I'll go in there turn the hazards on and
then<00:03:57.180> turn<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.480> lights<00:03:57.690> on

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.120 

and<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:04.170> interior<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.620> same<00:04:04.860> I'm<00:04:05.010> not

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
and the interior is the same I'm not

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.410 
and the interior is the same I'm not
gonna<00:04:05.220> really<00:04:05.400> going<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.580> show<00:04:05.730> much<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.150> I

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
gonna really going to show much of it I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.990 
gonna really going to show much of it I
think<00:04:08.270> it's<00:04:09.270> pretty<00:04:09.390> self-explanatory<00:04:09.810> their

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
think it's pretty self-explanatory their

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.740 
think it's pretty self-explanatory their
big<00:04:12.000> date<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.450> big<00:04:12.600> update<00:04:12.960> is<00:04:13.170> right<00:04:13.410> here

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:26.120 

okay<00:04:20.989> hope<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.170> helps<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.620> also<00:04:25.860> have

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
okay hope that helps and you also have

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:37.520 
okay hope that helps and you also have
these<00:04:26.400> LEDs<00:04:26.820> in<00:04:27.000> here<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:36.230> that<00:04:37.230> is<00:04:37.380> the

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
these LEDs in here and that is the

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.580 
these LEDs in here and that is the
sequence<00:04:37.950> in<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:39.270> back<00:04:39.480> when<00:04:40.170> you<00:04:40.320> have<00:04:40.470> the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
sequence in the back when you have the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.290 
sequence in the back when you have the
turn<00:04:40.740> signals<00:04:41.160> on<00:04:43.250> very<00:04:44.250> nice<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:47.300> don't

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
turn signals on very nice I don't

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.670 
turn signals on very nice I don't
believe<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.750> engine<00:04:49.020> has<00:04:49.110> been<00:04:49.140> updated<00:04:49.620> I

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
believe the engine has been updated I

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.020 
believe the engine has been updated I
think<00:04:49.830> it's<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.010> same<00:04:50.220> engine<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.580> got<00:04:50.940> in

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
think it's the same engine that got in

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.670 
think it's the same engine that got in
the<00:04:51.120> 2015<00:04:53.810> obviously<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.930> LED<00:04:55.260> lights<00:04:55.470> are

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
the 2015 obviously the LED lights are

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.360 
the 2015 obviously the LED lights are
the<00:04:55.770> big<00:04:55.919> thing<00:04:59.660> okay<00:05:00.660> so<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:01.110> element<00:05:02.070> is<00:05:02.190> on

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
the big thing okay so that element is on

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:12.179 
the big thing okay so that element is on
these<00:05:03.150> are<00:05:03.300> off

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:12.189 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:15.159 

see<00:05:13.189> what<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.370> rights<00:05:13.610> are<00:05:13.849> it's<00:05:14.840> just<00:05:14.870> me<00:05:15.139> out

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
see what the rights are it's just me out

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.129 
see what the rights are it's just me out
here<00:05:15.530> so<00:05:17.499> and<00:05:18.499> it's<00:05:18.650> 92<00:05:19.039> degrees<00:05:19.870> it's<00:05:20.870> never

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
here so and it's 92 degrees it's never

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:28.589 
here so and it's 92 degrees it's never
it's<00:05:21.680> never<00:05:21.800> cool<00:05:22.159> out<00:05:22.340> here<00:05:22.370> is<00:05:22.729> it

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.629 

so<00:05:29.169> there<00:05:29.409> you<00:05:29.439> go<00:05:29.529> these<00:05:30.219> are<00:05:30.279> the<00:05:30.399> bright

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
so there you go these are the bright

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.419 
so there you go these are the bright
lights<00:05:30.909> so<00:05:31.449> you<00:05:31.479> got<00:05:31.659> that<00:05:31.809> the<00:05:32.409> two<00:05:32.830> elements

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:33.429 
lights so you got that the two elements

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:36.029 
lights so you got that the two elements
on<00:05:33.759> the<00:05:33.909> inside<00:05:34.270> here<00:05:34.509> then<00:05:35.199> the<00:05:35.319> outer<00:05:35.740> light

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
on the inside here then the outer light

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.980 
on the inside here then the outer light
seems<00:05:36.429> to<00:05:36.520> be<00:05:37.139> the<00:05:38.139> standard<00:05:39.089> radius<00:05:40.089> and<00:05:40.330> then

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
seems to be the standard radius and then

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.749 
seems to be the standard radius and then
these<00:05:41.139> are<00:05:41.199> the<00:05:41.379> these<00:05:41.740> two<00:05:41.979> internal<00:05:42.429> ones<00:05:42.580> on

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
these are the these two internal ones on

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.790 
these are the these two internal ones on
each<00:05:42.849> side<00:05:43.119> of<00:05:43.300> the<00:05:43.419> Fulbright's<00:05:46.589> they<00:05:47.589> turn

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
each side of the Fulbright's they turn

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.419 
each side of the Fulbright's they turn
the<00:05:47.860> Fox<00:05:48.099> on<00:05:49.529> know<00:05:50.529> if<00:05:50.589> they're<00:05:50.740> all<00:05:50.860> ready<00:05:53.429> yep

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:54.429 
the Fox on know if they're all ready yep

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:57.899 
the Fox on know if they're all ready yep
pull<00:05:54.789> out<00:05:55.289> once<00:05:56.289> for<00:05:56.529> the<00:05:56.589> front<00:05:56.800> fogs<00:05:57.039> the

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
pull out once for the front fogs the

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:11.989 
pull out once for the front fogs the
second<00:05:58.779> pull<00:05:59.020> out<00:05:59.199> is<00:05:59.469> front<00:06:00.009> and<00:06:00.219> rear<00:06:00.459> fogs

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:11.999 

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:14.970

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
I don't know what the rear fogs are let

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:48.409 
I don't know what the rear fogs are let
me<00:06:39.590> turn<00:06:39.770> off<00:06:39.800> the<00:06:40.419> hazards
