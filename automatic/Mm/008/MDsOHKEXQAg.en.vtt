at<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.270> we've<00:00:15.420> got<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.840> little<00:00:16.289> bit<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.440> glue

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
at this we've got a little bit of glue

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.170 
at this we've got a little bit of glue
on<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.949> nose<00:00:17.190> there<00:00:17.550> cuz<00:00:17.730> he<00:00:17.820> had<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> little

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
on the nose there cuz he had a little

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.400 
on the nose there cuz he had a little
bit<00:00:18.300> impact<00:00:18.539> here<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:18.780> let's<00:00:18.900> find<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.260> all

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
bit impact here but let's find it's all

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.529 
bit impact here but let's find it's all
stuck<00:00:19.680> back<00:00:19.830> together<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:20.940> a<00:00:20.970> glue<00:00:21.270> behind

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
stuck back together but a glue behind

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.870 
stuck back together but a glue behind
the<00:00:21.869> wing<00:00:22.110> just<00:00:22.710> up<00:00:22.860> here<00:00:23.100> where<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.460> broke<00:00:23.820> a

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the wing just up here where it broke a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.200 
the wing just up here where it broke a
bit<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.039> everything<00:00:26.039> else<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.339> crackerjack

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
bit and everything else is crackerjack

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.730 
bit and everything else is crackerjack
we've<00:00:27.390> got<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.689> new<00:00:28.169> motor<00:00:28.470> because

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
we've got a new motor because

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.800 
we've got a new motor because
unfortunately<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.849> old<00:00:29.999> ex-inmate<00:00:30.599> got

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
unfortunately the old ex-inmate got

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.240 
unfortunately the old ex-inmate got
toasted<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.410> either<00:00:31.529> cause<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.009> speed

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
toasted it either cause the speed

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580 
toasted it either cause the speed
control<00:00:32.580> to<00:00:32.790> fry<00:00:33.000> or<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:34.020> fried<00:00:34.320> by<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
control to fry or it was fried by the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.410 
control to fry or it was fried by the
speed<00:00:34.860> control<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.340> that's<00:00:35.490> the<00:00:35.730> nearest

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
speed control so that's the nearest

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.760 
speed control so that's the nearest
thing<00:00:36.720> I've<00:00:36.840> got<00:00:37.050> at<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.200> moment<00:00:37.380> don't<00:00:37.620> have

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
thing I've got at the moment don't have

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.290 
thing I've got at the moment don't have
a<00:00:37.800> genuine<00:00:38.160> accident<00:00:38.610> motor<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.880> it's<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
a genuine accident motor so it's just a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.930 
a genuine accident motor so it's just a
sony<00:00:39.809> 1500<00:00:40.410> kvv<00:00:40.770> I've<00:00:41.250> had<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.670> big

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
sony 1500 kvv I've had to put this big

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.569 
sony 1500 kvv I've had to put this big
honking<00:00:42.329> prop<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.690> there<00:00:43.010> a76<00:00:44.010> cut<00:00:44.280> down<00:00:44.430> to

honking prop on there a76 cut down to
six<00:00:44.699> and<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> half<00:00:44.940> by<00:00:45.239> six<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:46.170> doesn't<00:00:46.469> seem<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
six and a half by six it doesn't seem to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.799 
six and a half by six it doesn't seem to
produce<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.190> much<00:00:47.309> power<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.120> standard<00:00:48.570> ax

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
produce as much power as a standard ax

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.029 
produce as much power as a standard ax
in<00:00:48.989> matter<00:00:49.170> we've<00:00:49.289> got<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> new<00:00:49.559> speed

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
in matter we've got a new speed

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.650 
in matter we've got a new speed
controller<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.000> looking<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
controller in here looking here you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.290 
controller in here looking here you
speed<00:00:52.440> controller<00:00:52.769> and<00:00:53.609> I've<00:00:53.850> cut<00:00:54.059> away<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
speed controller and I've cut away the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.750 
speed controller and I've cut away the
heat<00:00:54.449> shrink<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
heat shrink on it so you can see the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.520 
heat shrink on it so you can see the
middle<00:00:56.969> bit<00:00:57.059> near<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.420> promotes<00:00:58.140> extra

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
middle bit near that promotes extra

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.630 
middle bit near that promotes extra
cooling<00:00:58.910> everything<00:00:59.910> else<00:01:00.090> looks<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:00.929> fine

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
cooling everything else looks just fine

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
cooling everything else looks just fine
so<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.789> might<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.120> flyer<00:01:03.329> date<00:01:03.510> later<00:01:03.710> he

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
so we might have a flyer date later he

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.080 
so we might have a flyer date later he
goes<00:01:04.860> Neil<00:01:05.160> near<00:01:05.370> is<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.700> throw<00:01:05.880> this

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
goes Neil near is going to throw this

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.800 
goes Neil near is going to throw this
