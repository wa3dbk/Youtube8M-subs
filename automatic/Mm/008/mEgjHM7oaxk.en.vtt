00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the motor which has this worm gear I

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.630 
the motor which has this worm gear I
guess<00:01:30.119> would<00:01:30.270> yeah<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.890> end<00:01:32.070> which<00:01:32.490> was

guess would yeah on the end which was
used<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:35.030> drive<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> gearing<00:01:36.479> down<00:01:36.860> man<00:01:38.299> right

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
used to drive the gearing down man right
