00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
chocolate I imagine this is what it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.470 
chocolate I imagine this is what it
would<00:02:21.740> be<00:02:21.860> like<00:02:21.890> if<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.400> mix<00:02:22.730> balsamic

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
would be like if you mix balsamic

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.850 
would be like if you mix balsamic
dressing<00:02:23.740> with<00:02:24.740> molasses<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:26.120> butter<00:02:26.420> and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
dressing with molasses and butter and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.060 
dressing with molasses and butter and
salt<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:29.239> dog<00:02:29.780> food<00:02:30.019> well<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:30.680> know<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.980> I'm

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
salt and dog food well I know that I'm

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.060 
eating this right off the knife so
that's<00:02:32.900> probably<00:02:33.140> not<00:02:33.320> how<00:02:33.500> people<00:02:33.620> eat<00:02:33.950> it

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070
