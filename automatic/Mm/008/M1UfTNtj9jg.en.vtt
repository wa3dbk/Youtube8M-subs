00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.679
 I was working at a local automobile plant by summer. 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.890
 Projecting a place to work in agriculture that does not have a working relationship 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.830
 In fact, they were all the same first experience 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.849
 The city high and new investment judgment raising 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.259
 It is a divine body which made Kiyama green park relieved 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.339
 The city Fusako 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.909
 In the financial sector 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.909
 I will lose my job 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.550
 It was quiet while breaking down the delivery but inexperience for life 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.720
 Chose a way to challenge agriculture a lot 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.330
 It is old who worked for a factory 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.200
 Less than half 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.200
 Rain up 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.810
 US presidential election 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.700
 Issue SoftBank Preferred Stock 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.970
 It was further called out that it might be agriculture 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.530
 Toshio Saito More Japanese Brazilian Naturalized to Japanese Nationality 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.530
 Mr. 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.090
 I myself was originally 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.220
 I was interested in agriculture 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.909
 In the future 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.820
 I'm getting older society 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.780
 It is true not to scratch this new era 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.220
 Well now with chance 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.760
 Japanese Brazilians are negotiating for themselves in kindergarten of management policy 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.930
 It is considered as a place of iaea activity by putting it on the ground 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.790
 But 29 days after the British foreign workers 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.060
 It is unusual to win the music that encourages Japanese farmers 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.250
 I understood 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.690
 To develop nuclear weapons 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.250
 For example, from now on 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.090
 Kikukawa who won't know if won is a big loss with five 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.330
 I guess I should add it 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.960
 It is a Japanese Brazilian who interviewed 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.990
 In the future 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.590
 I'm thinking of becoming independent on that 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.490
 After all 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.520
 They are 10 people in Japan 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 Does it affect the sound? 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.299
 Those who show -40 as workers are by economic trends 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.359
 I would like to hear the opinion between picture scrolls 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.719
 I have been working on negotiations to get better 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:20.879
 very 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.930
 The part-time system is 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.349
 Though it is said that it does not fit, 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.879
 Japanese Brazilians are vaporized and become the leading producer of new agriculture 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.539
 It's fun for me to give me 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.539
 Just when new entry into agriculture twice as much as the country 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.039
 Business planning and financial planning 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.109
 We have to undergo examination by each municipalities agriculture committee 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.909
 It's hard to get in because it's tough to say 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.159
 I also have a thing 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.510
