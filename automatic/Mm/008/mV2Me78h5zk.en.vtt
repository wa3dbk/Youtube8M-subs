00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.650
 it's an organ 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550
 he shrugged 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.789
 can be beautiful willpower 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.680
 but also automatically expect my seat to be blown 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.670
 with it also to do 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.580
 and is that fun to mess up stuff to work on it 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.440
 encounters 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.780
 quite get it yes still the greatest appreciation that they can get if they are people 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.379
 follow the disease online 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.920
 Most people who acquitted a robbery concert and the public transport appeal 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.670
 of the plus 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.670
 that you can then make it difficult for most to play 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.510
 it has never occurred not can may not yet could make 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.120
 Well 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.850
 on the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.920
 the have 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.200
 but we were just there 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.140
 that came under 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.110
 but I play it myself deals with topics 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.750
 sit on stage in his old love 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.690
 making nice music 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.090
 jaak mertens i knew but yes we know of course i will do one 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.800
 ascending debts difficult to a trombone door 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.470
 the four passengers who 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.410
 there are so many good people and that is for an interest is enough the incident 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.410
 people worked 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.779
 cohen 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:20.260
 because he dropped 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.629
 projector orchestra 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.629
 so it worked because it's a poor Christmas joe 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.929
 occupation of mclaren with the Flemish later French 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:32.729
 when you buy pictures just admit that the horns are the bons 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.409
 bass tuba 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.409
 the mortuary weaker 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.799
 beh 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.589
 that is not good enough to get together 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.260
 spending a few hours on it for a couple of years is always easy 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.329
 but of course I have to deal with people and send them on to knock on offer 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.109
 with every human the mayor of abbreviations 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.219
 But people without van Calker also had to happen to the incident 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.579
 it is not only good for the dutch team, it is true that already 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.529
 those orchestras that have a lifetime 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:44.929
 that did not once peak to the hotond footwear missed running away 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.279
 they like it so much that they no longer do anything with us 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:51.679
 really a bit but a few in itself none of it baked we used to be 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:55.139
 well then when it all started way too expensive joke 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.499
 the attempted to stabbing pressure and 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:01.759
 and normal association to help somare down in terms of level but there 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.689
 so absolutely we will actually just offer a possibility for that good one 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.649
 music canteen every club is 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:09.269
 certain associations resolve crystal to incredibly large 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.069
 level difference for that better musician you want something different 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.229
 or eating we will just offer a possibility that is much better 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.229
 unfolding 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.530
 but we definitely do not want to stand in the way of social life 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.159
 I would regret the boat as people 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.159
 would choose us and almost stop our own association 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.550
 the committee this year a special one 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.930
 the from the united states who is that 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.110
 power your closet to test which with nac 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.219
 after the games 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.239
 the great studio trumpet player of man's consensus has known 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.169
 yes actually from the last fifteen to thirty years 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.189
 played except music 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.189
 as soon as you go kart from shiny, turn into a trumpet in one 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.430
 rice dystopian three cinemas becomes a trumpet there is music 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.289
 jakarta I assume that until we support those men is the young fun title 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.740
 we go so we must send out athlete of all 3 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.290

 olster independence day manager 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.080
 one the priest 4 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.080
 lierse cooled fall gold painted can 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.020
 what is needed for you 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.669
 at the bottom is that the entire organization likes it and it costs a lot 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.279
 much time I think yes or is the music for example it is clear 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.000
 they are created for the music just to want to play a good choice themselves 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.349
 and also grow old together with the conductor on music as a compiler that I myself also 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.659
 like to play about that briefly is also quite saying something about it 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:18.529
 the space yes that someone wants to do that organization so I actually have to 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.529
 otherwise there is also confidence that came 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:27.619
 put the top of the future will have to show if he can join 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.430
 but that is a good question i have already thought the website about it not 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.449
 so much with that our nation 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.380
 have been this band to accept something themselves 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.150
 witsel strived to not be able to play well at all because that is what it wants 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.059
 I also can play that nicely 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:45.139
 lommel things have to think of going well a good city 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.059
 place and therefore goes under the body to that kind of craziness 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:51.059
 but I 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.979
 I am definitely going to play well, but we had to baptize tomtom in terms of level 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.389
 until an interpreter happens to be able to guarantee anp novum over time 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.400
