let me borrow the chair so I could make

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.529 
let me borrow the chair so I could make
some<00:00:42.829> patterns<00:00:43.219> and<00:00:43.429> build<00:00:43.609> a<00:00:43.730> set<00:00:43.910> for<00:00:44.089> myself

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
some patterns and build a set for myself

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:45.610 
some patterns and build a set for myself
and<00:00:44.749> that's<00:00:44.989> what<00:00:45.109> we're<00:00:45.199> gonna<00:00:45.260> do<00:00:45.499> today

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
and that's what we're gonna do today

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.709 
and that's what we're gonna do today
we're<00:00:46.489> gonna<00:00:46.609> start<00:00:46.730> with<00:00:47.179> these<00:00:47.359> curved

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
we're gonna start with these curved

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.899 
we're gonna start with these curved
pieces<00:00:48.199> and<00:00:48.409> to<00:00:48.859> do<00:00:48.980> that<00:00:49.129> we'll<00:00:49.730> need<00:00:49.760> a

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
pieces and to do that we'll need a

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.030 
pieces and to do that we'll need a
bandsaw

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.130 

to<00:00:54.760> ensure<00:00:55.000> that<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.240> curve<00:00:55.420> support<00:00:55.840> pieces

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
to ensure that the curve support pieces

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.170 
to ensure that the curve support pieces
are<00:00:56.290> consistent<00:00:56.860> start<00:00:57.460> with<00:00:57.610> a<00:00:57.640> set<00:00:57.850> of<00:00:57.880> paper

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
are consistent start with a set of paper

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
same but this time the spacers need to

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.999 
same but this time the spacers need to
be<00:06:24.039> sixteen<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:24.610> a<00:06:24.699> quarter<00:06:25.029> inches<00:06:25.300> wide<00:06:25.539> and

be sixteen and a quarter inches wide and
you'll<00:06:27.009> also<00:06:27.219> start<00:06:27.430> with<00:06:27.819> the<00:06:27.909> legs<00:06:28.149> curved

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
you'll also start with the legs curved

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.899 
you'll also start with the legs curved
upward<00:06:29.139> that's<00:06:29.919> because<00:06:30.309> the<00:06:30.460> first<00:06:30.699> piece

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
upward that's because the first piece

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.029 
upward that's because the first piece
you<00:06:30.939> need<00:06:31.210> to<00:06:31.300> attach<00:06:31.599> is<00:06:31.960> a<00:06:32.020> cross<00:06:32.379> brace<00:06:32.740> that

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
you need to attach is a cross brace that

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.809 
you need to attach is a cross brace that
rests<00:06:33.759> in<00:06:33.969> the<00:06:34.120> notches<00:06:34.389> on<00:06:34.839> the<00:06:35.229> curved<00:06:35.469> leg
