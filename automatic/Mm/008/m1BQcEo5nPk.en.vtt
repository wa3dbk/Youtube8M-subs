 unlimited ok it's very easy to do 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.989
 this trick is the trick easier than the 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.840
 true that I have seen what you have to 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.899
 do simply is for example have 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.910
 this garage take out a new carie not what 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.559
 I'm going to do, you should have a friend 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.360
 that is going to give you the vehicle that 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.250
 you want to use this this this trick 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.850
 works for any vehicle be 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.219
 luxuries or are those rare ok what are you going 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.560
 to simply do for example your friend 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.520
 is going to put the vehicle in that position 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.680
 you must 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.690
 this garage 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.940
 and how can you watch channels we're also going 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.830
 to occupy a pegasus vehicle that 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.620
 pegasus vehicle is that jeep that is 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.450
 There, I recommend that you be that 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.580
 let's put in that position as well as 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.370
 are you watching so we are going to put 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.410
 the pegasus jeep and the vehicle that you 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.720
 want to duplicate in this case is this 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.850
 vehicle is from my friend this vehicle me 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.310
 is going to give it that way, as they can 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.270
 see we must put the vehicle in this 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.510
 position and we must put the jeep of 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.950
 pegasus in that other position and what 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.440
 let's do with the street again 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.530
 it's very simple, we 're going to put it 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.330
 enter between the two vehicles to 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.399
 to be able to do that from you we must 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.770
 put our phone in an activity 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.750
 so you do not get into the garage is very 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.570
 important that you do that you use your 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.880
 phone so that the garage circle 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.430
 disappear and you can not get inside 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.410
 of the garage using your phone ok as 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.930
 you can see let's put the face of 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.580
 again we're going to put it in half in 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.160
 medium of the two vehicles so that 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.040
 clog the doors and now what are we going to 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.120
 simply do 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.129
 it's here it's very important you have to 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.680
 call lester so that at the time that 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.950
 you shoot your vehicle do not leave 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.550
 the police 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.260
 you can call I do not know that the police 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.110
 ignore all the crimes that you commit 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.550
 and once you do that, we're going to 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.959
 do what we're going to do is shoot him 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.400
 to the face in new here I'm going to 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.680
 put in slow motion to see 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.010
 perfectly well until you get the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.780
 first flame of fire let's stop 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.569
 shoot ok 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.970
 see right now what comes next 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.430
 being in the flames of fire I stop 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.129
 shoot and at this time I call 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.980
 lester in case I get the police is very 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:00.470
 important that the police do not leave you 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.060
 I call Lester to remove the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.380
 search star in this case I think 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.090
 they did not give me search star 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.950
 but in case the flies that already had 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.620
 called the step now what I'm going to do 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.989
 is to run to the new street I'm going to 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.739
 run and I'm going to check the button 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.690
 climbing up once is very important 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.069
 they must run towards the vehicle, not what 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.610
 they can do walking they should be 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.959
 running they climb up then they go down 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.540
 appear in the other vehicle and then it 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.860
 they go back up and so suddenly as 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.530
 can see 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.210
 the light of the vehicle turns on suddenly 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.240
 that clichÃ© to this a little bit and how 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.480
 can see the vehicle gets inside 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.810
 my garage is very, very simple 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.990
 only thing they are going to do is run 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.570
 towards the street a new one to go up to pacho 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.850
 by clicking the button and the triangle button 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.090
 in playstation then when they are 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.950
 up they go down they stop you again the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.170
 button and I the triangle button and it 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.120
 they go back up to the other vehicle like this 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.670
 just crushed the button or the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.310
 triangle button and automatically the 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.340
 vehicle that easy gets inside 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.840
 your garage already doubles this now if 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.239
 you want to make unlimited money so 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.459
 only thing you're going to do is take this 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.400
 vehicle to sell to custom gifts 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.759
 they are going to see I think 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.620
 more than 200 thousand dollars for this vehicle 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:22.540
 so channels here is the trick of 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.360
 how to duplicate 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.130
 luxury vehicles to give them to 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.560
 your friends as you can see here is the 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.600
 my friend's vehicle and here I am 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.950
 that easy I hope this trick works 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.360
 you liked it if you liked it, do not forget 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.010

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.690

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.600
 lent one of those vehicles to be able to 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.410
