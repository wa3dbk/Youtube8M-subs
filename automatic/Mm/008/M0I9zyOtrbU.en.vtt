00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 do not 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.369
 very good that as you are here 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.529
 we are back in minecraft 1.711 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.529
 point 6.4 sorry 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.180
 fail and good you ask yourselves 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.970
 I bring and they bring a new bar 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.600
 and what is it going to be about? 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.600
 preciousness 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.430
 The first thing I say is that 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.660
 details the esthetic is super currado 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.010
 to be minecraft 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.010
 It is made of cubes 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.640
 and it's lovely a way that I would put a 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:07.370
 of my series 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.370
 And the first thing you can see is life 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.170
 here it does not look good but 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.090
 yes or his visa to her seen the hearts 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.119
 now 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.620
 Well, many guys are you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.270
 you will ask what happens 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.939
 when it ends the hearts 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.360
 you explained this is is 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.740
 one touch 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.740
 that when you give 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.350
 then explode 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.820
 and not european is everything but the cubes 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.110
 this snowmobile 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.250
 it works as much as 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.610
 they work in all the blocks but 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.900
 works best on ice and in snow 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.850
 store I will put a little 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.840
 for example this one that will be 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 without green 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.260
 it does not get here over there what else 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.510
 there is a little low 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.349
 by land 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.689
 but then come here and look 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.599
 it was super fast what I liked about this 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.370
 snowmobile is right now I am 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.079
 giving the left and the right but not 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.530
 but if it accelerates and if you look 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:55.760
 that miserable movement I love 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.760
 and go full steam 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.270
 as well 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.270
 this snowmobile 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.900
 can go for a piece 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.760
 above the water is useless general 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.069
 but I will continue to see myself returning 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.680
 sinking turning with touch 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.910
 I do not understand it goes down until you 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.610
 pulls out 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.340
 walk to see if the car looks you stay 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.540
 still 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.540
 and the last ones 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.110
 pencil 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.910
 and it joins and sank 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.960
 and there he stays only exploits jce because 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:50.510
 it will be useful 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:54.580
 and good as is being tainable 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.580
 this beautiful level bike 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:04.450
 what with its own sound 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.450
 back that has reverse 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.590
 well let's say 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.480
 the first thing is the back seat and as 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.900
 you know, I always put it as if it were 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:22.590
 of character of lefts like this 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.590
 and you take and then ski like that 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.530
 the load 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.509
 the exhaust pipe with wood and iron in 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.800
 wood does not make sense if you do not 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:41.000
 would burn this item does not have kraft in the 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:45.000
 chassis has no crafter for anything 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.250
 what little I know he did not find look 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.520
 I do not know, we'll have to make an exchange 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.190
 in your fluids if you want it 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.680
 then the 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.120
 I do not know how to call it I do not get the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.830
 let's call it rubber 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.420
 they are made in this way 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.409
 the engine as always iron and 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.289
 and a piston 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.420
 and to make the bike with all that 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:13.010
 it is imposed in this way 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.010
 and they give you a motorbike 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:25.529
 and so what I thought of me 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:28.769
 this bike the truth is that it is very good 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:30.419
 you can get to the sites very fast 

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:34.799
 you can go killing 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:37.380
 listen to me here there chicken chicken here 

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:40.620
 poor 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.660
 you can kill chickens and you can upload 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.129
 up to two blocks look here 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:51.389
 You see no repulsive 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:53.409
 I do not know what if apology can reach 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.360
 to climb two blocks 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.090
 but I thought the central having 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.130
 space of your life 3 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.400
 is that it makes the movement but it does not arrive 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.400
 to go up 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.930
 and good I hope you liked the 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.930
 way to like to subscribe and 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.040
 let's see if we're still here all day 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.040

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.919
 goodbye
