00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello welcome to la style today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.000
 I want to show you how to get one 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.160
 Do something pleasant in the summer 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 hairstyle is when it is just very hot 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.630
 and if I help then to a yes 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.930
 There you almost need one more 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.130
 you still need such hair brush 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.050
 bobby pins and celebrities but best 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.189
 again those who do not have a silver edge 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.410
 thanks to you the herrligkoffer 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.420
 made and I would say ask 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.000
 Just as we know each other 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.160
 hair into a braid and in it are braid 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.890
 bind david be different you can do it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.170
 down here for example 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.670
 or hereby or here above and me 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.270
 Now make mine for up here on the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.270
 Upper head 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.240
 so now have us the head made 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.140
 Now we just take this donath 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.000
 and do it once in both 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.040
 hair tie so to speak that is so and 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.380
 then we'll keep the new one 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.020
 have wide he should be a bit 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.420
 so smaller are not so run out 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.880
 and now we just go forward 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.250
 and spread the hair over this 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.340
 donath that when we're so dull 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.440
 no longer grasp and feel this 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.180
 material from these days play 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.660
 but that hair everywhere over it 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.060
 are 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.440
 and then I just agree 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.440
 hair gum still over it 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.240
 pretty much now and almost done now 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.300
 I just look that out you are 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.250
 just our link and the participants 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.730
 So diligent in two such rehearsals are here 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:18.950
 made two strands and now I would come 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 me again through the harvey above 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.480
 firmly and now I want this strand 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:52.640
 Already we take the braided 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:57.130
 strands develop both the and 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.130
 the end was definitely bobby cars 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.120
 We now have the first strand so around 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:08.510
 wrapped around my head and now I want 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.570
 the second in exactly the same 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.570
 direction 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.490
 Of course you can still do some provincial 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.080
 make a majority if you want that 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.490
 In any case , one certainly holds 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.090
 just here to one purely other 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.090
 side always 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.680
 that way and then it definitely holds up a lot 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.680
 well marked cards as it looks 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.690
 i like it to such a high and 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.940
 hairstyle big ears to pull on that 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.890
 I have now put on my kreolen 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.110
 that was it already went very well 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.729
 fast very easy and I think so 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.320
 is not that boring 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.080

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.950
