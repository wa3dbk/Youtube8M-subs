00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.030
 Hello everyone, today we have April 24, 2014 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.509
 although promised modern Garik 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 regulate the valve us redo so 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.779
 we will start first for this moscow 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.820
 Anything is the cap here 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.130
 screwed this way your can even 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.550
 will get you on a moped 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.000
 from that side goes we had to say 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.769
 God bless you, but this chip vylazit a 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.600
 I became 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.570
 Turn off here is that it's a bolt 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.770
 here here we have and there we 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.840
 are keys to the rotor 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.160
 on which there are tags our task is such 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.809
 our task is to set the piston 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.469
 maximum top point on dead 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:57.210
 the point is that there is this 3. If you 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:01.350
 see here this is this rice should 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.409
 match 20 watts 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.090
 heads he prices must door out glasses 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.610
 match and we have a piston 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.280
 is at the highest point and this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.990
 confirmed we still have here 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.180
 here if. you if you see the mark you 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:30.530
 must be in the middle all means 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:34.170
 that we have a piston and a dead point to scientists 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.300
 So here you have it is this chip with 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.540
 top and in this chip from the bottom too 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:44.010
 such a chip we have connected here on 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:53.550
 the valve is a top valve then 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:54.900
 bottom valve we will not regulate 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:08.670
 felt we will check 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:19.670
 this valve to grind off so calmly all 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:19.670
 like we have a weak bottom also 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:34.880
 then put the top and bottom valve 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:38.580
 for this we take such a head on e5 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.930
 called out of the kit which we will 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.930
 connect the valves themselves 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.480
 and 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.560
 myself 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.560
 yes that fixes are not spinning 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:14.950
 and we do that without writing 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.549
 without just a little after him like me all 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.549
 enough 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.790
 and on the piano 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.590
 neatly . 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.769
 check again just in case 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:40.769
 shame if it comes he should not be 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:04:11.310
 we twist well 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:24.389
 that is, no need 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:38.979
 check twist twist on 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:05:06.539
 attribution that can be returned to them brush 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:05:06.539
 Such rustle necessarily she fixes 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.879
 tighten the bolts 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.400
 tightened 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.970
 twist right away 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.980
 it is no longer needed, even if it is 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.140
 pounding valve we won't need us 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:49.320
 will no longer exhibit the dead. 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:51.680
 dead. you will meet that does not sell 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.680
 yourself
