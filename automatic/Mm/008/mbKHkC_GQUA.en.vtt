the<00:02:13.570> answer<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.020> between<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.560> quarter<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.070> a

the answer is between a quarter and a

the answer is between a quarter and a
half<00:02:15.430> an<00:02:15.610> inch<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:16.180> don't<00:02:16.360> want<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.570> have<00:02:16.660> too

half an inch you don't want to have too

much<00:02:17.080> showing<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.590> looks<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.860> little<00:02:17.980> bit<00:02:18.250> odd

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
much showing it looks a little bit odd

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.720 
much showing it looks a little bit odd
this<00:02:19.750> actually<00:02:20.200> looks<00:02:20.380> best<00:02:20.680> more<00:02:21.490> is<00:02:21.610> a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
this actually looks best more is a

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.660 
this actually looks best more is a
subtle<00:02:22.180> accent<00:02:22.690> then<00:02:22.930> very<00:02:23.650> blatant<00:02:24.190> now

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
subtle accent then very blatant now

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.670 
subtle accent then very blatant now
something<00:02:25.090> else<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.450> consider<00:02:25.570> is<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.410> when

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
something else to consider is that when

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.890 
something else to consider is that when
you<00:02:26.800> put<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.100> in<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.490> would<00:02:28.360> recommend

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
you put it in I would recommend

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.650 
you put it in I would recommend
following<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.590> slant<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.610> your<00:02:31.060> pocket<00:02:31.540> as

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
following the slant of your pocket as

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.210 
following the slant of your pocket as
opposed<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.320> putting<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.770> straight<00:02:33.070> across

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
opposed to putting it straight across

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.940 
opposed to putting it straight across
that<00:02:33.670> would<00:02:33.790> look<00:02:33.970> like<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:35.740> want<00:02:35.890> to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
that would look like this you want to

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.280 
that would look like this you want to
follow<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.430> slant<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:37.660> just<00:02:37.870> going<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.050> keep

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
follow the slant it's just going to keep

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.860 
follow the slant it's just going to keep
that<00:02:38.590> line<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.520> little<00:02:39.730> bit<00:02:39.940> more<00:02:40.150> symmetrical

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
that line a little bit more symmetrical

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.600 
that line a little bit more symmetrical
and<00:02:41.020> look<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.470> little<00:02:41.710> bit<00:02:41.830> better<00:02:42.040> now<00:02:42.340> some<00:02:42.580> of

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
and look a little bit better now some of

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.280 
and look a little bit better now some of
you<00:02:42.820> are<00:02:42.850> probably<00:02:43.240> thinking<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.870> yourself<00:02:44.170> I

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
you are probably thinking to yourself I

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.200 
you are probably thinking to yourself I
really<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.310> simplicity<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
cleanness of the straight fold but I got

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.100 
cleanness of the straight fold but I got
a<00:02:48.670> really<00:02:48.970> awesome<00:02:49.150> pocket<00:02:49.720> square<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.020> it's

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
stitching around the edge and I would

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.770 
stitching around the edge and I would
really<00:02:54.070> love<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.520> show<00:02:54.550> is<00:02:55.000> there<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> way<00:02:55.750> to
