guys<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.549> what<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> sport<00:02:03.119> bikes<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.600> have

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
guys know what the sport bikes we have

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
guys know what the sport bikes we have
those<00:02:04.049> huge<00:02:04.680> brake<00:02:05.040> discs<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.820> front

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
those huge brake discs on the front

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.539 
those huge brake discs on the front
wheel<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.899> make<00:02:07.220> accessing<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> valve

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
wheel so it can make accessing the valve

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.300 
wheel so it can make accessing the valve
stem<00:02:08.880> very<00:02:09.149> difficult<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.649> know<00:02:11.130> but

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
stem very difficult so you know but

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.100 
stem very difficult so you know but
those<00:02:11.489> cheap<00:02:11.820> tire<00:02:12.090> pressure<00:02:12.420> gauges<00:02:12.959> they

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
those cheap tire pressure gauges they

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.840 
those cheap tire pressure gauges they
can<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.380> very<00:02:13.590> difficult<00:02:13.829> to<00:02:14.160> use<00:02:14.489> on<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
can be very difficult to use on the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.270 
can be very difficult to use on the
front<00:02:15.120> wheel<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.630> know<00:02:16.320> with<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.769> Accu

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
front wheel you know with this Accu

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.670 
front wheel you know with this Accu
gauge<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.910> has<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> right<00:02:18.810> angle<00:02:19.019> Chuck<00:02:19.470> with

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
gauge it has a right angle Chuck with

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.770 
gauge it has a right angle Chuck with
the<00:02:19.769> flexible<00:02:20.280> 11<00:02:20.669> inch<00:02:20.820> hose<00:02:21.060> for<00:02:21.630> those

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
the flexible 11 inch hose for those

hard-to-reach tire valves

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.530 
hard-to-reach tire valves
and<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.100> works<00:02:24.280> very<00:02:24.670> easy<00:02:24.940> all<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.240> need<00:02:25.330> to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
and it works very easy all you need to

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.630 
and it works very easy all you need to
do<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.870> put<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.170> Chuck<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.770> valve<00:02:26.950> stem<00:02:27.340> it

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
do is put the Chuck on the valve stem it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.220 
do is put the Chuck on the valve stem it
gives<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.120> pressure<00:02:28.330> ill<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.900> will

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
gives you the pressure ill it will

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.020 
gives you the pressure ill it will
actually<00:02:29.440> hold<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.070> pressure<00:02:30.280> for<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.820> until

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
actually hold the pressure for you until

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.660 
actually hold the pressure for you until
you<00:02:32.020> press<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.680> button<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.160> release<00:02:33.340> the

you press the button to release the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.180 
you press the button to release the
pressure<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.240> you<00:02:35.110> don't<00:02:35.410> have<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.740> sit<00:02:35.950> there

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
pressure so you don't have to sit there

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.430 
pressure so you don't have to sit there
and<00:02:36.370> hold<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.910> Chuck<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.810> then<00:02:37.990> you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
and hold the Chuck to it and then you

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.440 
and hold the Chuck to it and then you
know<00:02:38.560> keep<00:02:39.100> holding<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.120> look<00:02:40.330> at

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
know keep holding it to it and look at

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.330 
know keep holding it to it and look at
the<00:02:40.570> reading<00:02:40.900> on<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.290> no<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.740> just<00:02:42.070> put<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.280> on

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
