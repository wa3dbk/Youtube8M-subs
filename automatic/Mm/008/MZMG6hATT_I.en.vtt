going to take about seven to ten days we
filled<00:00:13.740> our<00:00:13.860> tray<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.220> halfway<00:00:14.460> up<00:00:14.700> with

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
filled our tray about halfway up with

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.820 
filled our tray about halfway up with
soil<00:00:15.180> and<00:00:15.480> then<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:15.870> put<00:00:16.020> some<00:00:16.230> chicken<00:00:16.619> manure

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
soil and then we put some chicken manure

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.349 
soil and then we put some chicken manure
on<00:00:17.100> top<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.519> you<00:00:17.609> don't<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.119> put<00:00:18.269> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
on top of it you don't have to put the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.520 
on top of it you don't have to put the
chicken<00:00:18.510> manure<00:00:18.720> because<00:00:19.050> they're<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
chicken manure because they're going to

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.290 
chicken manure because they're going to
grow<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:19.920> fast<00:00:19.950> and<00:00:20.580> they<00:00:20.670> already<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:21.120> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
grow so fast and they already have a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.880 
grow so fast and they already have a
nutrition<00:00:21.869> charge<00:00:22.140> from<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.650> seeds

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
nutrition charge from the seeds

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.160 
nutrition charge from the seeds
themselves<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:24.030> just<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.510> case<00:00:24.690> it<00:00:24.869> takes<00:00:25.020> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
themselves but just in case it takes a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.750 
themselves but just in case it takes a
little<00:00:25.320> longer<00:00:25.530> and<00:00:25.860> I<00:00:26.160> always<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.580> be

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
little longer and I always like to be

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.640 
little longer and I always like to be
sure<00:00:26.940> we<00:00:27.390> put<00:00:27.539> some<00:00:27.720> chicken<00:00:27.869> manure<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
sure we put some chicken manure in and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.779 
sure we put some chicken manure in and
then<00:00:28.920> we're<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.100> to<00:00:29.160> put<00:00:29.310> another<00:00:29.430> layer<00:00:29.730> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
then we're going to put another layer of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.179 
then we're going to put another layer of
soil<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.420> top<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:31.080> keep<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.529> manure<00:00:31.830> from

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
soil on top to keep the manure from

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
soil on top to keep the manure from
being<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.820> against<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> seeds<00:00:33.960> because

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
being right against the seeds because

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.260 
being right against the seeds because
it's<00:00:34.560> a<00:00:34.890> fertilizer<00:00:35.340> charge<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:35.940> against

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
it's a fertilizer charge right against

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.940 
it's a fertilizer charge right against
the<00:00:36.360> seeds<00:00:36.600> sometimes<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.470> keeps<00:00:37.590> them<00:00:37.829> from

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the seeds sometimes it keeps them from

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.200 
the seeds sometimes it keeps them from
growing<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.810> had<00:00:39.810> cilantro<00:00:40.410> once<00:00:40.910> sit<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
growing I had cilantro once sit in a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970 
growing I had cilantro once sit in a
pile<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.690> manure<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.290> thought<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.770> would<00:00:43.920> be

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
pile of manure I thought this would be

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.130 
pile of manure I thought this would be
great<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.880> such<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> heavy<00:00:45.420> feeder<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.989> going

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
great it's such a heavy feeder I'm going

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840 
great it's such a heavy feeder I'm going
to<00:00:46.200> plant<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:46.710> into<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> manure<00:00:47.399> it's

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
to plant it right into the manure it's

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.819 
to plant it right into the manure it's
sat<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:48.480> three<00:00:49.020> months<00:00:49.320> later<00:00:49.559> when<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
sat there three months later when the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.610 
sat there three months later when the
manure<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.370> aged<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.120> came<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:51.750> still<00:00:52.200> in<00:00:52.230> the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
better and we're going to cover them in

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.900 
better and we're going to cover them in
this<00:03:02.290> case<00:03:02.500> with<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.709> solid<00:03:03.100> bottom<00:03:03.250> flat<00:03:03.700> which

is leftover from a greenhouse kit I

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.710 
is leftover from a greenhouse kit I
bought<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:05.980> big<00:03:06.250> box<00:03:06.519> store<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.940> long<00:03:07.269> time<00:03:07.510> ago

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
bought a big box store a long time ago

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.350 
bought a big box store a long time ago
when<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.440> say<00:03:08.799> cover<00:03:09.070> it<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.760> got<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.120> be

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
when I say cover it it's got to be

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.670 
when I say cover it it's got to be
covered<00:03:10.750> by<00:03:10.870> something<00:03:11.140> that's<00:03:11.350> going<00:03:11.590> to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
covered by something that's going to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.860 
covered by something that's going to
hold<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.070> moisture<00:03:12.250> down<00:03:12.910> so<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.600> kind<00:03:13.780> of

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
hold the moisture down so it kind of

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.590 
hold the moisture down so it kind of
steeps<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.620> moisture<00:03:15.280> into<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.850> seeds<00:03:16.090> makes

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
steeps the moisture into the seeds makes

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.319 
steeps the moisture into the seeds makes
them<00:03:16.750> germinate<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.140> lot<00:03:17.500> faster<00:03:18.100> so<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.030> left

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
them germinate a lot faster so I left

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.900 
them germinate a lot faster so I left
these<00:03:19.570> microgreens<00:03:20.410> in<00:03:20.769> their<00:03:21.370> germination

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
these microgreens in their germination

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
and screaming for their lives so I took

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.990 
and screaming for their lives so I took
it<00:03:33.720> off<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.170> didn't<00:03:34.980> take<00:03:35.189> a<00:03:35.220> picture<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.790> it

it off I didn't take a picture of it

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.850 
it off I didn't take a picture of it

because I was really embarrassed and I

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.920 
because I was really embarrassed and I
wasn't<00:03:38.250> sure<00:03:38.370> they<00:03:38.519> would<00:03:38.700> recover<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.390> put

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
wasn't sure they would recover I put

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.780 
wasn't sure they would recover I put
them<00:03:40.049> out<00:03:40.170> in<00:03:40.349> the<00:03:40.470> Sun<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.220> watered<00:03:41.610> them

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
them out in the Sun and I watered them

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.580 
them out in the Sun and I watered them
and<00:03:42.090> now<00:03:42.269> we<00:03:42.329> have<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:43.200> beautiful

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
and now we have the beautiful

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.309 
and now we have the beautiful
microgreens<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.790> see<00:03:45.060> before<00:03:45.480> us<00:03:45.510> we're

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
microgreens you see before us we're

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.360 
microgreens you see before us we're
going<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.530> go<00:03:46.650> ahead<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:47.040> cut<00:03:47.220> these

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
going to go ahead and cut these

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.759 
going to go ahead and cut these
microgreens<00:03:48.030> they<00:03:48.750> did<00:03:49.019> get<00:03:49.170> kind<00:03:49.349> of<00:03:49.530> tall

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
microgreens they did get kind of tall

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.589 
microgreens they did get kind of tall
while<00:03:50.129> they<00:03:50.250> were<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.610> propagation<00:03:51.060> area

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
while they were in the propagation area

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.089 
while they were in the propagation area
if<00:03:51.810> we<00:03:52.049> were<00:03:52.170> going<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.379> plant<00:03:52.620> them<00:03:52.799> out<00:03:52.920> into

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
if we were going to plant them out into

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.500 
if we were going to plant them out into
the<00:03:53.190> garden<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.819> would<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.209> problem

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
the garden that would be a problem

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.390 
the garden that would be a problem
because<00:03:54.810> they'd<00:03:55.140> be<00:03:55.290> falling<00:03:55.650> over<00:03:55.739> we're

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
because they'd be falling over we're

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.770 
because they'd be falling over we're
going<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.609> cut<00:03:56.760> them<00:03:56.939> off<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:57.269> that<00:03:57.299> makes<00:03:57.569> it<00:03:57.720> a

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
going to cut them off so that makes it a

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.110 
going to cut them off so that makes it a
little<00:03:57.870> bit<00:03:58.079> easier<00:03:58.409> we<00:03:58.950> grow<00:03:59.220> them<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.730> these

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
little bit easier we grow them in these

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.259 
little bit easier we grow them in these
little<00:04:00.799> pots<00:04:01.799> instead<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.609> trays<00:04:02.879> the<00:04:03.150> way

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
little pots instead of in trays the way

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.990 
little pots instead of in trays the way
most<00:04:03.420> microgreen<00:04:04.079> growers<00:04:04.530> do<00:04:04.879> because<00:04:05.879> it

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
most microgreen growers do because it

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.229 
most microgreen growers do because it
makes<00:04:06.180> them<00:04:06.389> easier<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:07.200> cut<00:04:07.700> we<00:04:08.700> can<00:04:08.909> take<00:04:09.090> it

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
makes them easier to cut we can take it

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:21.140 
makes them easier to cut we can take it
out<00:04:09.620> turn<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.739> sideways<00:04:11.329> chop<00:04:12.329> em<00:04:12.750> off
