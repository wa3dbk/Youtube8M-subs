00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I'm not positive I don't think anybody

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.740 
I'm not positive I don't think anybody
knows<00:01:11.220> exactly<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:11.970> from<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.540> it's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
knows exactly what it is from but it's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.210 
knows exactly what it is from but it's
definitely<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> weapon<00:01:13.470> doesn't<00:01:13.830> kill

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
definitely not a weapon doesn't kill

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.460 
definitely not a weapon doesn't kill
anybody<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.810> seems<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> does

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
anybody but what it seems like it does

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
anybody but what it seems like it does
it<00:01:16.619> seems<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.100> might<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.490> replacing

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it seems like this might be replacing

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
it seems like this might be replacing
the<00:01:18.509> flashbangs<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.860> concussion<00:01:20.369> grenades

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the flashbangs and concussion grenades

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
the flashbangs and concussion grenades
etc<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> seems<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.659> mostly<00:01:22.590> going

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
etc it seems like this is mostly going

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.499 
etc it seems like this is mostly going
to<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.860> used<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> either<00:01:23.369> distract<00:01:23.880> enemies<00:01:24.119> or

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to be used to either distract enemies or

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
to be used to either distract enemies or
or<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.140> knock<00:01:25.380> them<00:01:25.590> off<00:01:25.830> guard<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.549> little

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
or kind of knock them off guard a little

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.670 
or kind of knock them off guard a little
bit<00:01:26.880> similar<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> flashbang<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.590> what

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
bit similar to what a flashbang or what

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.080 
bit similar to what a flashbang or what
a<00:01:28.710> concussion<00:01:29.130> grenade<00:01:29.369> will<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.610> again

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
a concussion grenade will do again

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.789 
a concussion grenade will do again
that's<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.479> confirm<00:01:31.079> that's<00:01:31.290> kind<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.560> what

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that's not confirm that's kind of what

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.410 
that's not confirm that's kind of what
I'm<00:01:31.950> seeing<00:01:32.310> because<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.270> the

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
have some high hopes for this game

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.309 
have some high hopes for this game
because<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.699> fact<00:04:47.969> that<00:04:48.210> they're<00:04:48.840> taking

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
because of the fact that they're taking

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.649 
because of the fact that they're taking
risks<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.430> there<00:04:50.669> and<00:04:50.939> they're<00:04:51.090> doing<00:04:51.389> things

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
risks and there and they're doing things

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.330 
risks and there and they're doing things
that<00:04:51.870> they<00:04:51.960> haven't<00:04:52.139> done<00:04:52.319> before<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.919> that's

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
that they haven't done before and that's

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.399 
that they haven't done before and that's
something<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.729> as<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.090> true<00:04:54.840> call<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.199> duty

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409
