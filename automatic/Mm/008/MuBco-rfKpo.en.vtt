00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
because it is pretty powerful by itself

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.420 
because it is pretty powerful by itself
and<00:01:57.469> so<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.530> gonna<00:01:58.619> wanna<00:01:58.799> do<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.399> a

just because you gotta be able to train

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.630 
just because you gotta be able to train
them<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:03.560> them<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.920> corner<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.489> get

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
them all at once with EMP and quick

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.970 
them all at once with EMP and quick
knowing<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.819> EMP<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.180> can't<00:03:08.680> sprint<00:03:09.680> you

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
knowing the EMP you can't sprint you

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.860 
knowing the EMP you can't sprint you
can't<00:03:10.340> basically<00:03:10.730> jump<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.420> can't<00:03:11.569> make<00:03:11.720> any

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
can't basically jump you can't make any

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.539 
can't basically jump you can't make any
noise<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.110> can't<00:03:12.440> shoot<00:03:12.799> you<00:03:12.950> can't<00:03:13.160> reload
