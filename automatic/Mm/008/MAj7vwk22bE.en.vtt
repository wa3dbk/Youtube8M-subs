00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.540
 14 are that and yes the bank is one 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.300
 a little bit weirder than normal 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.980
 but also has a short fright 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.680
 their meaningful because in most cases and narrow but 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.210
 down a bit from the bank or 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.950
 He makes a higher hollow cross 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.940
 which means you're almost back 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.380
 normal flying done 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.390
 that's why it's still a bit 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.259
 go boast to meet 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.930
 upper chest sturdy so so you see 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.790
 already I go with a hammer almost 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.670
 always outwards between parallel 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.710
 and provide just as I outwards 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.620
 the chest increases really nice far 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:29.270
 out and I then 8 front together 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:31.090
 I move the wrists to each other like that 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.840
 rum 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.970
 the background is the so-called 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.189
 You already know squeeze from jpm yes me 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.490

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:03.409
 certain angle no no voltage 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.819
 on the chest because now turns the arm 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.080
 you also get the very top 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.350
 there is still more tension together 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.510
 why, always on the chest 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.280

 In any case , you play the exercise 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.230
