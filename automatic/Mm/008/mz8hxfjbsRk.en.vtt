sciences of the world and I had notice

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.720 
sciences of the world and I had notice
this<00:02:13.599> is<00:02:13.810> what<00:02:14.019> lead<00:02:14.290> me<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.920> experimenting

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
this is what lead me to experimenting

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.180 
this is what lead me to experimenting
and<00:02:15.849> literally<00:02:16.269> defining<00:02:16.900> how<00:02:17.560> physical

make hybrids for example I was just

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.190 
make hybrids for example I was just
