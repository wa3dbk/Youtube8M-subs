00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
hey guys mark /r x games in our last

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.989 
hey guys mark /r x games in our last
tutorial<00:00:13.719> we<00:00:14.530> created<00:00:14.559> a<00:00:15.009> bullet<00:00:15.280> at<00:00:15.549> the<00:00:15.849> tip

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:15.999 
tutorial we created a bullet at the tip

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.849 
tutorial we created a bullet at the tip
of<00:00:16.090> a<00:00:16.209> gun<00:00:16.420> no<00:00:16.869> matter<00:00:17.020> where<00:00:17.230> it<00:00:17.289> was<00:00:17.439> an<00:00:17.650> image

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:17.859 
of a gun no matter where it was an image

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.320 
of a gun no matter where it was an image
angle<00:00:18.160> to<00:00:18.279> that<00:00:18.429> all<00:00:18.550> into<00:00:18.699> account<00:00:18.730> and<00:00:19.210> it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
angle to that all into account and it

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.120 
angle to that all into account and it
worked<00:00:19.539> perfectly<00:00:19.929> in<00:00:20.170> this<00:00:21.009> tutorial

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
worked perfectly in this tutorial

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.509 
worked perfectly in this tutorial
creating<00:00:21.789> some<00:00:21.910> sound<00:00:22.240> and<00:00:22.859> also<00:00:23.859> a<00:00:23.890> short<00:00:24.279> gap

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
creating some sound and also a short gap

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.560 
creating some sound and also a short gap
in<00:00:24.669> between<00:00:24.759> each<00:00:25.060> shot

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
in between each shot

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.999 
in between each shot
if<00:00:25.720> you<00:00:25.839> don't<00:00:25.960> wanted<00:00:26.169> to<00:00:26.259> shoot<00:00:26.470> 30<00:00:26.589> times<00:00:26.890> a

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
if you don't wanted to shoot 30 times a

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.189 
if you don't wanted to shoot 30 times a
second<00:00:27.310> because<00:00:27.759> that's<00:00:27.939> crazy<00:00:28.509> its<00:00:28.869> first<00:00:29.019> we

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
second because that's crazy its first we

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.660 
second because that's crazy its first we
now<00:00:29.320> add<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.439> sound<00:00:31.079> sound<00:00:32.079> gunfire<00:00:32.710> that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
now add a sound sound gunfire that

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.080 
now add a sound sound gunfire that
sounds<00:00:34.000> good<00:00:35.340> rifle<00:00:36.340> fire

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
sounds good rifle fire

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.550 
sounds good rifle fire
let's<00:00:37.660> test<00:00:37.810> it<00:00:37.930> out<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:40.000> normal<00:00:40.330> sound

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
let's test it out but a normal sound

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.130 
let's test it out but a normal sound
pair<00:00:41.560> should<00:00:41.770> be<00:00:41.920> fine<00:00:42.130> next<00:00:43.000> object<00:00:43.690> player

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
pair should be fine next object player

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.270 
pair should be fine next object player
we're<00:00:44.530> going<00:00:44.650> to<00:00:44.710> be<00:00:44.770> using<00:00:44.920> boolean

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
we're going to be using boolean

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.440 
we're going to be using boolean
variables<00:00:46.090> so<00:00:47.130> can't<00:00:48.130> shoot<00:00:48.400> equals<00:00:49.240> true

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
variables so can't shoot equals true

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.630 
variables so can't shoot equals true
that's<00:00:49.720> gonna<00:00:49.870> be<00:00:49.990> our<00:00:50.080> boolean<00:00:50.350> variable<00:00:50.860> and

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
that's gonna be our boolean variable and

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.700 
that's gonna be our boolean variable and
when<00:00:51.820> can<00:00:52.030> shoot<00:00:52.270> is<00:00:52.420> true<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:52.900> with<00:00:53.590> global

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
when can shoot is true and with global

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:02.220 
when can shoot is true and with global
left<00:00:54.100> kick<00:00:55.890> we're<00:00:56.890> gonna<00:00:56.980> want<00:00:57.190> to<00:00:57.250> fire<00:01:01.230> okay

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
left kick we're gonna want to fire okay

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.740 
left kick we're gonna want to fire okay
so<00:01:02.290> it'll<00:01:02.650> only<00:01:02.830> fire<00:01:03.190> whenever<00:01:03.790> amber<00:01:04.689> is

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
so it'll only fire whenever amber is

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.410 
so it'll only fire whenever amber is
greater<00:01:05.019> than<00:01:05.170> naught<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.680> can<00:01:06.400> shoot<00:01:06.820> equals

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
greater than naught and can shoot equals

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.200 
greater than naught and can shoot equals
true

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
true

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.670 
true
alright<00:01:10.210> so<00:01:10.390> that's<00:01:10.510> good<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.470> then<00:01:11.590> we're

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
alright so that's good and then we're

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.520 
alright so that's good and then we're
gonna<00:01:11.740> play<00:01:11.950> our<00:01:12.070> sound<00:01:14.280> sound<00:01:15.280> for<00:01:15.550> a<00:01:18.030> fire

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
gonna play our sound sound for a fire

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.100 
gonna play our sound sound for a fire
okay<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:21.340> we<00:01:21.430> click<00:01:21.640> if<00:01:22.330> we<00:01:22.510> can<00:01:22.720> it's<00:01:23.020> gonna

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
okay so we click if we can it's gonna

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.810 
okay so we click if we can it's gonna
pay<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.470> sound<00:01:23.710> does<00:01:24.220> everything<00:01:24.550> from<00:01:24.700> the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
pay the sound does everything from the

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.870 
pay the sound does everything from the
last<00:01:24.909> tutorial<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:26.409> it's<00:01:26.830> gonna<00:01:27.070> say<00:01:27.370> it<00:01:27.430> can

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
last tutorial then it's gonna say it can

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.870 
last tutorial then it's gonna say it can
shoot<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:30.580> false<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:33.520> need<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.670> be<00:01:33.760> using

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
shoot to false we need to be using

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.899 
shoot to false we need to be using
alarms<00:01:34.510> and<00:01:34.900> in<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.530> nutshell<00:01:35.740> alarm<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.580> sort

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
alarms and in a nutshell alarm is sort

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.840 
alarms and in a nutshell alarm is sort
of<00:01:36.970> like<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.120> counter<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:38.380> we<00:01:38.500> set<00:01:38.740> call<00:01:39.490> alarm

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
of like a counter so we set call alarm

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.210 
of like a counter so we set call alarm
nought<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.229> whatever<00:01:41.530> long<00:01:41.710> you<00:01:41.830> said<00:01:41.979> it<00:01:42.100> does

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
nought so whatever long you said it does

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.110 
nought so whatever long you said it does
and<00:01:43.030> we<00:01:43.150> give<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.420> time<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:45.220> when<00:01:45.909> it<00:01:46.030> gets

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
and we give it a time so when it gets

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.500 
and we give it a time so when it gets
here<00:01:46.479> it'll<00:01:46.930> jump<00:01:47.170> from<00:01:47.560> this<00:01:48.280> script<00:01:48.640> call

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
here it'll jump from this script call

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.539 
here it'll jump from this script call
this<00:01:49.690> code<00:01:50.020> it'll<00:01:50.710> jump<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.070> long<00:01:51.220> walk<00:01:51.430> and

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
this code it'll jump to a long walk and

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.130 
this code it'll jump to a long walk and
do<00:01:51.700> something<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:52.240> here<00:01:52.390> we<00:01:52.479> said<00:01:52.690> can<00:01:52.900> shoot

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
do something so here we said can shoot

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.590 
do something so here we said can shoot
to<00:01:53.260> false<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:54.250> another<00:01:54.490> jump<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.850> alarm<00:01:55.390> note

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
to false in another jump to alarm note

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.310 
to false in another jump to alarm note
10<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.290> count<00:01:56.440> down<00:01:56.620> 10<00:01:56.920> we're<00:01:57.790> gonna<00:01:57.909> create

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
10 the count down 10 we're gonna create

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.340 
10 the count down 10 we're gonna create
alarm<00:01:59.320> note<00:02:00.119> 3<00:02:01.119> here<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.600> we're<00:02:02.020> gonna<00:02:02.080> want

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
alarm note 3 here and we're gonna want

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.479 
alarm note 3 here and we're gonna want
it<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.560> set<00:02:02.979> can't<00:02:03.250> shoot<00:02:04.229> back<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.560> true<00:02:07.560> okay

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
it to set can't shoot back to true okay

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.940 
it to set can't shoot back to true okay
it's<00:02:09.969> pretty<00:02:10.119> simple<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.829> beginning

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
it's pretty simple so in the beginning

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.330 
it's pretty simple so in the beginning
it<00:02:12.459> said<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.790> true<00:02:13.060> when<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.930> shoot<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.709> it's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
it said to true when we shoot and it's

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.179 
it said to true when we shoot and it's
true<00:02:15.609> it<00:02:16.420> does<00:02:16.900> everything<00:02:17.170> set<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.980> false

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
true it does everything set it to false

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.610 
true it does everything set it to false
calls<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.969> alarm<00:02:19.269> not<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.780> landlord<00:02:20.260> counts

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
calls the alarm not a landlord counts

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.039 
calls the alarm not a landlord counts
down<00:02:20.799> and<00:02:21.269> changes<00:02:22.269> variable<00:02:22.599> country<00:02:22.930> to

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
down and changes variable country to

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.309 
down and changes variable country to
true<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:24.159> when<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.400> gets<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:24.969> naught<00:02:25.150> then<00:02:26.019> we

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
true and when it gets to naught then we

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.550 
true and when it gets to naught then we
can<00:02:26.620> shoot<00:02:26.859> again<00:02:27.159> so<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.569> is<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.049> time<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
can shoot again so this is the time the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.839 
can shoot again so this is the time the
amount<00:02:29.769> of<00:02:29.889> time<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.519> change<00:02:30.639> this<00:02:30.790> to

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
amount of time you can change this to

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.990 
amount of time you can change this to
anything<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.450> just<00:02:31.769> test<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:32.920> out<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.879> see

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
anything and just test it out and see

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.429 
anything and just test it out and see
what<00:02:34.299> it's<00:02:34.450> at<00:02:34.599> and<00:02:34.840> if<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:34.959> like<00:02:35.139> it<00:02:35.319> that's

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
what it's at and if you like it that's

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:35.910 
what it's at and if you like it that's
good

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
good

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.920 
good
otherwise<00:02:36.189> change<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.639> also<00:02:37.540> we're<00:02:37.689> gonna<00:02:37.750> go

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
otherwise change it also we're gonna go

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.209 
otherwise change it also we're gonna go
to<00:02:37.989> object<00:02:38.170> bullet<00:02:38.590> we<00:02:38.799> need<00:02:38.889> to<00:02:38.980> change

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:39.219 
to object bullet we need to change

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.009 
to object bullet we need to change
something<00:02:39.730> here<00:02:39.879> when<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.239> go<00:02:40.329> outside<00:02:40.569> run

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
something here when you go outside run

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.659 
something here when you go outside run
outside<00:02:41.590> run<00:02:41.799> we're<00:02:41.889> gonna<00:02:41.950> want<00:02:42.189> to<00:02:42.340> destroy

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:42.669 
outside run we're gonna want to destroy

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.690 
outside run we're gonna want to destroy
itself<00:02:43.709> last<00:02:44.709> thing<00:02:44.829> you<00:02:44.889> want<00:02:45.069> is<00:02:45.159> random

objects flying outside the room you know

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.270 
objects flying outside the room you know
using<00:02:48.579> memory<00:02:48.760> space<00:02:49.799> okay<00:02:50.799> so<00:02:50.859> let's<00:02:51.099> test

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
using memory space okay so let's test

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.229 
using memory space okay so let's test
this<00:02:51.400> out<00:02:55.829> see<00:02:56.829> there's<00:02:57.069> a<00:02:57.129> slight<00:02:57.489> pause<00:02:57.909> in

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
this out see there's a slight pause in

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.030 
this out see there's a slight pause in
between<00:02:58.269> each<00:02:58.870> shot<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.530> we've<00:02:59.769> got<00:02:59.919> the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
between each shot and we've got the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.000 
between each shot and we've got the
sound<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.609> everything<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.299> working

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
sound that everything is working

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.190 
sound that everything is working
perfectly<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:06.510> that's<00:03:07.510> pretty<00:03:07.689> much<00:03:07.840> it

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
perfectly so that's pretty much it

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.809 
perfectly so that's pretty much it

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.740 
to do a HUD which is the heads on
display<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.250> it's<00:03:12.370> gonna<00:03:12.459> split<00:03:12.790> our<00:03:13.090> speed<00:03:13.449> if

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
display so it's gonna split our speed if

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.830 
display so it's gonna split our speed if
it's<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.989> car<00:03:14.199> game<00:03:14.440> or<00:03:15.010> ammo<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.150> our<00:03:16.269> max<00:03:16.569> ammo
