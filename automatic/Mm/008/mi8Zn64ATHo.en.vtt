00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 the 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.740
 a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.810
 bmw has been the lord and master of it for years 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.020
 coming up with new ones every time 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.660
 niches small share of the market in which 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.369
 it is not yet represented and one 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.579
 part of inspiration for that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.250
 out of own successes this is 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.040
 namely the new bmw x4 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.130
 a kind of hatchback like 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.890
 body based on the x3 exactly 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.890
 as the x6 came from the x5 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.240
 know what driving character i am 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.340
 three is used to seeing at the x 4 and yet 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.130
 clearly differently designed bodywork 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.690
 and you love it or you find it 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.740
 terrible 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.380
 the cars x3 x4 are not in terms of dimensions 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.930
 so very different from each other 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.560
 x4 is fractionally long but especially one 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.350
 centimeters lower and that means 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.630
 so that along with that expire night the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.150
 buy the newspaper from a series 4 ten 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.500
 with respect to x 3, and with 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.600
 folded down rear seat 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.530
 is it no less than 200 liters 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530
 just baggage 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.060
 the passengers notice a lot there 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.640
 less of it 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.890
 of course the roof is somewhat lower but 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.440
 that car can also have that 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.420
 and certainly in this driver's seat 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.580
 it has such a large height adjustable 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.170
 rich that many people with a 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.630
 different posture 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.180
 be able to find a great seating position there 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.550
 so for that matter it is an x3 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.230
 but just with a slightly different twist and also 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.130
 there are definitely again 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.130
 find buyers for 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.440
 when it comes to driving yes 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.380
 That x4 of course has the same 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.480
 fantastic qualities like x 3 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.850
 certainly in this case if we make it 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.700
 have a car with 3 liters 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.730
 six-cylinder diesel 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.850
 258 hp 590 new measurements well then feel 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.630
 you really high on the buck supreme 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.630
 in that traffic 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.590
 in 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.470
 it's a car that makes you wonderfully long 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.450
 distances control cruise control the op 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.010
 distance scale wants us all 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.140
 technical provisions are present 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.870
 that make your stay on board enjoyable 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.730
 a car of a high level 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.560
 but at the same time also from one 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.739
 decent price level 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.180
 the x4 is more expensive and I tire in three 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.269
 the case of this 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.260
 6-cylinder 3 liters means that one 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.750
 price difference of around 4,000 euros 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.220
 and then that car comes without extra 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.389
 versions and higher 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.430
 Equipment variants already at a price of 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:05.310
 74,000 euros that is of course for 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.879
 delivery program of that x 4 is less 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.980
 then breaks the lighter engines of the e3 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.579
 whether the less power are engines or 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.590
 not 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.750
 and also the has x4 always 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.549
 four-wheel drive while the x3 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.250
 A number of versions are still available 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.250
 is with rear-wheel drive only
