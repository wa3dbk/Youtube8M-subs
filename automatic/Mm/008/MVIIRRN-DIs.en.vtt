00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:25.660
- The fact that there is a service that keeps
track of all flight paths of objects that

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.100
are flying past the ISS orbit trajectory.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.059
There are certain parameters on which we move
around the Earth.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:46.120
And, if the projected computing power, it
is likely that the outer body slam not us

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:55.850
specifically, but it is in such great shape
space as the ISS, then we were warned, but,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:05.820
as the world already knew and tracked the
object, they Earth warned us in advance for

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:16.650
two days before and was told that the object
is flying at a certain speed and a certain

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.450
size, but do not worry, because the entity
does not meet your path.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.550
On this, we reacted calmly to it and for us
it is not a problem.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.890
If there was something threatening, then it
would have warned us would give a telegram

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.030
that says, be prepared to take their places
in a space ship, to be prepared and redocking

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.659
orbiting ISS, that would make the maneuver
against meteorite.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.610
In this case, we had information about the
flight of the object and the object will fly

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.610
by.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.950
- Roman, thank you very much.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.520
I wanted to ask about that: Have you seen
or not seen at least something?

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.280
Because you are warned that you are safe,
and the people of Russia had not been warned

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.580
about the danger.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.540
And you did not see anything?

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.581
(After this issue, the Russian astronaut begins
to flounder in the conversation, showing the

00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:20.660
withholding of information ...)
- If we are talking about the current meteorite,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:30.290
which was, and about the meteorite, about
which I say ....

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.560
(You can see that the astronaut is nervous
and confused words .....) - We learned about

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.210
the meteorite only an hour after the meteorite
flew into the atmosphere and disintegrated

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.500
over Chelyabinsk.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:54.000
The information we got, we got the news, we
immediately looked on the internet and all

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.989
the pictures we've seen, where the sports
hall broken window, embossed plastic window

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.010
on the balcony.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.420
I think it is not very great destruction.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:18.309
- You do not usually affected so many people
and the damage is very large.

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:29.620
- Humans are now not sure that people have
some sort of protection or warning system

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:41.900
from meteorites and life on earth is not protected
from external forces.
