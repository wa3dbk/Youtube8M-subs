00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everybody okay about your injury leaves another experiment on our track 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.380
 of maca 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.380
 because we'll be creating two bandits 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:13.079
 I want to show me crisis situations highlights you have to make to the request 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.969
 two bodies 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.359
 are they going to have a use of gugu and attack the last year 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.269
 we observe that it will have to be without gravity are related to the position 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.319
 of the coast floor 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.440
 this passion 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.609
 the fulcrum 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.679
 so we'll start the work initially by making 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.489
 the buccal flight we will use two spheres zizou a little 10 centimeters 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.109
 lidiane 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.540
 in one of seven centimeters 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.560
 d of food 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.530
 the recent fall we'll be 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.920
 cutting and robot divided into two parts 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.090
 one of the work folders was physical 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.630
 where are we going is going 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.640
 six marbles 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.080
 the shape of a flower 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.610
 so we're going to stick these balls with hot glue 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.460
 they are trapped 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.060
 and you now 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.000
 gives you continuity 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.950
 the construction of the rhombus 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.740
 speaking now with a stick of hot glue 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.650
 is sticking 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.270
 Wait again. 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 let's not go here 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.390
 we have ours 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 schooled 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.770
 and the other sphere of the new 17 cent wait 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.560
 We'll be sticking 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.560
 on the majority of victims 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 forming here one here 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 Let's wait for the cola to dry. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.540
 but we have already made that our 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.790
 Judged buffon has hands 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.100
 Note that it happens because we will be attentive locando 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.370
 moving away 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.370
 of filipe's position 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.680
 and what happens the subfloor that is in the waiting period larger 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.350
 celebrities 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.220
 I felt I stood out from dialogue by making the acronym 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.170
 across the grid position 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.789
 whatever 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.219
 the movement 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.199
 we had to make him always return 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.039
 the grid position 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.229
 arising from the under- 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.769
 but would make the biggest 10 cents 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:23.699
 watching then 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.739
 the tightrope player 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.739
 the time of feeling very simple of the competition 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:34.979
 the other toy also exports demonstrating that state and the turtle 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.929
 There are dead we'll use 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:38.389
 a sphere 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.509
 d seven cents where you're cutting someone 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.039
 and we will use only one of the parts 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.049
 We'll be fine as the difficult one. 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.529
 to pixar 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.129
 a ball I grow 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.369
 at one end 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.619
 we use here 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.669
 shape of a turtle 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.559
 we are using here 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.709
 the material the key 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.709
 let's learn 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.029
 Unveils the turtle 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:12.089
 waiting 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.479
 the bronze ball 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.939
 Let's be learning 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.939
 thus 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.509
 but we have here our 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.379
 turtle 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.899
 How does the tortoise work in the hands? 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:31.339
 whatever happens 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:34.339
 but we have 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.749
 normally 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.339
 it always returns to the equilibrium position 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.899
 her operation 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:04.109
 this way 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.589
 left but we have our 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:08.999
 cult ball 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.879
 translate this point 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.859
 But let's see that over there. 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.669
 thus 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.319
 and jumping 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.069
 it returns to the position 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:20.479
 deferred 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.270
 so we have here our 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.270
 the stubborn turtle and our dumb people 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.889
 so two toys where we showed 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.400
 precisely 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.620
 the balance 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.620
 Caesar 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.620
 they killed a lot of emotion 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.490
 two simpson toys that we may be using to demonstrate 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.529
 but create storm situations 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:54.369
 So we got there. 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.129
 this was the most rewarded our neymar bike 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.999
 See you at the next meeting. 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.129
 thanks a hug
