them a lead if they can pick up a point
here<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.560> right<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.920> they<00:01:08.040> would<00:01:08.159> need<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
here that's right so they would need to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
here that's right so they would need to
win<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.750> don't<00:01:09.990> win<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.350> they

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
win here if they don't win here they

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.240 
win here if they don't win here they
could<00:01:10.650> use<00:01:10.799> their<00:01:10.979> bonus<00:01:11.310> flag<00:01:11.600> but<00:01:12.600> DC<00:01:13.590> would

could use their bonus flag but DC would

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.539 
could use their bonus flag but DC would
have<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.549> not<00:01:14.760> finish<00:01:15.030> race<00:01:15.750> 11<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
have to not finish race 11 for that to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.399 
have to not finish race 11 for that to
even<00:01:17.610> matter<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.720> very<00:01:18.990> unlikely

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
even matter and that's a very unlikely

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
even matter and that's a very unlikely
event<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.950> there's<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.189> scenario<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.700> could<00:01:20.939> be

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
event and there's a scenario we could be

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.300 
event and there's a scenario we could be
looking<00:01:21.180> at<00:01:21.360> gridlock<00:01:21.930> which<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.439> grids<00:01:22.979> form

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
looking at gridlock which is grids form

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.399 
looking at gridlock which is grids form
of<00:01:23.520> overtime<00:01:24.060> which<00:01:24.299> who<00:01:24.810> doesn't<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
of overtime which who doesn't like that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.870 
of overtime which who doesn't like that
that's<00:01:25.770> right

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that's right

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.980 
that's right
so<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:28.020> DC<00:01:28.829> Wow<00:01:29.780> significantly<00:01:30.780> ahead

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
