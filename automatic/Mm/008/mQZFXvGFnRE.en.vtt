 toyota more while organizing 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.859
 here I discovered a very cute way 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.660
 very easy to make organizers with 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.670
 cardboard boxes cause of the pa 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.910
 This is all about going back to class. Let's go. 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.790
 organize new year new life on fifth 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.510
 new organization new new decoration 4 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.059
 new so let's talk all we 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.620
 Are you going to need a shoe box and 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:47.360
 cardboard cloth on white ball brush 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.629
 hot glue decorative papers ribbons 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:56.090
 fofuras packaging scissors stylus 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.130
 ruler and pen decorative letters 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.530
 We're going to use a piece of cardboard. 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.570
 to make a reinforcement layer is only 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.670
 mark the larger side of the carton 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.710
 cut with the scissors exactly 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.720
 easy size you can count too 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.729
 with a stylus 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:19.160
 Just pass glue smeared on to fix it. 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:23.380
 the two reinforcement layers may be a 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.380
 inside so easily 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.090
 two layers on each side 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.560
 we will choose the fabric and cut 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.320
 a band a little bigger than the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.860
 side of the carton 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.460
 spread a little glue and fixed fabric 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.460
 analyzing well 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.010
 the finish to pass glue underneath and 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.610
 over the fabric to make it look good 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.610
 right 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.549
 but the same thing on both sides 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.970
 When we do, she'll have the 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.220
 less you will get this access 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.220
 specific and thus complements perfect 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.409
 Just go in and the other one has been 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.090
 long time 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.760
 only this time we're going to cut the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.230
 works always passing glue over 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.129
 all black is just to put the fabric and 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.129
 analyzing carefully 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.440
 I chose pink paper to make the background 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.440
 from the box 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.489
 And then I said a wheelbox and you? 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.140
 you can mount your shelf the way you 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:06.730
 You wanted me to decorate with a ribbon. 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:08.680
 of income and now sports will need 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.900
 from its packaging to cut the fabric to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.599
 wrap the can with a little soil there 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:20.409
 We'll fold in law shishin. 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:23.079
 exactly the size of the lac is very 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.230
 simple and according to a source of 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:29.400
 income 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.400
 was slow in the leather hiss 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:40.330
 Now I'll decorate with that mustache in that 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.180
 love we see a combination that 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.410
 You can draw this other one will stay. 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.230
 with the contact paper 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.010
 just roll the contact ldu note 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.010
 smoothing well 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.160
 and I'll decorate with this little square 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.960
 which I did with two different roles 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.880
 counting one smaller than the other 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.350
 so way to with a hard hand and I will 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.500
 paste this little piece that she comes in 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.500
 House 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.360
 now just take the excess contact by 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.640
 against 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.380
 ready and there's a lot of other 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.860
 strong ideas to win you over 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.860
 would inspire 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.280
 It's not the cutest thing July, cute thing. 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.080
 and change everything 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.730
 spending almost nothing you can make the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.440
 The way you did you trained 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.110
 packaging that I used the boxes I 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.280
 I used it in an event in keep photo that was the 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.200
 Today's video I hope you have 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.930
