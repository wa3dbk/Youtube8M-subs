 bread without yeast and sourdough 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.080
 such a useful superfood 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.390
 for this we need 2 cups of flour 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.949

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.450
 oils 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.170
 we will need it in order to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.770
 knead our tes. 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:53.100
 highly carbonated water is purified and soda 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:57.660

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.619
 I have a taste of dried green onion 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.340
 dried parsley dill mind coriander we 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.549
 must now mix all our dry 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.920

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.360
 mix well be ready for 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.479
 the fact that this crib he had not the seal of putting it 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.270
 it will not be much lush roses it 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.869
 useful qualities can not be overestimated 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.210
 after we have mixed all our dry 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:55.270
 ingredients do inside 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:02:00.750
 such a fishing pole and add on wool 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.750
 on and oil and then open some water 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.979
 then we have some water and quick 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.330
 knead the dough, we should not 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:17.709
 get too cool then 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.400
 there is so tight a little bit 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:28.239
 slightly require very loose due to 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:33.099
 the fact that there we have bran baked flour then 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:36.480
 have he set useful to such 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:41.739
 the amount of flour I will leave then 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:48.160
 250 grams of water Iâ€™m probably water more 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:51.220
 I will not add kneads and all the dough 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.090
 naturally sticks too we will say 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.060
 roll on vegetable oil 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.819
 grease a little pen 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.069
 begin our father. 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.340
 move a little surface she 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.049
 very sticky 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.389
 as I noted my do not do 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:15.810
 too steep bread volume 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:20.590
 put it on a greased form and 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:24.310
 around the world and how to say loaf you 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.560
 can form round bread from 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.590
 this difference is not important to change 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.540
 completely next i'll take a man and 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.690
 a little bit of why they should have to nadrezhu 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.530
 knit because he will start 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.970
 increase increase in volume and 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:49.120
 such large cracks will start to appear 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.620
 so you can cut on top 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.560
 sprinkle with something 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.120
 and put in preheated to 200 degrees 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.660
 the oven immediately turns off the gas to about 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:06.170
 150 degrees and bake about 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.090
 Forty minutes immediately get bread 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.050
 not worth the oven 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.420
 let it stand for about an hour and 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.019
 cools down slowly naturally 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.480
 so we have cooked breads as far as 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.960
 it's delicious to put it in words of course 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.910
 it's hard but I advise everyone to bake at home 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.950
 bread 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.240
 all bon appetit to new meetings 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.240
