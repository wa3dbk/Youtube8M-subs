00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.540
 then for mounting the noca mask 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.820
 We're going to foam like this underneath. 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.420
 have been main with a right side 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.220
 for here internal fabric ne 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.830
 with the right side facing the side 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.140
 also the fabric that will 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.650
 here a little bit we'll fit 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.460
 here we will calculate 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.010
 more or less here the two and a half fingers 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.820
 more or less up here and it's going 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:45.230
 fit it here I'll finite that it is 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:49.160
 to get better and tag 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.590
 here and there we put the black 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.620
 and continue the process one more 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.379
 before continuing too. 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.440
 here the elastic he enters with 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.980
 one side is left, not side with side 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.090
 stitching it up here in case 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.789
 his right is also on top of the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.119
 the fabric right that is when the 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:16.130
 people turn it does not turn the other way 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:20.030
 still just one more remark before I 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.760
 close me I 'm fine here 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.840
 more or less two and a half fingers here 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.780
 top and now I'm going to come in with 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.740
 with this part here with right facing 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.030
 to the right of the fabric 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.520
 I'll fit it here right then and there. 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.060
 I'll sew it up leaving more or 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.070
 at least four fingers up here 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.159
 I usually center a little starting at 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.759
 seam here with half a centimeter of 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.060
 stitching also well surrounding her with 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:00.820
 half an inch and then what for? 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:06.469
 to be able to untap the mask 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.750
 So here I sewed whenever I 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.540
 I spend here in the rubber band I usually do 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.970
 a setback for him to get a little 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.040
 more firm and do not let go with 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.440
 facility 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.470
 I left it here right? 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:26.710
 an opening of about four 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:29.950
 fingers and now I'm going to turn just more 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:34.500
 an observation before turning the parts 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.710
 I cant speak 2 neighbors here 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.710
 to facilitate 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.000
 So here I'll be right back, the mask. 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.230
 the elastic was in the correct position with 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.210
 his sewing is inside here 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.870
 mask 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:01.600
 the etiquette is also there 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.580
 here I put a pin only 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.870
 This is where I'm going to do the 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.050
 closure 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.680
 and there I like to take advantage of tarpon take 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.980
 this seam what and ask and playing 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.920
 that label back then it's a fish 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.060
 about half a centimeter point 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.400
 around the entire mask and remembering 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.320
 playing this label back here is not 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:37.870
 So that you can not stay that way you can not 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:42.300
 back and here is the seam 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.670
 can be clear right and behind the coil 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.680
 always black 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.680
 so that one is ready 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.040
 tapestry actually gives a little 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.230
 less than half a centimeter because 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.280
 account of the closure that has 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.800
 a right will stay open the seam at 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.620
 around her all fear you put half 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.210
 It's not going to close here. 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.210
 it's very simple
