 Hello people, welcome, one more 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.350
 video channel geo tv on youtube site ms 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.510
 ric.com.br 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.650
 also for the entire microsoft community 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.679
 technet 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.130
 this video here is one more of those who 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.740
 I wrote via text article that some 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.720
 people did not have access to this 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.760
 content so I'm recording the video 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.980
 also that suddenly some subscribers 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.170
 aquino is following my site so I am 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.869
 also disseminating via video what the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.180
 public via text on site 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.129
 in this video here I will talk about this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:42.270
 commenting here on the launch of the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.090
 office 2016 for this year here 2015 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.360
 so you have a lot of important information 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.440
 because it has direct connection and with 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.020
 windows 10 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.190
 I'll tell why then on 21 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.010
 January of this year the Microsoft did is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.350
 an event on windows 10 and also 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.899
 took the opportunity to talk some things 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.299
 office 2016 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.820

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.020
 released this year 2015 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.610
 so if we look there on the internet 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.259
 search we will find many 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 information and rumors of images and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.869
 there news related to office 2016 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.960
 so I'm relating here even 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.680
 some of these images are this one by 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.890
 example shows a powerpoint screen already 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.430

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.210
 I have here an image referring to the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.899
 world 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.810
 so just for you to come here 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.180

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.270
 nÃ© in relation to what we use today more 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.020
 for the time being here nothing 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.590
 exceptional or different from what we already use 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.009
 today is down more here article I 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.350
 commented that the essential information and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.379
 that Microsoft is developing the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.200
 office 2016 for use in 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.900
 set there with a windows 10 inclusive 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.420
 we will probably have a version 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.860
 special for windows 10 ie you 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.840

 will have a basic package there from the office 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.590
 2016 is a standalone version of office 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.830
 2016 so much that she has it should be 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.250

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.500
