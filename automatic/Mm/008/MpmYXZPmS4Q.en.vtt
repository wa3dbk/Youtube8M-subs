00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.900
 well I'll leave late 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.289
 and of course a little 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.779
 How is it painted yet? 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:15.069
 a tc car 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.980
 for that we are going to open 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.609
 who first 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.230
 kennedy 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.630
 let's find it here 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.689
 you will know where they have it 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.689
 your dear to know where is mine 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.490
 and good percent 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.000
 there is no death 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.540
 let's see what we found a falcon falcon one falcon 2 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.650
 with three 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.060
 falcon 4 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.520
 enter one stage 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.760
 Falcon moments 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.360
 with the files that we are going to work with will be with any of these 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.290
 cuatros en falcÃ³n 1 2 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.890
 the 3 a 4 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.320
 that differential in very little 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 i in what differs the 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.150
 in the triple formed by percent for example the punch 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.880
 the shot was but dynamic there were some other thing these pictures 104 these 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.280
 four files 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.280
 the English box 2 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.750
 extra percent 1 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 in the quintile brought by the windows 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.330
 and the windshield 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.530
 percent to 2 will not be used in the case of tc mouras not used 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.790
 over here on the pontoons 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.250
 and as the tc mouras 'no more vat' pontoons I'm not optimistic 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.160
 and the falcon story this is preferable not to touch it 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.350
 well let's work with the falcon 1 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.720
 let's go to select one 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.720
 of any of the four that remains 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.490
 a preference you are the one you like the most, look at 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.350
 leader who likes me for example the son of 1 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.299
 we are going to open 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.109
 once opened 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.859
 as if my masters 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.069
 and we see that pre-defined layers are attracted 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.889
 I operated printed 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:25.159
 for example the layer of colors the layer this crisis does not modify 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.219
 and the coat of caracas 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.639
 what do we do with the paint layer here 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.039
 what we do is 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.609
 change the color at 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.519
 all that is the body of the car 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.639
 for example let's paint the sky selecting always paint the face 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:48.259
 let's change the color that the colors if they change destination this area 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.519
 these are in this order waving 8 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.239
 by clicking 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.599
 they open the color palette 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.599
 we were percent the color that more 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.429
 I in this case and choose unasur 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.169
 let's see okey 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.199
 and always 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.869
 selected to paint here 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:14.939
 let's go edition 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.409
 react 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.539
 we leave this as it is 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.539
 in the lyricism case and it's very rare that 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:28.829
 they say tell here selected preserve transparency trap not 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.129
 no no no no say it because yes no no no no 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.739
 do not paint 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.479
 then yes after viewing 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.569
 preserves high and transparency we select them 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.049
 we create because she 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.849
 and there I have this car painted 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.459
 of the color that we want
