00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.050
 the spider was with the man like a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.360
 potential for perdition she was with 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 him the man activated this potential we do not 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.580
 not activated it depends on the orientation 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.370
 that he takes but if the man activated this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.129
 potential then the spider get the 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.650
 potential of the fall the potential of 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.129
 live without the places the potential of 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.230
 pride and the sufficiency of thinking 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.300
 that we are an independent being that we can 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.780
 to live without the senses the letters that's it 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.930
 to deny it to think that we are at 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.510
 above all we need nothing 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.879
 so it's the spider to live without a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.760
 divine world it's the spider time that 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.280
 the man lived with the sea â€‹â€‹the spider does not 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.589
 could not touch the man because the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.020
 mother protect the man but as soon as 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.870
 the man came out of the sea then 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.450
 the spider was there to catch 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.650
 the man you have the spider you have 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.149
 flies because can not there 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.310
 have no fly spider and the 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.759
 flies to the six representatives late 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.350
 account certain thoughts in the man and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.039
 it is the thought of the man who is 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.719
 lower and the man actually lives with 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.039
 thoughts of flies and breathes in 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.579
 fly thoughts so they 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.340
 interest spiders and spider 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.350
 and as the brain of man and that's 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.670
 a brain that wants to take and steal and 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.740
 flies and and those who had to 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.789
 go to the higher worlds but the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.350
 flies only go to the waste 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.210
 if you do not see this being from 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.240
 the spider you will not be able to see the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.420
 christ because in reality christ 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.890
 came to show us how to do 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.659
 to cross this being of the army because 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.729
 that this being of the spider it's all 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.679
 around us is the world of men 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.190
 you really want to see what is 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.640
 it's the man 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.730
 so look at the disown but try to 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.319
 overcome the disgust because the christ 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.600
 is the strength that allows us to defeat 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.250
 disgust 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.820
 without Christ we will become 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.400
 sectarian beings all beings who have 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.640
 not followed the christ became 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.580
 sectarian sector means they have 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.860
 cut off from each other they were 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.800
 raw superior to others they are 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.600
 become sufficient they believed that there 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.400
 had superior beings and beings 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.770
 inferior but jesus what he has 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.320
 said you must love each other 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.150
 other 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.200
 you must but it's a strength 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.360
 superior what you do to the little ones 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.470
 it's mine that you do it you me 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.160
 trample on 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.210
 that is, I touched the earth I 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:08.130
 touched the earth what is this the 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:15.210
 earth is the greatest wonder that 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:18.030
 exist it's god we touch there is 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.860
 no god but the earth the earth 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.660
 shows us the divinity 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.660
