00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.810 
the gorilla torch it's a 65 lumen output
is<00:01:18.509> brightest<00:01:19.110> setting<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
is brightest setting and on this

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.570 
is brightest setting and on this
brightest<00:01:21.299> setting<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.110> round<00:01:22.470> about<00:01:22.770> 20

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
hours battery life now on economy

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.880 
hours battery life now on economy
setting<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.810> around<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.110> 80<00:01:28.380> hours<00:01:28.860> of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
setting you get around about 80 hours of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.730 
setting you get around about 80 hours of
battery<00:01:29.369> life<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.170> also<00:01:31.350> water

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
battery life and that it is also water

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.810 
battery life and that it is also water
resistant<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.640> well<00:01:32.720> now<00:01:33.720> runs<00:01:34.200> off<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.820> three

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820

AAA<00:01:36.540> batteries<00:01:37.159> which<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.460> see

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
AAA batteries which you can see

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.039 
AAA batteries which you can see
installed<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.810> side<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> torch<00:01:40.619> and

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
installed on this side of the torch and

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.840 
installed on this side of the torch and
then<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> controls<00:01:43.680> operating<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.549> torch

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
then the controls operating the torch

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.830 
then the controls operating the torch
are<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.899> right-hand<00:01:46.770> side<00:01:47.299> now<00:01:48.299> i'm<00:01:48.600> just

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
are on the right-hand side now i'm just

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.719 
are on the right-hand side now i'm just
going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.759> dim<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.060> studio<00:01:51.689> lives<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.729> show

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
going to dim the studio lives and show

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.469 
going to dim the studio lives and show
you<00:01:53.790> how<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.360> works<00:01:55.460> we<00:01:56.460> rotate<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.119> round

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
you how this works we rotate this round

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.929 
you how this works we rotate this round
and<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.689> switches<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> torch<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.340> then

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and that switches the torch on and then

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.469 
and that switches the torch on and then
as<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:01.250> round<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:03.090> range<00:02:03.590> actually<00:02:04.590> dims

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
as you go round the range actually dims

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.020 
as you go round the range actually dims
or<00:02:06.619> becomes<00:02:07.619> brighter<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.700> you've<00:02:08.849> got<00:02:08.879> that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
or becomes brighter so you've got that

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.130 
or becomes brighter so you've got that
adjustment<00:02:09.780> there

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
adjustment there

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.710 
adjustment there
for<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> point<00:02:11.160> straight<00:02:11.520> at<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.819> camera<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
for a point straight at the camera you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.960 
for a point straight at the camera you
can<00:02:12.750> see<00:02:13.050> how<00:02:13.110> can<00:02:13.290> dim<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.560> light<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.280> then

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
can see how can dim the light and then

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.660 
can see how can dim the light and then
bring<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.360> back<00:02:15.390> up<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.900> full<00:02:16.110> brightness<00:02:16.670> and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
bring it back up to full brightness and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.809 
bring it back up to full brightness and
again<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:18.900> table<00:02:19.170> here<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:20.370> can<00:02:20.550> dim<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
again on my table here we can dim the

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.530 
again on my table here we can dim the
line<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:22.140> then<00:02:22.650> rotate<00:02:23.069> background<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:24.330> bring

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
line and then rotate background to bring

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.110 
line and then rotate background to bring
it<00:02:24.660> up<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.930> full<00:02:25.110> brightness<00:02:25.730> then<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.880> course

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
it up to full brightness then of course

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.449 
it up to full brightness then of course
we<00:02:27.330> can<00:02:27.480> turn<00:02:27.690> off<00:02:27.930> by<00:02:28.500> clicking<00:02:28.950> into<00:02:29.310> that

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
we can turn off by clicking into that

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.600 
we can turn off by clicking into that
position<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.830> got<00:02:31.980> some<00:02:32.160> useful

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
position so it's got some useful

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.210 
position so it's got some useful
adjustment<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.810> shame<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.530> there's<00:02:35.040> not

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
adjustment it's a shame that there's not

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.460 
adjustment it's a shame that there's not
some<00:02:35.459> sort<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.760> focus<00:02:36.270> ring<00:02:36.570> on<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.989> front<00:02:37.260> so

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
some sort of focus ring on the front so

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.770 
some sort of focus ring on the front so
that<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.800> either<00:02:37.890> concentrate<00:02:38.760> or<00:02:39.209> extend

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
that we can either concentrate or extend

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.930 
that we can either concentrate or extend
the<00:02:39.930> width<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.470> beam<00:02:40.770> but<00:02:41.520> certainly

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
the width of that beam but certainly

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.570 
the width of that beam but certainly
it's<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.180> very<00:02:42.510> useful<00:02:42.840> work<00:02:43.320> George<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.070> the
