00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.910

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.410

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.410

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.880
 weird games like whether an honest salute 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.810

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.330
 the alphabet 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.190
 before you start shooting you want 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:33.910

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:37.060
