00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.960 

what<00:01:12.130> we<00:01:12.250> have<00:01:12.460> is<00:01:12.729> your<00:01:13.299> standard<00:01:13.750> tack<00:01:14.970> miles

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
what we have is your standard tack miles

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.300 
what we have is your standard tack miles
per<00:01:16.240> hour

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
per hour

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.980 
per hour
that's<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.520> odometer<00:01:18.790> right<00:01:19.299> there<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:19.810> any

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
that's the odometer right there and any

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.429 
that's the odometer right there and any
bit

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
bit

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.100 
bit
this<00:01:21.189> is<00:01:21.369> zero<00:01:21.729> there<00:01:22.119> is<00:01:22.270> out<00:01:22.479> of<00:01:22.509> sync<00:01:22.899> mile

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
this is zero there is out of sync mile

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.850 
this is zero there is out of sync mile
and<00:01:23.470> it's<00:01:23.590> like<00:01:23.770> brand-new<00:01:25.680> green<00:01:26.680> light

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
and it's like brand-new green light

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.320 
and it's like brand-new green light
means<00:01:27.009> neutral<00:01:28.020> different<00:01:29.020> modes<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:31.119> just

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
means neutral different modes that just

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.420 
means neutral different modes that just
changed<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.750> bottom<00:01:32.020> number<00:01:32.170> there<00:01:32.470> now

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
changed that bottom number there now

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.279 
changed that bottom number there now
it's<00:01:33.610> at<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:33.820> zero<00:01:34.149> one<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.689> guess<00:01:35.080> there's<00:01:35.259> a

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
it's at a zero one I guess there's a

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.080 
it's at a zero one I guess there's a
tenth<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.680> mile<00:01:35.890> but<00:01:36.250> I<00:01:36.310> guess<00:01:36.490> all<00:01:36.729> income

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
tenth of a mile but I guess all income

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.389 
tenth of a mile but I guess all income
like<00:01:37.210> that<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:38.289> then<00:01:38.619> there's<00:01:38.799> this<00:01:38.979> on<00:01:39.220> it's

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
like that and then there's this on it's

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.700 
like that and then there's this on it's
really<00:01:39.490> cool<00:01:39.789> it's<00:01:39.970> a<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.920> a<00:01:42.039> trip<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:43.240> can

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
really cool it's a it's a trip you can

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.290 
really cool it's a it's a trip you can
time<00:01:44.710> how<00:01:44.740> long<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.280> takes<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:45.789> to<00:01:45.819> go<00:01:46.210> from
