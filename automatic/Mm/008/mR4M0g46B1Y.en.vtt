heat<00:00:12.150> horsepower<00:00:12.630> should<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.080> same<00:00:13.230> it's

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
heat horsepower should be the same it's

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.780 
heat horsepower should be the same it's
like<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.559> seven<00:00:13.830> horsepower<00:00:14.099> which<00:00:14.429> would<00:00:14.580> be

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
like the seven horsepower which would be

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.080 
like the seven horsepower which would be
the<00:00:14.880> 724<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.470> it's<00:00:17.039> pride<00:00:17.520> pretty<00:00:17.820> much<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
the 724 and it's pride pretty much the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.640 
the 724 and it's pride pretty much the
same<00:00:18.240> procedure<00:00:18.660> for<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.900> whole<00:00:19.050> bunch<00:00:19.560> of

same procedure for a whole bunch of

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.880 
same procedure for a whole bunch of
different<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:20.100> come<00:00:20.310> some<00:00:20.490> engines<00:00:21.769> over<00:00:22.769> the

different to come some engines over the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.140 
different to come some engines over the
years<00:00:23.039> these<00:00:23.279> bolts<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.730> get<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> little

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
years these bolts can get a little

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.390 
years these bolts can get a little
stubborn<00:00:24.449> make<00:00:25.199> sure<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.890> from<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
stubborn make sure that is from the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.620 
stubborn make sure that is from the
factory<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:26.849> came<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> couple<00:00:27.240> tabs

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
factory they came with a couple tabs

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.089 
factory they came with a couple tabs
that<00:00:28.080> seat<00:00:28.740> against<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:30.619> bolt<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.949> got<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that seat against the bolt so you got a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.160 
that seat against the bolt so you got a
pry<00:00:32.369> those<00:00:32.610> away<00:00:32.940> I've<00:00:33.540> already<00:00:33.840> done<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.140> here

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
get a socket item and the tool that I

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.869 
get a socket item and the tool that I
need<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> half-inch<00:00:40.860> socket<00:00:41.250> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
need for this is a half-inch socket of

need for this is a half-inch socket of
the<00:00:41.940> ratchet<00:00:42.270> wrench<00:00:53.570> even<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.750> them<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the ratchet wrench even with them you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.840 
the ratchet wrench even with them you
don't<00:00:55.710> want<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.949> take<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> way<00:00:56.730> out

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
don't want to take one all the way out

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
don't want to take one all the way out
and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> other<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.050> make

any seeds on the bunch of these bolts I
already<00:02:21.599> did<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> couple<00:02:22.050> days<00:02:22.410> ago<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.800> I'm

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
already did it a couple days ago so I'm

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.490 
already did it a couple days ago so I'm
not<00:02:22.950> gonna<00:02:23.099> do<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.400> again

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
not gonna do it again

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.930 
not gonna do it again
you<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:25.620> get<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.220> auto<00:02:26.340> parts<00:02:26.730> store

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
you can get that in the auto parts store

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.930 
you can get that in the auto parts store
and<00:02:27.650> it'll<00:02:28.650> make<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:28.920> easier<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.730> get<00:02:29.910> off

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and it'll make this easier to get off

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.240 
and it'll make this easier to get off
and<00:02:30.629> on<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.959> next<00:02:31.200> time<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.739> ever<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:32.069> to

wobbly tail you want to make it kind of
even<00:03:12.310> like<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:28.540> bolts<00:03:29.230> like<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.500> loosen<00:03:29.830> up<00:03:29.920> to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
even like is bolts like to loosen up to

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.470 
even like is bolts like to loosen up to
over<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.459> years<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:30.940> then<00:03:31.030> yeah
