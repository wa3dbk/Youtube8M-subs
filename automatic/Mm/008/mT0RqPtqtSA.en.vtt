00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.250
 this is a top-class sedan 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.780
 At first glance, this seems to be a normal sevens from the outside 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.409
 his 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.929
 at first glance 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.410
 the interior is comfortable as usual from Munich so also so also 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.509
 nothing remarkable here 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.469
 but a small button the steering wheel for these sevens to under Owens 7 the 

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.589
 the world's first hydrogen-powered luxury saloon 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.179
 and yet with something unique 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.430
 The Hydrogen 7 has undergone the complete series development process 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.550
 and is a full-fledged everyday vehicle 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.550
 just not everyday 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.760
 There is currently no nationwide supply of hydrogen 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.180
 is guaranteed, the hydrogen 7 both with gasoline and with 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.060
 Be operated hydrogen 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
 the refueling process is very easy 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.409
 fueled by a user-friendly hydrogen coupling 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.170
 after interlocking the tank coupling becomes the pipe for refueling 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.390
 Approved 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.830
 the deep cold hydrogen then spins into the special one can not in the hypo- 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.830
 is positioned at seven behind the rear seat 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.810
 Imkamp is always one besides the liquid hydrogen 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.810
 Layer of gaseous hydrogen 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.890
 after completion of the refueling process, the Tan coupling is simply released again 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.760
 When starting the engine is then if so set to hydrogen operation with 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.030
 supplied gaseous hydrogen 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.730
 the gaseous hydrogen has electricity at ambient temperature in the second 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.389
 gate 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.649
 in the so-called plant, the gaseous hydrogen becomes oxygen with air 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.369
 mixed 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:24.839
 in h2 combustion engine, this mixture is burned and direct 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.699
 converted mechanical energy 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.930
 the engine can be easily connected while driving at the touch of a button 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.929
 two and petrol mode switched 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.209
 the combustion of hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen produces water vapor 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.469
 This water vapor flows through the exhaust system and exhausted 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.769
 according to all experts 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.009
 Hydrogen is the only source of energy 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:59.809
 the our fossil 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.769
 Fuels because pull and diesel 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.409
 replace in the long term 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.260
 As a company that acts sustainably, we also stand for sustainable Nobel 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.499
 IT at 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.829
 with the BMW Hydra Jan Steffen 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.119
 do we have 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.529
 a vehicle presented 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:21.829
 guaranteed for the first time sustainable mobility for our customers 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:27.419
 We have decided here for the hydrogen combustion engine 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.459
 because only the hydrogen internal combustion engine the typical 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.019
 Properties that make BMW 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.019
 Agility and dynamics 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.019
 personified 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.949
 the performance data are for gasoline and hydrogen which are the fish 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.519
 from six liters of displacement, the engine generates 260 hp 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.400
 is accelerated from zero to one hundred in no time and seconds 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.689
 and then at 230 he lays down without sports equipment 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:01.139
 BMW wants to avoid the cars to so-called pioneer drivers 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.790
 a sale is out of the question and Breisach will not be announced 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:10.949
 Celebrities and decision-makers should drive the car up to half a year in Germany 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.899
 Try the USA and China 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.059
 we are looking forward to their castle part
