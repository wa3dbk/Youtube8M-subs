00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.200
 newspaper already left daily in the afternoon 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.600
 I know, here you are, you do not change the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.700
 little ones would not ask me 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.050
 When he asks for it, nothing says, I came 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.800
 by the team captain and his 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.380
 center forward 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.290
 my little sister I heard that you were 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.660
 of ball and look of a great rival 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.460
 because one day they will meet in front 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.090
 from the door of your house with your tongue 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.400
 out at least 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.080
 because they always fight if there 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.879
 known that the coconut would bring his dog not 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.420
 I would have come more and for these good 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.420
 stop fighting 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.730
 the life 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.870
 that's how I would miss more the same 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.110
 but what does this miss a potato 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.110
 A) Yes 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.390
 I'm coming, I 'll see the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.069
 boys and it takes I'm also going 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.540
 I will try to sell a few 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.680
 newspapers 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.569
 we have stayed at the end alone 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.599
 It was what he said that would happen to me 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.599
 more and for that was playing 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.290
 by lifting the coconut mood simply 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.030
 I do not understand it, Zurich is the best 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.210
 goalkeeper not only in the fifth grade but 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.470
 of the whole school and how badly she was 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.800
 will think that something is not in order 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.620
 as if it were intentional do not think 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.050
 that coconut are you talking nonsense look 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.400
 I would take a look at my motorcycle and from here 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.110
 a few minutes he would reach the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.870
 dressing rooms and I'll try to give them a little 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.390
 of encouragement if I can enter clear that if 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.500
 comes quiet if someone tells you something 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.500
 that you come to see me 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.410
 what's wrong with you jury that could have 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.569
 made a better defense for that but 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.599
 I'm in shape let's go to him as a pretext 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:30.080
 in your way this is decisive you know it 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.449
 I'm going with the 73rd defense and because you're 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.270
 the one who has the case maybe not me 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.099
 you blame me for now we're going to 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.630
 lose because it always has to be like 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:43.490
 the center forward hello boys good 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.449
 I can not always do it just like me 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.819
 I do not care 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.819
 I also want to kick a bowl 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.509
 and what is said and only that you are the 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.490
 better and how bitter is poor she 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.740
 think that you are the best goalkeeper of 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.349
 the school and now what will he say 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.479
 she writes that clear and she repeated it 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.520
 during the game pay attention that 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.280
 boy will become the goalkeeper of 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.310
 the selection said that about the selection and 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.229
 of the selection that said well did not rob him 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.180
 the longer the second one is going to start 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.180
 part of the party until then 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.740
 they are said turning over my bike 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.020
 what happens, tell me what happened 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.490
 how are we highlighting you like this 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.610
 tremendous goal and the goalkeeper is in the 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:40.300
 defense like a beast who plays better 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:43.880
 now the center forward the goalkeeper does not 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.700
 we are remembered very well 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.310
 I will talk with the eggs separated 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.880
 I started what we have then what 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.880
 it does very well 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:24.310
 one more game so gray hair 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.840
 how a police dog has seen before 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.020
 white 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.230
 it does not matter as much as I am the 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.230
 champion 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.050
 Y 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.400
 and 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.720
 Y
