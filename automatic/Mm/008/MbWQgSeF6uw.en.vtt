 look at the buildings look what 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.250

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.500

 that I have others to tell you what is this 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.060
 that's why we started the raid 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.040
 so you have to know that we were in the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.800
 thailand and we tried left the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.390
 thailand for more finally we left the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.770
 thailand since we did not want it 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.700
 give us the rights could there was 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.790
 renounced under chef who were not 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.670
 okay and so we said finally we got 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.960
 says for that for erp etc 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.670
 it was better for you to change 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.310
 downright concretely our country have so 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.510
 we created our country but our old 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.830
 minor of thailand it 's not too much who 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.110
 did that since one all gone which 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.880
 is a little normal 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.700
 finally I understood is actually it is 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.770
 very he was very friend with brazil 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.590
 who is the most powerful woman of the 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.150
 Serbian but we had even paid you 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.230
 Uruguay and Brazil it was just there 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.080
 they came right away we 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.520
 look for trouble 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.890
 when we were there so they came 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.090
 have put themselves on the wall and then I 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.980
 I heard that we hit them so we told them 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.070
 justin friend finally a damage said qin 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.180
 help us 20xx for members of the ceni 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.420
 are they building with us 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.170
 we gave to give a little corner and there 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.970
 above said yes 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.170
 you declared war on us and 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.190
 so et cetera so if you're on 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.480
 the chain and you have a country do 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.890
 was tapping on every owner of people even 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.680
 a little bit and that can be a motive 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.200
 of war so here we were we were 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.019
 a little sick 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.090
 so we had the brazilo that at the beginning they 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.190
 told us so we will take you a 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.420
 fee and in exchange will assure you 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.519
 protection and stuff 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.200
 so we had that it was not in force 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.230
 and to sink everything but finally we get 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.650
 what's up and then after the next day he 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.940
 we at the level 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.620
 finally gives you no protection 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.550
 gives you no stock includes 50% of 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.739
 your income per week 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.200
 and otherwise you died there we were a 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.230
 little braking a little ghetto so we have 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.610
 decided 2 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.629
 to change server since we were not 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.940
 not there for a very long time so I 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.019
 repeat you announced the glory chain 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.610
 blue you are trying to talk a little bit 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.200
 in the chatt asked a guy from 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.150

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.560
 teamspeak who is the like skype of 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.090
 anyway mandatory of the speak team 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.099
 to enter our home it's like skype 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.870
 so what are you looking for a the cat is not 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.860
 uruguay recruitment and so you go 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.840
 you wait until there is a guy who 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.040

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.530

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.790
 not brave the data here 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.150
 I 'll explain it more in the next 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.799
 video 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
 it's really a quick video for 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.680

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.310

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.620
 what is it to the six nations the rice 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.639
 really seems to please you since 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.590
 it made me feel like where there is the most 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.120
 more view etc 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.610
 compare f k so I think I'm going 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.320
 more put myself in the optics to make 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.370
 the most possible 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.830
 it really suited you 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.530
 to interest in something too 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.840
 will put in the link in the description 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.160
 if it's still possible to vote for 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.330
 the red vs bout bout actually 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.100
 I would like to film you there is the 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.870
 raid against the blues I registered 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.889
 with dark side but on dark cei told me 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.330
 finally he did not really want to 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.400
 do it so I 'll be alone so if 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.380
 I can get a system upgraded 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.000
 of voting the 30 players who have the most 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.500
 votes are taken so it would be 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.880
 cool to go vote for me if you have 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.680
 the time you spend right on the link 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.300
 that I put you in the description 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.130
 you have you finally click you 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.740
 go on blue server and you click 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.090
 on collar you put vote that me 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.370
 will film you the clash 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.460
 big it's going to be a clash May 30 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.410
 30 32 against 30,30 of the blue 30 of the raid 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.160
 then it can be very nice I think to 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:19.130
 I will film you shoot it if I 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.210
 taken of course I will film the progress 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.830
 from the city so we're still in 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.470
 construction in the city is very recent 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.950
 and there of two days should construction 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.150
 and a day of destruction knowing that a 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.229
 day it was monday so you can not 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.979
 too much by cons we still registered 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.590
 to get money 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.270
 so what makes us win eight 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.260
 thousand dollars while there was right and 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.020
 butt a wall I do not know too much 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.810
 how they managed to noticed us so 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.699
 that was all I had to say 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.000
 plus a lot of chicken genome tasks 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.710
 works well actually 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.050
 that's all I had to say at 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.090
 level of change and so it's 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.800
 do not forget so do not hesitate to 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.150
 to the future 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.330
 we just about recruiting people who 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.190
 had to take one we recruit 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.150
 we recruit no need steph etc you 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.510
 help you redo etc 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.880
 there is no problem with it so 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.290
 that's all I did 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.610
 in any case, I hope that 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.840
 next episodes of the glory chain 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.100

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.620
 will happen of course do not worry 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.730
 not just not too much time for them 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.920
 to do right now but I'm going to 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.210

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.310

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.530
 this town hall with you then we go 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.220

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:30.070
 the man who starts his build be 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.990
 so yes people are starting to be from 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.110
 more and more active 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.520
 so it's pretty cool 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.320
 so here it was mister cow the 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.210
