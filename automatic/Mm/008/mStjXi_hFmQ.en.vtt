00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
people do have units and are using them

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.460 
people do have units and are using them
for<00:04:06.609> four<00:04:07.239> different<00:04:07.600> areas<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:08.230> was

for four different areas that was

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.590 
for four different areas that was
something<00:04:08.980> we<00:04:09.310> really<00:04:09.340> needed<00:04:09.940> as<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.150> factor

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
something we really needed as a factor

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.750
