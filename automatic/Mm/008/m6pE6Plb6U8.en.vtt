88 overall left wing power forward I

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.359 
88 overall left wing power forward I
think<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.500> bit<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.710> an<00:00:31.800> over<00:00:31.980> rating<00:00:32.250> for

think it's a bit of an over rating for
package<00:00:32.640> ready<00:00:32.730> he's<00:00:32.969> probably<00:00:33.149> around<00:00:33.540> 86<00:00:34.050> 87

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559

is<00:00:36.750> definitely<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> good<00:00:37.200> power<00:00:37.410> forward<00:00:37.739> but

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
is definitely a good power forward but

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.260 
is definitely a good power forward but
I'd<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.790> scoring<00:00:39.120> touch

him next guys drew doughty 88 overall
offensive<00:00:51.149> defenseman<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.230> drew

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
offensive defenseman I think drew

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.450 
offensive defenseman I think drew
doughty<00:00:52.530> could<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.800> even<00:00:53.010> ranked<00:00:53.340> higher

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
doughty could be even ranked higher

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.619 
doughty could be even ranked higher
since<00:00:53.730> there<00:00:53.879> are<00:00:53.940> some<00:00:54.149> defense<00:00:54.420> when<00:00:54.539> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
since there are some defense when I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.090 
since there are some defense when I
higher<00:00:54.809> than<00:00:54.989> him<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:55.440> he's<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
higher than him that I think he's on the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.830 
higher than him that I think he's on the
same<00:00:56.280> level<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.910> maybe<00:00:57.090> more<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.390> an<00:00:57.449> 89

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
same level with so maybe more of an 89

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.560 
same level with so maybe more of an 89
for<00:00:58.109> Judy<00:00:58.980> next<00:00:59.879> guys<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.300> Patrick

be<00:01:03.989> closer<00:01:04.260> than<00:01:04.379> 87<00:01:04.949> kind<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.220> gets<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.430> boost

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
be closer than 87 kind of gets a boost

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.550 
be closer than 87 kind of gets a boost
