00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:17.160
 hello everyone and it's 0-1 because bg 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.710
 for a new video so a 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.600
 compilation of three bugs on reise die 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.410
 even if there is full looping here is 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.100
 so as to make 3 so it goes 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.710
 fast enough 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.680
 so there everything to have to be obliged in 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.059
 solo but here you have to go by 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.440
 the elevator to go faster but 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.739
 you do not have to, you have to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.670
 put the belly viano edge edge made 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.780
 be careful not to fall 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.420
 do not exaggerate that's how you 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.590
 can you squat yourself or put 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.899
 it is the same standing so there will 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.620
 men here you are misplaced finally a 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.340
 little bit badly spent who are you 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.870
 give you slaps in aurons that do not 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.320
 do not want to give you slaps so 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.390
 watched as observed here that makes its 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.560
 voices that you can give them given 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.000
 the favorites you want them 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.409
 head shots they do not really take 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.619
 as to the inhabitants this beautiful is so 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.630
 after I was too stupid I took the 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.119
 care so after I was badly placed 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.220
 affected areas 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.960
 here I pray them there just for 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.360
 tell you you must have noticed I'm 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.070
 not live 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.960
 this is me then here we must be careful 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.640
 not to fall so where you saw 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.800
 that I am me it is to be on time 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.070
 so that for that I want to do a little 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.659
 hit not solved so here we will not see 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.240
 that I get hit by azumi but 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:51.500
 everywhere the gentleman will make comparison and 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:55.090
 because of that I'm dead so here we go 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.490
 why still a little bit 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:06.429
 so blige there you can survive 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:08.679
 a few months later so that's why 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.269
 I decided to make you right bÃ¨gles 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.049
 and the three Greek is in this 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:18.069
 building mom there is more I 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:26.260
 know a lot more but hey you 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:30.190
 do not get to see it here they are 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:37.269
 and we will quickly go to the second ring 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:39.730
 go to more and so here we are 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.799
 found for bug number two then 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.430
 buggy number 2 is on the roof 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.230
 so here you go here where I am 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.690
 you will put yourself in the middle of 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.570
 small post here 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.280
 and then the zombies are going to happen 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.900
 stuck next to the barrier 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.920
 I do not like this bug because 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.020
 after the zombies they push each other 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.360
 time so that's how power to the 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.780
 right there are the zombies that think themselves 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.140
 so I went in third mode 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.810
 nobody watch it if someone passes 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.900
 next to it that's it so I advise you 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.340
 not that there is a second person who 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.510
 so go on there we can see also a 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.250
 another example that here at the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.020
 punchers a lot of movie corners is 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.810
 after I have to be careful who has not 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:38.920
 tomic vocals so there it was with the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:40.570
 gollum so that's ok so also if you 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.260
 worry all you zombies 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.770
 have and if you do not shoot a single 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.650
 ball will you have a free trump 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:54.580
 but here is watching it pays for itself 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.500
 5% and rings number 3 the last bug 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.170
 so watch up 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.150
 it is very hard but in Montpellier xiii 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.310
 en bloc it's not me but they 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.739
 were in the party so the street he has 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.450
 successful first time 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:13.660
 So there I go there is little to accelerate 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.080
 can on a lot of points so here 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.140
 we were eating 13 so we could not 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:24.520
 survive all his sleeves there with 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.690
 all these zombies so here you are then we 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.650
 can see that there is still a lot 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.650
 a lot of zombies 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:40.010
 so here we are going to leave on those on 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:44.510
 these pictures and I'm preparing you another 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.300
 video you will see on tips 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.620
 to have a good weapon in the box 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.620
 magic to go smart 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.660
