00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.350
Life is a snap. It happens!

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.350
Your father loves you and your behavior is
souring his life. 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.389
You must grow up and stop fooling around.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.320
I see a very black future for him, in prison.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.749
Family dinners are a pain in the neck. Don't
you agree? I'll pass.

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.749
Darling, you carry more than you can hold.
It is best to let it go.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.039
Enjoy what you have. You're still green, your
time has not arrived yet. 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.039
Love! 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.250
I like it here. It is very relaxing. 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.339
Life is complicated when you have no one, believe me!

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.339
You need your father. 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:44.339
Forgive! 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:46.339
No one ever gives you anything for free. 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.339
You have to earn it all, including happiness.

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:54.619
There is nothing more wonderful 
than enjoying every moment that we have been given.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.320
Live!

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.320
Life is a show.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.320
A continuous session that is beyond our control. 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320
For the first time I understand what you mean.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320
At the end, you're not as dumb as I thought.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.270
Life is just around the corner.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.270
Time fixes any problem. And if you want the truth, don't
worry, you'll have it.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.270
Ana is special.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.270
He's a bad-mannered and a swine. 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.460
When she likes someone, is very spiteful. But deep down,
she likes you. 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.590
God, this guy has guts, I like him. 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.409
Youth, these days ... Are you on Tuenti,
right? 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.409
Of course you are! 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.409
What I want is to live my life without obligations. 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.409
Well, I didn't say a word about you getting adapted to it, do not exaggerate.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.759
How's it going?

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.759
What brings you here?

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.759
I'm your sister, aren't you happy to see me?

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.570
No choise is wrong.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.570
You choose the path.
