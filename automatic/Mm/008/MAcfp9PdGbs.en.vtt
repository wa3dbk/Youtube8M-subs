00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:14.809
 the student's interest in what you 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.270
 teacher will present know how to pass on 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.450
 a content for each 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.000
 every child that has a different world 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.390
 you have a different culture that has 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.850
 a value different from our students 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.500
 he he school they come to the world today 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.640
 think much more cooked more 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.540
 evolved 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.400
 so it's up to me to try 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.730
 monitor it as best you can and 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.160
 make that exchange with him both meet 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.820
 with them as he is teaching and 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.800
 learning every day and every year year 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.530
 change is too big so it's a 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.370
 very challenging evolve with these 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.829
 boys 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.379
 one of the greatest challenges has been to bring 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.170
 all these technology features 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.899
 visual audio inside the school 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.039
 not that it's hard to bring from school 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.420
 difficult to bring into the school and 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:14.080
 I managed to put it in a way that 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.080
 that make the students 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.360
 shine your eyes and and is interested in and is 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.909
 very difficult to bring the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.729
 resources but without taking away the 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.869
 greater importance of the book and to make 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.869
 with which they understand this 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.230
 the teacher is involved not only in 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.900
 classroom but develop a job 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:53.680
 and prepare proof or correction of evidence 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.350
 for more green juice for example that 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.090
 people have the availability of modules 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.910
 This is a time when the teacher 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.640
 is outside the classroom that moment 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.119
 he does not contemplate it is not enough 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.130
 for efficient continuing training that 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.200
 I consider it a great challenge in 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.370
 education is a matter of valuing the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.130
 teacher 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.380
 I see that the teacher needs to be more 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:23.350
 valued as both financially 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.780
 society even to himself himself 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.100
 he sometimes he in so has 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.739
 difficulty speaking which is a 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.140
 teacher because because he knows that he 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.080
 is devalued and is having the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.489
 amount due because the teacher is 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.640
 a very important profession in the 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.640
 society
