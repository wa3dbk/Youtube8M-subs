you weighed out so you know what your

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.690 
you weighed out so you know what your
end<00:02:26.750> weights<00:02:27.079> going<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.439> be<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.040> get<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.400> spoon

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
end weights going to be you get a spoon

really<00:02:37.489> I<00:02:37.670> always<00:02:38.090> go<00:02:38.420> overboard<00:02:38.720> with<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.230> I

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
really I always go overboard with it I

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.589 
really I always go overboard with it I
put<00:02:39.680> too<00:02:39.890> much<00:02:39.920> on<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.579> then<00:02:40.909> I<00:02:41.030> test<00:02:41.329> them<00:02:41.510> out

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
put too much on and then I test them out

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.080 
put too much on and then I test them out
in<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.810> water<00:02:42.019> see<00:02:42.590> how<00:02:42.739> they<00:02:42.980> pull<00:02:43.220> then<00:02:43.939> I'll

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
in the water see how they pull then I'll

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.339 
in the water see how they pull then I'll
cut<00:02:44.390> back<00:02:44.420> accordingly<00:02:45.260> for<00:02:46.190> desired<00:02:46.519> look

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
cut back accordingly for desired look

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.569 
cut back accordingly for desired look
now<00:02:48.349> when<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:48.889> I<00:02:48.980> said<00:02:49.159> when<00:02:49.310> they're<00:02:49.430> wet

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
now when like I said when they're wet

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.940 
now when like I said when they're wet
they<00:02:50.180> scrunch<00:02:50.480> down<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:51.409> this<00:02:51.530> one<00:02:51.739> would<00:02:51.920> have

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
they scrunch down so this one would have

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.319 
they scrunch down so this one would have
nice<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.970> tight<00:02:53.200> red<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.379> middle<00:02:54.650> as<00:02:55.329> the

notice with the blue foxes when you cast

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.309 
notice with the blue foxes when you cast
them<00:03:24.620> out<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:25.010> they<00:03:25.699> land<00:03:25.970> in<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.120> water<00:03:26.419> they

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
them out and they land in the water they

them out and they land in the water they
tip<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.010> then<00:03:28.459> they<00:03:28.579> dive<00:03:28.879> down<00:03:29.299> and<00:03:29.659> I<00:03:29.959> find

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
tip and then they dive down and I find

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.479 
tip and then they dive down and I find
that<00:03:30.319> that's<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.590> moment<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:31.040> your<00:03:31.250> line

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
that that's the moment that your line

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.509 
that that's the moment that your line
gets<00:03:31.790> twisted<00:03:32.209> around<00:03:32.359> here<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:33.709> try<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.280> put

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
gets twisted around here so I try to put

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.399 
gets twisted around here so I try to put
more<00:03:34.699> weight<00:03:34.940> at<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.090> back<00:03:35.299> less<00:03:36.019> weight<00:03:36.230> up

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
more weight at the back less weight up

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.589 
more weight at the back less weight up
front<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.889> when<00:03:37.879> it<00:03:38.000> goes<00:03:38.150> through<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.419> air

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
front and when it goes through the air

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.520 
front and when it goes through the air
and<00:03:38.949> it<00:03:39.949> hits<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.159> water<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.639> drops<00:03:41.299> level<00:03:41.900> so

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
and it hits the water it drops level so

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.830 
and it hits the water it drops level so
when<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.799> get<00:03:42.979> a<00:03:43.010> good<00:03:43.190> pull<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:44.419> have<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.599> good

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
when you get a good pull you have a good

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.539 
when you get a good pull you have a good
opportunity<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.530> untwist<00:03:45.859> your<00:03:46.069> line<00:03:46.220> just<00:03:46.459> in

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
opportunity to untwist your line just in

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.719 
opportunity to untwist your line just in
case<00:03:46.699> it<00:03:46.849> is<00:03:46.970> twisted<00:03:48.129> now<00:03:49.129> for<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.579> odd

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:49.729 
case it is twisted now for the odd

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.689 
case it is twisted now for the odd
occasion<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:50.359> do<00:03:50.419> like<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:50.810> fish<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:52.190> top<00:03:52.400> water

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
occasion I do like to fish the top water

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.849 
occasion I do like to fish the top water
and<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.569> felt<00:03:53.780> like<00:03:53.870> I<00:03:53.930> needed<00:03:54.109> a<00:03:54.290> spinner<00:03:54.650> for

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
and I felt like I needed a spinner for

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.559 
and I felt like I needed a spinner for
that<00:03:55.010> as<00:03:55.159> well<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:55.819> this<00:03:55.970> one<00:03:56.150> here<00:03:56.359> almost

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
that as well so this one here almost

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.949 
that as well so this one here almost
weighs<00:03:56.930> nothing<00:03:57.349> compared<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.430> rest

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
weighs nothing compared to the rest

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.920 
weighs nothing compared to the rest

extremely light blade and big I can pull
it<00:04:03.079> from<00:04:03.379> a<00:04:03.470> foot<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:03.889> less<00:04:04.099> in<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.370> water<00:04:04.579> and

it from a foot and less in the water and

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.270 
it from a foot and less in the water and
I<00:04:05.870> can<00:04:06.019> get<00:04:06.169> it<00:04:06.290> up<00:04:06.379> to<00:04:06.590> about<00:04:06.709> like<00:04:06.979> an<00:04:07.129> inch

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
I can get it up to about like an inch

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.369 
I can get it up to about like an inch
from<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:07.639> surface<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.419> the<00:04:08.989> blade<00:04:09.169> just

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
from the surface and it the blade just

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.610 
from the surface and it the blade just
kicks<00:04:09.620> along<00:04:09.949> and<00:04:10.220> creates<00:04:10.579> a<00:04:10.669> nice<00:04:10.849> ripple

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
kicks along and creates a nice ripple

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.210 
kicks along and creates a nice ripple
lifelike<00:04:13.209> action<00:04:14.209> there<00:04:14.419> and<00:04:14.919> this<00:04:15.919> one<00:04:16.099> over

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
lifelike action there and this one over
