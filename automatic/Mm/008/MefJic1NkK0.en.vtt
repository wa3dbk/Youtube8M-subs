that we notionally rescued at dawn pilot

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.870 
that we notionally rescued at dawn pilot
we're<00:01:52.800> also<00:01:52.920> working<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.430> our<00:01:53.550> infantry

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
we're also working on our infantry

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.520 
we're also working on our infantry
skills<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.630> also<00:01:54.690> of<00:01:54.960> course<00:01:55.110> we're<00:01:55.350> working

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
skills and also of course we're working

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.400 
skills and also of course we're working
on<00:01:55.590> our<00:01:55.619> casts<00:01:56.270> platforms<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.509> fast<00:01:57.869> air<00:01:58.080> and

on our casts platforms with fast air and

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.870 
on our casts platforms with fast air and
then<00:01:58.950> we're<00:01:59.040> also<00:01:59.160> calling<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.670> notional

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
then we're also calling in notional

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.190 
then we're also calling in notional
artillery<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.690> it's<00:02:00.810> pretty<00:02:00.930> much<00:02:01.080> an

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
artillery so it's pretty much an

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.240 
artillery so it's pretty much an
all-around<00:02:01.590> spread<00:02:01.920> exactly<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.149> do

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.800 

there<00:02:08.250> shouldn't<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.700> any<00:02:08.970> problem<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.600> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
there shouldn't be any problem with the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.320 
there shouldn't be any problem with the
American<00:02:10.709> French<00:02:11.100> British<00:02:11.520> aircraft<00:02:11.700> helping

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.789 
out Spanish German Dutch crown troops
and<00:02:14.630> that's<00:02:15.630> working<00:02:16.110> out<00:02:16.170> pretty<00:02:16.350> well<00:02:16.470> and

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
and that's working out pretty well and

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.560 
and that's working out pretty well and
that's<00:02:17.130> basically<00:02:17.489> one<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.120> reasons

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
that's basically one of the reasons

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.470 
that's basically one of the reasons
we're<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.080> these<00:02:19.200> joint<00:02:19.709> exercises<00:02:20.480> so
