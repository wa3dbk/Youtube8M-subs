00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.929
 I hope you are doing well today 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.020
 I come back with a new dialogue 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.440
 alexis stick of the galaxy to 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.780
 bottles cdja wilde is very present 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.730
 on youtube but I really wanted the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.300
 do it because it really does not cost anything 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.539
 and I'm obsessed with the galaxy 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.480
 so if you want at the same time a one 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.010
 said soft shell to the galaxy 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.119
 comments that would really make me 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.880
 pleasure to make you a shell of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.040
 phone 1.6 but for now it's 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.040
 to say that we will do the state 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:51.390
 we will need two more 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:53.670
 different sizes with but on their 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.409
 lids you will also need to 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.059
 cotton coup I'll find at crossroads 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.629
 for 99 centimes 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:05.190
 and yes it's cheap it will also 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.619
 a lot of water and some residents and 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.170
 of course some water paint 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.890
 could take with the varnish of 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.920
 food coloring mainly 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.240
 blue and brushes and remove their game 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.890
 and of course to be so first of all we 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.500
 going to chat with a painting abound 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.500
 to cover the lid 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.299
 he 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.850
 you can use the color he 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.750
 need more to cover your lid 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.810
 and I was a little darker I 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.060
 covered a little g actually put a little 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.539
 of holy water hours that's because 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.780
 as you know very well be 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.780
 flakes 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:10.580
 first of all we will put water 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:12.860
 in our local then we will take 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.640
 our first color so I take 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:27.290
 from the acrylic paint the mix the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:29.860
 everything then filed two three happy 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.860
 here 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.940
 so much of his reception I mixed a little 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.400
 another color that approaches a little 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.690
 between green and blue we will say 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.090
 here and I added myself adding 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.400
 always cotton so that it does not 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.590
 remains almost more water we will say that 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.610
 the cotton observed all the water is 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.740
 paid to the ligato toc here so I put 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.250
 again this time you can a lot 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.250
 darker 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.060
 add almost all the time 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.319
 flakes 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.090
 then and that's adding now from 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.860
 purple and violet color 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.390
 because if there is no bubble and 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.550
 in a galaxy it's a bit weird 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.160
 it's a bit of a job starting from a 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.769
 galaxy here and of course I added 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.110
 cash and always the same 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.140
 principle by mixing the colors in 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.840
 trying to health that more or less to 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.120
 a galaxy 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.830
 then I added bronze here 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.930
 it's the same as purple if there is no 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.500
 of pink to clarify it is not too much no 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:47.180
 more so here's from this step 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.180
 actually try to actually make 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.220
 mix the colors a little between them 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.329
 we're going to say that it's a little bit like 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.510
 a galaxy 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.690
 do not hesitate in France 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.540
 is actually the stick to try to 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.700
 play with colors here is proxad a 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.000
 really a very very beautiful effect two 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.000
 galaxies 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.989
 once you are satisfied with your 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.010
 of the result you just have to close 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.639
 the jar 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.350
 it's simple so I did another 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.030
 jar on the other hand I did not make a 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.250
 galaxy but as I told you 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.990
 previously I really like pink and 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.610
 the moro rose so I wanted to do 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.440
 something a little gray rhymes 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.539
 So here I come simply due 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.880
 with pink roses a little 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.080
 pale and a little darker and 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:46.940
 golden glitter 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:50.120
 that's m 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.889
 that's what you have in the end 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.039
 so I find this diamond is really 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.660
 very very beautiful and very very very very 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.320
 very very easy to do I believe that 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.960
 all the materials we have at home 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.889
 it's obligatory so it's really perfect 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.259
 to give a touch of pep and 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.479
 grimm to his room inside 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.860
 in short I really hope it's due to 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.419
 what you will like do not hesitate to 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.330
 theme I like this video if you have it 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:23.090
 beloved at the appart aiea commented and me 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:25.610
 I tell you soon dad did not 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.349
 streaming or lively 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.349
 witnesses would have
