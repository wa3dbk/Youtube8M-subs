00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.339
 but kids here we are another video and 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:10.130
 you will see what happens to me in 90% of 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.650
 the games that I'm playing on the plate 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.030
 but the game starts and goes 15 9 in the 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.250
 moment that you have seen that you have started 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.189
 the video we play with the connection of the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.630
 guiris bbva three rods here you do not notice 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.249
 the difference because it comes out as a cinema 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.859
 he roared he had to give them 200 bullets to 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:28.189
 kill them and they also arrived three hours 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.890
 late I did not take clouds to the dogs 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.720
 They are hungry when you go 15-9 are they 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.130
 host are winning the game is 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.800
 everything of whore mother nothing else was a 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.390
 team of 4 is all very cool but one 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.860
 Once you start giving him a scene, you take off 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.290
 some gusts will be of the game 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.400
 then it does not come out profitable or put a 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.990
 swarm and it's not but it's because it's not 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.600
 you just can not use them 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.210
 most of the time not 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.040
 you're going to see now how he threw clouds at and 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.660
 once I throw clouds to the gods you 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.000
 sos call the team 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.110
 you are going to see it measured to the flag 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.880
 they play like us simply 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.320
 we were also the same and see 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.880
 where the three shots get you think 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.410
 ballet incolballet I already have the dogs and 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.999
 the swarm and in no time I stay 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.070
 here changed as you see activator where 

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:09.200
 giving move to see what they did 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.190
 I'm going to catch me, I say, my mother, I say 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.470
 here the cop 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.420
 it also comes back to me I'm 200 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.010
 It points me to throw back the gusts and 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.660
 we can make a killing of good 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.890
 things are going to see what happens uncle to the 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.950
 dogs and the gloves that threw the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.650
 Swarm always happens the same 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.409
 cable run are expected from whores 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.999
 games 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.530
 as I said the first part had it 

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.880
 that to take from the cinema the second one already I began 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.170
 to record me with the capturer but you go 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.090
 to see how the game starts 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.810
 where it ended up there you see 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.700
 so what is it that I spend a lot 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.890
 people criticize people who get out of 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.329
 the games do not get confused and I 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.759
 people who leave the games when 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.950
 enter a game started or because they 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.780
 is going bad connection or whatever it is 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.369
 completely that completely 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.259
 understandable not me too do it myself 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.659
 I put in a game that is started and 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.549
 I think there is a streak of I say my 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.409
 I'm going to eat my streak 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.849
 that they have thrown another uncle to him but not 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.530
 example in this case is one of the 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.110
 many that has happened to me of beginning the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.000
 game start the game I normal no 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.470
 us not doing a great slaughter and a 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.119
 once you get the streak that costs you the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.620
 cojones get the streak that I have 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.060
 every day do one had low of those of 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.890
 6 or how it would be a mega low or super 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.960
 low in the field are the names of 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.940
 supermarket that flips 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.560
 It has cost me the host to take it out for me 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.670
 Then, once you throw it away, they ask for 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 the game the truth that I burned 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.940
 very much but a lot of people 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.020
 question that because many times I do not go up 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.970
 many games and simply because of this 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.990
 because they are bored with balls this is 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.910
 just the only thing I do is give 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.140
 turns and people are pulled there has been a 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.610
 moment when I was one heading now 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.380
 I'm going to spend a moment on camera 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.640
 fast because you're going to see how it does not stop 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.500
 enter people and leave that that is another 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.720
 the issue was not that people entered because it was 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.830
 someone the host and let's do in 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.780
 we already the people neither enter and 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.710
 simply the enemies surrender but 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.870
 good what I told you to leave me 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.060
 the games is not always a bad thing and 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.700
 when you go out for what I know because 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.640
 you have a bad connection because 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.200
 it shows bored and if you look at yourself or because 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.880
 say do not buy me the streak of the people 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.530
 of a started game there are thousands of 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.940
 reasons but this one in particular is the 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.260
 that it's my turn to have more balls 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.550
 seen that there is a moment that is 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.920
 end of the game because the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.230
 people were obviously leaving when you play 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.580
 with a team and you give them I have taken you out 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.260
 some streaks because you stay because you're 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.610
 some streaks playing well do not notice in 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.020
 saved you have not done anything if you 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.460
 barreneche with the gusts hear then go 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.390
 the departure carrying the message loading 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.420
 in his fucking mother 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.050
 completely understandable but I try to 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.050
 finish 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.040
 I just wanted to 16 what happens to me 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.380
 I do not always know if it will happen to you 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.970
 same but good I would like that then 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.830
 put in the comments that I 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.110
 leave 6 so if you have a good time 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.910
 because I'm lately what 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.160
 that I can not I just can not like that 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.600
 that nothing kids said that while the 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.860
 comments I like favorites and you see 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.620
 I have a relax contract because I'm 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.640
 fucked from the throat and see you in the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.640
 next video goodbye
