you can take the gunsmith and get
reforged<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.609> let's<00:00:26.760> start<00:00:26.939> by<00:00:27.210> taking<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.539> look

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570

the<00:01:15.750> way<00:01:15.869> let's<00:01:16.049> talk<00:01:16.530> scopes<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.250> perks

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
the way let's talk scopes and perks

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.450 
the way let's talk scopes and perks
first<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.170> under<00:01:19.530> scopes<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> couple

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
first up under scopes you have a couple

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.280 
first up under scopes you have a couple
of<00:01:20.549> options<00:01:20.700> there's<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> quick-draw<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
of options there's the quick-draw is

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.590 
of options there's the quick-draw is
which<00:01:22.680> has<00:01:22.890> 15<00:01:23.220> points<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.549> handling<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.030> 15

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
which has 15 points and handling and 15

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.899 
which has 15 points and handling and 15
and<00:01:24.750> reload<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> red<00:01:26.340> dot<00:01:26.490> OAS

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and reload or you have the red dot OAS

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.020 
and reload or you have the red dot OAS
which<00:01:27.390> will<00:01:27.570> give<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> 0.2%<00:01:28.710> zoom<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.759> more

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
which will give you a 0.2% zoom but more

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.190 
which will give you a 0.2% zoom but more
importantly<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.720> will<00:01:30.900> increase<00:01:31.110> your

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
importantly it will increase your

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.280 
importantly it will increase your
stability<00:01:31.500> by<00:01:32.009> 14<00:01:32.549> points<00:01:32.869> now<00:01:33.869> again<00:01:33.990> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
stability by 14 points now again it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
stability by 14 points now again it
really<00:01:34.439> depends<00:01:34.829> how<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.189> plan<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.729> use<00:01:35.759> your

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
really depends how you plan to use your

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.609 
really depends how you plan to use your
fusion<00:01:36.210> rifle<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.720> what's<00:01:36.990> most<00:01:37.170> important

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
fusion rifle and what's most important

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.590 
fusion rifle and what's most important
to<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.310> I'd<00:01:38.460> usually<00:01:38.700> favor<00:01:39.119> stability

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to you but I'd usually favor stability

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.740 
to you but I'd usually favor stability
so<00:01:39.960> i'd<00:01:40.079> recommend<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.530> red<00:01:40.799> dot<00:01:41.009> OAS<00:01:41.750> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
so i'd recommend the red dot OAS and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
so i'd recommend the red dot OAS and

that this weapon already has a high aim
assist<00:02:12.239> value

assist value

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.630

that<00:02:13.380> with<00:02:13.530> better<00:02:13.709> toga<00:02:13.980> acquisition<00:02:14.490> and

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
that with better toga acquisition and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.180 
that with better toga acquisition and
you've<00:02:14.849> got<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.150> winning<00:02:15.480> recipe<00:02:16.190> they're

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
you've got a winning recipe they're

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.830 
you've got a winning recipe they're
moving<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.760> second<00:02:18.209> hook<00:02:18.330> there's

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
moving on to the second hook there's

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.449 
moving on to the second hook there's
only<00:02:18.930> really<00:02:19.200> one<00:02:19.349> thing<00:02:19.770> worth<00:02:19.980> considering

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
only really one thing worth considering

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.390 
only really one thing worth considering
and<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.390> accelerated<00:02:22.260> coils<00:02:22.620> this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
and that is accelerated coils this

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.160 
and that is accelerated coils this
reduced<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> charge<00:02:24.330> time<00:02:24.569> on<00:02:24.720> your<00:02:24.930> fusion

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
reduced the charge time on your fusion

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.930 
reduced the charge time on your fusion
rifle<00:02:25.530> which<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.160> means<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.520> can<00:02:26.670> get<00:02:26.819> your

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
rifle which just means you can get your

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.550 
rifle which just means you can get your
shot<00:02:27.120> off<00:02:27.239> that<00:02:27.390> much<00:02:27.510> quicker<00:02:27.720> which<00:02:28.410> is

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
shot off that much quicker which is

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.170 
shot off that much quicker which is
especially<00:02:29.010> useful<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.459> close-quarter

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
especially useful in close-quarter

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.930 
especially useful in close-quarter
situations<00:02:31.250> then<00:02:32.250> under<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.520> third<00:02:32.700> perk

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
situations then under the third perk

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.970 
situations then under the third perk
there's<00:02:33.330> also<00:02:33.540> really<00:02:34.020> one<00:02:34.290> main<00:02:34.560> perk<00:02:34.830> that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
there's also really one main perk that

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.940 
there's also really one main perk that
out<00:02:35.130> does<00:02:35.340> all<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.670> others<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.150> is

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
out does all the others and that is

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.620 
out does all the others and that is
rangefinder<00:02:37.950> aiming<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.760> weapon<00:02:39.090> increases

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
rangefinder aiming this weapon increases

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.199 
rangefinder aiming this weapon increases
its<00:02:39.810> effective<00:02:40.260> range<00:02:40.519> sure<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.850> could<00:02:42.030> roll

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
its effective range sure you could roll

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.610 
its effective range sure you could roll
with<00:02:42.269> something<00:02:42.599> like<00:02:42.720> knee<00:02:42.959> pads<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.500> allow

you to slide further when using this

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.699 
you to slide further when using this
weapon<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:45.720> why<00:02:45.959> would<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.200> slide<00:02:46.470> into<00:02:46.680> a

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
weapon but why would you slide into a

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.440 
weapon but why would you slide into a
kill<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.100> put<00:02:47.340> yourself<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.730> danger<00:02:47.760> when<00:02:48.390> you

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
kill and put yourself in danger when you

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.520 
kill and put yourself in danger when you
