00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:06.370
 Tell me guys, I'm here to make more 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:09.070
 A video for you there is my request. 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.280
 friend and reinaldo there that posted on your 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.690
 channel on youtube 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.240
 he was wanting to know a tip about 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.970
 or break walls as you use them 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.570
 So this video is only for that. 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.210
 I already married how to use the wall break I 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.730
 I paid to do 12 breaks walls. 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.590
 I'm using four giants and my 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.619
 Troop use is not because I use it to 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.870
 form the video of today you just talk 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.929
 about it and even how to break them 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.429
 walls and properly start even I 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.649
 I was in doubt and said that I used 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:45.309
 he breaks the wall and he always touched the pit 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.640
 I'll just show you how it's like 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:52.449
 works as love breaks its pursuits 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.469
 targets is say so seek the 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:59.190
 violet that discusses kahn came to accelerate 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.190
 in this video here 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.290
 well this is it going to be 195 elixir 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.360
 94 gold 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.120
 this village even there we earn from it as 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.140
 If you can see there, it's quite misaligned in 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.510
 totally misaligned truths 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.910
 mortars from there the tip is for who 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.130
 is now starting the mortars three 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.340
 mortars usually with them 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.300
 triangular in phase they pick up phase 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.930
 entire 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.050
 That's it folks, but I'm coming back here. 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.150
 main topic here about the envelope 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.360
 The video today will start attacking by the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.610
 right side up where we have and litchi 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.820
 and show you how the sea breaks 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.470
 it works, it 's very simple, you break it 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.420
 always going to try to attack the building 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.490
 nearest is surrounded by hills 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.130
 for example in this part that I go 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.910
 to attack only two 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.880
 medium 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.619
 it goes straight as they can see I release 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.340
 space for the cannon because the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:12.030
 cannon is is the construction and nearest 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.190
 where I am your break wall in the case 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.190
 come back again two breaks the girl he 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.290
 go straight to archers tower 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.540
 from the top because the underside of the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.540
 it is already open there so you do not need 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.390
 open space which is the last update 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.870
 super happy heaven modify this part 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.090
 make the breaks much smarter 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.490
 so they always go in my well in the middle 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.470
 of the year in the nearest building 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.650
 surrounded by walls, it does not matter if 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.849
 is a gold garbage collector if it is 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.200
 defense 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:49.980
 it always goes on the closest it is 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.110
 I will now destroy these 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.910
 garbage collectors and go to see them 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.140
 You try to destroy this torrent. 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.940
 jack it down and then release 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.000
 others break loving as you can see 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.470
 this part that is open then release 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.810
 two more breakers there he goes 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.910
 Direct way ahead today is a 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.120
 because there because the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.220
 construction is the closest construction 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.330
 is surrounded by walls all around 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.260
 open already then he 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.260
 goes right there so the tip is always 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.000
 this attention on you only breaks the mule is 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.490
 only you put it in your head it goes 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.170
 always try the way for the most 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.510
 close to walls surrounded by 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.300
 It matters to the patient whether he is 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.980
 protecting the garbage collector and collector 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.480
 gold or a cannon defense that is 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.430
 he will always break a wall free 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.650
 way to the nearest building 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.770
 that I 'm going to make a way here in this 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.480
 bottom with broken wall 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.220
 as you can see there the cannon on the side 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.140
 right was destroyed from a pause that only 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.910
 we need to see if I drop another break 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.040
 at the same place 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.950
 he will attack what he will destroy a 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.200
 wall on the left because it goes in 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.170
 direction to the cannon that is there, 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.100
 It has been destroyed over the side 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.810
 right 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.260
 we do not have to open that wall there 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.760
 then it goes straight into the left eye and 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.220
 that's it folks i hope they have 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.290
 liked the video and is there to tip 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.750
 who still did not know how the 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.870
 for those who are 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.020
 starting now 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.660
 That was one of those attacks. 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.040
 even show how we work 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.940
 I was not aiming for an attack to steal 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.460
 all right 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.480
 but since I'm here it does not have an astral 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.900
 remaining 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.870
 I'll try to steal at least chinin today. 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:47.370
 guarantees troops I used a village 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.450
 very easy to be attacked still managed 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.660
 take it all the hellish archers 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:58.650
 basic personnel and personnel, I hope 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.390
 liked the video and until the next 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.270
 Do not forget to let a laity have 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.940
