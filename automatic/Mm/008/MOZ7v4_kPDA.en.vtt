00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
of those large white devices that we've

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.819 
of those large white devices that we've
towed<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.829> several<00:00:47.160> years<00:00:48.379> this<00:00:49.379> year<00:00:49.440> we're

towed for several years this year we're

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.860 
towed for several years this year we're
going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.520> looking<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.239> kinds<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
going to be looking at all kinds of

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.930 
going to be looking at all kinds of
things<00:00:52.110> really<00:00:52.410> things<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.280> guess<00:00:53.640> kind

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
things really things that I guess kind

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.790 
things really things that I guess kind
of<00:00:54.030> interests<00:00:54.390> me<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.230> first<00:00:55.500> one<00:00:55.770> that

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
of interests me and the first one that

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.490 
of interests me and the first one that
we<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.460> tripped<00:00:56.820> over<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:58.170> little

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
we have tripped over is this little

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.299 
we have tripped over is this little
device<00:00:59.809> it's<00:01:00.809> called<00:01:01.230> you're<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> mosca<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
device it's called you're a mosca and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.299 
device it's called you're a mosca and
it's<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.359> cooker<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.080> sorts<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.890> comes<00:01:05.159> from

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it's a cooker of sorts that comes from

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.750 
it's a cooker of sorts that comes from
the<00:01:05.489> Czech<00:01:05.700> Republic<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.930> made<00:01:07.170> they're

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
the Czech Republic it's made they're

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.880 
the Czech Republic it's made they're
essentially<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.590> dim<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
essentially because in the dim and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
essentially because in the dim and
distant<00:01:11.010> past<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.880> think<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.810> Czech<00:01:13.320> people

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
distant past I think the Czech people

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.070 
distant past I think the Czech people
had<00:01:13.979> trouble<00:01:14.400> buying<00:01:14.640> things<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.540> cookers

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
had trouble buying things like cookers

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.390 
had trouble buying things like cookers
and<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.380> had<00:01:16.530> trouble<00:01:16.890> getting<00:01:17.040> good

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and they had trouble getting good

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
and they had trouble getting good
electricity<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.689> someone

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
electricity and so on and so someone

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.350 
electricity and so on and so someone
came<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> idea<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.030> little

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
came up with the idea of this little

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.880 
came up with the idea of this little
device<00:01:21.479> which<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.049> essentially<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
device which is essentially just a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.660 
device which is essentially just a
simple<00:01:23.310> pot<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:25.170> lid<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.590> includes<00:01:26.369> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
simple pot and a lid that includes a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.880 
simple pot and a lid that includes a
cooking<00:01:27.210> element<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.750> essentially<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
cooking element and essentially this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.700 
cooking element and essentially this
does<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.490> job<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.210> roasting<00:01:31.140> meals<00:01:31.409> or

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
does the job of a roasting meals or

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.520 
does the job of a roasting meals or
making<00:01:31.979> meals<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.780> go<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.290> very

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
making meals all in one go for a very

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
making meals all in one go for a very
small<00:01:34.680> amount<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.369> electricity<00:01:35.880> although<00:01:36.780> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
small amount of electricity although I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.490 
small amount of electricity although I
have<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.110> say<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.530> quite<00:01:37.770> expensive<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.490> buy

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
have to say it's quite expensive to buy

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.060 
have to say it's quite expensive to buy
we<00:01:40.070> had<00:01:40.340> our<00:01:40.490> first<00:01:40.520> test<00:01:41.180> flight<00:01:41.300> with<00:01:41.780> that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
we had our first test flight with that

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.150 
we had our first test flight with that
yesterday<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.630> we<00:01:44.630> had<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:44.930> chicken<00:01:45.860> and

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
potatoes and vegetables and they were

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.490 
potatoes and vegetables and they were
roasted<00:01:49.580> beautifully<00:01:50.150> they<00:01:50.360> tasted<00:01:50.930> nice<00:01:51.140> and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
roasted beautifully they tasted nice and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.530 
roasted beautifully they tasted nice and
they<00:01:51.979> were<00:01:52.040> properly<00:01:52.400> cooked<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.180> have<00:01:53.420> to

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
they were properly cooked so I have to

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.450 
they were properly cooked so I have to
say<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:53.930> it's<00:01:54.080> a<00:01:54.140> very<00:01:54.320> nice<00:01:54.500> at<00:01:54.680> all<00:01:54.950> we'll
