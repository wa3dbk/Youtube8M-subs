you check out the obstacles I believe
now<00:03:20.489> they<00:03:20.670> have<00:03:20.819> parking<00:03:21.329> curbs<00:03:21.660> made<00:03:22.110> out<00:03:22.260> of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
now they have parking curbs made out of

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.860 
now they have parking curbs made out of
real<00:03:22.709> super<00:03:23.190> slick<00:03:23.519> synthetic<00:03:24.120> materials<00:03:24.660> so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
real super slick synthetic materials so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.390 
real super slick synthetic materials so
those<00:03:25.140> are<00:03:25.290> really<00:03:25.410> cool<00:03:25.650> they<00:03:25.920> also<00:03:26.069> have

those are really cool they also have

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.640 
those are really cool they also have

you a few of my no comply wheels here I

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.009 
you a few of my no comply wheels here I
have<00:03:38.100> some<00:03:38.340> dual<00:03:38.519> bearing<00:03:38.850> V<00:03:39.090> sixes<00:03:39.720> they're

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
have some dual bearing V sixes they're

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.080 
have some dual bearing V sixes they're
about<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.350> size<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.829> g4<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.609> would<00:03:41.880> say

about the size of a g4 I would say

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.819 
about the size of a g4 I would say
except<00:03:42.600> they<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.870> dual<00:03:43.139> bearings<00:03:43.560> they're

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
except they have dual bearings they're

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.160 
except they have dual bearings they're
super<00:03:44.190> nice<00:03:44.370> they're<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:45.120> really<00:03:45.420> reasonably

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170

super nice they're a really reasonably
priced<00:03:46.440> for<00:03:46.620> dual<00:03:46.950> bearing<00:03:47.280> wheels<00:03:47.489> super

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
priced for dual bearing wheels super

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.729 
priced for dual bearing wheels super
smooth<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.660> is<00:03:48.720> like<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> Cadillac<00:03:49.290> here

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739

listen your now that's high pitched so

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.659 
listen your now that's high pitched so
those<00:03:54.510> are<00:03:54.690> V<00:03:54.840> sixes<00:03:55.380> oh<00:03:55.680> here<00:03:56.099> I<00:03:56.250> have<00:03:56.459> some

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
those are V sixes oh here I have some

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.819 
those are V sixes oh here I have some
minis<00:03:57.090> these<00:03:57.450> are<00:03:57.599> no<00:03:57.750> compliant<00:03:58.230> mini<00:03:58.470> wheels

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
minis these are no compliant mini wheels

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.199 
minis these are no compliant mini wheels
see<00:03:59.130> how<00:03:59.250> they're<00:03:59.430> smaller<00:03:59.730> these<00:04:00.030> are

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
see how they're smaller these are

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.849 
see how they're smaller these are
actually<00:04:00.510> dual<00:04:00.750> bearing<00:04:01.139> minis<00:04:01.500> they<00:04:01.709> also

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
actually dual bearing minis they also

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.979 
actually dual bearing minis they also
sell<00:04:02.250> single<00:04:02.579> bearing<00:04:03.000> minis<00:04:03.329> but<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.720> reason

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
sell single bearing minis but the reason

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.479 
sell single bearing minis but the reason
they're<00:04:04.109> mini<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.680> they<00:04:04.829> made<00:04:04.980> them<00:04:05.130> smaller

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
they're mini and they made them smaller

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.370 
they're mini and they made them smaller
is<00:04:05.669> because<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.540> makes<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.959> entire

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
is because it makes the entire

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.289 
is because it makes the entire
fingerboard<00:04:08.069> look<00:04:08.280> more<00:04:08.489> like<00:04:08.669> a<00:04:08.700> scaled-down

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
fingerboard look more like a scaled-down

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.089 
fingerboard look more like a scaled-down
skateboard<00:04:10.079> like<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.440> size<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.919> wheels

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
skateboard like the size of the wheels

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.129 
skateboard like the size of the wheels
in<00:04:11.400> comparison<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.299> size<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.900> deck

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
in comparison to the size of the deck

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.599 
in comparison to the size of the deck
make<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.650> look<00:04:13.799> more<00:04:13.980> like<00:04:14.040> an<00:04:14.310> actual

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
make it look more like an actual

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.729 
make it look more like an actual
scaled-down<00:04:15.180> skateboard<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.169> pretty<00:04:16.500> cool

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
scaled-down skateboard so pretty cool

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.080 
scaled-down skateboard so pretty cool
there<00:04:16.979> was<00:04:17.099> thinking<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.579> cool<00:04:17.760> stuff<00:04:18.060> like

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
there was thinking of cool stuff like

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.969 
there was thinking of cool stuff like
that<00:04:18.450> no<00:04:18.810> matter<00:04:18.959> if<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.229> like<00:04:19.380> single<00:04:19.799> or

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
that no matter if you like single or

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.620 
that no matter if you like single or
dual<00:04:20.190> bearing<00:04:20.549> wheels<00:04:20.789> you<00:04:21.180> can<00:04:21.329> get<00:04:21.479> some

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
dual bearing wheels you can get some

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.300 
dual bearing wheels you can get some
mini<00:04:21.870> spheres<00:04:22.349> some<00:04:22.530> wheels<00:04:22.710> they<00:04:22.919> made<00:04:23.099> back

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
mini spheres some wheels they made back

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.190 
mini spheres some wheels they made back
in<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.520> day<00:04:23.729> these<00:04:24.000> are<00:04:24.180> called<00:04:24.389> Biggie's<00:04:24.900> I'm
