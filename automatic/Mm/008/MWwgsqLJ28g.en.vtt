out there do 640 by 480 at 15 or 30

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.469 
out there do 640 by 480 at 15 or 30
frames<00:01:19.409> per<00:01:19.500> second<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.490> actually<00:01:21.119> does

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
frames per second this one actually does

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.950

into once they get actually get into
your<00:06:36.339> computer<00:06:36.520> and<00:06:36.880> obviously<00:06:37.449> it's<00:06:37.599> a<00:06:37.630> lot

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
your computer and obviously it's a lot

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.209 
your computer and obviously it's a lot
easier<00:06:37.930> to<00:06:38.110> just<00:06:38.289> tag<00:06:38.500> a<00:06:38.529> picture<00:06:38.919> once<00:06:39.099> you

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
easier to just tag a picture once you

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.070 
easier to just tag a picture once you
take<00:06:39.370> it<00:06:39.520> rather<00:06:39.940> than<00:06:40.120> trying<00:06:40.270> to<00:06:40.330> do<00:06:40.479> three

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
take it rather than trying to do three

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.619 
take it rather than trying to do three
at<00:06:41.860> a<00:06:41.889> time<00:06:42.129> once<00:06:42.550> you<00:06:42.729> upload<00:06:43.090> the<00:06:43.330> pictures

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:43.629 
at a time once you upload the pictures

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.320 
at a time once you upload the pictures
so<00:06:43.900> it's<00:06:44.800> a<00:06:44.889> solid<00:06:45.190> camera<00:06:45.400> very<00:06:45.909> very<00:06:46.150> nice

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
so it's a solid camera very very nice

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.999 
so it's a solid camera very very nice
it's<00:06:46.539> got<00:06:46.659> that<00:06:46.870> automatic<00:06:47.440> face<00:06:47.650> detection

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
it's got that automatic face detection

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.070 
it's got that automatic face detection
that<00:06:48.220> works<00:06:48.400> really<00:06:48.699> really<00:06:48.849> well<00:06:49.330> but<00:06:49.990> I

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
that works really really well but I

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.659 
that works really really well but I
think<00:06:50.139> one<00:06:50.409> of<00:06:50.500> the<00:06:50.590> standout<00:06:51.069> features<00:06:51.520> of

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
think one of the standout features of

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.450 
think one of the standout features of
this<00:06:52.210> is<00:06:52.419> that<00:06:52.870> high<00:06:53.139> resolution<00:06:53.349> video<00:06:53.979> mode

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
this is that high resolution video mode

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.119 
this is that high resolution video mode
so<00:06:55.389> if<00:06:55.629> you<00:06:55.720> know<00:06:55.810> this<00:06:56.169> will<00:06:56.319> actually<00:06:56.530> could

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.129 
so if you know this will actually could

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:59.909 
so if you know this will actually could
take<00:06:57.400> the<00:06:57.520> place<00:06:57.699> of<00:06:58.080> your<00:06:59.080> video<00:06:59.379> camera<00:06:59.830> if

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
take the place of your video camera if

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.809 
take the place of your video camera if
you<00:07:00.009> have<00:07:00.099> a<00:07:00.129> nice<00:07:00.400> large<00:07:02.490> memory<00:07:03.490> card<00:07:03.699> to

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:03.819 
you have a nice large memory card to

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:05.730 
you have a nice large memory card to
stick<00:07:04.000> in<00:07:04.120> this<00:07:04.240> thing<00:07:04.479> you<00:07:05.110> can<00:07:05.259> able<00:07:05.680> to

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
stick in this thing you can able to

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.950 
stick in this thing you can able to
record<00:07:06.039> lots<00:07:06.310> of<00:07:06.550> extraordinarily<00:07:07.210> high

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
record lots of extraordinarily high

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.529 
record lots of extraordinarily high
quality<00:07:08.759> HD<00:07:09.759> video<00:07:10.090> with<00:07:10.419> the<00:07:10.900> codec<00:07:12.030> m109<00:07:13.030> 3

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:13.539 
quality HD video with the codec m109 3

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:16.080 
quality HD video with the codec m109 3
so<00:07:14.110> it's<00:07:14.349> a<00:07:14.409> very<00:07:14.590> very<00:07:14.710> solidly<00:07:15.340> built<00:07:15.669> camera

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
so it's a very very solidly built camera

so it's a very very solidly built camera
it's<00:07:16.180> got<00:07:16.270> a<00:07:16.330> very<00:07:16.750> very<00:07:16.810> nice<00:07:17.289> glass<00:07:17.710> lens<00:07:18.069> in
