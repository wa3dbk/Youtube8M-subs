the next level and commitment between

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.270 
the next level and commitment between
objects<00:00:06.120> it's<00:00:06.990> more<00:00:07.259> significant<00:00:07.799> commitment

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
objects it's more significant commitment

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.600 
objects it's more significant commitment

specific<00:00:25.170> menu<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.070> we're<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> call

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
specific menu and we're going to call

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.650 
specific menu and we're going to call
this<00:00:28.429> group<00:00:29.429> things<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.949> say<00:00:32.160> ok<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.759> now

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
this group things and you say ok and now

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.080 
this group things and you say ok and now
the<00:00:33.719> group<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.110> created<00:00:34.670> you'll<00:00:35.670> notice<00:00:35.940> that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the group is created you'll notice that

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.750 
the group is created you'll notice that
this<00:00:37.050> group<00:00:37.380> looks<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.980> little<00:00:38.129> different<00:00:38.340> than

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
this group looks a little different than

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.630 
this group looks a little different than
the<00:00:38.879> selection<00:00:39.329> set<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:39.809> had<00:00:39.960> earlier

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
the selection set that we had earlier

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.930 
the selection set that we had earlier
for<00:00:41.640> example<00:00:42.559> you'll<00:00:43.559> notice<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.190> first<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
for example you'll notice that first of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.119 
for example you'll notice that first of
all<00:00:45.090> there's<00:00:45.329> one<00:00:45.539> bounding<00:00:46.020> box<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.980> all

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
all there's one bounding box for all

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.369 
all there's one bounding box for all
four<00:00:47.399> objects<00:00:47.910> where<00:00:48.239> before<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
four objects where before in the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.740 
four objects where before in the
selection<00:00:49.710> set<00:00:50.100> there<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:51.030> an<00:00:51.239> individual

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
selection set there was an individual

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.260 
selection set there was an individual
bounding<00:00:52.140> box<00:00:52.520> you'll<00:00:53.520> also<00:00:53.699> notice<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
bounding box you'll also notice that

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
bounding box you'll also notice that
there<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.719> only<00:00:54.750> one<00:00:55.170> pivot<00:00:55.500> point<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:55.890> this

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
there is only one pivot point for this

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.369 
there is only one pivot point for this
object<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.210> even<00:00:57.570> though<00:00:57.600> these<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.050> for

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
object so even though these are for

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.260 
object so even though these are for
explicitly<00:00:59.219> different<00:00:59.609> objects<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.180> are

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
explicitly different objects that are

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.860 
explicitly different objects that are
now<00:01:00.359> treated<00:01:00.840> as<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.410> single<00:01:01.770> object<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:03.840> can

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
now treated as one single object you can

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.969 
now treated as one single object you can
still<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> modify<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.610> adjust<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
still go in and modify and adjust the

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.250 
still go in and modify and adjust the
individual<00:01:07.979> objects<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:09.450> example<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.140> go

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
individual objects for example if we go

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
individual objects for example if we go
to<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> group<00:01:10.740> drop-down<00:01:11.189> menu<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.640> choose

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
to the group drop-down menu and choose

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.890 
to the group drop-down menu and choose
open<00:01:12.979> we<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.100> now<00:01:14.310> our<00:01:15.060> bounding<00:01:15.420> box<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.780> now

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
open we are now our bounding box is now

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.890 
open we are now our bounding box is now
turned<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.439> pink<00:01:16.770> box<00:01:17.119> we<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:18.420> select

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
turned into a pink box we can now select

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.870 
turned into a pink box we can now select
the<00:01:19.200> object<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:19.950> example<00:01:20.369> let's<00:01:20.400> say<00:01:20.729> we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the object and for example let's say we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.469 
the object and for example let's say we
wanted<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.180> animate<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.869> object<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:23.150> can<00:01:24.150> go

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
wanted to animate this object I can go

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.260 
wanted to animate this object I can go
in<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.220> I'll<00:01:26.220> choose<00:01:26.460> my<00:01:26.490> rotate<00:01:27.030> tool

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
in here and I'll choose my rotate tool

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.660 
in here and I'll choose my rotate tool
and<00:01:28.939> i'll<00:01:29.939> animate<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.540> object<00:01:31.400> perhaps<00:01:32.400> we

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
and i'll animate that object perhaps we

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.840 
and i'll animate that object perhaps we
want<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> animate<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.509> object<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.110> well<00:01:35.150> and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
want to animate this object as well and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.399 
want to animate this object as well and
we'll<00:01:38.850> turn<00:01:39.030> off<00:01:39.210> our<00:01:39.360> animation<00:01:39.900> tool<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
we'll turn off our animation tool and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.170 
we'll turn off our animation tool and
perhaps<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.130> want<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.460> change<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.970> size

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
perhaps we just want to change the size

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
perhaps we just want to change the size
of<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.750> object<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:45.110> can<00:01:46.110> still<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.740> do

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
of this object I can still go in and do

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.660 
of this object I can still go in and do
those<00:01:47.100> things<00:01:47.399> independently<00:01:49.430> but<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.549> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
those things independently but if I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.960 
those things independently but if I
close<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.210> group<00:01:52.250> turn<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.369> my<00:01:53.520> animate

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
close the group turn on my animate

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.050 
close the group turn on my animate
button<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.560> you'll<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.770> first<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.250> all<00:01:56.430> we

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
button and you'll see first of all we

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.499 
button and you'll see first of all we
still<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:57.570> those<00:01:57.719> individual<00:01:58.350> objects

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
still have those individual objects

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.260 
still have those individual objects
performing<00:02:00.509> their<00:02:00.659> functions<00:02:01.939> but<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.000> can

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
performing their functions but I can

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.050 
performing their functions but I can
also<00:02:03.770> treat<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.979> object<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> single

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
also treat this object as a single

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.779 
also treat this object as a single
object<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:07.039> in<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.129> case<00:02:08.399> I'll<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.759> a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
object and in this case I'll do a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.110 
object and in this case I'll do a
rotation<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:10.860> when<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> playback<00:02:11.910> my

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
rotation so now when I playback my

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.720 
rotation so now when I playback my
animation

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
animation

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.130 
animation
we<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:14.849> objects<00:02:15.480> still<00:02:15.689> doing<00:02:15.959> their<00:02:16.109> own

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
we have objects still doing their own

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.160
