have<00:04:25.460> done<00:04:25.640> before<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.750> it's<00:04:26.990> because

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
have done before and it's because

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.860 
have done before and it's because
there's<00:04:27.920> a<00:04:28.010> lot<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.250> new<00:04:28.610> innovation<00:04:29.270> driving

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
there's a lot of new innovation driving

there's a lot of new innovation driving
it<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:31.520> starts<00:04:31.910> with<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.270> new<00:04:32.420> dual-core<00:04:32.990> a5

it it starts with the new dual-core a5

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.650 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5
chip<00:04:33.860> that's<00:04:34.250> added<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.670> lot<00:04:34.910> more<00:04:35.090> speed<00:04:35.420> to

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
chip that's added a lot more speed to

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.130 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the
place<00:04:43.700> we've<00:04:43.940> made<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.240> biggest<00:04:44.510> chunk<00:04:44.930> is

to nine times faster
you'll<00:04:49.849> really<00:04:50.180> notice<00:04:50.449> this<00:04:50.780> in<00:04:50.990> games<00:04:51.289> and

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
you'll really notice this in games and

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.339 
you'll really notice this in games and
apps<00:04:52.009> that<00:04:52.250> use<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.400> lot<00:04:52.669> of<00:04:52.699> video<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:53.240> for<00:04:54.199> the

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
apps that use a lot of video and for the

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.499 
apps that use a lot of video and for the
first<00:04:54.530> time<00:04:54.830> we<00:04:55.280> built<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.639> gyro<00:04:56.090> into<00:04:56.389> this

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
first time we built the gyro into this

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.050 
first time we built the gyro into this
on<00:04:56.750> pad<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.860> gives<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.280> very<00:04:58.610> precise

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
on pad that gives you very precise

on pad that gives you very precise
control<00:04:59.660> in<00:04:59.870> multiple<00:05:00.500> dimensions<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:01.310> it

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
control in multiple dimensions and it

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.580 
control in multiple dimensions and it
allows<00:05:01.849> us<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.509> really<00:05:02.810> measure<00:05:03.229> the

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
allows us to really measure the

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.760 
allows us to really measure the

new<00:05:07.039> components<00:05:07.669> and<00:05:07.789> features<00:05:07.970> add<00:05:08.449> all

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
new components and features add all

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.140 
new components and features add all

kinds of possibilities when it comes to
apps<00:05:11.300> and<00:05:11.630> even<00:05:12.500> though<00:05:12.620> we<00:05:12.770> boosted<00:05:13.190> the

apps and even though we boosted the

the<00:05:36.530> original<00:05:37.040> iPad<00:05:37.540> defined<00:05:38.540> a<00:05:38.750> category<00:05:39.350> and

the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.640 
the original iPad defined a category and
