00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:15.709
 hello everyone with you fil and today I tell you 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.510
 talk about the collector's edition of the game 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.760
 hitman absolution 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.980
 as you might guess not ours 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.350
 Russian aa overseas in which 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.029
 entered twenty-five centimeter 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.740
 the hitman figure itself and i wont 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.460
 hesitate and perhaps immediately proceed to 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.399
 The overview box is quite large, but not 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.510
 expected it to be a little smaller but in 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.969
 principle sizes and 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.460
 I was satisfied and I can see that 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.710
 the box is made in principle very much 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.559
 beautiful that is through a special 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.760
 big window we can see the figure 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.219
 hitman himself 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.850
 which looks like i must say very even 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:01.569
 not bad and now I'll show it to you in all 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.580
 details but first show you 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:06.700
 the back of the box will cause it 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.920
 actually this way 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.860
 So open and keep the wheel and 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 really good want a price I would 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.540
 so not drowned so first thing we 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.010
 we get two mufflers 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:28.280
 why do I need them I will tell you a little 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:30.110
 later, and strange as it may, I'll start with 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.780
 zest of this edition is the very 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.680
 a figurine and then we'll see the game itself 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.070
 and so the figure looks like this 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.590
 say very beautiful well, 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.700
 silencer as you might have guessed 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.840
 inserted in the gun and 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.830
 rather than quite pretty tight 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.950
 enters and 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:57.490
 and will not break longer and will not fall out of 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.580
 nominations of this figure is that 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.479
 gun and very easy to bend and and as well 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.690
 times right the hitman's gun or and if 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.420
 Seen from this side just yet 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.540
 hollowed out could also be given his 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.870
 pistol 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.810
 part of this did not happen in principle 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.740
 I figure this is very pleased 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.810
 beautifully weighty and on the shelf will be 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.600
 look very good that is 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.030
 if hitman fans is such a figure 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.050
 I think there should be your collections 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.440
 surely 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.630
 so perhaps I will leave my friend 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.360
 hitman and get the box itself with the game 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.690
 which looks like this and 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.959
 different from ours so that is in the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.360
 durable cardboard which of course 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.820
 did better than our Russian edition 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.560
 so open and see first thing 9 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.730
 box 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.010
 open and see the game disc under 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.130
 which is a second game disc 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.790
 that is, home installation disk and 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.880
 Additional materials 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.760
 burn in home and is at the bottom 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.019
 here in this here piles of disks I will remind 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.510
 what is the Russian edition 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.320
 the disc is put in a separate envelope that 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.510
 by the way it looks too bad look 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.090
 that's the way he unfortunately 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.810
 black and white and just a few 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.600
 page oldies offhand somewhere on 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.980
 57 behind it is written in the steam key which I 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.630
 you will not shoot 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.780
 then comes dlc so that's pretty 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.310
 beautiful piece of paper she looks like this and 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.070
 rear advertising 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.090
 hitman costume for sleeping dogs 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:54.480
 and finally the last piece of paper in the boxing world 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.209
 this is a product registration card 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.950
 it looks like this and something 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.980
 similar was in our Russian edition 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.890
 kane &amp; lynch 2 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:09.420
 Well, finally, the last leaflet is dlc 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.320
 adrension gun pack dlc 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.959
 that is , the agencyâ€™s weapon set 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.200
 Russian edition is exactly the same fox. 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.549
 attended last 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.550
 parts of the building 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.460
 this artbook artbook 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.360
 Fortunately made in hardcover 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.430
 squeeze it very beautiful 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.800
 there is a huge amount here 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.860
 exclusive art that you used to be 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 probably have not seen anywhere and tell us 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.020
 that artbook is very plump and I 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.659
 I think that all fans and not only 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.330
 fans he will definitely be interested 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.340
 by the way in the course of this review I often 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.060
 mentioned our Russian edition hitman 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.060
 absolution 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.740
 Well, this did not show melon show but 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.509

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.300
 new before this edition can say that 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.969
 it is worth buying 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.430
 every fan of this game but not for such 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:15.599
 great price that is 3,500 rubles for it 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.629
 really very expensive cost to it in 2000 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.879
 and 2500 rubles I would buy you the very first 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:22.860
 day did not think well, and so to me 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.440
 I had to wait a whole year to buy 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.900
 his uk for some there 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.509
