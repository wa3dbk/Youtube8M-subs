there<00:00:27.070> are<00:00:27.189> more<00:00:27.400> cleanings<00:00:27.910> I<00:00:28.029> found<00:00:28.419> from<00:00:28.570> my

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
there are more cleanings I found from my

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.720 
there are more cleanings I found from my
experience<00:00:29.109> should<00:00:29.320> be<00:00:29.470> done<00:00:29.679> every<00:00:30.009> 50,000

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
experience should be done every 50,000

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.339 
experience should be done every 50,000
kilometers<00:00:30.820> or<00:00:31.210> more<00:00:31.300> every<00:00:31.539> 30,000<00:00:32.200> miles

kilometers or more every 30,000 miles

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.650 
kilometers or more every 30,000 miles
and<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.770> reason<00:00:33.070> why<00:00:33.190> is<00:00:33.250> that<00:00:33.660> generally

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
and the reason why is that generally

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.570 
and the reason why is that generally
speaking<00:00:34.690> there's<00:00:35.140> a<00:00:35.230> lot<00:00:35.380> of<00:00:35.500> trash<00:00:36.010> and<00:00:36.310> oil

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
speaking there's a lot of trash and oil

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.920 
speaking there's a lot of trash and oil
that<00:00:36.790> blow<00:00:37.000> bond<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.330> can<00:00:37.450> build<00:00:37.600> up<00:00:37.780> on<00:00:37.900> your

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
that blow bond that can build up on your

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.140 
that blow bond that can build up on your
backside<00:00:38.680> of<00:00:38.770> your<00:00:38.800> throttle<00:00:39.220> plate<00:00:39.430> causing

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
backside of your throttle plate causing

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.900 
backside of your throttle plate causing
your<00:00:40.690> engine<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.530> not<00:00:42.040> perform<00:00:42.310> at<00:00:42.640> its<00:00:42.670> very

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
your engine to not perform at its very

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.270 
your engine to not perform at its very

throttle body looks like and basically

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.129 
throttle body looks like and basically
and<00:01:36.399> you<00:01:36.819> can<00:01:36.939> tell<00:01:37.179> here<00:01:37.479> that<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.810> throttle

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:38.139 
and you can tell here that the throttle

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.660 
and you can tell here that the throttle
plate<00:01:38.229> already<00:01:38.560> has<00:01:38.740> quite<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.009> bit<00:01:39.189> of<00:01:39.280> carbon

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.090 
plate already has quite a bit of carbon
buildup<00:01:39.999> as<00:01:40.179> sort<00:01:40.899> of<00:01:40.960> seen<00:01:41.200> by<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.439> edges<00:01:41.950> of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
buildup as sort of seen by the edges of

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.059 
buildup as sort of seen by the edges of
that<00:01:42.130> brass<00:01:42.639> color<00:01:42.969> plate<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.659> so<00:01:44.469> what<00:01:44.920> we're

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
that brass color plate and so what we're

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:46.080

use<00:01:52.060> we're<00:01:52.780> basically<00:01:53.049> just<00:01:53.229> going<00:01:53.439> to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
use we're basically just going to

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.649 
use we're basically just going to
saturate<00:01:54.100> this<00:01:54.249> throat<00:01:54.579> area<00:01:54.789> with<00:01:55.450> the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
saturate this throat area with the

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.539 
saturate this throat area with the
cleaner<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.259> that<00:01:56.289> also<00:01:56.920> opened<00:01:57.340> up<00:01:57.429> the

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
cleaner and that also opened up the

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.349 
cleaner and that also opened up the
plate<00:01:57.789> to<00:01:58.289> spray<00:01:59.289> clean<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.909> throttle<00:02:01.270> plate

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
plate to spray clean the throttle plate

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.919 
plate to spray clean the throttle plate
properly

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
properly

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.080 
properly
now<00:02:02.439> you're<00:02:02.829> wondering<00:02:03.219> how<00:02:03.399> we<00:02:03.459> open<00:02:03.880> up<00:02:03.909> the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
now you're wondering how we open up the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.269 
now you're wondering how we open up the
throttle<00:02:04.299> plate<00:02:04.539> well<00:02:04.899> now<00:02:05.619> there's<00:02:05.889> one<00:02:06.159> of

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:06.279 
throttle plate well now there's one of

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.679 
throttle plate well now there's one of
two<00:02:06.490> ways<00:02:06.639> that<00:02:06.819> you<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:06.969> actually<00:02:07.389> do<00:02:07.509> this

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
two ways that you can actually do this

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.419 
two ways that you can actually do this
and<00:02:07.959> one<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.289> them<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.619> get<00:02:08.770> an<00:02:08.860> assistant

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
and one of them is to get an assistant

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.340 
and one of them is to get an assistant
to<00:02:09.640> go<00:02:10.000> inside<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.420> vehicle<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.929> step<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.260> the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
to go inside the vehicle to step in the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.880 
to go inside the vehicle to step in the
gas

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
gas

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.250 
gas
to<00:02:12.190> open<00:02:12.400> up<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.730> plate<00:02:12.970> or<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.420> can<00:02:14.080> simply

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
to open up the plate or you can simply

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.310 
to open up the plate or you can simply
do<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.590> yourself<00:02:14.950> by<00:02:15.510> ever<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.780> carefully

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
do it yourself by ever so carefully

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.280 
do it yourself by ever so carefully
pushing<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.880> or<00:02:19.240> pulling<00:02:19.840> sorry<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:22.360> cable
