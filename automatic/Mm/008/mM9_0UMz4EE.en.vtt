00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
be a train because most trains usually

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.319 
be a train because most trains usually
have<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> little<00:00:50.309> thing<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.610> attaches<00:00:51.030> it

like<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.990> headpiece<00:02:21.350> right<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.100> just<00:02:22.130> think

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
like the headpiece right I just think

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.400 
like the headpiece right I just think
the<00:02:22.520> headpiece<00:02:22.880> should<00:02:23.090> maybe<00:02:23.930> be<00:02:24.230> with

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
the headpiece should maybe be with

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.250 
the headpiece should maybe be with
different<00:02:25.400> hair<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.940> do<00:02:26.209> like<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.690> ruffle<00:02:27.080> but

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260

again<00:02:27.440> with<00:02:27.530> different<00:02:27.860> hair<00:02:28.070> I<00:02:28.310> think<00:02:28.430> that

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
again with different hair I think that

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.990 
again with different hair I think that
the<00:02:28.880> hair<00:02:29.060> choice<00:02:29.300> probably<00:02:29.810> lays<00:02:30.320> this

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
the hair choice probably lays this

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.680 
the hair choice probably lays this
