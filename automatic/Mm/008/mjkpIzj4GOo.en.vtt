probably<00:01:34.500> SUVs<00:01:35.130> too<00:01:36.170> yeah<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> mean<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.740> good

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
probably SUVs too yeah I mean it's good

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.410 
probably SUVs too yeah I mean it's good
for<00:01:38.430> him<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.729> he's<00:01:38.820> actually<00:01:38.939> doing<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
for him that he's actually doing the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.580 
for him that he's actually doing the
correct<00:01:39.689> thing<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.869> hold<00:01:40.110> off<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.380> bill

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
correct thing to hold off this bill

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
correct thing to hold off this bill
because<00:01:40.770> obviously<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> had<00:01:41.460> well<00:01:41.880> you

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
because obviously if you had well you

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.249 
because obviously if you had well you
wouldn't<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.210> speed<00:01:42.540> up<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:42.990> he<00:01:43.079> has<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
wouldn't have speed up but if he has a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.740 
wouldn't have speed up but if he has a
bunch<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.649> links<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:44.009> before<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.450> Marines

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
bunch of links up before the Marines

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.910 
bunch of links up before the Marines
ready<00:01:45.960> obviously<00:01:46.110> will<00:01:46.409> be<00:01:46.500> very<00:01:46.740> nice<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
ready obviously will be very nice to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.289 
ready obviously will be very nice to
Shannon<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.430> him<00:01:47.520> he<00:01:47.700> should<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.030> able<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.240> be

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
sent to a little look it's a the bottom

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.600 
sent to a little look it's a the bottom
of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> ramp<00:01:54.390> where<00:01:54.659> say<00:01:55.200> they<00:01:55.350> can't<00:01:55.619> be

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
of the ramp where say they can't be

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.100 
of the ramp where say they can't be
really<00:01:57.000> attacked<00:01:57.329> whether<00:01:57.719> i<00:01:57.750> should<00:01:57.810> say

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
really attacked whether i should say

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.810 
really attacked whether i should say
shielded<00:01:58.469> by<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.649> bunker<00:01:58.979> even<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.729> you

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
shielded by the bunker even if you

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.010 
shielded by the bunker even if you
scared<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.600> very<00:02:00.750> hard<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.899> hold

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
scared but that can be very hard to hold

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.319 
scared but that can be very hard to hold
off<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.490> stuff<00:02:02.670> wouldn't<00:02:02.939> see<00:02:03.119> what

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
off but the stuff wouldn't see what

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.240 
off but the stuff wouldn't see what
exactly<00:02:03.869> does<00:02:04.020> happen<00:02:04.259> as<00:02:04.500> our<00:02:04.619> first<00:02:04.890> rain<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250

exactly does happen as our first rain is
just<00:02:05.280> popped<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> make<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> drunk<00:02:07.110> ill

just popped out and make it a drunk ill

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.169 
just popped out and make it a drunk ill

zerglings four circles coming out it's
going<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:16.910> be<00:02:17.060> forced<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.420> pull<00:02:17.569> drones<00:02:17.840> here

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
going to be forced to pull drones here

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.530 
going to be forced to pull drones here
two<00:02:18.230> SUVs<00:02:18.950> one<00:02:19.129> marine<00:02:19.340> up<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.610> ramp<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:19.879> he's

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
two SUVs one marine up the ramp and he's

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.880 
two SUVs one marine up the ramp and he's
just<00:02:20.629> going<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.840> keep<00:02:20.959> these<00:02:21.230> drones<00:02:21.500> away

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
just going to keep these drones away

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.880 
just going to keep these drones away
from<00:02:22.370> mining<00:02:22.580> for<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.760> time<00:02:22.910> being<00:02:23.890> yeah

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
from mining for the time being yeah

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.140 
from mining for the time being yeah
another<00:02:25.400> key<00:02:25.580> thing<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.849> note<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.030> that

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
another key thing to note is that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.390 
another key thing to note is that
obviously<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.170> tracks<00:02:27.890> pressure<00:02:28.099> can't

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
obviously the tracks pressure can't

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.759 
obviously the tracks pressure can't
really<00:02:28.700> kill<00:02:29.599> a<00:02:29.780> natural<00:02:30.140> expansion<00:02:30.440> this

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
really kill a natural expansion this

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:31.990 
really kill a natural expansion this
game<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.250> that's<00:02:31.400> all<00:02:31.489> right<00:02:31.549> nothing<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.910> as

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
game so that's all right nothing to as

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.520 
game so that's all right nothing to as
much<00:02:32.090> too<00:02:32.239> much<00:02:32.360> as<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.540> could<00:02:32.660> have<00:02:32.720> done<00:02:32.930> but

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
much too much as it could have done but

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.900 
much too much as it could have done but
I'll<00:02:33.739> just<00:02:33.799> have<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.040> wait<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.220> see<00:02:34.370> what<00:02:34.730> can

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
I'll just have to wait and see what can

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.690 
I'll just have to wait and see what can
I<00:02:34.940> really<00:02:35.330> do<00:02:35.569> off<00:02:35.810> one<00:02:36.440> base<00:02:36.650> in<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.099> sort<00:02:37.670> of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
I really do off one base in this sort of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.800 
I really do off one base in this sort of
map<00:02:37.879> not<00:02:38.540> as<00:02:38.780> much<00:02:39.290> as<00:02:39.349> I'd<00:02:39.560> like<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.769> sir<00:02:40.660> we<00:02:41.660> do

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
map not as much as I'd like to sir we do

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.720 
map not as much as I'd like to sir we do
see<00:02:41.959> an<00:02:42.019> overlord<00:02:42.530> not<00:02:42.890> going<00:02:43.099> to<00:02:43.160> go<00:02:43.250> down<00:02:43.400> so

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
see an overlord not going to go down so

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.190 
see an overlord not going to go down so
I<00:02:43.760> guess<00:02:44.060> receptor<00:02:44.690> wait<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.019> see<00:02:45.110> what

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
I guess receptor wait and see what

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.839 
I guess receptor wait and see what
happens<00:02:45.410> as<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.620> Marines<00:02:45.860> are<00:02:46.010> looking<00:02:46.700> like

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
happens as the Marines are looking like

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.880 
happens as the Marines are looking like
they<00:02:47.000> could<00:02:47.150> push<00:02:47.299> up<00:02:47.420> at<00:02:47.510> any<00:02:47.630> moment<00:02:47.890> yeah

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
they could push up at any moment yeah

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.410 
they could push up at any moment yeah
they're<00:02:49.130> getting<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.459> really<00:02:50.000> close<00:02:50.239> you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
they're getting it really close you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.809 
they're getting it really close you
still<00:02:50.630> pumped<00:02:50.870> those<00:02:50.989> Marines<00:02:51.319> out<00:02:51.500> and

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
still pumped those Marines out and

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.039 
still pumped those Marines out and
circlings<00:02:52.819> are<00:02:52.940> kind<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.239> poking<00:02:53.989> around

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
circlings are kind of poking around

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.780 
circlings are kind of poking around
using<00:02:54.319> those<00:02:54.440> SUVs<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:55.040> vision<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.549> get<00:02:55.670> some

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
using those SUVs for vision to get some

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.850 
using those SUVs for vision to get some
shots<00:02:56.000> off<00:02:56.239> on<00:02:56.510> those<00:02:56.750> circlings<00:02:57.200> speed<00:02:57.739> is

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
shots off on those circlings speed is

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.410 
shots off on those circlings speed is
about<00:02:58.099> halfway<00:02:58.519> finish<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.150> it's<00:02:59.269> kind<00:02:59.390> of

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
about halfway finish so it's kind of

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.910 
about halfway finish so it's kind of
buying<00:02:59.660> times<00:02:59.900> until<00:03:00.170> until<00:03:00.379> speed<00:03:00.829> is

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
buying times until until speed is

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.960 
buying times until until speed is
finished<00:03:01.220> it's<00:03:01.340> gonna<00:03:01.459> let<00:03:01.579> him<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.730> do<00:03:01.819> some

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
finished it's gonna let him to do some

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.390 
finished it's gonna let him to do some
counter<00:03:02.239> attacks<00:03:02.769> but<00:03:03.769> that<00:03:03.890> way<00:03:04.010> you'll<00:03:04.250> so

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
counter attacks but that way you'll so

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.119 
counter attacks but that way you'll so
finish<00:03:04.700> yet<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:06.470> also<00:03:06.590> do<00:03:06.799> see<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.040> the

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
finish yet and you also do see that the

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.589 
finish yet and you also do see that the
Marines<00:03:07.370> are<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.700> mean<00:03:08.090> that's<00:03:08.209> what<00:03:08.450> what<00:03:08.569> I

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
Marines are I mean that's what what I

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.210 
Marines are I mean that's what what I
can't<00:03:08.840> get<00:03:09.019> surrounded<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.620> there<00:03:09.920> goes<00:03:10.099> the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
can't get surrounded and there goes the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.030 
can't get surrounded and there goes the
bunker<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.750> try<00:03:12.349> build<00:03:12.560> another<00:03:12.739> one<00:03:12.829> goes

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
bunker and try build another one goes

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.430 
bunker and try build another one goes
again<00:03:13.629> he<00:03:14.629> is<00:03:14.690> trying<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:14.959> work<00:03:15.019> his<00:03:15.110> way<00:03:15.260> in

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
again he is trying to work his way in

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.080 
again he is trying to work his way in
here<00:03:15.560> very<00:03:15.829> slowly<00:03:16.129> so<00:03:16.430> i<00:03:16.730> can<00:03:16.880> throw<00:03:17.060> up

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
here very slowly so i can throw up

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.680 
here very slowly so i can throw up
another<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.630> bunker<00:03:19.120> Eddie<00:03:20.120> with<00:03:20.269> about<00:03:20.420> 400

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
another a bunker Eddie with about 400

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.690 
another a bunker Eddie with about 400
minerals<00:03:21.290> noodle<00:03:21.500> stuff<00:03:21.680> I'm<00:03:22.220> trying<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.549> make

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
minerals noodle stuff I'm trying to make

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.280 
minerals noodle stuff I'm trying to make
as<00:03:22.790> many<00:03:22.970> drones<00:03:23.209> or<00:03:23.389> a<00:03:23.480> sort<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.720> zerglings<00:03:24.049> as

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
as many drones or a sort of zerglings as

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.940 
as many drones or a sort of zerglings as
possible<00:03:25.810> hey<00:03:26.810> good<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.709> nice<00:03:27.829> position

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
possible hey good so in a nice position

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.289 
possible hey good so in a nice position
that<00:03:28.310> even<00:03:28.400> if<00:03:28.609> he<00:03:28.700> doesn't<00:03:28.849> count<00:03:29.060> that

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
that even if he doesn't count that

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.610 
that even if he doesn't count that
bunker<00:03:29.630> where<00:03:29.810> obviously<00:03:30.109> can't<00:03:30.560> be

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
bunker where obviously can't be

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.890 
bunker where obviously can't be
surrounded<00:03:31.130> by<00:03:31.370> those<00:03:31.730> leggings<00:03:32.060> was<00:03:32.329> only<00:03:32.870> a

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
surrounded by those leggings was only a

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.319 
surrounded by those leggings was only a
small<00:03:33.139> truck<00:03:33.349> is<00:03:33.500> open<00:03:33.799> so<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.310> suspect<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.120> at

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
small truck is open so I suspect that at

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.640 
small truck is open so I suspect that at
least<00:03:35.450> one<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.690> these<00:03:35.840> bunkers<00:03:36.170> will<00:03:36.319> complete

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
least one of these bunkers will complete

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.379 
least one of these bunkers will complete
yeah<00:03:37.430> looks<00:03:37.609> like<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.760> back<00:03:37.970> one<00:03:38.120> is<00:03:38.209> going<00:03:38.239> to

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
yeah looks like the back one is going to

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.789 
yeah looks like the back one is going to
finish<00:03:38.510> looks<00:03:38.840> like<00:03:38.959> speed<00:03:39.200> is<00:03:39.319> finished<00:03:39.680> and

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
finish looks like speed is finished and

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.680 
finish looks like speed is finished and
editors<00:03:40.069> gonna<00:03:40.190> tank<00:03:41.090> with<00:03:41.209> this<00:03:41.329> Queen<00:03:41.540> and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
editors gonna tank with this Queen and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.440 
editors gonna tank with this Queen and
maybe<00:03:41.810> run<00:03:42.049> in<00:03:42.139> there<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:43.060> yep<00:03:44.060> now<00:03:44.209> he's<00:03:44.329> going

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
maybe run in there I yep now he's going

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.370 
maybe run in there I yep now he's going
to<00:03:44.510> go<00:03:44.569> in<00:03:44.660> there<00:03:44.780> but<00:03:44.870> it<00:03:44.989> looks<00:03:45.109> like<00:03:45.169> his

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
to go in there but it looks like his

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.539 
to go in there but it looks like his
pretty<00:03:45.560> good<00:03:45.739> positioning<00:03:46.099> from<00:03:46.250> Richmond

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
pretty good positioning from Richmond

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.770 
pretty good positioning from Richmond
certainly<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.120> only<00:03:47.209> talking<00:03:47.419> about<00:03:47.510> two<00:03:47.720> or

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
certainly is only talking about two or

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.120 
certainly is only talking about two or
three<00:03:47.870> units<00:03:48.109> bunker<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:48.560> finished<00:03:48.889> he's<00:03:49.010> not

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
three units bunker is finished he's not

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.379 
three units bunker is finished he's not
pulling<00:03:49.310> drones<00:03:49.609> queen<00:03:49.880> is<00:03:50.030> dealing<00:03:50.269> damage

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
pulling drones queen is dealing damage

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.300 
pulling drones queen is dealing damage
to<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:50.660> bunker<00:03:51.079> that's<00:03:51.560> not<00:03:51.799> even<00:03:51.829> finished

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
to that bunker that's not even finished

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.250 
to that bunker that's not even finished
being<00:03:52.459> built<00:03:52.669> for<00:03:52.910> Marines<00:03:53.150> editor's<00:03:53.989> losing

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.710 
being built for Marines editor's losing
all<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.500> his<00:03:54.680> circling<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:56.299> intro<00:03:56.540> I

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
all of his circling and the intro I

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.120 
all of his circling and the intro I
don't<00:03:56.930> understand<00:03:57.230> he<00:03:57.349> should<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:57.739> really

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
don't understand he should have really

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.009 
don't understand he should have really
pulled<00:03:58.370> why<00:03:58.549> trulia<00:03:59.150> when<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.359> bugs<00:03:59.510> complete

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
pulled why trulia when the bugs complete

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.080 
pulled why trulia when the bugs complete
what<00:04:00.230> he's<00:04:00.349> got<00:04:00.500> this<00:04:00.620> around<00:04:00.859> there<00:04:01.090> surely

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
what he's got this around there surely

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.970 
what he's got this around there surely
he<00:04:02.660> should<00:04:02.840> actually<00:04:02.959> pull<00:04:03.500> his<00:04:03.650> legs<00:04:03.829> away

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
he should actually pull his legs away

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.650 
he should actually pull his legs away
and<00:04:04.280> then<00:04:04.579> say<00:04:04.819> maybe<00:04:05.150> try<00:04:05.329> to<00:04:05.389> go<00:04:05.540> for

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
and then say maybe try to go for

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.210 
and then say maybe try to go for
banelings<00:04:06.049> or<00:04:06.200> something<00:04:06.680> as<00:04:06.859> opposed<00:04:07.160> to

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
banelings or something as opposed to

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.039 
banelings or something as opposed to
just<00:04:07.280> throwing<00:04:08.150> away<00:04:08.299> all<00:04:08.329> of<00:04:08.510> his<00:04:08.630> wings<00:04:08.930> and

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
just throwing away all of his wings and

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.809 
just throwing away all of his wings and
his<00:04:09.230> only<00:04:09.410> chance<00:04:09.560> in<00:04:09.709> this<00:04:09.799> game<00:04:09.859> but

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
his only chance in this game but

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.180 
his only chance in this game but
obviously<00:04:11.049> he<00:04:12.049> didn't<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.440> nice<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.859> see<00:04:13.010> that

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
obviously he didn't and nice to see that

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.390 
obviously he didn't and nice to see that
he<00:04:13.250> didn't<00:04:13.669> actually<00:04:13.940> GG<00:04:14.480> this<00:04:14.750> game<00:04:15.019> sir<00:04:15.400> yeah

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
he didn't actually GG this game sir yeah

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.339 
he didn't actually GG this game sir yeah
I<00:04:16.729> mean<00:04:16.880> there's<00:04:17.389> a<00:04:17.479> really<00:04:17.750> no<00:04:17.959> reason<00:04:18.139> to

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
I mean there's a really no reason to

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.779 
I mean there's a really no reason to
attack<00:04:18.590> into<00:04:18.859> those<00:04:18.979> bunkers<00:04:19.340> you<00:04:19.400> can<00:04:19.609> make<00:04:19.760> a

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
attack into those bunkers you can make a

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.120 
attack into those bunkers you can make a
spine<00:04:20.150> crawler<00:04:20.479> that<00:04:20.780> will<00:04:21.620> kill<00:04:21.919> those

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
spine crawler that will kill those

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.589 
spine crawler that will kill those
bunkers<00:04:22.490> right<00:04:23.090> next<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.450> your<00:04:23.570> main<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.050> then

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
bunkers right next to your main and then

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.839 
bunkers right next to your main and then
like<00:04:26.599> why<00:04:26.870> what<00:04:27.439> I<00:04:27.680> don't<00:04:28.009> understand<00:04:28.340> he<00:04:28.639> was

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
like why what I don't understand he was

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.270 
like why what I don't understand he was
going<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.210> hinge<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.449> banker<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:30.110> mean<00:04:30.770> he<00:04:31.009> had

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
going to hinge the banker I mean he had

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.740 
going to hinge the banker I mean he had
enough<00:04:31.610> snuggling<00:04:32.120> so<00:04:32.150> that<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.539> Marines

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
enough snuggling so that the Marines

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.110 
enough snuggling so that the Marines
couldn't<00:04:33.199> actually<00:04:33.439> jump<00:04:34.189> into<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.490> for<00:04:34.729> ya

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
couldn't actually jump into it for ya

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.429 
couldn't actually jump into it for ya
they<00:04:35.330> could<00:04:35.479> generate<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:36.050> could<00:04:36.349> have

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:36.439 
they could generate you could have

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.649 
they could generate you could have
protected<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.889> spine<00:04:37.129> easily<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.699> you<00:04:37.729> look

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
protected a spine easily and you look

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.350 
protected a spine easily and you look
back<00:04:38.840> at<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.050> base<00:04:39.169> of<00:04:39.340> Richmond<00:04:40.340> he<00:04:40.939> was

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
back at the base of Richmond he was

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.059 
back at the base of Richmond he was
behind<00:04:41.719> in<00:04:41.930> harvesters<00:04:42.409> only<00:04:42.620> by<00:04:42.740> one

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
behind in harvesters only by one

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.249 
behind in harvesters only by one
admittedly<00:04:43.550> but<00:04:44.120> he<00:04:44.300> was<00:04:44.479> not<00:04:44.659> mattering<00:04:45.080> up

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
admittedly but he was not mattering up

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.679 
admittedly but he was not mattering up
he<00:04:45.379> hadn't<00:04:45.620> expanded<00:04:46.159> I<00:04:46.280> mean<00:04:46.430> if<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.479> spine

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:47.689 
he hadn't expanded I mean if the spine

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.629 
he hadn't expanded I mean if the spine
boy<00:04:47.810> did<00:04:47.990> go<00:04:48.110> up<00:04:48.250> Richmond<00:04:49.250> might<00:04:49.370> not<00:04:49.550> have

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
boy did go up Richmond might not have

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.409 
boy did go up Richmond might not have
really<00:04:49.939> been<00:04:50.090> very<00:04:50.120> far<00:04:50.539> ahead<00:04:50.629> oh<00:04:51.009> yeah<00:04:52.009> I

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
really been very far ahead oh yeah I

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.839 
really been very far ahead oh yeah I
definitely<00:04:53.419> think<00:04:53.780> you<00:04:53.900> chose<00:04:54.289> the<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:55.550> worst

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
definitely think you chose the the worst

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.089 
definitely think you chose the the worst
of<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.629> two<00:04:56.750> decisions<00:04:57.199> to<00:04:57.500> go<00:04:57.650> with<00:04:57.830> here<00:04:58.009> on

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
of the two decisions to go with here on

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.570 
of the two decisions to go with here on
this<00:04:58.219> game<00:04:59.409> but<00:05:00.409> that<00:05:00.680> is<00:05:00.800> so<00:05:01.219> that's<00:05:01.400> they

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
this game but that is so that's they

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.249 
this game but that is so that's they
even<00:05:01.819> wait<00:05:01.969> for<00:05:02.000> speed<00:05:02.389> to<00:05:02.539> finish<00:05:02.810> if<00:05:03.050> you're

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
even wait for speed to finish if you're

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.529 
even wait for speed to finish if you're
yummy<00:05:04.219> news<00:05:04.400> Alec<00:05:04.639> he's<00:05:04.759> chasing<00:05:05.120> any<00:05:05.240> units

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
yummy news Alec he's chasing any units

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.700 
yummy news Alec he's chasing any units
and<00:05:05.659> he<00:05:05.750> had<00:05:05.840> those<00:05:05.990> zerglings<00:05:06.379> done<00:05:06.500> for<00:05:06.680> a

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
and he had those zerglings done for a

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.110 
and he had those zerglings done for a
while<00:05:06.770> he<00:05:07.069> was<00:05:07.159> waiting<00:05:07.279> for<00:05:07.550> speed<00:05:07.759> to<00:05:07.849> finish

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
while he was waiting for speed to finish

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.670 
while he was waiting for speed to finish
to<00:05:08.270> attack<00:05:08.569> into<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.870> wall<00:05:09.139> i<00:05:09.169> wasn't<00:05:09.560> going

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
to attack into a wall i wasn't going

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.269 
to attack into a wall i wasn't going
anywhere<00:05:10.069> so<00:05:10.580> speed<00:05:10.849> was<00:05:11.029> really<00:05:11.389> useless

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:12.279 
anywhere so speed was really useless

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.429 
anywhere so speed was really useless
yeah<00:05:13.279> it<00:05:13.400> was<00:05:13.550> just<00:05:13.759> mean<00:05:14.539> obviously<00:05:14.900> the

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:15.439 
yeah it was just mean obviously the

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.320 
yeah it was just mean obviously the
bunker<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:15.919> completely<00:05:16.699> out<00:05:16.729> of<00:05:16.849> range<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.240> the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
bunker is completely out of range of the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.610 
bunker is completely out of range of the
mineral<00:05:17.569> and<00:05:17.689> all<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:17.930> can<00:05:18.050> do<00:05:18.139> is<00:05:18.229> like<00:05:18.439> dot

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
mineral and all you can do is like dot

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.679 
mineral and all you can do is like dot
back<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:18.979> forth<00:05:19.129> from<00:05:19.279> the<00:05:19.400> bug<00:05:19.550> cut<00:05:19.759> that

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
back and forth from the bug cut that

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.350 
back and forth from the bug cut that
will<00:05:20.930> make<00:05:21.169> him<00:05:21.289> lose<00:05:21.529> a<00:05:21.590> bunch<00:05:22.039> of<00:05:22.159> wings<00:05:22.430> but

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
will make him lose a bunch of wings but

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.300 
will make him lose a bunch of wings but
you<00:05:23.840> could<00:05:24.020> definitely<00:05:24.259> get<00:05:24.740> a<00:05:24.800> spine<00:05:25.039> co-op

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
you could definitely get a spine co-op

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.529 
you could definitely get a spine co-op
and<00:05:25.460> if<00:05:25.699> you<00:05:25.819> have<00:05:25.939> the<00:05:26.060> Queen<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:26.300> have<00:05:26.419> the

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
and if you have the Queen you have the

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:27.640 
and if you have the Queen you have the
spine<00:05:26.779> and<00:05:26.810> if<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.050> have<00:05:27.139> a<00:05:27.199> few<00:05:27.409> Ling's

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
spine and if you have a few Ling's

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.100 
spine and if you have a few Ling's
there's<00:05:28.069> no<00:05:28.340> way<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:28.789> a<00:05:29.000> few<00:05:29.599> Marines<00:05:29.900> been

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
there's no way that a few Marines been

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.230 
there's no way that a few Marines been
going<00:05:30.319> to<00:05:30.440> actually<00:05:30.589> kill<00:05:31.219> your<00:05:31.250> base<00:05:31.550> I<00:05:31.819> mean

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
going to actually kill your base I mean

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.969 
going to actually kill your base I mean
his<00:05:32.360> joins<00:05:32.629> us<00:05:32.750> safe<00:05:32.990> he<00:05:33.589> could<00:05:33.770> have<00:05:33.830> even

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
his joins us safe he could have even

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.709 
his joins us safe he could have even
joined<00:05:34.520> up<00:05:34.699> a<00:05:34.789> little<00:05:35.060> bit<00:05:35.150> at<00:05:35.240> that<00:05:35.360> second

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
joined up a little bit at that second

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.269 
joined up a little bit at that second
capital<00:05:35.900> of<00:05:36.050> his<00:05:36.139> legs<00:05:36.319> alive<00:05:36.589> I<00:05:36.830> don't<00:05:37.039> it

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:37.279 
capital of his legs alive I don't it

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:42.189 
capital of his legs alive I don't it
really<00:05:37.759> really<00:05:38.240> was<00:05:38.870> not<00:05:39.139> behind<00:05:40.930> I'm<00:05:41.930> sure<00:05:42.080> he

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
really really was not behind I'm sure he

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.279 
really really was not behind I'm sure he
would<00:05:42.349> beg<00:05:42.830> to<00:05:42.860> differ<00:05:43.129> but<00:05:43.460> anyways<00:05:44.289> that's

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
would beg to differ but anyways that's

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.200 
would beg to differ but anyways that's
the<00:05:45.440> end<00:05:45.650> of<00:05:45.680> this<00:05:45.770> series<00:05:46.009> 20<00:05:46.460> going<00:05:47.060> to

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
the end of this series 20 going to

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.409 
the end of this series 20 going to
richmond<00:05:47.569> and<00:05:48.159> for<00:05:49.159> this<00:05:49.250> EG<00:05:49.550> masters<00:05:49.969> cup<00:05:50.180> and

richmond and for this EG masters cup and

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.510 
richmond and for this EG masters cup and
once<00:05:50.690> again<00:05:50.810> losing<00:05:51.169> 20<00:05:51.560> units<00:05:51.860> versus<00:05:52.279> four

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
once again losing 20 units versus four

once again losing 20 units versus four
so<00:05:52.759> a<00:05:52.789> really<00:05:53.500> cost<00:05:54.500> effective<00:05:54.650> play<00:05:55.339> here<00:05:55.520> by

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
so a really cost effective play here by

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.230 
so a really cost effective play here by
richmond<00:05:56.589> yeah<00:05:57.589> that's<00:05:58.129> one<00:05:58.729> way<00:05:58.849> to<00:05:58.879> play<00:05:59.150> out

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
richmond yeah that's one way to play out

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.760 
richmond yeah that's one way to play out
a<00:05:59.300> best-of-three<00:05:59.629> series<00:05:59.810> i<00:06:00.289> guess<00:06:00.439> against

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
a best-of-three series i guess against

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.040 
a best-of-three series i guess against
is<00:06:00.889> roads<00:06:01.129> gonna<00:06:01.279> work<00:06:01.629> it's<00:06:02.629> going<00:06:02.779> to<00:06:02.839> infer

choose against edrum more than other

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.409 
choose against edrum more than other
players<00:06:09.110> because<00:06:09.529> he<00:06:09.770> seems<00:06:10.039> to<00:06:10.159> be<00:06:10.219> known<00:06:10.460> to
