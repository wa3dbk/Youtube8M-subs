00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.080
 do a thorough investigation because 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.380
 it is not the first time that they attack the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.030
 people and we're going to infiltrate and 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.670
 to call 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.299
 those who make up these are 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.119

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.909
 been emphatic in that they fear for their life 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.590
 and therefore have requested measures of 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.040
 information protection from the center 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.720
