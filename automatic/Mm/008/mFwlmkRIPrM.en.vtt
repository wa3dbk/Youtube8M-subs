00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.140 
okay I'll start this one is nuts the
this<00:04:56.110> parts<00:04:56.410> brown<00:04:56.710> on<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.700> handle<00:04:58.030> of<00:04:58.090> the

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
this parts brown on the handle of the

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.850 
this parts brown on the handle of the
gun<00:04:58.320> but<00:04:59.320> this<00:04:59.620> one<00:04:59.800> isn't

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
gun but this one isn't

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.080 
gun but this one isn't
for<00:05:00.979> some<00:05:01.129> reason<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.430> still<00:05:01.460> think<00:05:01.879> that<00:05:02.030> I've

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
for some reason I still think that I've

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.360 
for some reason I still think that I've
keep<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.479> in<00:05:02.689> the<00:05:03.319> package<00:05:03.710> because<00:05:03.919> this<00:05:04.159> one

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
keep it in the package because this one

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.260 
keep it in the package because this one
doesn't<00:05:04.669> have<00:05:05.569> the<00:05:06.129> brown<00:05:07.129> on<00:05:07.340> there<00:05:07.550> does<00:05:08.090> on

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
doesn't have the brown on there does on

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.429 
doesn't have the brown on there does on
the<00:05:08.300> back<00:05:08.539> but<00:05:08.870> not<00:05:09.020> on<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.199> front<00:05:09.550> so<00:05:11.439> this

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:12.439 
the back but not on the front so this

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.899 
the back but not on the front so this
one's<00:05:12.650> also<00:05:12.800> has<00:05:13.039> a<00:05:13.099> slight<00:05:13.430> crease<00:05:13.699> right

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
one's also has a slight crease right

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:15.490 
one's also has a slight crease right
