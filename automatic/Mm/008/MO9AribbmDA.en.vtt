00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.760 
glance there are a lot of things that I
really<00:00:36.180> started<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.600> enjoy<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> lot<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770

came<00:00:37.950> from<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> artwork<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.820> week<00:00:39.059> now<00:00:39.629> I've

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
came from the artwork this week now I've

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
came from the artwork this week now I've
made<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.290> clear<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.829> no<00:00:40.920> surprise<00:00:41.280> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the expressions that his characters can

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.350 
the expressions that his characters can
give<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.410> kampachi<00:00:47.160> gives<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.700> lot<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.120> those

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.060 
that looked really awesome and you know
this<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.260> chapter<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.650> think<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:48.950> definitely

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
this is a chapter I think you definitely

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.680 
this is a chapter I think you definitely
need<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.430> read<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> couple<00:02:49.940> times<00:02:50.300> there's<00:02:50.600> a

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
need to read a couple times there's a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.900 
need to read a couple times there's a
lot<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.900> little<00:02:51.080> bit<00:02:51.320> of<00:02:51.440> subtext<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.459> context

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
lot a little bit of subtext and context

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.040 
lot a little bit of subtext and context
in<00:02:53.000> there<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.330> think<00:02:53.360> really<00:02:53.660> makes<00:02:53.930> this

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
in there that I think really makes this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.310 
in there that I think really makes this
chapter<00:02:54.440> work<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:56.120> know<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.660> wanted<00:02:57.230> the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
chapter work you know I wanted the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.630 
chapter work you know I wanted the
action<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.739> be<00:02:57.770> maybe<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.190> little<00:02:58.280> more

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
action to be maybe a little more

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.790 
action to be maybe a little more
explosive<00:02:59.090> but<00:03:00.020> really<00:03:00.290> it's<00:03:00.410> still<00:03:00.650> pretty

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
explosive but really it's still pretty

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.560 
explosive but really it's still pretty
cool<00:03:01.040> it's<00:03:01.220> still<00:03:01.400> incredibly<00:03:01.940> brutal<00:03:02.180> but

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
cool it's still incredibly brutal but

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.880 
cool it's still incredibly brutal but
this<00:03:02.660> wasn't<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.989> perfect<00:03:03.140> chapter<00:03:03.530> there<00:03:03.860> are

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
this wasn't a perfect chapter there are

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.140 
this wasn't a perfect chapter there are
some<00:03:04.040> things<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.310> wish<00:03:04.370> would<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.790> been<00:03:04.910> more
