00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:29.540

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
okay guys so that's the specs of it if

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.700 
okay guys so that's the specs of it if
you<00:05:29.699> have<00:05:29.879> any<00:05:30.030> comments<00:05:31.280> just<00:05:32.280> let<00:05:32.639> me<00:05:32.819> know<00:05:32.849> I

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
you have any comments just let me know I

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.860 
you have any comments just let me know I
think<00:05:34.710> that's<00:05:34.889> a<00:05:34.979> good<00:05:35.099> choice<00:05:35.250> to<00:05:35.490> put<00:05:36.000> the

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
think that's a good choice to put the

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.490 
think that's a good choice to put the
Neo<00:05:38.360> adapter<00:05:39.360> which<00:05:39.599> is<00:05:39.629> the<00:05:39.840> thin<00:05:40.080> one<00:05:40.289> so

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
Neo adapter which is the thin one so

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.670 
Neo adapter which is the thin one so
it's<00:05:40.620> reduce<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.159> width<00:05:41.909> of<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.240> laptop

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
it's reduce the width of the laptop

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.709 
it's reduce the width of the laptop
actually<00:05:43.680> it's<00:05:43.830> not<00:05:43.979> heavy<00:05:44.539> stream<00:05:45.539> you're

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:45.719 
actually it's not heavy stream you're

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.469 
actually it's not heavy stream you're
not<00:05:45.840> heavy<00:05:46.139> like<00:05:46.259> oh<00:05:46.590> that's<00:05:46.770> all<00:05:46.949> before<00:05:47.479> by

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
not heavy like oh that's all before by

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.689 
not heavy like oh that's all before by
the<00:05:48.509> way<00:05:48.659> I<00:05:48.840> have<00:05:49.139> this<00:05:49.819> the<00:05:50.819> old<00:05:51.030> am<00:05:51.300> 17<00:05:51.900> X

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
the way I have this the old am 17 X

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:59.209 
the way I have this the old am 17 X
which<00:05:53.699> is<00:05:53.939> Siri<00:05:54.449> or<00:05:54.659> 51<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:57.680> think<00:05:58.680> it's<00:05:58.860> almost

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
which is Siri or 51 I think it's almost

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:05.059 
which is Siri or 51 I think it's almost
the<00:05:59.639> same<00:05:59.879> weights<00:06:00.289> with<00:06:01.289> that<00:06:01.560> one<00:06:03.800> yeah<00:06:04.800> this

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
the same weights with that one yeah this

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.240 
the same weights with that one yeah this
is<00:06:05.250> a<00:06:05.279> little<00:06:05.610> bit<00:06:05.789> heavier<00:06:06.210> but<00:06:07.219> comparing<00:06:08.219> to

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
is a little bit heavier but comparing to

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.899 
is a little bit heavier but comparing to
the<00:06:08.610> adapters<00:06:09.240> that<00:06:09.569> one<00:06:13.400> you<00:06:14.400> can<00:06:14.580> see<00:06:14.759> the

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
the adapters that one you can see the

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.279 
the adapters that one you can see the
difference<00:06:15.360> here<00:06:16.400> that's<00:06:17.400> quite<00:06:17.789> big<00:06:18.289> it's

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
difference here that's quite big it's

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.290 
difference here that's quite big it's
almost<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.889> same<00:06:20.099> type<00:06:20.520> here<00:06:20.819> but<00:06:21.180> the

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
almost the same type here but the

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.409 
almost the same type here but the
thickness<00:06:21.569> is<00:06:22.020> that's<00:06:22.770> quite<00:06:23.159> big<00:06:25.279> anyway

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
thickness is that's quite big anyway

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.749 
thickness is that's quite big anyway
