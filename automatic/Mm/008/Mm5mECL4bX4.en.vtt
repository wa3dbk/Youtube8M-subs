00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
contradictory statement and you know why

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.429 
contradictory statement and you know why
because<00:01:39.039> it<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.719> because<00:01:40.719> the<00:01:40.960> Word<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.409> God

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
are not disconnected and so but we do

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.149 
are not disconnected and so but we do
live<00:01:48.250> in<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.850> land<00:01:49.119> where<00:01:49.560> personal<00:01:50.560> experience

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
live in a land where personal experience

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.940 
live in a land where personal experience
is<00:01:51.399> more<00:01:51.789> than<00:01:52.030> just<00:01:52.390> an<00:01:52.600> informing<00:01:53.409> process

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
is more than just an informing process

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.219 
is more than just an informing process
in<00:01:54.159> a<00:01:54.280> person's<00:01:54.700> worldview<00:01:55.539> and<00:01:55.750> epistemology

in a person's worldview and epistemology

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.779 
in a person's worldview and epistemology
it<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:57.280> often<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.240> defining<00:01:59.140> focus<00:01:59.649> and<00:01:59.920> that

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
it is often the defining focus and that

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.810 
it is often the defining focus and that
is<00:02:01.090> what<00:02:01.450> Sola<00:02:01.740> experiencia<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.280> you

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
is what Sola experiencia is and you

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.010 
is what Sola experiencia is and you
simply<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.420> simply<00:02:04.899> will<00:02:05.469> not<00:02:05.520> coexist<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.780> a
