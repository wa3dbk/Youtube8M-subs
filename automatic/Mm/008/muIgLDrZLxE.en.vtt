00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
a little thing called the geyser tube so

a little thing called the geyser tube so
here's<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:20.910> happens<00:00:21.210> see<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> Mentos<00:00:21.810> so

here's what happens see the Mentos so

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.179 
here's what happens see the Mentos so
we're<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.350> using<00:00:22.500> these<00:00:22.710> little<00:00:22.859> mint

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
we're just using these little mint

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.950 
we're just using these little mint
Mentos<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:24.029> about<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.689> these<00:00:24.779> are

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
Mentos that you know about so these are

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.720 
Mentos that you know about so these are
Mentos<00:00:25.410> when<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.890> pull<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.490> watch

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
Mentos when you pull like this watch

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.400 
Mentos when you pull like this watch
what<00:00:26.910> happens<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.330> when<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.539> pull<00:00:27.840> they<00:00:28.080> fall

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
what happens so when you pull they fall

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.929 
what happens so when you pull they fall
to<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> bottom<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.340> see<00:00:29.490> how<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.730> kind<00:00:29.910> of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
to the bottom so see how it kind of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.550 
to the bottom so see how it kind of
comes<00:00:30.150> up<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> bottom<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> kablooey<00:00:31.170> part

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
comes up to the bottom the kablooey part

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440 
comes up to the bottom the kablooey part
yellow<00:00:31.980> now<00:00:32.279> here's<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> secret<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.149> those

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
yellow now here's the secret is those

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.330 
yellow now here's the secret is those
Mentos<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.989> tiny<00:00:34.230> little<00:00:34.380> pits<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:35.010> them<00:00:35.130> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
Mentos have tiny little pits on them and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.130 
Mentos have tiny little pits on them and
when<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> pits<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.329> react<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> carbon

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
when the pits now react with the carbon

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.139 
when the pits now react with the carbon
dioxide<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.950> there<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.340> pulls<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> carbon

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
dioxide in there it pulls the carbon

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.090 
dioxide in there it pulls the carbon
dioxide<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:40.230> until<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.649> point<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.040> is

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
dioxide out up until this point this is

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.260 
dioxide out up until this point this is
what<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.340> would<00:00:41.460> always<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> Mentos

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
what you would always do is the Mentos

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.810 
what you would always do is the Mentos
so<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.960> came<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.559> device<00:00:43.920> working

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
so we came up with this device working

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.430 
so we came up with this device working
with<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> klutz<00:00:45.329> people<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.020> called<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
with the klutz people this is called a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.020 
with the klutz people this is called a
depth<00:00:46.680> charge<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.460> if<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> take<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> look<00:00:47.910> at

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
depth charge so if you take a look at

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.930 
depth charge so if you take a look at
this<00:00:48.120> sure<00:00:48.930> why<00:00:49.620> would<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> call<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.730> tube

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
this sure why would you call it a tube

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.520 
this sure why would you call it a tube
or<00:00:51.149> anything<00:00:51.329> else<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.050> see<00:00:52.199> how<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.410> kind

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
or anything else so you see how it kind

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.319 
or anything else so you see how it kind
of<00:00:52.649> fits<00:00:52.829> together<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.699> now<00:00:54.120> watch

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
of fits together like this so now watch

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.819 
of fits together like this so now watch
what<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.260> fill<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.800> with

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
what you can do you can fill it with

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.600 
what you can do you can fill it with
whatever<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.430> want<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.699> tell<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.210> completely

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
whatever you want to tell you completely

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.119

[Music]
I<00:01:02.129> want<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.730> whether<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.059> not

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I want to see whether or not

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
I want to see whether or not
salt<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.619> allow<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.159> happen<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.549> now

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
salt will allow that to happen so now

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.340 
salt will allow that to happen so now
that<00:01:05.850> goes<00:01:06.270> into<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> little<00:01:06.750> device<00:01:06.930> that's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
that goes into the little device that's

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.649 
that goes into the little device that's
here<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> pull<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> pin<00:01:09.390> in

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
here and now when you pull the pin in

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.179 
here and now when you pull the pin in
here<00:01:09.900> focus<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.590> Matt<00:01:10.740> would<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> come

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
here focus down here Matt would you come

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.550 
here focus down here Matt would you come
down<00:01:11.220> ready<00:01:11.820> 1<00:01:11.970> 2<00:01:12.000> 3<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.689> kids<00:01:12.930> see<00:01:13.470> how

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
down ready 1 2 3 when your kids see how

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.980 
down ready 1 2 3 when your kids see how
it<00:01:13.680> brings<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.549> depth<00:01:14.880> charge<00:01:15.240> secret<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it brings the depth charge secret is to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.719 
it brings the depth charge secret is to
get<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.470> stuff<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.979> very<00:01:17.310> bottom

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
get all this stuff on the very bottom

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.280 
get all this stuff on the very bottom
and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.210> when<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.659> bottom<00:01:18.869> will<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
and then when it's on the bottom will it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
and then when it's on the bottom will it
react<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.799> now<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.280> science<00:01:20.790> experiment

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
react so now it's a science experiment

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.179 
react so now it's a science experiment
because<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> Mentos<00:01:22.770> will<00:01:23.040> do

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
because we know what the Mentos will do

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.620 
because we know what the Mentos will do
but<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.790> put<00:01:26.299> there's<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.360> little

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
but now we can put there's a little
