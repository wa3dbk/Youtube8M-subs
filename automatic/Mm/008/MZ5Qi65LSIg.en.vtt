let's<00:00:02.220> see<00:00:02.580> how<00:00:03.030> black<00:00:03.510> should<00:00:03.870> attack<00:00:04.290> white

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
let's see how black should attack white

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.650 
let's see how black should attack white
to<00:00:05.130> space<00:00:05.520> extension<00:00:06.359> in<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.560> situation

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
to space extension in this situation

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.020 
to space extension in this situation
this<00:00:09.660> appears<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.410> game<00:00:10.679> quite<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.070> lot<00:00:14.030> let's

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
this appears in game quite a lot let's

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.370 
this appears in game quite a lot let's
first<00:00:15.389> see<00:00:15.630> how<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:15.929> get<00:00:16.260> here<00:00:18.140> this<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
first see how we get here this is a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.259 
first see how we get here this is a

popular opening wide approaches slides
and<00:00:24.689> makes<00:00:25.380> extension<00:00:26.449> now<00:00:27.449> how<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.960> black

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
and makes extension now how to the black

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.290 
and makes extension now how to the black
attack<00:00:29.090> this<00:00:30.090> white<00:00:30.859> extension<00:00:32.300> black

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
attack this white extension black

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.889 
attack this white extension black
attaching<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> great<00:00:34.559> move<00:00:35.180> now<00:00:36.180> white<00:00:36.540> can

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
attaching is a great move now white can

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.850 
attaching is a great move now white can
either<00:00:37.140> honey<00:00:37.620> from<00:00:38.190> above<00:00:38.579> or<00:00:38.879> from<00:00:38.940> under

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
either honey from above or from under

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.180 
either honey from above or from under
you<00:00:40.860> swine<00:00:41.190> honey's<00:00:41.640> from<00:00:42.059> above<00:00:42.950> black<00:00:43.950> her

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you swine honey's from above black her

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.970 
you swine honey's from above black her
knees<00:00:44.570> white<00:00:45.570> connects<00:00:46.230> black<00:00:47.190> connects<00:00:47.579> back

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
knees white connects black connects back

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.590 
knees white connects black connects back
so<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.280> point<00:00:50.579> black<00:00:51.090> gets<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
so at this point black gets the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.650 
so at this point black gets the
territory<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> white<00:00:53.910> doesn't<00:00:54.360> have

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
territory here and white doesn't have

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.799 
territory here and white doesn't have
eyes<00:00:55.460> here<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.910> has<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.120> move<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
eyes here so it has to move to the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.750 
eyes here so it has to move to the
center<00:00:58.340> so<00:00:59.340> black<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.820> happy<00:01:01.370> now<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.640> if

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
center so black is happy now what if

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.289 
center so black is happy now what if
instead<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.420> connecting<00:01:04.519> wide<00:01:05.519> arteries<00:01:08.299> and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
instead of connecting wide arteries and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
instead of connecting wide arteries and
separate<00:01:10.020> black<00:01:10.530> goons

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.480 

now<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.940> should<00:01:15.150> practice<00:01:16.040> black<00:01:17.040> shouldn't

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
now what should practice black shouldn't

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.230 
now what should practice black shouldn't
play<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.409> otherwise<00:01:19.460> white<00:01:20.460> connects<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
play this otherwise white connects and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.740 
play this otherwise white connects and
black<00:01:22.140> doesn't<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.710> follow-up<00:01:23.160> moves<00:01:23.750> so

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
black doesn't have follow-up moves so

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.320 
black doesn't have follow-up moves so
this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.050> not<00:01:25.380> good<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:25.680> black<00:01:30.380> instead

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
this is not good for black instead

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.350 
this is not good for black instead
flagship<00:01:33.500> clamp<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:35.869> now<00:01:36.869> why<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.170> ends

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
flagship clamp here now why this ends

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.680 
flagship clamp here now why this ends
black<00:01:39.360> cannot<00:01:39.869> cut<00:01:40.490> as<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.759> yet<00:01:42.030> because<00:01:42.479> if

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
black cannot cut as of yet because if

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.170 
black cannot cut as of yet because if
white<00:01:43.140> connects<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.310> whole<00:01:44.520> black<00:01:44.759> group<00:01:45.030> is

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
white connects the whole black group is

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.279 
white connects the whole black group is
dead<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.170> we're<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:46.710> cut<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.990> now<00:01:48.990> wyd

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
dead so we're actually cut here now wyd

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.400 
dead so we're actually cut here now wyd
cannot<00:01:49.770> ascend<00:01:50.190> otherwise<00:01:51.149> black<00:01:51.720> cards<00:01:52.080> here

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
cannot ascend otherwise black cards here

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.670 
cannot ascend otherwise black cards here
and<00:01:52.590> then<00:01:53.310> kill<00:01:53.729> all<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.119> white<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:55.020> white

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and then kill all the white so white

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.529 
and then kill all the white so white
connects<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:57.300> black<00:01:57.630> bridge<00:01:57.960> sounder<00:01:59.539> so

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
connects and black bridge sounder so

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.870 
connects and black bridge sounder so
from<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.170> result<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.130> black<00:02:02.580> is<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
from this result we can see black is a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.400 
from this result we can see black is a
big<00:02:03.360> corner<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:04.460> also<00:02:05.460> gives<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.940> 33<00:02:06.509> here

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
big corner and also gives the 33 here

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.360 
big corner and also gives the 33 here
and<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.880> white<00:02:09.149> didn't<00:02:09.630> get<00:02:09.840> anything<00:02:10.380> still

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
and the white didn't get anything still

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.080 
and the white didn't get anything still
doesn't<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.850> eyes<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.340> also<00:02:14.820> good

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
doesn't have eyes so this is also good

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.550 
doesn't have eyes so this is also good
for<00:02:15.120> black<00:02:16.760> actually<00:02:17.760> better<00:02:18.269> than<00:02:18.450> before<00:02:21.560> so

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
for black actually better than before so

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.960 
for black actually better than before so
we<00:02:22.739> see<00:02:22.950> white<00:02:23.790> cannot<00:02:25.160> separate<00:02:26.160> black<00:02:26.610> group

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
we see white cannot separate black group

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.440 
we see white cannot separate black group
like<00:02:27.239> this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.240 

now<00:02:32.310> how<00:02:33.310> about<00:02:33.340> white<00:02:34.349> anaise<00:02:35.940> from<00:02:36.940> under<00:02:38.250> no

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
now how about white anaise from under no

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.369 
now how about white anaise from under no
black<00:02:39.610> should<00:02:40.269> cut<00:02:41.010> here<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:44.290> white<00:02:44.849> Ataris

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
black should cut here if white Ataris

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.880 
black should cut here if white Ataris
black<00:02:47.379> arteries<00:02:48.010> white<00:02:48.849> kills<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.560> black

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
black arteries white kills the black

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.089 
black arteries white kills the black
connects<00:02:51.459> back<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:52.720> way<00:02:52.989> black<00:02:53.500> still<00:02:53.830> gets

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
connects back this way black still gets

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:03.000 
connects back this way black still gets
a<00:02:54.400> big<00:02:55.150> corner<00:02:55.980> here<00:02:56.980> so<00:02:57.849> it's<00:02:58.090> still<00:02:58.330> good<00:03:02.010> now

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
a big corner here so it's still good now

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.740 
a big corner here so it's still good now
if<00:03:03.819> white<00:03:04.239> Ataris<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:05.440> black<00:03:05.799> stone<00:03:06.750> then

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
if white Ataris this black stone then

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.030 
if white Ataris this black stone then
black<00:03:07.989> arteries<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.630> cut<00:03:10.630> off<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.470> wide

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
black arteries and cut off this wide

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.960 
black arteries and cut off this wide
stone<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.980> it's<00:03:15.310> still<00:03:15.549> good<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:18.030> black<00:03:19.799> can

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
stone so it's still good and black can

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.240 
stone so it's still good and black can
consolidate<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:23.140> territory<00:03:23.709> on<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.040> right

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
consolidate the territory on the right

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.640 
consolidate the territory on the right
side<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:26.130> white<00:03:27.130> cannot<00:03:27.579> connect<00:03:28.000> back<00:03:28.650> so

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
side and white cannot connect back so

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.210 
side and white cannot connect back so
this<00:03:29.980> result<00:03:30.430> is<00:03:30.610> also<00:03:30.970> good<00:03:31.239> for<00:03:31.810> black<00:03:32.220> so

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
this result is also good for black so

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.509 
this result is also good for black so
that's<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.730> way<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:34.239> attack<00:03:34.630> this<00:03:35.470> white<00:03:35.859> to

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
that's the way to attack this white to

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.630 
that's the way to attack this white to
space<00:03:36.850> extension
