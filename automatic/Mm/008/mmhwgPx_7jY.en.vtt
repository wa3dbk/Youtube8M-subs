00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello everyone, I am with you again and today I am 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.890
 tell you about the fashion that adds to 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.500
 game new blocks blocks that you 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.630
 will need to build your beautiful 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.780
 and unusual roof see that they 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.109
 multi-colored more traced or 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.900
 just beautiful are here let's say how 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.470
 sara different roof and truly here 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.939
 such 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.230
 I do not know such a tile here damn yes horseradish 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.660
 he knows I do not really know these terms 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.940
 they act like semi-blocks rather not 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.530
 half blocks and as a monthly unit we can 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 climb them like this 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.510
 quietly without jumping and all that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.410
 but the textures as you see they are flat 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.840
 and this is now marked as a black mark 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.550
 the line on which I drive now 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.969
 it goes exactly the whole block that is 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.430
 tagged nepal block and tagged entirely and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.530
 we can break the void if so 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.369
 challenge to express and also each of 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.979
 This type of coloring of these blocks is 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.939
 their positions rather than their position 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.540
 In general, the positions are others like that 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.580
 the positions are the worst, for example 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.680
 see on like two exactly the same 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.200
 positions but like ladders and as if 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.869
 just flipped you have them 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.549
 crafting most likely just separately 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.550
 rather not likely have to craft 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.860
 separately because 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.320
 each of these items is crafted 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:44.990
 differently differently here i fell off 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.120
 we get a little bit see 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.260
 Now these two positions is collected q 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.690
 little diamond well how do you understand 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.510
 use the floor not only for roofs 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.760
 Can we can there I do not know how she rus for 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.160
 dogs brothers for the backup go away 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.660
 in small to the flying house can 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.630
 flying can gradually 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:10.100
 nonsense well in short i think you are me 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.650
 understood you find all this business of some kind 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.340
 scream be i clap tobiko

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.030
 find all this business some 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.950
 creative use of unusual Well 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.200
 I actually think everything 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.790
 archive with mod and crafting my will 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.610
