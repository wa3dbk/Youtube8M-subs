 in the Neapolitan countryside son of parents 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.920
 very poor born enrico caruso that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.060
 would become the greatest singer of 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.060
 all the times 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.810

 old to Romans and he wanted his son 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.260

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.670
 paternal 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.570

 I believe that not to the first repair does not throw 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.020
 The moment arrived when Caruso decided 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.830

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.830

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:05.479
 where popularity 

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:09.539
 Enrico Caruso returned to his native Naples 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:14.099
 of Naples and then die and for 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:17.729
 Unfortunately this was the August 2, 1921 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:20.219

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:24.689
