do do so you're gonna expect something I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.609 
do do so you're gonna expect something I
mean<00:01:29.970> whatever<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.900> I've<00:01:31.320> been<00:01:31.439> wearing

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
mean whatever and I've been wearing

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.499 
mean whatever and I've been wearing
these<00:01:31.829> shirts<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.460> tank<00:01:32.970> tops<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
these shirts because tank tops because I

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.530 
these shirts because tank tops because I
find<00:01:33.869> them<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> most<00:01:34.229> comfortable<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.540> muling

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
find them the most comfortable I muling

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.859 
find them the most comfortable I muling
is<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:37.320> impossible<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.540> it's<00:01:39.540> just

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
is like not impossible but it's just

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.380 
is like not impossible but it's just
more<00:01:40.710> difficult<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.220> hate<00:01:41.400> sleeves<00:01:41.729> anyway

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
more difficult and I hate sleeves anyway

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.469 
more difficult and I hate sleeves anyway
so<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.350> makes<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:43.979> easier<00:01:44.479> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
so this just makes it a lot easier to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.300 
so this just makes it a lot easier to
deal<00:01:45.630> with<00:01:45.659> um<00:01:45.930> along<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.619> corset<00:01:47.040> training

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
deal with um along with corset training

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.999 
deal with um along with corset training
which<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.420> way<00:01:48.600> straining<00:01:48.799> I've<00:01:49.799> been

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
which is this way straining I've been

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.090 
which is this way straining I've been
taking<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.000> yogi<00:01:51.420> cleansing<00:01:52.350> teas<00:01:52.590> which<00:01:52.920> is
