00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
actually costs money I think it's like

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.439

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it's actually very good I just change

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.630 
it's actually very good I just change
something<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.750> settings<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.590> my<00:01:10.650> own<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.610> I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
something in the settings on my own so I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.969 
something in the settings on my own so I
don't<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> hell<00:01:13.110> are<00:01:13.290> changed<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
don't know what the hell are changed I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.960 
don't know what the hell are changed I
think<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> should<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.000> less<00:01:15.570> laggy<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.970> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
think it should be less laggy now but it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.270 
think it should be less laggy now but it
also<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.390> more<00:01:18.689> laggy<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> don't<00:01:20.220> know

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
also can be more laggy so I don't know

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.280 
also can be more laggy so I don't know

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.070 
this is what I changed before I was
changing<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:35.160> framerate<00:05:35.550> shitty<00:05:36.060> but<00:05:37.020> I

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
changing the framerate shitty but I

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.880 
changing the framerate shitty but I
don't<00:05:37.320> know<00:05:37.410> this<00:05:38.400> rotation<00:05:39.080> thing<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.380> think

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
don't know this rotation thing I think

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.800 
don't know this rotation thing I think
this<00:05:41.130> is<00:05:41.280> when<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:41.580> do<00:05:41.730> like<00:05:41.940> like<00:05:42.570> I<00:05:42.750> do

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
this is when you do like like I do

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.780 
this is when you do like like I do
you're<00:05:43.680> going<00:05:43.860> to<00:05:43.950> have<00:05:44.070> them<00:05:44.310> on<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.490> side

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
you're going to have them on the side

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.940 
you're going to have them on the side
like<00:05:45.270> laying<00:05:45.540> down<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:46.200> stuff<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:48.800> this<00:05:49.800> you

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
like laying down and stuff and this you

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.620 
like laying down and stuff and this you
have<00:05:50.040> to<00:05:50.160> change<00:05:50.400> if<00:05:50.670> you<00:05:50.970> are<00:05:51.150> going<00:05:51.480> to

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
have to change if you are going to

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.900 
have to change if you are going to
record<00:05:51.930> your<00:05:52.020> microphone<00:05:52.670> it's<00:05:53.670> very

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
record your microphone it's very

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.370 
record your microphone it's very
important<00:05:54.390> because<00:05:54.450> I<00:05:54.780> recorded<00:05:55.230> my<00:05:55.290> first

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
important because I recorded my first

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.490 
important because I recorded my first
videos<00:05:55.980> without<00:05:56.220> microphone<00:05:56.820> and<00:05:57.230> you<00:05:58.230> should

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
videos without microphone and you should

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.310 
videos without microphone and you should
not<00:05:58.680> probably<00:05:59.160> not<00:05:59.250> have<00:05:59.550> too<00:05:59.700> high<00:05:59.910> on<00:06:00.150> the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
not probably not have too high on the

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.830 
not probably not have too high on the
high<00:06:01.320> on<00:06:01.470> this<00:06:01.620> I'd<00:06:01.919> when<00:06:02.910> I<00:06:02.940> did<00:06:03.270> that<00:06:03.300> and<00:06:03.720> try
