00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello people welcome to one 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.910
 further tutorial the minecraft 1.5 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.529
 brings many innovations with it and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.139
 I'll end this for you now 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.200
 show if I go through for example 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.299
 little poisoned how to do that completely 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.940
 just behind is a command blog 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.529
 Powdered and in which is the order in it 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.850
 I 'll play game mode 1 fast 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.300
 so i also put in a command blog 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.289
 can enter 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.359
 effect then for whom eg for the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.579
 closest player to what effect 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.710
 is there , for example, the 19 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.020
 then how long will we make two 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.469
 seconds and how strong the effect will be 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.629
 should 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.670
 Let's do ten strength then 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.910
 we confirm the whole sit down times 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.489
 again game 0 and move to the button 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.559
 and are poisoned now you can too 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.480
 quite a lot of other things still 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.969
 make for example was really cool is 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.559
 is speed 20 here then you run here so 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.260
 fast long way or for example 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.690
 hurry 50 that means you're easy here 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.229
 Break down the blog very quickly 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.390
 can be cool if 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.590
 you can jump very high, for example 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.479
 jump here 10 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.670
 You have to hurt the case 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.909
 so we'll take care of that for you 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.439
 next exercise and creative mode there 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.450
 let's jump 100 if you can 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.630
 also wants to exaggerate then sees it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.490
 whole so horny you can do it all 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.020
 but also for useful things use 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.530
 like eg here comes down to if we times 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.210
 for this example, go this way and here 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.630
 go through that for adventure maps 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.860
 cool 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.299
 then we fly up here, yes, all the way 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.540
 simple is here is a command 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.630
 block with the command effect for the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.970
 densest player eight ispringen for 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.880
 one second and there are ten strength 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.250
 we walk through here and can do so high 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.450
 then let's jump again 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.329
 back even cool things are 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.860
 for example, blindness 15 that they are the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.440
 all this looks like this or us 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.540
 make us again in game 0 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.240
 for people who want to dive very long 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.250
 breathing 20 and then let's just go 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.110
 to these pools and see that we 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.720
 almost no bubbles lose 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.860
 only when the effect is over, yes 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.660
 the bubbles begin to disappear 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.550
 yes all the effects are in the video 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.660
 description I hope you have that 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.590
 fallen tutorial 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.590
 Until next time
