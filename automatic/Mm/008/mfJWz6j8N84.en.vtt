00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.650 
go a couple of times in that area and
then<00:02:16.799> once<00:02:17.130> I'm<00:02:17.340> sure<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.880> down<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.510> it's

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
then once I'm sure it's down and it's

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.470 
then once I'm sure it's down and it's
flat<00:02:18.989> I'll<00:02:19.500> go<00:02:20.010> ahead<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.640> continue<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.209> sole

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
flat I'll go ahead and continue the sole

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.949 
flat I'll go ahead and continue the sole
and<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:22.350> also<00:02:22.739> show<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.040> how<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.790> finish<00:02:24.329> off<00:02:24.600> if

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
and I also show you how I finish off if

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.770 
and I also show you how I finish off if
I'm<00:02:25.230> at<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.590> end<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.920> my<00:02:26.069> thread<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.239> there<00:02:27.630> you

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
I'm at the end of my thread so there you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
I'm at the end of my thread so there you
go<00:02:27.989> this<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.709> 10<00:02:28.950> inch<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.579> how<00:02:29.760> far<00:02:30.060> I

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
go this is the 10 inch this is how far I

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.830 
go this is the 10 inch this is how far I
have<00:02:30.450> gotten<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.250> yes<00:02:32.250> no<00:02:32.670> cut<00:02:33.030> tracks<00:02:33.450> and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
have gotten and yes no cut tracks and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.349 
have gotten and yes no cut tracks and
when<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.470> start<00:02:34.829> off<00:02:34.920> with<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.250> first<00:02:35.519> bundle<00:02:36.150> I

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
when I start off with the first bundle I

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.250 
when I start off with the first bundle I
do<00:02:36.720> tend<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.410> space<00:02:37.889> them<00:02:38.280> far<00:02:39.209> away<00:02:39.900> at<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
do tend to space them far away at the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.860 
do tend to space them far away at the
bottom<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.220> then<00:02:41.760> as<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.030> go<00:02:42.180> at<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.420> top<00:02:42.659> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
bottom and then as I go at the top the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.830 
bottom and then as I go at the top the
tracks<00:02:43.200> will<00:02:43.890> be<00:02:43.920> much<00:02:44.489> closer

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
tracks will be much closer

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.650 
tracks will be much closer
so<00:02:46.840> next<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.410> start<00:02:47.709> off<00:02:47.890> with<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.489> 12-inch<00:02:49.270> and

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
so next I start off with the 12-inch and

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.540 
so next I start off with the 12-inch and
this<00:02:50.080> is<00:02:50.230> how<00:02:50.379> far<00:02:50.680> I've<00:02:50.800> gotten<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.370> can

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
this is how far I've gotten you can

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.470 
this is how far I've gotten you can
almost<00:02:51.879> see<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.599> long<00:02:53.560> tapered<00:02:54.340> look<00:02:55.000> to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
almost see the long tapered look to

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.570 
almost see the long tapered look to
starting<00:02:56.470> off<00:02:56.590> with<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.890> shorter<00:02:57.280> length

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
starting off with the shorter length

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.449 
starting off with the shorter length
this<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.120> how<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:58.780> finished<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.379> top<00:02:59.650> edge<00:02:59.920> off

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
this is how I finished the top edge off

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.150 
this is how I finished the top edge off
and<00:03:00.940> then<00:03:01.540> I'm<00:03:01.690> going<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:01.989> finish<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.769> off<00:03:02.920> with

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
and then I'm going to finish it off with

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.640 
and then I'm going to finish it off with
the<00:03:03.340> 14<00:03:03.849> inch<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.420> I'm<00:03:04.540> going<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.810> go<00:03:04.989> in<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.290> big

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
the 14 inch and I'm going to go in a big

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.350 
the 14 inch and I'm going to go in a big
circle<00:03:06.340> at<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.239> top<00:03:07.420> with<00:03:08.019> them<00:03:08.380> pretty<00:03:08.830> close

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
circle at the top with them pretty close

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:26.480 
circle at the top with them pretty close
together

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.420 

so<00:03:27.490> since<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.240> am<00:03:28.300> not<00:03:28.840> going<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.470> be<00:03:29.680> using<00:03:30.280> the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
so since I am not going to be using the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.010 
so since I am not going to be using the
closure<00:03:30.730> I'm<00:03:31.000> going<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.240> show<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.510> exactly

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
closure I'm going to show you exactly

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.760 
closure I'm going to show you exactly
how<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:33.040> finish<00:03:33.520> this<00:03:33.700> off<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.390> am<00:03:35.050> going<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:35.500> take

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
push it into the center of the wig and

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.770 
push it into the center of the wig and
then<00:04:17.049> I'm<00:04:17.170> gonna<00:04:17.260> take<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.680> week<00:04:18.130> off<00:04:18.600> flip<00:04:19.600> it

then I'm gonna take the week off flip it

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.380 
then I'm gonna take the week off flip it
over<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.500> then<00:04:21.250> I'm<00:04:21.400> going<00:04:21.580> just<00:04:21.790> going<00:04:22.270> to

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
over and then I'm going just going to

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.040 
over and then I'm going just going to
just<00:04:22.600> make<00:04:22.870> sure<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.230> that<00:04:23.530> can<00:04:24.370> be<00:04:24.580> sewn<00:04:25.120> to

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
just make sure that that can be sewn to

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.880 
just make sure that that can be sewn to
the<00:04:26.080> inside<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.490> cap<00:04:28.330> so<00:04:28.720> that<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:29.290> is<00:04:29.500> even

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
the inside of the cap so that it is even

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.300 
the inside of the cap so that it is even
more<00:04:29.919> secure<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.970> won't<00:04:31.180> lift<00:04:31.510> up<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:33.070> can't

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
more secure it won't lift up you can't

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.840 
more secure it won't lift up you can't
pull<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.640> out<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.510> this<00:04:35.200> is<00:04:35.470> how<00:04:35.890> I<00:04:35.950> close<00:04:36.430> off

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
pull it out so this is how I close off

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.960 
pull it out so this is how I close off
wigs<00:04:37.690> if<00:04:38.169> I'm<00:04:38.440> not<00:04:38.650> using<00:04:39.010> any<00:04:39.430> type<00:04:39.910> of

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
wigs if I'm not using any type of

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.409 
wigs if I'm not using any type of
circular<00:04:40.510> closures<00:04:41.290> or<00:04:41.669> lace<00:04:42.669> closures<00:04:45.419> all

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
circular closures or lace closures all

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.680 
circular closures or lace closures all
right<00:04:46.660> so<00:04:46.930> now<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.140> closing<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.890> wig<00:04:48.130> is

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
right so now the closing of the wig is

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.050 
right so now the closing of the wig is
