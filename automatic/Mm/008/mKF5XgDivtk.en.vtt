00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.369 
because if Queen takes Knight there is a
family<00:02:42.840> fork<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.489> check<00:02:45.260> attacking<00:02:46.260> all

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
family fork this is check attacking all

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.729 
family fork this is check attacking all
the<00:02:46.530> Queen<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.370> rook<00:02:47.489> Wow

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
the Queen and the rook Wow

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.910 
the Queen and the rook Wow
okay<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:49.799> King<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.370> d7<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.000> better<00:02:51.420> more<00:02:51.920> King

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
okay so King to d7 is better more King

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.550 
okay so King to d7 is better more King
is<00:02:53.069> not<00:02:53.220> very<00:02:53.459> well<00:02:53.579> placed<00:02:54.079> that's<00:02:55.079> why<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> nun

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
is not very well placed that's why a nun

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.030 
is not very well placed that's why a nun
played<00:02:55.829> g5<00:02:56.280> he<00:02:56.489> wants<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.819> open<00:02:57.120> files<00:02:57.359> and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
played g5 he wants to open files and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.509 
played g5 he wants to open files and
carpet<00:02:59.040> played<00:02:59.280> f5<00:03:00.209> he<00:03:00.359> wants<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.720> keep

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
carpet played f5 he wants to keep

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.280 
carpet played f5 he wants to keep
position<00:03:02.519> closed<00:03:03.680> c3<00:03:05.569> pawn<00:03:06.569> takes<00:03:06.870> pawn<00:03:06.959> and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
position closed c3 pawn takes pawn and

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.429 
position closed c3 pawn takes pawn and
now<00:03:07.319> you<00:03:07.470> think<00:03:07.590> maybe<00:03:08.010> Knight<00:03:08.250> takes<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:09.030> keep

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
now you think maybe Knight takes to keep

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.800 
now you think maybe Knight takes to keep
pawn<00:03:10.439> structure<00:03:10.739> nice<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.340> tidy<00:03:11.810> undone

pawn structure nice and tidy undone

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.110 
pawn structure nice and tidy undone

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.029 
attacking at the moment Bishop on c5 and
there<00:04:17.279> is<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.700> trap<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.389> if<00:04:18.599> Queen<00:04:19.469> takes<00:04:19.709> Knight

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039

on

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
on

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.920 
on
five<00:04:22.169> then<00:04:23.099> that<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.460> check<00:04:23.849> NAFTA<00:04:24.720> knight

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
five then that is a check NAFTA knight

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.290
