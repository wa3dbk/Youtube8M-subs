is no bigger than a Mondeo and actually

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.359 
is no bigger than a Mondeo and actually
needn't<00:01:34.260> cost<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.650> much<00:01:34.890> more<00:01:35.130> than<00:01:35.340> a

that exactly feeling tiny it does feel a

that exactly feeling tiny it does feel a
lot<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.620> nimble<00:01:56.280> than<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> outgoing<00:01:56.790> one

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.170

and<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.440> vaguely<00:01:58.920> sporting<00:01:59.550> experience

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
and it is a vaguely sporting experience

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.270 
and it is a vaguely sporting experience
I<00:02:00.330> say<00:02:00.540> vaguely<00:02:00.900> because<00:02:01.500> well<00:02:01.770> then<00:02:01.950> expect

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
I say vaguely because well then expect

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.430 
I say vaguely because well then expect
it<00:02:02.370> to<00:02:02.460> romp<00:02:02.700> away<00:02:02.940> madly<00:02:03.420> easy<00:02:03.930> choice<00:02:04.260> of
