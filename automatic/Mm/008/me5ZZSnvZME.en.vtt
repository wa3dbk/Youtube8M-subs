for one sec so as I said before it's a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.479 
for one sec so as I said before it's a
flip<00:00:36.270> case<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> nice<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.530> soft<00:00:37.829> TPU

flip case with a nice really soft TPU

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.729 
flip case with a nice really soft TPU
material<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> inside<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.620> can

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
material on the inside there and you can

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.950 
material on the inside there and you can
see<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> flip<00:00:41.760> case<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.270> attached<00:00:42.600> onto

see the flip case it is attached onto
the<00:00:43.110> front<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.610> TPU<00:00:45.030> case

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the front so because it's TPU case

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.290 
the front so because it's TPU case
really<00:00:46.050> simple<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> put<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> phone<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.399> does

you can also take phone calls whilst the
flap<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.920> closed<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.030> has<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> nice

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
flap is closed because it has a nice

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.230 
flap is closed because it has a nice
speak<00:01:22.049> class<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.470> their<00:01:23.030> moves<00:01:24.030> about<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
speak class up their moves about a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.700 
speak class up their moves about a
little<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:24.930> nothing<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.530> worry

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
little bit but that's nothing to worry

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.010 
little bit but that's nothing to worry
about<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.490> won't<00:01:27.450> damage<00:01:27.570> around<00:01:27.869> at

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
about because it won't damage around at

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.270 
about because it won't damage around at
all<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.220> has<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.689> nice<00:01:30.869> magnetic<00:01:31.470> closure

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
all so it has a nice magnetic closure

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.600 
all so it has a nice magnetic closure
there<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.000> very<00:01:33.090> very<00:01:33.630> secure<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.259> won't

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
there see it's very very secure it won't

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.240 
there see it's very very secure it won't
come<00:01:35.610> off<00:01:35.670> easily<00:01:36.860> why<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.009> called<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
come off easily why it's called the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.160 
come off easily why it's called the
smart<00:01:38.520> case<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.990> here

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
smart case is because if you see here

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.120 
smart case is because if you see here
this<00:01:40.320> folds<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.939> this<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.229> has<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> magnetic<00:01:43.649> bit

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
this folds up this is has a magnetic bit

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.160 
this folds up this is has a magnetic bit
there<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.460> well<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.390> are<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> works<00:01:45.869> into

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
there as well so it are the works into

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.310 
there as well so it are the works into
animals<00:01:46.530> which<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.579> first<00:01:47.729> being<00:01:48.200> if<00:01:49.200> you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
animals which the first being if you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.270 
animals which the first being if you
prompt<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.799> backwards<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.579> rest<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.540> it

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
prompt it backwards like that rest on it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.210 
prompt it backwards like that rest on it
as<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:52.580> can<00:01:52.729> watch<00:01:52.960> videos<00:01:53.960> or<00:01:54.290> like<00:01:54.890> video

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
as you can watch videos or like video

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.010 
as you can watch videos or like video
call<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> much<00:01:55.970> more<00:01:56.150> comfortable<00:01:56.540> angle<00:01:56.659> and

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
call a much more comfortable angle and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.399 
call a much more comfortable angle and
the<00:01:57.710> second<00:01:58.100> one<00:01:58.220> being<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:59.030> angle<00:01:59.390> here<00:01:59.630> so

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
the second one being this angle here so

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.530 
the second one being this angle here so
if<00:02:00.650> you<00:02:00.740> want<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.920> train<00:02:01.220> or<00:02:01.580> for<00:02:02.060> example<00:02:02.090> you

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
if you want to train or for example you

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.719 
if you want to train or for example you
be<00:02:02.659> able<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:03.430> watch<00:02:04.430> movies<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:05.259> better<00:02:06.259> angle
