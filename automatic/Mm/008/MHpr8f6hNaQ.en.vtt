00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.530 
should they quit I know in ultimate team
that<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> biggest<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> biggest

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that was the biggest one of the biggest

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.510 
that was the biggest one of the biggest
concerns<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.350> dnf<00:01:31.770> people<00:01:32.220> were<00:01:32.490> always

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
concerns the dnf people were always

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
concerns the dnf people were always
hating<00:01:33.290> magnette<00:01:34.290> been<00:01:34.560> matched<00:01:34.829> against

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
hating magnette been matched against

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.550 
hating magnette been matched against
people<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.150> low<00:01:36.750> dnf<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.409> they'd

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
people with low dnf because they'd

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.929 
people with low dnf because they'd
always<00:01:37.740> quit<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.189> they<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.460> wind<00:01:38.640> one-nil

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
always quit if they just wind one-nil

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
always quit if they just wind one-nil
down<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:39.990> there's<00:01:40.200> any<00:01:40.409> critters<00:01:40.590> in

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
down so if there's any critters in

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.550 
down so if there's any critters in
online<00:01:41.220> seasons<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.200> get

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
online seasons then they will just get

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.410 
online seasons then they will just get
ripped<00:01:43.890> from<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> their<00:01:44.549> games<00:01:44.790> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
ripped from one of their games so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.620 
ripped from one of their games so
basically<00:01:45.869> they'll<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.460> bill<00:01:48.450> just

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
basically they'll just get a bill just

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.600 
basically they'll just get a bill just
lose<00:01:48.810> three<00:01:49.140> points<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:49.979> even<00:01:50.340> harder

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
lose three points so that's even harder

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.330 
lose three points so that's even harder
for<00:01:50.729> them<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.000> promoted<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> that's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
for them to get promoted and so that's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.240 
for them to get promoted and so that's
what<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.909> sort<00:01:54.090> out<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.250> rage

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
what that will sort out to the rage

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.690 
what that will sort out to the rage
