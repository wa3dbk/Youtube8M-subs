in this video I want to show you how to
do<00:00:14.120> the<00:00:14.330> smacking<00:00:14.870> acetate<00:00:15.380> technique<00:00:15.860> with<00:00:16.040> a

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
do the smacking acetate technique with a

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.320 
do the smacking acetate technique with a
little<00:00:16.340> bit<00:00:16.460> of<00:00:16.490> a<00:00:16.610> twist<00:00:16.880> on<00:00:17.090> it

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
little bit of a twist on it

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.810 
little bit of a twist on it
a<00:00:17.510> variation<00:00:18.020> for<00:00:18.440> what<00:00:18.530> we<00:00:18.619> usually<00:00:18.800> do<00:00:19.280> but

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
a variation for what we usually do but

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.220 
a variation for what we usually do but
before<00:00:20.090> we<00:00:20.180> do<00:00:20.330> that<00:00:20.360> let's<00:00:20.660> go<00:00:20.779> ahead<00:00:20.900> and

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
before we do that let's go ahead and

before we do that let's go ahead and
review<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.740> smacking<00:00:22.220> acetate<00:00:22.820> technique

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
review the smacking acetate technique

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.730 
review the smacking acetate technique
this<00:00:23.540> is<00:00:23.600> one<00:00:23.960> of<00:00:23.990> my<00:00:24.140> favorite<00:00:24.619> techniques

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
this is one of my favorite techniques

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.769 
this is one of my favorite techniques
because<00:00:25.279> it's<00:00:25.430> fast<00:00:25.700> it's<00:00:26.029> easy<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:26.540> you<00:00:26.630> can

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
because it's fast it's easy and you can

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.290 
because it's fast it's easy and you can
create<00:00:27.140> great<00:00:27.470> colorful<00:00:27.920> backgrounds<00:00:28.730> so

you'll notice that I've stamped right on

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.040 
you'll notice that I've stamped right on
the<00:00:31.070> smacking<00:00:31.460> acetate<00:00:31.880> technique<00:00:32.330> here<00:00:32.599> so

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
the smacking acetate technique here so

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.280 
the smacking acetate technique here so
let<00:00:33.170> me<00:00:33.230> show<00:00:33.410> you<00:00:33.500> how<00:00:33.620> I<00:00:33.650> did<00:00:33.800> that<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:36.110> want

let me show you how I did that you want
to<00:00:36.350> take<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:36.559> window<00:00:36.949> sheet<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:37.570> just<00:00:38.570> scribble

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
to take a window sheet and just scribble

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.049 
to take a window sheet and just scribble
on<00:00:39.170> it<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:39.530> as<00:00:39.739> you're<00:00:40.070> using<00:00:40.280> your<00:00:40.550> markers<00:00:40.910> to

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
on it so as you're using your markers to

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.490 
on it so as you're using your markers to
scribble<00:00:41.420> on<00:00:41.510> it<00:00:41.690> just<00:00:41.900> think<00:00:42.110> about<00:00:42.170> what

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
scribble on it just think about what

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.149 
scribble on it just think about what
direction<00:00:42.710> you<00:00:43.220> want<00:00:43.460> your<00:00:44.680> pattern<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:45.860> be<00:00:45.979> it

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
direction you want your pattern to be it

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.009 
direction you want your pattern to be it
and<00:00:46.370> just<00:00:46.879> go<00:00:47.030> ahead<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.330> add<00:00:47.479> the<00:00:47.659> color<00:00:47.839> to

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
and just go ahead and add the color to

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.619 
and just go ahead and add the color to
your<00:00:48.680> window<00:00:49.220> sheet<00:00:49.550> it's<00:00:49.850> always<00:00:50.239> best<00:00:50.479> to

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
your window sheet it's always best to

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.570 
your window sheet it's always best to
start<00:00:50.720> with<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.589> lightest<00:00:51.979> color<00:00:52.040> of<00:00:52.370> marker

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
start with the lightest color of marker

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.719 
start with the lightest color of marker
just<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:53.870> don't<00:00:54.170> get<00:00:54.550> darker<00:00:55.550> ink

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
just so that you don't get darker ink

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.170 
just so that you don't get darker ink
onto<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:56.330> and<00:00:56.479> just<00:00:56.809> keep<00:00:56.989> adding<00:00:57.260> color<00:00:57.710> here

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.320 

and<00:01:02.180> I'm<00:01:02.330> gonna<00:01:02.449> add<00:01:03.129> third<00:01:04.129> color<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.150> far

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
and I'm gonna add third color so so far

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.719
