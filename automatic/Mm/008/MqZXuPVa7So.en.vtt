was amazing headphone and it was a
no-brainer<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.810> use<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> design<00:00:19.380> language<00:00:19.590> to

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.130 
no-brainer to use the design language to
start<00:00:20.039> building<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> collection<00:00:21.140> it
