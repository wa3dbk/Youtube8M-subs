00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello dear friends with you flame show and 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.670
 winter hysteria continues in the absence of 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.740
 motorcycle by quadrocopter me often 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.210
 wrote whether he can take off the camera 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.240
 do he need cameras like this at all 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.510
 perhaps we are common to all of you and to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.390
 myself i attached a camera to it it was 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.910
 it's hard to practically camera from its keychain 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.619
 all had to make out bought 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.840
 special soldered small there 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.200
 the battery so that you can well as the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.120
 the helicopter could lift this weight so then he 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.149
 Of course not for weight he with one of the most 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.940
 fast helicopters and raise it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.469
 certainly something very hard but let's 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.360
 let's see what came of it anyway I 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.129
 I thought it was fun here we take off like 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.050
 here these twitchings it I manage it 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.149
 accordingly, the camera starts to twitch 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.920
 here we are already taking off to the level of the house and 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.809
 here it is the roof then Anton 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.060
 we took off just very very high 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.369
 I wanted to see this kind of baby 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.220
 helicopter take a look at our snowy 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.500
 city with camera 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.549
 Well, besides the fact that it removes waste 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.859
 on the quality that hundreds of 480 so she 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.020
 also general but from the vibration there is cracking 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:28.880
 Well, in general, the video is unstable 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.280
 so don't wait for anything here not gopro here 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.920
 how would i come down to manage it 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.219
 it's hard enough with the camera 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.140
 how could it be like that one two three times 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.759
 somewhere to check the bill just take off but 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.920
 fly so generally unreal now 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:48.109
 cold he got himself a second flight 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.890
 here is how my legs spread 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:54.979
 turn into tentacles i don't know 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.670
 vibrate it all from vibe here 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.280
 spinning even around its axis we 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.319
 rise again he raises the light so 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.979
 limp as if he were without a camera we 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:09.379
 already turned into a point in the sky here 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.299
 the wires here goes me very surprised how 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.549
 it would seem to me from below that it was just there 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.220
 clear sky i'm here get into these wires 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.170
 that's what interesting birds hunt them 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.579
 the birds begin 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.420
 But when they fly close, he 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:26.720
 also a Jew that they intersect and 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.720
 plowing in their attics is simple 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.490
 here in him as if when he is high there 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.620
 he starts the storm saw the bird 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.750
 which goal and it starts shorter 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.630
 a drop such a baby falls snow it 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.060
 such general flights and ended thanks 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.280
 for watching like if you have it 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.310
 pleased what happened you saw me 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.310
 I think it was funny no more 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.890
 fly it again 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.620

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.660
