 hello very good morning today we are going to 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.000
 work with an ingredient that has been 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.880
 one of the maximum contributions of 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.950
 mexico to kitchens around the world 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.580
 the tomato next the 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.580
 ingredients 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.720
 and here we are going to do a procedure 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.180
 what is it called is footwear let's go 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.890
 the tomatoes a few minutes water 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.720
 hot that I already have the stove and for 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.760
 that the skin comes out faster because the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.060
 we want without skin they will see how easy 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.300
 we're just going to make a little cross 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:51.260
 in the part that is called the peru ass 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.390
 here we are going to make a cross 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.600
 to all our tomatoes and of 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.059
 preference when you make this sauce 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.309
 use very ripe tomatoes not the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.140
 green tomatoes or when at home already 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.570
 have some days there with the tomatoes 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.509
 and they are spoiling take out 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.549
 do this procedure and they will see 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.630
 how delicious is your sauce for pizza for 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.390
 pasta also garlic very important 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.750
 this flavor that we are going to give to our 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.280
 sauce with garlic 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.040
 use two teeth 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.250
 today I think I did not have a good breakfast because I did not 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.800
 I had the strength to cut my eyes another 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.400
 big 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.080
 now yes blunt and look how good 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.990
 how fast the skin of the waves 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.360
 is 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.620
 we help with this and we have 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.740
 ready 2 cloves of garlic 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.120
 our tomatoes cut so they do not 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.740
 come out of the skin and now 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.580
 we also go to the stove where the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.580
 water is boiling 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.300
 Well, we have our tomatoes ready 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.410
 after being in cooking 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.410
 approximately 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.160
 four minutes and you how fast it comes out 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.530
 the skin 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.270
 here we have to do a little bit 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.840
 hot so I helped me with a 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.879
 knife 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.099
 to remove the skin of the tomato because 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.180
 if we need all this skin and zita 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.459
 stay out before liquefying 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.840
 this I here I'm removing the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.840
 certain are our beds 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.840
 very well, because our tomatoes are already 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.940
 well pegaditos just crush them a 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.520
 little look at you this water that they have 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.990
 it's just the tomato juice nothing 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.950
 more crush them to help you a little 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.000
 the blender 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.000
 let's put in the blender 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.470
 with all excessive 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.980
 let's add the garlic 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.630
 a lot of flavor here we are going to eat 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.630
 the Italian flavor with mccann oregano 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.670
 and we will also put some herbs 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.290
 Thin improved in rosemary thyme 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.579
 salvia 100% Italian flavors have 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.579
 here tomato puree 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.990
 and this is also going to help us 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.260
 although the tomato already with its own 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.739
 juices 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.360
 it's not going to liquefy very well 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.680
 we repeat the procedure of not putting 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.680
 the lid and liquefy 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.320
 our sauce list look I'm 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.000
 making 22 preparations for 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.770
 which can we use it 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.750
 you can use it as a means as a 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.729
 base for a pizza for a sauce if the 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.310
 we want more thick we leave it 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.770
 minutes more on the stove so that the 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.449
 sauce condense a little more and 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.090
 only with being here putting him 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.229
 we know the aroma of oregano 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:16.150
 garlic those delicious Italian flavors 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.150
 Now we go to the oven and try 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.710
 Well, since I'm ready with my 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.720
 spoon to delight with these rich 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.280
 hikes look how fast how easy what 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.080
 practical and what a nice way to 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.139
 present to the family something that 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.009
 surely they will share at home here 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.529
 we have our dolls 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:58.659
 do them and that we continue giving that 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.659
 value so important to Mexican tomatoes
