when we're using no wait we just got a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.550 
when we're using no wait we just got a
swivel<00:01:17.820> tied<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.170> swivel<00:01:19.500> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
swivel tied up there and the swivel is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.469

just<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.830> keep<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.159> line<00:01:20.759> from<00:01:21.000> twitch<00:01:21.240> them

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
just to keep your line from twitch them

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.880 
just to keep your line from twitch them
up<00:01:21.570> because<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:22.049> shed<00:01:22.290> when<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.590> hook<00:01:22.740> them

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
up because they shed when you hook them

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.620 
up because they shed when you hook them
sometimes<00:01:23.670> they'll<00:01:23.850> spin<00:01:24.090> coming<00:01:24.420> through

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
sometimes they'll spin coming through

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.969 
sometimes they'll spin coming through
the<00:01:24.689> water<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> swivel<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.740> kind<00:01:25.920> of

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the water so the swivel just kind of

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.980

keeps<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.400> keep<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.240> line<00:01:27.390> from<00:01:27.420> twisting

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
keeps you keep your line from twisting
