00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.629
 hello everyone I'm Jonathan and in another 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.990
 video for my channel what I'm going to do 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:10.570
 is to teach how to record our games 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.030
 spoken well that is all those 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.750
 gameplays videogames I do not know how you 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.429
 they call that they are spoken there are many 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.009
 times as a tutorial form of a game 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:23.730
 of everything and it's pretty good is used 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.730
 the frank program 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.740
 how to record and configure everything is in 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.350
 other channels but I 'm going to teach it to 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.240
 configure the mobile you are going to 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.190
 learn to select the key with the 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.860
 which will start will select the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.580
 pc on which the game will work and 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.989
 here the record usually does not appear 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.110
 external input that would be the microphone 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.230
 ok let's put the exterior tildan 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.809
 this and leave it there once this is done 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.059
 what we are going to do is go to click 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.979
 secondary on the recording panel 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:01.150
 there and let's see that the microphone is in 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:05.210
 this volume that would be at the maximum rate 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.190
 Yesterday end up here in the second and no 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.970
 because they are going to notice that the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.220
 Very strong improvement and in 20% once done 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.320
 this we are going to accept now yes what 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.750
 let's do is open the game in this 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.570
 case is going to be the point blank point 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.850
 white I do not know how he calls them I do not know the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.400
 pronunciation is strange to me 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.350
 I'm going to enter my account 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.910
 the password let's enter and the game 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.910
 just started 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.119
 We hope to apply the new file only 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.560
 we have to wait for him to load everything 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.670
 to follow the game and just enter 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.670
 choose a server and we will configure 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 this 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.890
 ok now in the control panel of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.620
 audio volume to look for the where 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.670
 it says here point blank and the audio I want 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.709
 drop it to 30% because it's this 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.230
 because one when recording with the frap what 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.880
 it does is capture all the sound whether 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.890
 there is system sound also bach and no 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.209
 make or to capture the sound the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.120
 system will capture if there is a 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.190
 messenger on facebook on twitter all 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.510
 his sounds that he will capture him and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.209
 another block we just want that 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.700
 capture what would be the game and capture 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.260
 our voice because put it at 30% for 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.350
 lower the volume of what would be 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.380
 our game and if we speak it 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.260
 listen to us since all the video comes out 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.420
 with an audio on a single track and not on 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.310
 two channels so I will not be able 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.350
 we will have the possibility to master 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.000
 these and lower the volume to what will be 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.350
 the game so that our voice is more 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.600
 clear ok 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.190
 Once you have understood, I suppose 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.000
 is understood what we are going to do is 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.470
 enter a server whatever be 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.470
 just to try let's go here 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.120
 Lets put 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.010
 I do not like this map 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.870
 this is good 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.140
 here you can notice game 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.590
 I'm going to press the 5 key and I would have 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.599
 to start recording 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.950
 You may notice you are recording the game 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.950
 is going to slow king you notice 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.760
 there is 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.860
 do not wait for it to be professional bhatti 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.200
 one with a pump I'm not professional in 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.200
 the game but I get distracted enough 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.330
 well the program is already recording can 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.790
 notice is heard in everything that would be the 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.049
 audio of the game and they will listen 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.970
 again what I'm saying 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.670
 repeated because I'm going to play the 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.819
 video for you to see and verify 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.300
 that really has been recorded with my voice and 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.970
 the game audio ok 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.560
 now they are killing me wetering I finished 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.560
 to record I will give out 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.190
 I will not minimize because it is something 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.450
 completely 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:18.400
 well until it comes out then a lot I'll 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.400
 to enter my frappe video folder 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.060
 must have several others here 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.060
 now 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.060
 38 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.560
 this is 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.930
 Now it's quiet and it only sounds 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.930
 the video 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.349
 you may notice you are recording the slow game 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.650
 ah 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.939
 a professional or mateo experience 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.949
 of bach and one with a profession bomb in 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.949
 the game but I get distracted 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.779
 well the program is already recording can 

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:12.749
 not to stay because it would be the audio of 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:14.519
 game and they will listen again what 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.989
 I'm saying repeated because I'm going to 

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:18.569
 play the video so that you 

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:22.770
 see and verify that you really have 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:26.819
 recorded with my voice and audio and nigeria 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.460
 ok pause the video you can notice is 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.080
 works perfectly in mixture in 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.569
 windows xp is a bit medium 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.310
 complicated but in the stereo mix that 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.840
 If you see the video you will know what 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.810
 I'm talking about what you have to do is 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.300
 lower the volume to 30% by calculating 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.740
 what would be an exterior mixture I 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.210
 done that they already record their videos 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.819
 commented well I have nothing more than 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.680

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.300
