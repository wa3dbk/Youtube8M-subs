keep it clean now the one on the box

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.730 
keep it clean now the one on the box
what<00:01:06.970> it's<00:01:07.180> made<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.479> do<00:01:07.810> this<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.170> go<00:01:08.350> around

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
what it's made to do this you go around

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.550 
what it's made to do this you go around
one<00:01:09.700> way<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.180> then<00:01:10.270> change<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.840> another<00:01:11.289> way

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
one way and then change it another way

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.700 
one way and then change it another way
and<00:01:11.950> change<00:01:12.430> it<00:01:12.640> again<00:01:12.929> so<00:01:13.929> that<00:01:14.170> when<00:01:14.440> you<00:01:14.560> go

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
and change it again so that when you go

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.680 
and change it again so that when you go
through<00:01:15.009> around<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.610> three<00:01:15.819> times<00:01:16.119> it<00:01:16.300> takes<00:01:16.330> a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
through around it three times it takes a

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.080 
through around it three times it takes a
different<00:01:16.899> route<00:01:17.350> yeah<00:01:18.069> I'll<00:01:18.220> only<00:01:18.429> problem<00:01:18.940> I

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
different route yeah I'll only problem I

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.559 
different route yeah I'll only problem I
have<00:01:19.390> or<00:01:19.659> idea<00:01:20.500> time<00:01:20.770> is<00:01:21.310> stopping<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.179> trains

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
have or idea time is stopping the trains

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.680 
have or idea time is stopping the trains
and<00:01:22.869> you'll<00:01:23.440> see<00:01:23.770> there<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:25.149> little<00:01:25.330> orange

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
and you'll see there the little orange

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.279 
and you'll see there the little orange
stick<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.890> can<00:01:27.729> stop<00:01:28.000> it<00:01:28.209> there<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.840> orange<00:01:29.200> one

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
stick I can stop it there the orange one

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.430 
stick I can stop it there the orange one
on<00:01:29.709> RC<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:31.060> if<00:01:31.270> you're<00:01:31.390> running<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.959> you<00:01:32.229> might

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
on RC so if you're running to you might

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.760 
on RC so if you're running to you might
find<00:01:32.709> a<00:01:32.950> hard<00:01:33.459> to<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.840> know<00:01:34.869> they'll<00:01:35.380> crash

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
find a hard to you know they'll crash

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.789 
find a hard to you know they'll crash
it's<00:01:36.159> easier<00:01:36.549> with<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.789> RC<00:01:37.420> now<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.200> second

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
it's easier with the RC now the second

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.620 
it's easier with the RC now the second
thing<00:01:38.830> I'm<00:01:39.100> not<00:01:39.340> big<00:01:39.580> on<00:01:39.759> building<00:01:40.360> some

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
thing I'm not big on building some

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.230 
thing I'm not big on building some
bridges<00:01:40.929> and<00:01:41.319> I<00:01:41.950> gave<00:01:42.220> my<00:01:42.399> bridge<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:43.000> my

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
bridges and I gave my bridge to my

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.950 
bridges and I gave my bridge to my
nephew<00:01:43.450> so<00:01:43.959> the<00:01:44.860> cheapest<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.520> Joe<00:01:45.939> is<00:01:45.969> on<00:01:46.359> in<00:01:46.630> 15

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
nephew so the cheapest a Joe is on in 15

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.709 
nephew so the cheapest a Joe is on in 15
you<00:01:47.350> gotta<00:01:47.560> clean<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.130> trot<00:01:48.430> hundred<00:01:49.390> fifty

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
you gotta clean the trot hundred fifty

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.010 
you gotta clean the trot hundred fifty
dollars<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.350> made<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.159> Ray<00:01:51.460> loads<00:01:51.789> up<00:01:52.119> out<00:01:52.539> of<00:01:52.600> it

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
dollars I made to Ray loads up out of it

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.120 
dollars I made to Ray loads up out of it
and<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.979> my<00:01:57.520> final<00:01:57.820> design<00:01:58.829> anyways<00:01:59.829> if

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
and this is my final design anyways if

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.760 
and this is my final design anyways if
you<00:02:00.670> want<00:02:01.179> to<00:02:01.299> do<00:02:01.450> some<00:02:01.780> really<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.649> know

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
you want to do some really you know

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.819 
you want to do some really you know
getting<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.159> trains<00:02:03.579> in<00:02:03.789> and<00:02:04.000> out<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:05.530> good

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
getting the trains in and out it's good

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.509 
getting the trains in and out it's good
hi<00:02:06.130> six<00:02:06.490> but<00:02:07.350> remember<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.739> turnouts<00:02:09.220> are

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
hi six but remember the turnouts are

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.060 
hi six but remember the turnouts are
different<00:02:10.030> there's<00:02:10.450> two<00:02:10.690> for<00:02:11.109> signing<00:02:11.680> and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
different there's two for signing and

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.930 
different there's two for signing and
two<00:02:12.519> for<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.530> loop<00:02:14.530> personally<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.400> think<00:02:15.519> you'd

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
two for a loop personally I think you'd

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.530 
two for a loop personally I think you'd
better<00:02:16.150> buying<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.070> auto<00:02:18.070> city<00:02:18.820> loader<00:02:19.239> if

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
better buying the auto city loader if

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.740 
better buying the auto city loader if
you<00:02:19.690> need<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> turnout<00:02:20.650> sixes<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:22.239> about

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
you need a turnout sixes is about

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.630 
you need a turnout sixes is about
average<00:02:23.790> anyways<00:02:24.790> uh<00:02:25.530> that's<00:02:26.530> all<00:02:26.829> I<00:02:26.890> did<00:02:27.160> I

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
average anyways uh that's all I did I

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.290 
average anyways uh that's all I did I
hope<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.420> enjoy<00:02:28.690> my<00:02:28.720> video
