00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.309
 in 1989 the first method in Italy was the method devised by the surgeon of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.729
 Vallarsa 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:13.979
 play now 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:18.109
 regarding the open vector rhinoplasty of the tip 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.170

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.240
 work out to modify the nose tip the nose in toto 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.130
 in a three-dimensional manner and customizing it on the wishes of the 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.390
 patient 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.630
 better yet we came out of the standard methods that led to one 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.090
 I am very stereotyped very similar to the patient to patient we have 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.910
 finally the possibility to choose the nose together with our client at 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.430
 our patient 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.149
 the best nose for the smile is the total customization 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.280
 this method 3 is also dedicated to one of the most delicate areas in the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.440
 aesthetic correction and also functional that the tip of the nose 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.250
 all the plastic surgeons are on the tip of the nose to play one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.510
 game and very important about the position 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.430
 regarding the relationship between the tip of the back but also with regard to the 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.770
 functionality of the sea 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.480
 here immediately above the tip cartilages of the tip we have 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.480
 a very delicate woman who has so called nasal valve 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.710
 we have all seen them on television at the cinema or athletes 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.540
 characters that certain situations cannot do without the nasal cerretino 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.840
 this cerratina serves to enlarge the den of the valve 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790
 when a surgery too aggressive 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.520
 I have a trauma 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.969
 has created one 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.350
 valve fall 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.619
 here the tip besides being visually restricted also works 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.440
 worse 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.520
 here is the need for a method that is respectful of aesthetics 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 and function at the same time 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.560
 firmness solved these problems beautifully and 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:11.719
 her 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:17.279
 foster totti train plastik is part of a third of the scaffolding of my method 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.379
 global 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.279
 which is associated with structural rhinoplasty and the mind or the 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:27.739
 turbinoplasty modified according to my method which allows us to give
