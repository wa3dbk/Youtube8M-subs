00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
I'm not paying it elsewhere so there's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.009 
I'm not paying it elsewhere so there's
two<00:02:35.400> ways<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.760> which<00:02:35.819> minimalism<00:02:36.300> has<00:02:36.810> helped

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
two ways in which minimalism has helped

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.670 
two ways in which minimalism has helped
me<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.200> save<00:02:37.380> money<00:02:37.590> also<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.400> third<00:02:39.150> way<00:02:39.330> is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
me to save money also a third way is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.470 
me to save money also a third way is
minimalism<00:02:40.680> has<00:02:40.860> changed<00:02:41.250> my<00:02:41.370> thinking<00:02:41.480> in

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
minimalism has changed my thinking in

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.190 
minimalism has changed my thinking in
general<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:44.040> I'm<00:02:44.459> always<00:02:45.209> just<00:02:45.690> kind<00:02:45.989> of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
general so I'm always just kind of

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.160 
general so I'm always just kind of
thinking<00:02:46.680> small<00:02:47.130> now<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.670> thinking<00:02:48.540> simply

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
thinking small now and thinking simply

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.789 
thinking small now and thinking simply
so<00:02:50.480> even<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.569> things<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.989> have<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.230> buy<00:02:52.530> like
