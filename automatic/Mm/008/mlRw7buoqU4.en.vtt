 A second time and thank you. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.890
 could talk about compensation for 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.439
 you see alexandre guy how it works 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.229
 this question of validity would be 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.610
 this automotive hygiene that people 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.759
 both hear talk 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.799
 first thing today is I brought a 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.630
 called a pain machine which is a 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.990
 American technique and he does 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.579
 car side roof hygiene 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.020
 carpet seats and if the car with bench 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.200
 leather we make the process of 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.259
 hygiene with hydration this to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.390
 eliminate fungi and bacteria 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.580
 microbacteria 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.710
 and leaving the car with a smell 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.690
 nice he tries to leave the car 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.590
 full as it reaches new car is only 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.590
 make mistake, right? 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.130
 and usually have people looking for 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.870
 to give with open glasses, right? 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.580
 although our climate that does not 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.230
 it allowed too hot the guy has to 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.110
 use but there are lots of people who do not like 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.590
 the embassy here happens he can 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.660
 to them under glass and that pollution goes 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.700
 getting into the vehicle 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.190
 and then she goes running on the walls of 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.560
 car but it's on the car's 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.230
 so it accumulates a dirt and 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.640
 our equipment he can eliminate 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:54.150
 those and those filth and also as 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.550
 to say yes is the air conditioning who uses 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.500
 much to the accused turns off the 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.080
 Brazil and begins to create bacteria 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.720
 that begin to identify those a 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.160
 indication that it starts in depth is not 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.410
 It is also necessary to do the hygiene 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.190
 air conditioning ducts not only from the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.560
 which in the part is side telescopic frames 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.860
 the party but also together when you 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.810
 does the vehicle sanitize you 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.180
 also makes use of pipelines to 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.400
 leave the car against a pleasant 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.110
 smell that's when you make a 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.680
 indemnity came to operate from 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.640
 House 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.079
 if you do not look, keep a 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.480
 speeding up the air conditioning 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.220
 clean filters filter change it goes 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.660
 start giving trouble at home will give 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.000
 problem in the vehicle will give problem 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.049
 When you enter you will limit 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.049
 sinusitis ne 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.640
 This is the process of a day is a day of 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.620
 job 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.830
 then the car is made this process of 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.140
 one day one day 4 to 4 pm 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.170
 More or less it's done 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.030
 he enters here in the country the checklist o 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.129
 car is done any lifting that 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.659
 have to do not have the car dented is 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.579
 crossed out and this survey was 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.650
 to be able to pass as security 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.349
 he left the car credibly a 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.540
 right warranty service 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.919
 and this process takes six hours 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.519
 because the car is being washed 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.769
 car 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.050
 wash the wheel case or the process 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.690
 of sanitation to express indemnity 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.880
 surroundings will more or less up to another 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.500
 every eight hours will get the car 4 and 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.600
 6 5 pm 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.340
 the two professionals he has to 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.919
 work with at least ensuring the 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.110
 security it right then it's gone 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.090
 achievement and work with glove works 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.030
 with mask works with everything not to 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.430
 letting go is even hair falling, huh? 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:50.039
 does not have a security process and 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.039
 also generating the customer's vehicle 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.110
 in any case there is some time to 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.650
 if you start this idea is this 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.530
 hygienization is the very air 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.650
 conditioning is how banks are 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.560
 this order of hygiene exists 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.720
 Yes, it 's the car that comes in. It's done. 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.950
 process of washing the process of 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.450
 sanitation 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.340
 this process of innovation will use the 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.480
 equipment making the car with 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.260
 leather seat 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.000
 after facial cleansing moisturizing 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.860
 after the service done all part of 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.280
 people that hydration is made 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.090
 inspiration ended the inspiration the car 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.370
 is closed is to put the equipment of 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.130
 nebulization by placing a product 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.300
 to make the car pay the 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.720
 the vehicle is connected to the vehicle 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.270
 boot in the warm air leaves the question of ten 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.910
 minutes and then another ten minutes with 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.160
 air conditioning on and will then make the 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.380
 complete hygiene in the alexandre case 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.640
 You said it 's necessary to do it. 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.890
 to maintain good hygiene 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.290
 at least every six months. 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:03.740
 months in the six-month preference would be 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.050
 good because there is this is the forecast is a 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.210
 It's a good face , too. 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.420
 but ideally every six months to 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.560
 ensure streamlining and cleaning of the 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.560
 vehicle inside the event 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.800
 In this case the guarantee of this service is 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.780
 how much time of six months even six 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.940
 months the guarantee had not remains 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.500
 even though the customer does not 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.740
 like the service we forward the 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.750
 until he felt like one today. 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.300
 I felt nice, you're staying with the 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.210
 vehicle in case you also spoke of 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.800
 hygienization of the leather bench is there 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.470
 some specific material for the various 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.050
 agencies does not exist it is used a 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:48.260
 hygiene product which is a 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.510
 product that also imports it along with 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.850
 after finishing with the productions 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:57.110
 Equals here is a moisturizer is the 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:59.000
 3g technology - in fact this product 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.520
 ventures from outside are also not 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.200
 what is high technology 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.970
 So, there, my brother, if you suddenly 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.760
 You need to do that. 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.220
 sanitation in your car to let him 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.780
 with a pleasant smell and lives 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.390
 pollution is also found on a daily basis 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.410
 This is the request so stay there with the 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.410
 cleaning your car 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.920
 ae
