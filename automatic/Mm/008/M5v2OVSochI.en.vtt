them<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.270> thought<00:01:03.719> since<00:01:03.780> they're<00:01:04.140> already

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
them so I thought since they're already

them so I thought since they're already
there<00:01:04.860> out<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> open<00:01:05.820> normally<00:01:06.390> they're

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
there out in the open normally they're

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.039 
there out in the open normally they're
put<00:01:07.260> away<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.470> cases<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:09.060> thought<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.869> uses

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
put away in cases I thought as it uses

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.960 
put away in cases I thought as it uses
up<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.710> show<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.130> few<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.700> ideals

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
up there and do show a few of ideals

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570 
up there and do show a few of ideals
this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> actually<00:01:12.689> less<00:01:12.869> than<00:01:12.900> half<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.580> the
