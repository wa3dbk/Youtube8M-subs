00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
very very well researched I mean not

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.220

this particular incident in the film but
there'll<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.410> many<00:00:25.650> incidents<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.130> this

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
there'll be many incidents like this

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.820 
there'll be many incidents like this
which<00:00:26.490> are<00:00:26.580> very<00:00:26.820> very<00:00:27.000> similar<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:28.170> it's

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
which are very very similar and it's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.220 
which are very very similar and it's
obviously<00:00:29.070> fabricated<00:00:29.699> from<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:31.050> life

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
obviously fabricated from to life

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.340

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
instances of mollified from there so his

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.950 
instances of mollified from there so his
research<00:00:34.920> was<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.340> solid<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.880> his<00:00:36.510> briefs<00:00:36.780> was

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960

so<00:00:37.110> solid<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.559> us<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:38.480> then<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.570> didn't<00:00:39.840> have

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
so solid to us that then I didn't have

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.690 
so solid to us that then I didn't have
