00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.440
 night forms with volleyball from 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:42.000
 magic of his feet I advise you to 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:44.250
 out of a dime change all of me guys 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.100
 they are rich for the last few fetal times 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.289
 we are that today with the player of put 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 yes yes we the last tv truth it 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.850
 we decided to define it seaf and not 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.980
 tiff because for us the record version 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.920
 baker is a separate version therefore for 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.920
 we this msx iv first of all must 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.539
 thank a lot of native christmas 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.140
 that the guy who pressed us this 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.900
 player 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.450
 really thank you this proves 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.670
 like the reality of recent times pedara se 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.450
 is increasingly growing and therefore i 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.740
 boys trust us and therefore 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.650
 players also come to lend us 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.470
 but let's talk about this right away 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.479
 mostriciattoli resigned 96 overall and already 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.320
 makes me realize how strong this is 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.259
 player 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.240
 98 ball control ie it speaks for itself 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.200
 the value and then to all characteristics 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.320
 green when you go to the footer you see 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.530
 all 98 99 95 92 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.759
 in the end it is quite simplistic 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.409
 explain to you all the values ​​because you can 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.890
 already imagine when you sometimes this 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.540
 player 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.659
 let's say I want to help you 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.360
 comparison with the toti version because 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.320
 obviously we also brought the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.600
 totti version like all the other toti 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.130
 so you can the team of the year 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.750
 go and see that review vi 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.460
 we leave the link then we also did 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.360
 the utah area the record prayer so who 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.780
 better than us 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.679
 or maybe no one can tell you better than us 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.410
 the comparison for this then put in the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.410
 complex a fantastic 98 player of 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.620
 dribbling 4 star skill agility 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.510
 crazy 95 I have the ball control 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.520
 said 98 you can skip opponents 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.590
 with a disarming ease 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.440
 the only little problem I found 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.200
 also this time in the review put 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.940
 sif was that he practically took 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.470
 forced from all sides 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.060
 I have put three four sides on it 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.480
 because you have to see it 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.310
 you can't see what they are of 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.590
 they kill practically because of course 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.630
 they see the player laugh when he is 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.230
 strong and try to stop it in all 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.910
 ways if I sincerely can 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.500
 seem a little presumptuous 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.080
 now, however, when I felt that when 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.450
 I found opponents who didn't know much 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.170
 defends reja I said no but what the heck did I do 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.390
 I get bored 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.970
 but not because I was a fool in the 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.010
 to say this but because I enjoyed it more 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.959
 with opponents who knew how to defend 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.060
 because I did n't do right and left with the 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.190
 ball control and discarded all 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.980
 world and I had more fun maybe can 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.680
 use a half skill agility 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.310
 done well because it was more fun in the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.230
 complex 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.560
 let's say that with the toti version the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.630
 dribbling for almost the same but you believe 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.780
 strongly the version endowed with respect to 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.900
 this concerns shooting because at 94 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.760
 on the social paper scioni sip and 99 di 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.489
 finalization in area and goal nine on 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.459
 ten really maybe 10 out of 10 no because 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.120
 if not it would be no more 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.190
 fun to operate though 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.959
 nine out of ten to put it in a 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.849
 long shot level for me the version 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.230
 dowries is a little bit higher because 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.299
 with this version I do not say that not 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.040
 I could do them for god's sake 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.099
 but I did n't like them the way I did 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.440
 liked with the version toti then to 84 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.269
 of tv power if he had maybe 90 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.659
 it would have been reading mentally though 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:09.049
 however put it then you understand well then 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.900
 at the level of hulk for me it is excellent medium 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.280
 low with 97 repositioning he is 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.590
 always impositions 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.570
 honestly I recommend using it 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.090
 in a web ditch because I really like it 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.630
 the more it has more field it manages to serve with 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.120
 its handle step 91 on the card with 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.370
 94 of short 80 tv that manages to serve 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.010
 the two wings so you can be assigned 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.470
 the wings that mark him because he has more 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.389
 field in my opinion here manages to exploit 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.270
 the 99 of acceleration that a value 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.400
 absurd because guys really mean when 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.919
 start the first step does not stop them 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.470
 nobody you can go crazy like you want 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.440
 but he jumps me to the first one at first 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.320
 acceleration any defender 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.289
 have against then overall I have to 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.410
 to say that the totti version I repeat before 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.030
 nor a superior span but we specify 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.130
 not very much 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.260
 maybe a meeting may be the price 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.820
 because less than 15 million is not found 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.099
 like all other versions also the 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.229
 record prey that the toti do not succeed 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.120
 to find a version as soon as I arrive 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.530
 15 million if they take it 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.599
 as soon as a player arrives at the beginning 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.070
 miserable they take so it's hard though 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.620
 all in all a player 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.680
 wonderful I hope I liked it 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.169
 I made the intro of the video a bit 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.349
 particular and nothing the review stands for 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.180
 finish now I will list instead read 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:30.440
 these site that the flop of this 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.419
 player 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.789
 the final grade must also be given 10 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.430
 here because it is truly supreme indeed 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:40.370
 very strong the only small against maybe 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.810
 it can be a bit like the physical strength of 65 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.050
 pre improved compared to the version 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.510
 record prayer let's say you can be 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.320
 a little against but mednick because of the 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.020
 end 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.330
 skip opponents without problems can 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.290
 happen one twice that during the 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.750
 they stop me 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:00.380
 what about the weak foot and even a little 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.680
 because you do n't hear the stars anymore 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.380
 weak of the three stars weak foot 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.900
 general a great player boys 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.970
 nothing the review is going to end I would say 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.920
 that you can leave us so many like 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.390
 because you have seen that we are bringing them all 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.330
 practically the reviews I hope the 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.890
 you like our work and nothing we do 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.490
 let's see in an upcoming video 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.490
 hello everyone guys
