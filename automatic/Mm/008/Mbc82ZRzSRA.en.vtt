much helped everything in terms of wind
conditions<00:00:45.820> it<00:00:46.630> was<00:00:46.720> really<00:00:47.140> nice<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:47.710> sort<00:00:48.280> of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
conditions it was really nice to sort of

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.690 
conditions it was really nice to sort of
warm<00:00:49.510> up<00:00:49.720> from<00:00:50.140> like<00:00:50.350> light<00:00:50.710> air<00:00:50.890> like<00:00:51.430> a<00:00:51.460> sort

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
warm up from like light air like a sort

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.540 
warm up from like light air like a sort
of<00:00:51.730> light<00:00:51.940> light<00:00:52.270> air<00:00:52.420> event<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:53.110> now<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:54.100> guess

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
of light light air event to now I guess

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.610 
of light light air event to now I guess
today<00:00:54.790> we<00:00:54.910> saw<00:00:55.030> double<00:00:55.300> trapping<00:00:55.720> and<00:00:56.080> you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
know there was more urgency involved in

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.960 
know there was more urgency involved in
manoeuvres<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.350> things<00:00:59.559> like<00:00:59.680> that<00:00:59.739> so<00:01:00.160> today

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
manoeuvres and things like that so today

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:10.140 
manoeuvres and things like that so today
was<00:01:01.090> great<00:01:01.270> sailing<00:01:01.540> today<00:01:01.960> was<00:01:02.080> really<00:01:02.320> fun

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.170 

well<00:01:11.080> I<00:01:11.110> guess<00:01:11.350> I've<00:01:11.860> been<00:01:12.100> selling<00:01:12.550> home<00:01:12.700> 16

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
well I guess I've been selling home 16

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.510 
well I guess I've been selling home 16
since<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:14.140> age<00:01:14.260> of<00:01:14.530> 16<00:01:15.370> so<00:01:16.270> that's<00:01:16.930> back<00:01:17.520> 14

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
since the age of 16 so that's back 14

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.970 
since the age of 16 so that's back 14
years<00:01:18.730> ago<00:01:18.880> why<00:01:19.660> I<00:01:19.690> liked<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.140> so<00:01:20.290> much<00:01:20.320> I<00:01:20.710> guess

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
years ago why I liked it so much I guess

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.890 
years ago why I liked it so much I guess
it's<00:01:21.250> because<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:22.180> can<00:01:22.360> tell<00:01:22.600> there's<00:01:22.870> a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
it's because you can tell there's a

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.390 
it's because you can tell there's a
mixed<00:01:23.230> group<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.710> works<00:01:23.890> out<00:01:24.040> really<00:01:24.250> well

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400
