of<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.790> speed<00:00:06.150> changer<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:08.000> 1958<00:00:09.000> TV

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
of the speed changer on the 1958 TV

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.700 
of the speed changer on the 1958 TV
walked<00:00:10.080> behind<00:00:10.610> just<00:00:11.610> did<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> 55<00:00:12.710> Super

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
walked behind just did the 55 Super

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.300 
walked behind just did the 55 Super
Deluxe<00:00:14.089> alright<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:16.080> decided<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:17.100> one

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
Deluxe alright and I decided to do one

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.120 
Deluxe alright and I decided to do one
with<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> 58<00:00:18.470> because<00:00:19.470> there's<00:00:19.619> no<00:00:19.740> foot<00:00:19.980> on

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
with the 58 because there's no foot on

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.029 
with the 58 because there's no foot on
it<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.490> hopefully<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> get<00:00:21.210> some<00:00:21.570> better<00:00:22.039> visual

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
it so hopefully I get some better visual

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.710 
it so hopefully I get some better visual
of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.550> linkage<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.090> how<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.330> hooked<00:00:24.510> up

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
of the linkage and how it's hooked up

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.740 
of the linkage and how it's hooked up
and<00:00:25.560> they<00:00:25.890> really<00:00:26.250> are<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.730> about<00:00:27.390> exactly

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and they really are just about exactly

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.560 
and they really are just about exactly
the<00:00:28.080> same<00:00:28.550> just<00:00:29.550> about<00:00:29.789> exactly<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.330> same

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the same just about exactly the same

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.229 
the same just about exactly the same

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
ride down to the training position where

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730 
ride down to the training position where
you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.910> see<00:00:48.090> this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.560 
right it goes to this here and the other
side<00:00:54.100> of<00:00:54.220> that<00:00:54.310> there's<00:00:54.610> another<00:00:54.880> ride<00:00:55.150> and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
side of that there's another ride and

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:04.549 
side of that there's another ride and

of the police I can't see those two
bolts<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.380> showed<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> other<00:01:10.950> video

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
bolts I showed you in the other video

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.430 
bolts I showed you in the other video
they're<00:01:12.270> loose<00:01:12.479> enough<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.810> move<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.259> and

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
they're loose enough to move it up and

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.700 
they're loose enough to move it up and
down<00:01:14.930> attention

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.820 

it's<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.730> pretty<00:01:20.910> simple<00:01:21.210> system<00:01:24.770> it's<00:01:25.770> not

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
it's a pretty simple system it's not

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.220 
it's a pretty simple system it's not
much<00:01:26.160> really<00:01:26.670> there's<00:01:27.480> no<00:01:27.600> maintenance<00:01:27.840> on

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
much really there's no maintenance on

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.910 
much really there's no maintenance on
except<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.360> wd-40<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.600> greasing<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.800> know

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
except the wd-40 in greasing you know

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.260 
except the wd-40 in greasing you know
just<00:01:32.160> to<00:01:32.310> make<00:01:32.580> sure<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.880> keeps<00:01:33.000> moving

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
just to make sure it keeps moving

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.600 
just to make sure it keeps moving
properly

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.520 

but<00:01:38.180> there's<00:01:38.720> not<00:01:38.840> much<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.320> it<00:01:39.760> okay<00:01:41.500> when<00:01:42.500> I

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
but there's not much to it okay when I

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.440 
but there's not much to it okay when I
plowed<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.010> garden<00:01:43.370> this<00:01:43.490> year<00:01:43.550> with<00:01:44.300> this

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
plowed the garden this year with this

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.540 
plowed the garden this year with this
tractor<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.290> just<00:01:45.830> kept<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.160> at<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.340> full

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
tractor I just kept it at the full

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.460 
tractor I just kept it at the full
tension<00:01:47.020> tight<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.170> belt<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:50.470> that's

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
tension tight that belt is and that's

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.440 
tension tight that belt is and that's
all<00:01:51.680> I<00:01:51.710> did<00:01:51.980> I<00:01:52.100> kept<00:01:52.400> that<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.550> full<00:01:52.820> tension<00:01:53.240> and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
all I did I kept that a full tension and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.450 
all I did I kept that a full tension and
I<00:01:53.480> just<00:01:54.230> controlled<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.920> tractor<00:01:55.280> at<00:01:55.400> the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
I just controlled the tractor at the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.480 
I just controlled the tractor at the
throttle<00:01:56.560> again<00:01:57.560> like<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.040> mention<00:01:58.340> any<00:01:58.460> other

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
throttle again like I mention any other

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.550 
throttle again like I mention any other
video<00:01:58.850> I'm<00:01:59.450> not<00:01:59.660> a<00:01:59.690> very<00:01:59.870> big<00:01:59.960> fan<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.350> these

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
video I'm not a very big fan of these

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.970 
video I'm not a very big fan of these
speed<00:02:01.400> changes<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:02.630> that's<00:02:03.080> just<00:02:03.200> my<00:02:03.410> opinion

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
speed changes but that's just my opinion

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.540 
speed changes but that's just my opinion
okay<00:02:05.260> so<00:02:06.260> again<00:02:06.410> it's<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.740> two<00:02:06.890> belt<00:02:07.130> system

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
okay so again it's a two belt system

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.170 
okay so again it's a two belt system
right<00:02:08.360> both<00:02:09.080> from<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.350> tranny<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:10.000> then<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
right both from the tranny and then the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.980 
right both from the tranny and then the
belt<00:02:11.470> must<00:02:12.470> be<00:02:12.650> change<00:02:12.950> it<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.370> motor<00:02:13.990> okay

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
belt must be change it to the motor okay

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.630 
belt must be change it to the motor okay
whereas<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.590> other<00:02:15.740> ones<00:02:15.890> only<00:02:16.070> has<00:02:16.190> one<00:02:16.400> belt

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
whereas the other ones only has one belt

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.780 
whereas the other ones only has one belt
so<00:02:17.270> it's<00:02:18.050> really<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.890> exact<00:02:19.160> same<00:02:19.400> setup

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
so it's really the exact same setup

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.460 
so it's really the exact same setup
different<00:02:20.090> sized<00:02:20.450> belt<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.930> can<00:02:21.020> see<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.200> felt

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
different sized belt you can see it felt

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.160 
different sized belt you can see it felt
much<00:02:21.650> wider<00:02:21.950> know<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.970> exact<00:02:23.270> size<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.750> top<00:02:23.990> my

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
much wider know the exact size of top my

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.660 
much wider know the exact size of top my
head

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
head

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
together basically with cotter pins one

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:50.660 
together basically with cotter pins one
cotter<00:02:39.200> pin<00:02:39.410> on<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.620> back<00:02:39.800> of<00:02:39.980> here<00:02:48.130> okay

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
cotter pin on the back of here okay

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.399 
cotter pin on the back of here okay
sherrod<00:02:52.460> it<00:02:53.460> was<00:02:53.700> over

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.149
