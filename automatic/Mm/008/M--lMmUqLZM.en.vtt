finder integrated into the system this

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.330 
finder integrated into the system this
is<00:00:21.000> actually<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> old<00:00:21.689> cast<00:00:21.990> 10<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.130> our

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
is actually the old cast 10 I our

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.929 
is actually the old cast 10 I our
discovery<00:00:23.939> pontoon<00:00:24.689> right<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.789> this<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
discovery pontoon right here and this is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.210 
discovery pontoon right here and this is
the<00:00:27.090> actual<00:00:27.449> fish<00:00:28.109> finder<00:00:28.470> mounting<00:00:28.830> system

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the actual fish finder mounting system

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.790 
the actual fish finder mounting system
on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.609> 10<00:00:29.789> IR<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:31.199> reason<00:00:31.410> why<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.619> came<00:00:31.740> up

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
on the 10 IR the reason why we came up

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.520 
on the 10 IR the reason why we came up
with<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> low<00:00:32.219> profile<00:00:32.700> solution<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.570> pontoons

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
with a low profile solution for pontoons

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.549 
with a low profile solution for pontoons
is<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> or<00:00:35.610> clearance<00:00:36.239> issue<00:00:36.559> we

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
is because of the or clearance issue we

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.830 
is because of the or clearance issue we
actually<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.219> our<00:00:38.250> u1<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.000> u2<00:00:39.120> models<00:00:39.660> for

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
actually on our u1 and u2 models for

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.110 
actually on our u1 and u2 models for
float<00:00:40.020> tubes<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:41.040> actual<00:00:41.399> fish<00:00:41.610> finder<00:00:41.969> will

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
float tubes the actual fish finder will

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.540 
float tubes the actual fish finder will
mount<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.510> top<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.860> battery<00:00:44.370> box

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
mount on top of here on the battery box

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.660 
mount on top of here on the battery box
itself<00:00:45.030> bringing<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.079> another<00:00:46.670> 1.75

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
itself bringing it up another 1.75

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
itself bringing it up another 1.75
inches<00:00:48.090> which<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.840> actually<00:00:49.440> enough<00:00:49.800> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
inches which is actually enough to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.910 
inches which is actually enough to
actually<00:00:50.579> interfere<00:00:51.030> when<00:00:51.210> you're<00:00:51.329> oaring

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
actually interfere when you're oaring

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.380 
actually interfere when you're oaring
when<00:00:52.920> you're<00:00:53.160> actually<00:00:53.340> paddling<00:00:53.940> with<00:00:54.059> yours

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
when you're actually paddling with yours

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
when you're actually paddling with yours
so<00:00:55.489> actually<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.210> here<00:00:58.190> it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so actually you can see right here it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.979 
so actually you can see right here it
has<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> same<00:00:59.969> functionality<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.750> their

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
has all the same functionality as their

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.860 
has all the same functionality as their
other<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.890> our<00:01:01.920> u<00:01:02.219> 1<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.550> u<00:01:02.579> 2<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> u<00:01:03.629> P
