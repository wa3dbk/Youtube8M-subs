the<00:00:09.710> separatist<00:00:10.280> army<00:00:10.550> is<00:00:10.670> pretty<00:00:10.850> much

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
the separatist army is pretty much

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.870 
the separatist army is pretty much
completely<00:00:11.570> comprised<00:00:12.320> of<00:00:12.620> droids<00:00:13.160> in<00:00:13.760> the

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
completely comprised of droids in the

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.910 
completely comprised of droids in the
Trade<00:00:14.180> Federation<00:00:14.210> so<00:00:15.110> it's<00:00:15.469> quite<00:00:15.740> an

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
Trade Federation so it's quite an

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.760 
Trade Federation so it's quite an
extensive<00:00:16.420> catalog<00:00:17.420> of<00:00:17.630> droids<00:00:17.960> to<00:00:18.230> develop

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
extensive catalog of droids to develop

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.770 
extensive catalog of droids to develop
so<00:00:19.310> we<00:00:19.430> started<00:00:19.670> doing<00:00:19.940> the<00:00:20.090> battle<00:00:20.570> droids

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
so we started doing the battle droids

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.510 
so we started doing the battle droids
it's<00:00:21.410> going<00:00:21.530> to<00:00:21.590> be<00:00:21.680> a<00:00:21.710> great<00:00:21.860> true<00:00:22.160> builder

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
it's going to be a great true builder

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.179 
it's going to be a great true builder
program<00:00:22.700> there<00:00:23.630> supremely<00:00:24.320> poseable<00:00:24.949> they

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
program there supremely poseable they

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.740 
program there supremely poseable they
look<00:00:25.369> excellent<00:00:25.699> in<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.420> Phantom<00:00:26.689> Menace

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
look excellent in the Phantom Menace

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.330 
look excellent in the Phantom Menace
when<00:00:27.019> you<00:00:27.080> first<00:00:27.289> see<00:00:27.380> them<00:00:27.500> deploy<00:00:27.800> from<00:00:28.130> the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
when you first see them deploy from the

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.339 
when you first see them deploy from the
droid<00:00:28.609> deployment<00:00:29.240> vehicle<00:00:29.570> they<00:00:29.869> come<00:00:30.199> out

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
droid deployment vehicle they come out

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.300 
droid deployment vehicle they come out
almost<00:00:30.560> like<00:00:30.740> they're<00:00:30.859> just<00:00:31.009> pieces<00:00:31.160> of

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
almost like they're just pieces of

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.400 
almost like they're just pieces of
hardware<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:32.000> they're<00:00:32.540> compact<00:00:33.050> they're

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
hardware and they're compact they're

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.650 
hardware and they're compact they're
folded<00:00:33.980> up<00:00:34.100> their<00:00:34.670> heads<00:00:34.910> are<00:00:35.030> tucked<00:00:35.270> in<00:00:35.450> and

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
folded up their heads are tucked in and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.200 
folded up their heads are tucked in and
it's<00:00:36.650> like<00:00:36.680> they're<00:00:36.890> in<00:00:36.980> storage<00:00:37.340> mode<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:38.150> I

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
it's like they're in storage mode and I

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.310 
it's like they're in storage mode and I
thought<00:00:38.390> that'd<00:00:38.510> be<00:00:38.600> really<00:00:38.780> cool<00:00:38.900> if<00:00:39.080> we

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
thought that'd be really cool if we

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.619 
thought that'd be really cool if we
could<00:00:39.590> have<00:00:39.770> them<00:00:40.070> be<00:00:40.700> able<00:00:40.969> to<00:00:41.059> do<00:00:41.239> that<00:00:41.420> and

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
could have them be able to do that and

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.779 
could have them be able to do that and
actually<00:00:42.379> package<00:00:42.860> them<00:00:43.039> like<00:00:43.190> that<00:00:43.340> the

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
actually package them like that the

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:45.639 
actually package them like that the
first<00:00:44.090> two<00:00:44.300> are<00:00:44.329> just<00:00:44.660> battle<00:00:45.410> droids

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
first two are just battle droids

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.920 
first two are just battle droids
infantry<00:00:46.070> guys<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:46.520> it's<00:00:46.969> just<00:00:47.719> to<00:00:47.809> get

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
infantry guys and it's just to get

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.229 
infantry guys and it's just to get
people<00:00:47.960> into<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:48.739> idea<00:00:48.949> of<00:00:49.100> building<00:00:49.670> a<00:00:49.969> troop

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
people into the idea of building a troop

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.330 
people into the idea of building a troop
army<00:00:50.570> of<00:00:50.750> battle<00:00:51.230> droids<00:00:51.410> there's<00:00:51.980> going<00:00:52.280> to

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
army of battle droids there's going to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.060 
army of battle droids there's going to
be<00:00:52.870> multiple<00:00:53.870> paint<00:00:54.079> variants<00:00:54.440> down<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.890> line

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
be multiple paint variants down the line

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.010 
be multiple paint variants down the line
since<00:00:55.460> there<00:00:55.550> are<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.000> many<00:00:56.539> different<00:00:56.629> colors

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
since there are so many different colors

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.389 
since there are so many different colors
of<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.140> battle<00:00:57.379> droids<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:57.859> sometimes<00:00:58.219> seem

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
of the battle droids you sometimes seem

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.250 
of the battle droids you sometimes seem
on<00:00:58.520> screen<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.090> in<00:00:59.269> the<00:00:59.329> Clone<00:00:59.510> Wars<00:00:59.660> with<00:01:00.109> and

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
on screen and in the Clone Wars with and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
without the backpack we want to do one

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.849 
without the backpack we want to do one
variant<00:01:02.449> that<00:01:02.510> has<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.989> backpack<00:01:03.350> on<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:03.680> and

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
variant that has the backpack on it and

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.850 
variant that has the backpack on it and
it's<00:01:04.010> labeled<00:01:04.480> 1138<00:01:05.480> you<00:01:06.290> know<00:01:06.380> an<00:01:06.590> obvious

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
it's labeled 1138 you know an obvious

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.550 
it's labeled 1138 you know an obvious

reference to George Lucas THX 1138 I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.690 
reference to George Lucas THX 1138 I
think<00:01:09.770> it's<00:01:09.860> kind<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:10.040> cool<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:10.280> for<00:01:10.610> our

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
think it's kind of cool that for our

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.249 
think it's kind of cool that for our
first<00:01:11.000> battle<00:01:11.180> droid<00:01:11.450> we're<00:01:11.600> also<00:01:11.750> doing<00:01:11.960> a

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
first battle droid we're also doing a

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.830 
first battle droid we're also doing a
snap<00:01:13.070> vehicle<00:01:13.549> for<00:01:13.820> him<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:14.000> write<00:01:14.119> on<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:14.479> can

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
snap vehicle for him to write on it can

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.230 
snap vehicle for him to write on it can
be<00:01:14.960> removed<00:01:15.200> from<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.590> base<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.240> it's

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
be removed from the base and it's

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.620 
be removed from the base and it's
basically<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:18.140> hovering<00:01:19.100> speeder<00:01:19.939> bike<00:01:20.210> it's

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
basically a hovering speeder bike it's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.450 
basically a hovering speeder bike it's
going<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.810> have<00:01:21.020> movable<00:01:21.500> pedals<00:01:21.979> that<00:01:22.189> the

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
going to have movable pedals that the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.280 
going to have movable pedals that the
droid<00:01:22.640> can<00:01:23.000> control<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.600> lot<00:01:24.020> of<00:01:24.170> engineering

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
droid can control a lot of engineering

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.440 
droid can control a lot of engineering
lot<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.799> time<00:01:25.040> went<00:01:25.310> into<00:01:25.520> developing<00:01:25.909> this

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
lot of time went into developing this

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.450 
lot of time went into developing this
vehicle<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.049> that<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:27.290> can<00:01:27.470> attach<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.189> battle

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
vehicle so that it can attach the battle

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.730 
vehicle so that it can attach the battle
droid<00:01:28.640> properly<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.570> bio<00:01:29.720> joys<00:01:30.049> looks<00:01:30.350> like

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
droid properly the bio joys looks like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.030 
droid properly the bio joys looks like
he<00:01:30.979> is<00:01:31.009> naturally<00:01:31.460> flying<00:01:32.270> this<00:01:32.509> thing<00:01:32.979> so<00:01:33.979> in
