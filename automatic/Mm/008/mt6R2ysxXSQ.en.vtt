00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and then it has more of us like a shiny

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.679 
and then it has more of us like a shiny
interior<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.380> brushes<00:01:37.740> itself<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:38.280> pink<00:01:38.729> so

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
interior the brushes itself are pink so

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.710 
interior the brushes itself are pink so
when<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.110> look<00:01:40.320> at<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> brushes<00:01:41.720> completely

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
when you look at the brushes completely

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.010 
when you look at the brushes completely
being<00:01:42.960> honest<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:43.979> think<00:01:44.930> looks<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
being honest what do you think looks a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.260 
being honest what do you think looks a
lot<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.320> Sigma<00:01:46.829> makeup<00:01:47.159> brushes<00:01:47.340> right<00:01:47.640> so

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
lot like Sigma makeup brushes right so

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.910 
lot like Sigma makeup brushes right so
that's<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> thought<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.320> first<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.740> then

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that's what I thought at first and then

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.389 
that's what I thought at first and then
I<00:01:50.130> held<00:01:50.460> them<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.450> brushes<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.399> they

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
I held them up to the brushes and they

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.819 
I held them up to the brushes and they
are<00:01:53.460> actually<00:01:53.820> different<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:55.200> look<00:01:55.229> like

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
are actually different they look like

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.959 
are actually different they look like
there<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.100> sand<00:01:56.369> there<00:01:56.520> are<00:01:56.579> actually<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> lot

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
there is sand there are actually a lot

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.880 
there is sand there are actually a lot
of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> same<00:01:57.570> kind<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.200> brushes<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:58.710> they're
