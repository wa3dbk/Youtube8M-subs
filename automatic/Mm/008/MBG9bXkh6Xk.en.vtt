00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.540
 use are 2 slices of bacon 2 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.640

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.550
 the ingredients that I will need are

 bacon and some oregano and to 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.119
 decorating we are going to use some olives 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.519
 black and a piquillo pepper what 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.650
 first thing we will do is the mass of the 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.259
 mini pizzas the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.380
 is to put the leaven in the water that 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:14.310
 we have previously bought a little and 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.350
 the half teaspoon of sugar 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:25.180
 so that the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:29.210
 we move a little bit once we have 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:33.560
 dissolved let's throw the flour 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.560
 we put the flour in a bowl 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.289
 we make a hole in the center in 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:45.930
 form of volcano and there we salt the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.840
 oil and we are adding 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.680
 the water that we have with the yeast and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.300
 let kneading and mixing everything well if 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.180
 you see that the dough has stayed enough 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.060
 hard we will add a little more than 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.490
 very little water , but let's put the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:14.790
 at the table and we will continue to knead 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:17.430
 a little bit more and now we make a 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.470
 little ball we put a little flour in 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.050
 the bowl in the background and we put the 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.459
 ball and we'll leave it like an hour or 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.550
 until you see that he has doubled or 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.250
 tripled the volume and we'll cover it with 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:37.770
 a cloth once the dough is ready 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:40.920
 we are going to stretch it and now with the help of 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.590
 a heart-shaped slicer we're going 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.410

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.140
