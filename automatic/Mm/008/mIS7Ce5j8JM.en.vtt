00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.779 
how it turned out and I did speed this
up<00:04:26.010> because<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.580> took<00:04:27.000> me<00:04:27.240> forever<00:04:28.610> I'm<00:04:29.610> just

putting on these lashes and they are
from<00:04:33.330> kiss<00:04:33.750> near<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.530> flirty<00:04:34.800> lash<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.340> they

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
from kiss near the flirty lash and they

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.100 
from kiss near the flirty lash and they
are<00:04:35.669> a<00:04:35.699> little<00:04:35.910> bit<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.300> foliar<00:04:36.599> lash<00:04:36.870> but

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
are a little bit of a foliar lash but

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.140 
are a little bit of a foliar lash but
they<00:04:37.199> still<00:04:37.470> very<00:04:37.919> natural<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:38.669> they<00:04:39.000> don't

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
they still very natural and they don't

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.560 
they still very natural and they don't
look<00:04:39.300> overdone<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.050> I<00:04:40.080> really<00:04:40.650> love<00:04:40.979> these

for the lower lash line I didn't want to

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.560 
for the lower lash line I didn't want to
leave<00:04:49.100> wine<00:04:49.310> bear<00:04:49.670> because<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.060> feel<00:04:50.330> like<00:04:50.390> my
