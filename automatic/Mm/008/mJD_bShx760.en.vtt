00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.720
 please Mr. Minister 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.339
 Do you think it is overdone when you look for 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.840
 40 billion euros a year 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.840
 punctuality expected 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:25.290
 one of my predecessors nothing 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.549
 obviously began before 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.430
 decades to borrow money 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.350
 a few billion not because we 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.500
 broke 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.720
 we wanted more prosperity more 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.900
 geopolitical influence a modern one 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.860
 army 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.790
 not a single cent we have until today 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.700
 why the sum of the 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.050
 interest paid exceeds by now 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.180
 far as we have borrowed 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.460
 proportionality in the lexicon under v 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.210
 After baby punctuality beat this time 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.240
 after a quarter of our tax revenues 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.260
 go for interest on it 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.040
 we are overindebted as with the 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.200
 smoke 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.230
 Everyone knows that it is unhealthy, but 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.560
 ignore the danger there will be us 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.709
 always new loans raised only around 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.420
 to be able to pay old interest on debt 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.790
 nice circulation 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.580
 That can only be done in a global one 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.580
 This is the end of the wave of bankruptcies 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.400
 however, even countries like this one 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.739
 alleged economic powers decide 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.730
 over the people in the interest of those 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.730
 who lend them the money 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.450
 Incidentally, I would like to know that's it 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:15.150
 Our country will not make any new loans 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:15.150

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.860
 law with that dictates 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.860
 Everyone owes every seventh year

 the 80 million people work around 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.750
 the prosperity of an eccentric 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.750

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.920

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.550
 the capitalist 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:09.000
 Unfortunately, the state is so expensive that
