00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:15.177
Ukrainian barrier troops. A POW testimony.

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:19.875
State your full name.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:22.925
Pywnev, Alexander Andreiwych.

00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:24.557
And your home town?

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.269
The city of Luhansk.

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:26.819
Good.

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:32.215
I was born in 1977

00:00:32.278 --> 00:00:35.148
on January the 25th

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.794
Now, Sasha, tell us how you ended up with the National Guard.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:44.433
I was pulled from the car.

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:45.335
Right.

00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:48.250
We were out on work assignment,

00:00:48.386 --> 00:00:50.347
assembling the towers.

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:53.216
And on the way back,

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:57.660
when exiting Shvatovo,

00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:01.963
I was grabbed from the car

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:06.069
and taken to their...

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:09.543
camp.

00:01:09.623 --> 00:01:10.655
Right.

00:01:10.768 --> 00:01:17.185
- What camp, what unit was it?
- That, that...

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:18.843
Yes.

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:25.102
- This unit they had...
- Their insignia.

00:01:25.394 --> 00:01:29.964
They had this distinguishing mark on their uniform.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:34.250
Sasha, during your service with the National Guard,

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:38.386
what surprised you the most?

00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:44.246
Their consumption of vodka

00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:48.520
and plunder.

00:01:48.892 --> 00:01:51.704
How they beat up people.

00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:57.101
And there were cases,

00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:01.204
that some men in Shvatovo have told us about,

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:08.766
that this battalion (Donbas) have raped some young girls.

00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:13.573
- So you had incidents of that happening?
- Yes.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.281
Now about their casualties,

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.727
their attitude to their dead and injured?

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:24.172
They never evacuate them

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:27.692
or offer medical help.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:33.328
They either bury them by the side of the road

00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:37.784
or in mass graves,

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:41.932
leaving only their underwear on.

00:02:42.523 --> 00:02:44.813
They pile them in these pits.

00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:50.131
And use explosives to seal the graves.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.575
- Is that how they bury their dead?
-Yes.

00:02:55.621 --> 00:03:00.757
The dead and the heavily wounded, whom they don't want to be bothered evacuating.

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:03.223
They don't inform..

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.706
their relatives either.

00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.931
They just say that the individual has left..

00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:14.395
well, what you call it, left the unit of his own..

00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:16.510
Gone AWOL.

00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:19.175
- Escaped and is AWOL.
- Yes, yes.

00:03:19.213 --> 00:03:22.082
It's an accurate discription.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.558
I see.

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:28.168
You, as far as I understand, have escaped as well?

00:03:28.224 --> 00:03:29.200
Yes.

00:03:29.273 --> 00:03:31.574
- I simply..
- What was the reason for your actions?

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.849
I was ashamed and very scared.

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:37.581
Because of..

00:03:37.948 --> 00:03:41.871
..their atrocities and shelling the civilians.

00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:47.046
Even their younger recruits

00:03:47.353 --> 00:03:49.178
are subjected to humiliations.

00:03:49.304 --> 00:03:52.989
They get beaten.

00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:00.001
Tell me now Sasha,

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.365
what areas of the Luhansk area contain those mass graves?

00:04:05.385 --> 00:04:08.356
Containing both dead and still living men.

00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:14.846
That will be in the direction of the stanitsa, beyond

00:04:16.015 --> 00:04:20.527
either Makarovo or Alhovoye, I can't say exactly at the moment.

00:04:20.562 --> 00:04:23.396
Marinovo, the sand quarry?

00:04:23.444 --> 00:04:28.137
Yes, maybe. In the sands.

00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:33.978
Over there they did it with shells and well..

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:38.026
- Explosives.
- They buried the bodies.

00:04:39.276 --> 00:04:42.099
- I see.
- It's very unsettling.

00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:47.753
What are their personnel casualties?

00:04:49.712 --> 00:04:52.638
Well, I wouldn't be able to.. numerically..

00:04:52.707 --> 00:04:55.512
A lot have been killed.

00:04:55.556 --> 00:04:59.015
And that Donbas,

00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:04.015
they are never the first to enter combat.

00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:08.699
They are always willing the army to engage first.

00:05:08.954 --> 00:05:11.459
Regular troops.

00:05:11.527 --> 00:05:15.156
Those who refuse to fight,

00:05:15.555 --> 00:05:17.662
are shot by them.

00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:21.278
They act like barrier troops,

00:05:21.358 --> 00:05:25.599
to prevent their own forces from deserting.
