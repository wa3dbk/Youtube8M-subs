00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
but as soon as I transform I mean I snap

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.630 
but as soon as I transform I mean I snap
and<00:00:53.100> become<00:00:53.880> a<00:00:54.180> completely<00:00:54.750> different<00:00:54.900> person

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.660 

well<00:01:00.210> no<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.870> wasn't<00:01:01.500> difficult<00:01:01.649> because<00:01:02.130> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
well no it wasn't difficult because it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.270 
well no it wasn't difficult because it
kind<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.180> all<00:01:03.360> just<00:01:03.630> CGI<00:01:04.620> I<00:01:04.739> didn't<00:01:05.190> have

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
kind of was all just CGI I didn't have

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.940 
kind of was all just CGI I didn't have
to<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.550> anything<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.380> interesting

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to do anything but it was interesting

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.350 
to do anything but it was interesting
because<00:01:08.070> when<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.520> were<00:01:08.610> filming<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:09.060> had<00:01:09.210> no

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
because when we were filming we had no

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.359 
because when we were filming we had no
idea<00:01:09.690> what<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> wolves<00:01:10.860> were<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.190> look

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
idea what the wolves were going to look

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.700 
idea what the wolves were going to look
like<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.790> saw<00:01:11.970> some<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:12.600> drawings<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.440> we

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
like we saw some some drawings but we

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.560 
like we saw some some drawings but we
really<00:01:14.310> didn't<00:01:14.550> know<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.300> I've<00:01:15.540> seen

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
really didn't know so now that I've seen

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.469 
really didn't know so now that I've seen
the<00:01:16.020> movie<00:01:16.410> and<00:01:17.220> I've<00:01:17.369> seen<00:01:17.640> werewolves<00:01:18.360> they

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the movie and I've seen werewolves they

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.420 
the movie and I've seen werewolves they
look<00:01:18.630> amazing<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.560> can't<00:01:20.009> wait<00:01:20.160> for<00:01:20.190> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
look amazing and I can't wait for the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.560 
look amazing and I can't wait for the
fans<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:20.970> them

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.760 

um<00:01:27.200> either<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.650> dirt<00:01:29.100> bike<00:01:29.430> scene<00:01:30.770> just

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
um either the dirt bike scene just

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.200 
um either the dirt bike scene just
because<00:01:32.010> I<00:01:32.100> had<00:01:32.190> never<00:01:32.400> ridden<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.850> dirt<00:01:32.880> bike

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
because I had never ridden a dirt bike

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.740 
because I had never ridden a dirt bike
before<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:35.520> required<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.150> lot<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.300> practice

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
before so it required a lot of practice

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.190 
before so it required a lot of practice
before<00:01:37.190> or<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:39.060> scene<00:01:39.300> where<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.540> run<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:40.050> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
before or the scene where I run up the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.440 
before or the scene where I run up the
side<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.470> Bella's<00:01:41.220> house<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.940> jump<00:01:42.150> onto<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
side of Bella's house and jump onto the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.109 
side of Bella's house and jump onto the
tree<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.190> fly<00:01:44.190> in<00:01:44.340> through<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.640> window<00:01:44.910> that

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
tree and fly in through the window that

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.850 
tree and fly in through the window that
one<00:01:45.270> was<00:01:45.420> really<00:01:45.630> complicated<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.500> required

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
one was really complicated and required

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.200 
one was really complicated and required
a<00:01:47.009> lot<00:01:47.160> of<00:01:47.190> rehearsal

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.420 

I<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:53.350> hope<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.650> I<00:01:53.710> wouldn't<00:01:54.100> be<00:01:54.159> in<00:01:54.280> the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
I really hope that I wouldn't be in the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.910 
I really hope that I wouldn't be in the
situation<00:01:54.460> it's<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.510> really<00:01:55.900> tough<00:01:56.229> situation

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
situation it's a really tough situation

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.280 
situation it's a really tough situation
I<00:01:57.159> felt<00:01:57.430> bad<00:01:57.610> for<00:01:57.940> Jacobs<00:01:58.270> character<00:01:58.690> when<00:01:59.260> I

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
I felt bad for Jacobs character when I

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.600 
I felt bad for Jacobs character when I
read<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.680> books<00:01:59.890> but<00:02:00.130> now<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.520> I've

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
read the books but now that I've

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.180 
read the books but now that I've
actually<00:02:00.820> lived<00:02:01.420> Jacob<00:02:02.020> during<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.740> process

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
actually lived Jacob during the process

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.410 
actually lived Jacob during the process
of<00:02:03.310> filming<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.869> feel<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:05.080> much<00:02:05.200> worse<00:02:05.259> so

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
of filming I feel so much worse so

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.719 
of filming I feel so much worse so
thankfully<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.659> have<00:02:08.259> not<00:02:09.009> yet<00:02:09.280> been<00:02:09.459> in<00:02:09.610> that

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
thankfully I have not yet been in that

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.490 
thankfully I have not yet been in that
situation<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.620> hopefully<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.860> won't<00:02:12.370> be

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.380
