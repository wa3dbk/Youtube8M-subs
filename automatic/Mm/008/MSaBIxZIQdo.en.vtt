00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
this okay that's a hang glide now it's a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.580 
this okay that's a hang glide now it's a
penny<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> type<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.300> floor<00:00:33.600> you're<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
penny on the type of floor you're on you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.889 
penny on the type of floor you're on you
can<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.860> more<00:00:35.010> rotations<00:00:35.640> okay<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
can get more rotations okay this is a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
can get more rotations okay this is a
rough<00:00:37.140> floor<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> wood<00:00:38.879> floor

rough floor so on the wood floor
linoleum<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.379> probably<00:00:40.649> get<00:00:40.890> two<00:00:41.280> or<00:00:41.370> three

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
linoleum you probably get two or three

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.940 
linoleum you probably get two or three
rotations<00:00:41.989> easier<00:00:42.989> than<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.890> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
rotations easier than that and if it's a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.290 
rotations easier than that and if it's a
rough<00:00:44.129> floor<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.550> use<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> glove<00:00:45.030> or

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
rough floor you can use a glove or

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
spin okay now I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.889 
spin okay now I'm going to demonstrate
the<00:00:49.980> move<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.879> easiest<00:00:51.239> method<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.690> into

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the move the easiest method to get into

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.400 
the move the easiest method to get into
it<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.199> find<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:53.250> right<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:53.789> here

freeze twist now from here once I put my

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.749 
freeze twist now from here once I put my
left<00:01:15.869> hand<00:01:16.110> down<00:01:16.259> my<00:01:17.130> right<00:01:17.310> hand<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.670> gonna

left hand down my right hand is gonna
come<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.890> with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> stab<00:01:20.250> again<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
come in with the stab again now this

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.499 
come in with the stab again now this
time<00:01:22.070> once<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.220> come<00:01:23.430> into<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.759> freeze<00:01:24.060> I'm

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
time once I come into the freeze I'm

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.480 
time once I come into the freeze I'm
gonna<00:01:24.750> let<00:01:24.840> my<00:01:24.960> moment'<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.380> take<00:01:25.650> me<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.460> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
gonna let my moment' to take me so I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.990 
gonna let my moment' to take me so I
turned<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.659> way<00:01:27.810> around<00:01:28.640> now<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.670> trick

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
turned all the way around now the trick

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
turned all the way around now the trick
to<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.240> move<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:31.049> when<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.350> put<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.680> wrist

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
to this move is when you put your wrist

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.670 
to this move is when you put your wrist
down<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:33.060> let<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.750> fingers<00:01:34.110> stay<00:01:34.590> on

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
down you don't let your fingers stay on

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.370 
down you don't let your fingers stay on
the<00:01:34.770> ground<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.670> fingers<00:01:36.060> when<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:37.049> here

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the ground your fingers when they here

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.890 
the ground your fingers when they here
have<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.829> stay<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.150> allow<00:01:39.659> you

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
have to stay up so that they allow you

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.789 
have to stay up so that they allow you
to<00:01:40.110> spin<00:01:40.759> similar<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.530> don't<00:01:43.530> want

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
to spin similar to this you don't want

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.940 
to spin similar to this you don't want
to<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.540> because<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.899> causes<00:01:46.799> more

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to do this because it causes more

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.139 
to do this because it causes more
friction<00:01:47.009> okay<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.479> let's<00:01:48.840> try<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.079> slow<00:01:50.149> okay

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
friction okay so let's try it slow okay

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.889 
friction okay so let's try it slow okay
from<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.799> we're<00:01:52.799> gonna<00:01:52.860> go<00:01:53.630> one<00:01:54.630> two<00:01:56.899> three

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
from here we're gonna go one two three

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.550 
from here we're gonna go one two three
okay<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.509> more<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.869> try<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> more

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
okay and the more you try it the more

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
okay and the more you try it the more
rotations<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.219> you'll<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.430> able<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.700> go<00:02:02.850> now

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
rotations do you'll be able to go now

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.910 
rotations do you'll be able to go now
you<00:02:03.570> want<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.899> place<00:02:04.079> your<00:02:04.229> legs<00:02:04.469> as<00:02:04.740> you're

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
you want to place your legs as you're

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.499 
you want to place your legs as you're
spinning<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.759> position<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.479> can

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
spinning in a position that you can

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.389 
spinning in a position that you can
balance<00:02:06.810> yourself<00:02:07.079> out<00:02:07.500> whether<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.310> be

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
balance yourself out whether it be

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.839 
balance yourself out whether it be
straight<00:02:09.170> side<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.379> side<00:02:10.619> whatever<00:02:11.489> works<00:02:11.730> for

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
straight side to side whatever works for

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.780 
straight side to side whatever works for
you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.520 
you
let's<00:02:13.569> try<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.810> again<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.260> what<00:02:14.379> still

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
let's try it again this is what still

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.440 
let's try it again this is what still
look<00:02:14.680> like<00:02:14.829> I'm<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.040> dual<00:02:15.189> pull-up<00:02:15.579> okay<00:02:15.969> I'm

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
look like I'm the dual pull-up okay I'm

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.810 
look like I'm the dual pull-up okay I'm
here<00:02:19.980> okay<00:02:21.269> that's<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.390> hang<00:02:22.569> glide
