 Halli hello my friends and sincerely 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.509
 welcome on the channel even master lp 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.800
 Today I present a text 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.080
 We do not bacon and torch for a long time 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.089
 and I present you the times directly 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.400
 individual blocks 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.920
 this is the gravel and before you go 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.930
 even in the short term packers is that the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.830
 protection pack only in a higher 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:34.130
 resolution that exists in 32 times 32 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:36.690
 64x64 128x128 256x256 and 512 512 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.070
 yes you will already see it and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.719
 here a gravel blog the individual pixels 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 Textures have been done differently 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.820
 you can see here we already see 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.930
 the amis will block both memory it becomes 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.610
 at the diamonds 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.610
 So it looks like they will 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.190
 Blocks can be said to say that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.140
 doctors highlighted her a bit 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.870
 coal iron gold emsland rolli redstone 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.470
 diamond and the devils then we have 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.060
 to the respective blocks android blog 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.130
 blog travel blog and gold blog something 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.110
 donate very well here and also 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:20.250
 lapis lazuli blogs most 12 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.200
 he is currently the fans shit again 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.750
 windows and under normal windows and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.240
 then we will come back to the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.080
 different stone brakes one man 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 Can be found 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.110
 All very nicely done this 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.939
 I also like that, for example 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.040
 hard that they can be very very cool 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.110
 you are very good at what you do so very much 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.090
 well here the stone is a bit 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.619
 darker than and normal if here 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.670
 cobblestone will eat me now 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.250
 personally not quite so well done 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.820
 So of course very well implemented 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 badly done but that's what I think 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.869
 not so good to build but it is for everyone 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.950
 his thing then here still the normal 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.880
 bridgestone then the bedrock meter break 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.340
 And then come to the words that cars 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:12.410
 here with the stairs with the harps tab 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.410
 and the wood block then here the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:22.209
 here in things to the birch wood 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.230
 respective thing about it and the jungle 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:30.189
 wood here now 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:33.730
 moreover, and then often falls like 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:39.310
 is the domicile i um is that this 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.900
 blog this is then the one in stone 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:49.239
 pumpkin glowing and not light up the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.329
 melons and sponge the normal sand and 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.709
 the normal bell-bell connected 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.269
 textures so here i will show you then 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.220
 but let's do the thing very well 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:05.760
 I think you can do that very well here 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:09.790
 recognize by the individual pixels of 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.170
 then have every actor over as well 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.389
 we still here the book represents what also 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.349
 looks very very cool when you see 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:19.470
 but dancing is a better thing 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:21.790
 resolution is then smooth stone as 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:28.209
 research minister rossis tor 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.159
 obsidian 10 playback percent and the 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.590
 monastery and everything was done very cool 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:38.889
 here then the resin stepstone 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.470
 stormreach stepstone half sap and the 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.079
 window of the sanctions again the 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.609
 stair was there just has no place 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.169
 and yes, I 'll hit you on the stairs as well 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.709
 the chest made very cool that goes 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.510
 still here on it now the individual 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.220
 Textures made very well that me 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.489
 Also this expedition in the wood can 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.840
 one was also just seen one 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.799
 changed the bed you can see here 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.859
 very cool 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.389
 the individual segments can be said 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.930
 are also displayed very well here 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.329
 rails 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.790
 The wood is very well done here 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:13.000
 this is very nice with these pixels 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.090
 very well done here and sectors and 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.549
 the power trail and the leaves looks 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.660
 you back there 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.830
 which can be seen here 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.450
 here you can see that now also a difficult 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:29.510
 I can not say anything about that here 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.940
 bad everyone has to know yourself 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.320
 then we have the scoop with the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.570
 title to it as all at the 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.150
 pickaxe the same and with the ax 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.410
 also and here 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:45.020
 it can now time to armaments at 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.430
 teeth and so far has become then 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.380
 not done so much with the animals 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.420
 is not so much there yet 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:05:01.370
 Let's spur a few times 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:05:02.690
 and let a pig recognize that 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.590
 now also very good at here 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.730
 probably the whole single pixel 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.230
 nothing has happened to the pig yet 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.300
 the texture does not quite pack 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.550
 it is 90 percent complete at the 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.840
 they can do that too and at the cow they do it 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.640
 that we can see very well 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.260
 So fund looks relatively cool 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.740
 Everything is so nice 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:26.360
 So everything is not bad the texture 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:30.010
 pack the rest as you can handle this 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.530
 fruit I will not show you yet and 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.970
 the link of the link to download this 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.590
 texture pack in the five different 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.120
 Variations can be found below in the video 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.230
 description and find the work through 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.169
 the video has liked if he like the 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.520
 a tower lived high and yes thank you 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.520
 I see you something and we are 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.450
 next time until then your german 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.980
