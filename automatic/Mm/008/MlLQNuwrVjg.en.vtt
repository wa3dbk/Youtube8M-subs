00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.560
 I would be happy with how simple we could be 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.530
 everyone shouted by the mark 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.309
 you're pried 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.710
 first the degrees 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.049
 you guessed 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.179
 and after having 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.669
 military 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.660
 from nearly twice the risk of overtaking the Bedouins in the south 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.029
 not lifted 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.199
 the 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.300
 this film that meets the pen 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.910
 how the light of the precise gestures of the victims are a couple 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.590
 it's impossible to mechanize this harvest so as not to deny the margin rate 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.460
 effective michel face family but the yields or almost trait for 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.390
 nervous trait to pay you 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.579
 eight trays just about 1 1 million the plateau 8 ten quarry in the la la la 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 amount 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.970
 it's still six months 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.320
 for the MP and those rains kilos at both banks 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.540
 the mission 64 kilos 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.800
 for the hour ten 80 kilos 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.640
 how do you feel that you 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.130
 We count 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.180
 the current malaita 05 25

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.880
 for him as for the market has stabilized in reconquest on average 30 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.880
 euros of production from their canton of NeuchÃ¢tel the competitors make three to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.020
 four times more often production costs of at least one euro but 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.300
 Michel is not the type to be discouraged 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.510
 to sell his crop he brings here to this marketer 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 it's because of 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.060
 very competitive with Italian grapes 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.540
 and we felt it especially signed the last fortnight 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.270
 to reach this is only after the triumph of the afp campaign of the regime 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.790
 French 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.970
 if it is restarted 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.770
 and then overnight 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.110
 almost 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.690

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.180
 detriment of table grapes 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.900
 the couple explains not all the kit she adapted to the tastes of the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.510
 consumers and to develop very quickly regional species with large 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.040
 grain and its time 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.720
 the riposte Languedoc should not delay too much we have studied 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.530
 and hamas crusaders we came to this first variety a 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.770
 blame 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.840
 we are lagging behind deputy anwar variety 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.099
 with about the same size 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.779
 effect the black eagles should arrive home to be able to market it 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:22.229
 in europe during 2011 and 2012 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:26.029
 the centennial is the name of this new species will also propose 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:27.209
 best in the world 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.739
 the producers hope that it will allow them to maintain a long time 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.709
 its characteristic landscapes of the golden valley
