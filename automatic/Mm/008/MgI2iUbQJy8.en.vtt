00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
turn three and four maybe we will

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.900 
turn three and four maybe we will
certainly<00:00:09.929> keep<00:00:10.340> lead<00:00:11.340> off<00:00:11.490> with<00:00:11.639> mountain

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
certainly keep lead off with mountain

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.759 
certainly keep lead off with mountain
again<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.269> case<00:00:12.389> we<00:00:12.630> draw<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.139> frostburn

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
again in case we draw the frostburn

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
weird Andy mold 25 that's probably good

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.170 
weird Andy mold 25 that's probably good
for<00:00:18.630> us<00:00:18.810> to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.060

creeper<00:00:24.370> vine<00:00:24.550> i<00:00:24.580> guess<00:00:24.850> but<00:00:25.150> obviously<00:00:26.140> with

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
creeper vine i guess but obviously with

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.350 
creeper vine i guess but obviously with
a<00:00:26.320> mole<00:00:26.470> 25<00:00:26.740> you<00:00:26.890> can't<00:00:27.040> expect<00:00:27.280> too<00:00:27.400> much<00:00:27.520> he's

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
a mole 25 you can't expect too much he's

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.700 
a mole 25 you can't expect too much he's
on<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:28.600> play<00:00:28.870> worst<00:00:29.860> of<00:00:30.070> the<00:00:30.160> three<00:00:30.190> hands<00:00:30.730> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
on the play worst of the three hands you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.750 
on the play worst of the three hands you
well<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:32.890> be<00:00:32.980> fair<00:00:33.070> our<00:00:33.130> hand<00:00:33.370> isn't<00:00:33.550> that

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
well to be fair our hand isn't that

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:42.390 
well to be fair our hand isn't that
great<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:37.090> it's<00:00:37.360> pretty<00:00:37.600> decent<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:42.070> deep<00:00:42.250> in

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
great but it's pretty decent the deep in

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.570 
great but it's pretty decent the deep in
glee<00:00:42.670> deck<00:00:43.360> probably<00:00:43.989> just<00:00:44.200> loses<00:00:44.590> to<00:00:44.980> the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
glee deck probably just loses to the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.979 
glee deck probably just loses to the
authorities<00:00:45.970> deck<00:00:46.150> if<00:00:46.300> we<00:00:46.360> ever<00:00:46.480> play<00:00:46.690> against

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
authorities deck if we ever play against

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.350 
authorities deck if we ever play against
it<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:48.340> maybe<00:00:48.760> not<00:00:50.460> run<00:00:51.460> this<00:00:51.580> guy<00:00:51.760> out<00:00:51.940> on<00:00:52.210> me

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
it but maybe not run this guy out on me

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.069 
it but maybe not run this guy out on me
should<00:00:52.600> f6<00:00:53.530> I<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:55.210> we<00:00:55.300> do<00:00:55.420> deviant<00:00:55.810> GLIAC

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
should f6 I think we do deviant GLIAC

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.210 
should f6 I think we do deviant GLIAC
because<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.350> puts<00:00:56.440> them<00:00:56.560> on<00:00:56.649> a<00:00:56.680> factor<00:00:57.100> and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
because that puts them on a factor and

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.119 
because that puts them on a factor and
clock<00:00:57.370> as<00:00:58.560> opposed<00:00:59.560> to<00:00:59.649> playing<00:00:59.800> racketeer

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.550 

actually<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.180> that<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.390> same<00:01:05.540> clock<00:01:05.780> he's<00:01:06.439> on

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
actually is that the same clock he's on

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.300 
actually is that the same clock he's on
a<00:01:06.619> five<00:01:06.740> ten<00:01:06.890> o'clock<00:01:07.009> now<00:01:07.539> so<00:01:08.920> we<00:01:09.920> hit<00:01:10.130> them<00:01:10.189> to

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
a five ten o'clock now so we hit them to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.859 
a five ten o'clock now so we hit them to
16<00:01:10.640> play<00:01:10.939> racket<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.270> your<00:01:11.360> next<00:01:11.570> turn<00:01:11.719> and<00:01:11.750> hit

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
16 play racket to your next turn and hit

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.109 
16 play racket to your next turn and hit
him<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.110> 12<00:01:12.350> things<00:01:13.009> on<00:01:13.159> a<00:01:13.189> to<00:01:13.369> turn<00:01:13.549> clock<00:01:13.759> so

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
him to 12 things on a to turn clock so

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:24.790 
him to 12 things on a to turn clock so
actually<00:01:14.710> yet<00:01:15.710> is<00:01:15.860> faster<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.399> way

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.390 

he's<00:01:25.460> probably<00:01:25.760> just<00:01:26.120> dead

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.160 

maybe<00:01:30.000> has<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> gate<00:01:30.420> creeper<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> help

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
maybe has a gate creeper here to help

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.480 
maybe has a gate creeper here to help
out

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:43.830 

if<00:01:34.119> he<00:01:34.299> doesn't<00:01:34.509> that's<00:01:34.780> pretty<00:01:35.079> bad<00:01:35.259> for<00:01:35.619> them

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.289 

sure<00:01:44.500> so<00:01:44.740> let's<00:01:45.100> play<00:01:45.250> this<00:01:45.399> discard<00:01:45.909> a<00:01:46.000> swamp

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
sure so let's play this discard a swamp

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.960 
sure so let's play this discard a swamp
play<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.229> mountain

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.270 

Pass<00:01:52.670> that's<00:01:53.670> six<00:01:53.970> damage<00:01:54.150> we<00:01:54.690> have<00:01:55.040> an<00:01:56.040> extra

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
Pass that's six damage we have an extra

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.860 
Pass that's six damage we have an extra
four<00:01:56.700> yeah<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.600> isn't<00:01:57.750> real<00:01:58.350> game<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.710> magic

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.680 

well

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.750 

I<00:02:07.780> guess<00:02:08.410> we<00:02:08.530> just<00:02:08.560> bash<00:02:08.830> 46<00:02:09.220> no<00:02:09.430> point<00:02:09.640> in

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
I guess we just bash 46 no point in

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:18.530 
I guess we just bash 46 no point in
showing<00:02:10.060> anything<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.720> next<00:02:11.170> opponent

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.580 

yeah<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.720> sucks

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.369 

that's<00:02:25.459> magic<00:02:25.610> sometimes<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:27.140> actually

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
that's magic sometimes that actually

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.589 
that's magic sometimes that actually
just<00:02:27.560> happened<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:27.920> my<00:02:28.040> most<00:02:28.300> recent<00:02:29.300> one<00:02:29.569> the

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
just happened in my most recent one the

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.259 
just happened in my most recent one the
one<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.870> saw<00:02:29.989> pop<00:02:30.170> up<00:02:30.319> here<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:32.090> probably

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
one you saw pop up here you probably

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.390 
one you saw pop up here you probably
didn't<00:02:32.569> want<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.780> watch<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.080> actually<00:02:33.530> it

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
didn't want to watch that actually it

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.860 
didn't want to watch that actually it
was<00:02:34.610> sort<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:34.940> other<00:02:35.060> problem<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.540> ended

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
was sort of the other problem I ended

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.600 
was sort of the other problem I ended
with<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.170> actual<00:02:36.560> seven<00:02:36.980> basic<00:02:37.280> lands<00:02:37.459> in

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
with the actual seven basic lands in

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.900 
with the actual seven basic lands in
hand<00:02:38.620> but<00:02:39.620> yeah<00:02:39.800> not<00:02:40.250> much<00:02:40.340> can<00:02:40.489> be<00:02:40.580> done<00:02:40.670> there

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
hand but yeah not much can be done there

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.900 
hand but yeah not much can be done there
