Timothy's<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.270> team<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> nice

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
Timothy's and team really just a nice

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
Timothy's and team really just a nice
nice<00:01:34.619> makes<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.189> nice<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.970> done

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
nice makes it be nice to get that done

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.050 
nice makes it be nice to get that done
if<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.960> no<00:01:37.170> biggie<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:38.820> soon<00:01:38.970> as

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
if not it's no biggie but what soon as

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
if not it's no biggie but what soon as
we<00:01:39.150> hit<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.329> negative<00:01:39.900> figures<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.409> are<00:01:40.680> gone

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
we hit that negative figures we are gone

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.200 
we hit that negative figures we are gone
so<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.000> 300k<00:01:42.750> way<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.710> 100<00:01:44.640> k<00:01:44.790> 100

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
so this is a 300k way not to 100 k 100

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.990 
so this is a 300k way not to 100 k 100
100<00:01:45.689> k<00:01:45.810> wager<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.189> value<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.549> him<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
100 k wager that's a value of him on the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
100 k wager that's a value of him on the
market<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.540> was<00:01:48.659> looking<00:01:49.020> at<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.500> current

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
market as I was looking at that current

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.819 
market as I was looking at that current
time<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.880> equalize<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.869> what<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.710> do

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
time we do equalize it to what we do

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.190 
time we do equalize it to what we do
actually<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.369> had<00:01:53.460> taken<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> lead<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.270> can't

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
actually it's had taken the lead I can't

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.569 
actually it's had taken the lead I can't
remember<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.100> taking<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.549> lead

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
remember I think that is taking the lead

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.060 
remember I think that is taking the lead
in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.630> 52nd<00:01:58.200> minute<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.560> thought<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> game

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
in the 52nd minute I thought the game

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.429 
in the 52nd minute I thought the game
was<00:01:59.280> cruising<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.450> game<00:02:00.659> wasn't<00:02:00.899> cruising

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
was cruising the game wasn't cruising

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.929 
was cruising the game wasn't cruising

don't know why it was apparently he was
apparently<00:03:35.440> but<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.310> was<00:03:36.430> just<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.640> animation

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
apparently but it was just the animation

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.760 
apparently but it was just the animation
which<00:03:37.240> done<00:03:37.450> indeed<00:03:37.810> diving<00:03:38.230> over<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.560> top

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
which done indeed diving over the top
