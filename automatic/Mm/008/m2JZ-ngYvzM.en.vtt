00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.000
 I already saw the truck hit a mountain 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.340
 people to whom the cargo is going 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.429
 leaving everything sings here show to who the 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.660
 Thunder forgot when it's all over 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:20.930
 with the play room you save 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.150
 we are still well that it is light 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.890
 It's good that you take the good work to 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.080
 Did you see the work in the meantime? 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.630
 got the trash out there who's on the road 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.910
 also jaime obs and has raw material already 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.100
 take me the old partner with the new 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.440
 fleet that is coming around trucks 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.230
 increasingly larger 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.250
 it is necessary to invest in new 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.290
 relief solutions like this one 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.940
 investment of about one million and 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.310
 four hundred thousand reais 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.070
 This is our story today. This is the 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.410
 extra-heavy winch that will help 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.150
 removal and unfolding of trucks 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.230
 carts and buses on the highway president 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.550
 dutra 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.640
 the model volvo fm x 480 horsepower and traction 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.100
 8 for 4 is a truck that likes life 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.020
 hard is in the right place 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.870
 the vehicle received various equipment 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.590
 between them in the hydraulic system 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.350
 has 11 functions that can be handled 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.200
 through remote control that we have 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.650
 here 11 hydraulic control our trash and 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.750
 this and this command here it's function 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.850
 in all items is hydraulic boom 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.770
 the three reducers that have 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.109
 vehicle lipstick extender scale 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.600
 the balance we have here a truck 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.340
 here against only 6 tonnes we have and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.810
 here he gives a balance for what 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.850
 this serves against time here in our 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.390
 animal that is triggered by control 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.119
 remote 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.630
 we get a truck that has a 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.159
 is then charged to the nominal weight 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.810
 lit at 12 tons we played the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.270
 counterweight to the front 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.490
 arriving near the cabin for you to have 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.039
 three tons and more on the front axle 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 So it's three and a half tons more 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.360
 gain what more stability 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.429
 to the ground with this you have a 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.569
 greater safety in handling in the 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.310
 moment of removal 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.380
 what is the advantage of the remote control in 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.420
 Remote control operation many times 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.190
 operator is lynching and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.450
 this lynching when he 's doing it 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.400
 have to get under the truck to 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.260
 make the apple lift the truck and 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.730
 at a time of getting up the road has 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.099
 to get out under the vehicle 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.930
 push the button that is loser ass and 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.640
 with remote control ratio that many 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.620
 Sometimes it's under the extended truck. 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.400
 a little bit the spear collects and makes a 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.060
 lifting 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.930
 advancing the time of service of 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.480
 removal 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.049
 then this time you are reduced 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.700
 wins is with him in removal to take away 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.250
 faster on the highway 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.350
 The winch has a 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.620
 two throws and five hydraulics 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.870
 meters and a half three reducers being two 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.269
 with a capacity of 43 tonnes in 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.389
 rear and one with a capacity of 10 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.389
 tons at the front also has two 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:03.359
 stabilizer bases at the rear 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:06.750
 these resources help in the day-to-day 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:09.359
 operation and brings more agility in 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.389
 release of traffic in case of an accident 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.790
 a has many advantages truck is on a 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:17.040
 operation that today would take a 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.500
 many times the private company in 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.079
 function of other equipment which is a 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.880
 slightly lower could be two 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.760
 hours with the release of a lane and 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.569
 this way it reduces 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.040
 type of operation is often even in 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.900
 680 per cent and function of their 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.239
 advantages that the equipment 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.829
 have for this position here he will be 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.500
 squeaky now but it 's not broken 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.450
 not only that it's just a simulation for us 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.870
 see the performance here of the crane 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.870
 come on 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.070
 this extra heavy critter may tip over 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.830
 trucks and carts in places with little 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.170
 space can move coils and pipes 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.960
 of steel pull vehicles on the wall 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.490
 central and the sun bar tank trucks 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.459
 with greater security 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.800
 I're fÃ¡bio is touching but here the 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.050
 presentation of the false vehicle that was 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.070
 of filling heavy December weight 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.780
 I started here is not easy 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.880
 And then what you found now you go with 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.430
 instructor but operated well the vehicle is 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.550
 break or excellent way an excellent 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.650
 equipment is stick to all work remove 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.720
 any type of truck outside the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.150
 security it gives you stability 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.070
 that we pass the comfort is of a 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.740
 truck with this equipment 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.740
 first line until the end of the year will be 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.130
 four new niches and if the heavy as 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.130
 this one
