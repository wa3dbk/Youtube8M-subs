be<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> mandibular<00:01:15.380> branch<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.460> we're<00:01:17.549> going

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
be the mandibular branch so we're going

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.219 
be the mandibular branch so we're going
to<00:01:17.759> separate<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.509> talk<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:18.930> them

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to separate and talk about them

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.190 
to separate and talk about them
separately<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.360> right<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.509> I'm<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
separately so right now I'm going to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.039 
separately so right now I'm going to
talk<00:01:22.470> about<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.820> atomic<00:01:24.270> branch<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.930> I'm

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
talk about the atomic branch and I'm

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.789 
talk about the atomic branch and I'm
going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> redraw<00:01:28.590> over<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.409> see

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
going to redraw over here so we can see

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.620 
going to redraw over here so we can see
better

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.780 

so<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.079> trigeminal<00:01:37.680> ganglion

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.249

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
receding on the sella turcica so the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.520 
receding on the sella turcica so the
view<00:01:46.470> one<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> come<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.460> over<00:01:47.939> here

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
view one is going to come out over here

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.010 
view one is going to come out over here
and<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:50.460> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> pass<00:01:50.909> by<00:01:51.180> structuring

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and it's going to pass by structuring

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
and it's going to pass by structuring
the<00:01:52.259> ice<00:01:52.649> cold<00:01:53.159> named<00:01:54.229> superior<00:01:55.670> orbital

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
atomic nerve is going to come down over

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.830 
atomic nerve is going to come down over
here<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.310> we<00:04:05.550> is<00:04:05.790> going<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.210> be<00:04:06.390> name<00:04:06.600> it

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
here and we is going to be name it

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.940 
here and we is going to be name it
frontal<00:04:07.640> nerve<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:09.630> frontal<00:04:10.140> nerve<00:04:10.380> has<00:04:10.710> only

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
frontal nerve the frontal nerve has only

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.270 
frontal nerve the frontal nerve has only
our<00:04:11.340> two<00:04:11.790> branches<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:13.350> first<00:04:13.650> branch<00:04:14.010> is

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
our two branches the first branch is

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.949 
our two branches the first branch is
going<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.580> cause<00:04:14.790> us<00:04:15.210> Supra<00:04:17.390> trochlear<00:04:18.390> nerve

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
going to cause us Supra trochlear nerve

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.030 
going to cause us Supra trochlear nerve
and<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:21.209> supertalker<00:04:21.720> our<00:04:22.049> nerve<00:04:22.290> is<00:04:22.680> going

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
and the supertalker our nerve is going

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.830 
and the supertalker our nerve is going
to<00:04:23.130> innervate<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.610> nose<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.820> medial<00:04:27.330> part<00:04:27.570> of

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
to innervate the nose the medial part of

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:43.100 
to innervate the nose the medial part of
the<00:04:28.050> eyelids<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.770> also<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.160> forehead<00:04:42.110> the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
the eyelids and also the forehead the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.530 
the eyelids and also the forehead the
second<00:04:43.560> branch<00:04:43.830> of<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.430> frontal<00:04:45.000> nerve<00:04:45.240> is

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
second branch of the frontal nerve is

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.070 
second branch of the frontal nerve is
going<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.810> be<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.020> super<00:04:47.450> orbital<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:48.810> we

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
going to be the super orbital and we

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.070 
going to be the super orbital and we
know<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:50.550> lot<00:04:50.970> about<00:04:51.000> about<00:04:51.660> this<00:04:51.840> nerve

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
know a lot about about this nerve

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.750 
know a lot about about this nerve
because<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:52.710> nerve<00:04:52.890> is<00:04:53.040> going<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.310> exit

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
because this nerve is going to exit

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.330 
because this nerve is going to exit
through<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:55.100> supraorbital<00:04:56.480> foramen

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
through the supraorbital foramen

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.490 
through the supraorbital foramen
so<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.640> supraorbital<00:05:00.030> nerve<00:05:00.690> is<00:05:01.140> going<00:05:01.380> to

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
so the supraorbital nerve is going to

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.990 
so the supraorbital nerve is going to
innervate<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:01.980> forehead<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:04.770> also<00:05:05.700> the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
innervate the forehead and also the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:20.340 
innervate the forehead and also the
interior<00:05:07.220> scope

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.790 

and<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:22.400> last<00:05:22.640> less<00:05:23.060> range<00:05:23.570> over<00:05:23.810> here<00:05:24.170> is

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
and the last less range over here is

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.980 
and the last less range over here is
really<00:05:25.040> simple<00:05:25.510> it's<00:05:26.510> going<00:05:26.720> to<00:05:26.780> call

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
really simple it's going to call

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.240 
really simple it's going to call
lachrymal<00:05:28.780> nerve<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:30.260> lacrimal<00:05:30.740> nerve<00:05:31.010> is

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
lachrymal nerve the lacrimal nerve is

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:39.970 
lachrymal nerve the lacrimal nerve is
going<00:05:31.490> to<00:05:32.440> innervate<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.470> lacrimal<00:05:34.220> gland<00:05:38.980> so

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
going to innervate the lacrimal gland so

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.040 
going to innervate the lacrimal gland so
three<00:05:40.490> parts<00:05:40.910> over<00:05:41.120> here<00:05:41.420> the<00:05:42.260> lateral<00:05:44.050> I'll

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
three parts over here the lateral I'll

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:53.710 
three parts over here the lateral I'll
eat<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:47.630> conjunctiva<00:05:50.890> of<00:05:51.890> the<00:05:52.160> eye<00:05:52.190> and<00:05:53.090> also

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
eat the conjunctiva of the eye and also

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.950 
eat the conjunctiva of the eye and also
the<00:05:54.020> lacrimal<00:05:54.380> woman<00:05:56.980> and<00:05:58.270> that's<00:05:59.270> it<00:05:59.570> about

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
the lacrimal woman and that's it about

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.550 
the lacrimal woman and that's it about
the<00:06:00.290> atomic<00:06:00.980> range
