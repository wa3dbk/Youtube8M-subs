your RCA connectors directly into the s4

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.970 
your RCA connectors directly into the s4
and<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.210> interacts<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> sound<00:00:49.200> card<00:00:49.440> in

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and it interacts with the sound card in

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.380 
and it interacts with the sound card in
order<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> produce<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.000> need<00:00:51.239> an

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
order to produce this you don't need an

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.420 
order to produce this you don't need an
additional<00:00:51.629> box<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.469> any<00:00:52.649> other<00:00:52.980> additional

to your channel here your input and then
on<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.100> other<00:02:04.130> side<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.759> have<00:02:05.050> another<00:02:06.050> set

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
on the other side you have another set

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.740 
on the other side you have another set
of<00:02:06.380> inputs<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.920> we're<00:02:07.069> running<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:07.750> directly

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
of inputs and we're running it directly

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.199 
of inputs and we're running it directly
through<00:02:09.250> show<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.429> whole<00:02:10.580> cable<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.150> you

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
through show you the whole cable so you

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.320 
through show you the whole cable so you
can<00:02:11.300> see<00:02:11.540> there<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.900> no<00:02:12.170> need<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.830> run<00:02:13.400> an<00:02:13.940> extra

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
can see there is no need to run an extra

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.809 
can see there is no need to run an extra
piece<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.540> hardware<00:02:15.020> just<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.830> s4<00:02:16.340> can<00:02:16.580> do<00:02:16.700> it

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
piece of hardware just the s4 can do it

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.720 
piece of hardware just the s4 can do it
all<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:18.230> said<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.650> was<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.860> demo<00:02:19.130> but<00:02:19.610> this

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
all so I said this was a demo but this

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.010 
all so I said this was a demo but this
is<00:02:19.850> more<00:02:20.030> like<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.209> public<00:02:20.660> service

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
is more like a public service

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.020 
is more like a public service
announcement<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:22.430> let<00:02:22.580> everyone<00:02:22.819> know

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
announcement just to let everyone know

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.020 
announcement just to let everyone know
out<00:02:23.630> there<00:02:23.690> who<00:02:24.230> may<00:02:24.920> be<00:02:24.980> thinking<00:02:25.730> about

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
out there who may be thinking about

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.550 
out there who may be thinking about
taking<00:02:26.480> their<00:02:26.720> hard-earned<00:02:26.750> money<00:02:27.380> and

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
taking their hard-earned money and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.550 
taking their hard-earned money and
getting<00:02:28.690> $1,000<00:02:29.690> DJ<00:02:30.050> controller<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:32.560> you

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
getting $1,000 DJ controller that you

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.559 
getting $1,000 DJ controller that you
know<00:02:33.709> this<00:02:34.099> one<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.459> still<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.240> little<00:02:35.360> bit<00:02:35.540> more

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
know this one is still a little bit more

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.140 
know this one is still a little bit more
upgradeable<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.550> do<00:02:37.670> things<00:02:37.910> with

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
upgradeable and you can do things with

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.920 
upgradeable and you can do things with
it<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.860> other<00:02:40.040> ones<00:02:40.280> can't

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
it that the other ones can't

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.290 
it that the other ones can't
so<00:02:41.930> other<00:02:42.140> decks<00:02:42.410> can<00:02:42.680> do<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.040> feature<00:02:43.459> but

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
so other decks can do this feature but

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.699 
so other decks can do this feature but
in<00:02:44.599> order<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.900> do<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.290> they<00:02:46.300> actually<00:02:47.709> require

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
in order to do it they actually require

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.910 
in order to do it they actually require
another<00:02:49.280> piece<00:02:49.520> of<00:02:49.550> hardware<00:02:49.790> such<00:02:50.690> as<00:02:50.720> an<00:02:51.110> SSL

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
another piece of hardware such as an SSL

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.860 
another piece of hardware such as an SSL
unit<00:02:52.310> or<00:02:52.520> one<00:02:53.300> of<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.450> Native<00:02:53.720> Instruments

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
unit or one of the Native Instruments

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.970 
unit or one of the Native Instruments
units<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.230> how<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.500> works<00:02:57.680> basically

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
units but this is how it works basically

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.330 
units but this is how it works basically
your<00:02:58.849> two-time<00:02:59.300> codecs<00:02:59.840> are<00:03:00.110> deck<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.069> deck

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
your two-time codecs are deck a and deck

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.870 
your two-time codecs are deck a and deck
B<00:03:01.550> they're<00:03:02.000> up<00:03:02.150> here<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.739> I<00:03:04.190> use<00:03:04.520> these<00:03:04.730> as

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
B they're up here and I use these as

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.940 
B they're up here and I use these as
sample<00:03:05.360> decks<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:05.840> know<00:03:06.110> because<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.560> sample

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
sample decks you know because the sample

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.250 
sample decks you know because the sample
deck<00:03:07.099> layout<00:03:07.520> is<00:03:08.090> perfect<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:08.900> one-to-one

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
deck layout is perfect it's one-to-one

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.319 
deck layout is perfect it's one-to-one
here<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:09.920> they<00:03:10.250> made

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
here and they made

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.199 
here and they made
Traktor<00:03:12.049> Kontrol<00:03:12.079> s4<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.819> perfect

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
Traktor Kontrol s4 it's a perfect

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.699 
Traktor Kontrol s4 it's a perfect
one-to-one<00:03:14.629> operation<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.230> looks<00:03:15.379> just<00:03:15.530> like

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
one-to-one operation it looks just like

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.670 
one-to-one operation it looks just like
what's<00:03:15.950> up<00:03:16.129> there<00:03:16.310> on<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.519> screen<00:03:16.719> so<00:03:17.719> that's

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
what's up there on the screen so that's

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.339 
what's up there on the screen so that's
the<00:03:18.859> reason<00:03:19.040> for<00:03:19.549> me<00:03:20.510> using<00:03:20.659> those<00:03:20.870> sample

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
the reason for me using those sample

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.959 
the reason for me using those sample
decks<00:03:21.530> but<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.769> can<00:03:21.950> use<00:03:22.159> those<00:03:22.370> as<00:03:22.609> track

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:22.969 
decks but you can use those as track

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.080 
decks but you can use those as track
decks<00:03:23.239> as<00:03:23.390> well<00:03:23.420> for<00:03:23.870> all<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.909> for<00:03:25.909> all<00:03:26.000> the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
decks as well for all you for all the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.360 
decks as well for all you for all the
BG's<00:03:26.390> out<00:03:26.540> there<00:03:26.780> who<00:03:27.019> actually<00:03:27.590> spin<00:03:28.159> with

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
BG's out there who actually spin with

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.210 
BG's out there who actually spin with
four<00:03:28.670> decks<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.930> as<00:03:30.319> you<00:03:30.530> can<00:03:30.650> see<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:30.920> have<00:03:31.189> it

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
four decks so as you can see I have it

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.399 
four decks so as you can see I have it
set<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.489> a<00:03:31.670> CD<00:03:32.060> timecode<00:03:32.569> you<00:03:32.780> could<00:03:32.989> set<00:03:33.230> this

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
set to a CD timecode you could set this

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.149 
set to a CD timecode you could set this
up<00:03:33.650> with<00:03:34.450> analog<00:03:35.470> final<00:03:36.470> time<00:03:36.650> code<00:03:36.889> as<00:03:37.040> well

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
up with analog final time code as well

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.199 
up with analog final time code as well
and<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.209> will<00:03:38.299> work<00:03:38.420> just<00:03:38.480> just<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:39.290> same<00:03:40.209> so

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
and it will work just just the same so

00:03:41.209 --> 00:04:09.620 
and it will work just just the same so
just<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:42.079> show<00:03:42.439> you<00:03:42.500> guys<00:03:42.790> how<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.939> works<00:03:43.970> here

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.790 

as<00:04:10.630> you<00:04:10.810> can<00:04:10.900> see<00:04:11.140> there's<00:04:11.380> no<00:04:11.500> delay

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
as you can see there's no delay

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.640 
as you can see there's no delay
whatsoever<00:04:12.300> it<00:04:13.300> works<00:04:13.510> just<00:04:13.840> as<00:04:14.410> you<00:04:14.500> would

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
whatsoever it works just as you would

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.250 
whatsoever it works just as you would
want<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:16.209> we<00:04:16.269> can<00:04:16.540> come<00:04:16.660> over<00:04:16.870> here<00:04:17.109> and

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
want it to and we can come over here and

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.840 
want it to and we can come over here and
the<00:04:17.350> software<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:19.540> you'll<00:04:19.690> see<00:04:19.930> that<00:04:20.139> it's

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
the software and you'll see that it's

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.050 
the software and you'll see that it's
running<00:04:21.850> an<00:04:22.120> extra<00:04:26.490> we're<00:04:27.490> gonna<00:04:27.639> use<00:04:27.790> this<00:04:27.910> as

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
running an extra we're gonna use this as

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.940 
running an extra we're gonna use this as
a<00:04:28.090> sample<00:04:28.419> deck<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:29.260> we<00:04:29.350> can<00:04:29.500> take<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.650> sample

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
a sample deck and we can take a sample

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.200 
a sample deck and we can take a sample
anywhere<00:04:30.490> we're<00:04:30.639> ready

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:51.620 

it's<00:04:38.210> over<00:04:38.450> here<00:04:38.810> and<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.500> can<00:04:39.650> actually<00:04:39.830> hear

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:05.870
