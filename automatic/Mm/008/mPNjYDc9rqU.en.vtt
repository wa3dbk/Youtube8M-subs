how I'd take out the racket and get like
four<00:03:00.070> pieces<00:03:00.460> but<00:03:00.760> I'd<00:03:00.880> still<00:03:01.120> go<00:03:01.300> negative<00:03:01.600> so

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
four pieces but I'd still go negative so

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.980 
four pieces but I'd still go negative so
it<00:03:02.050> wasn't<00:03:02.530> really<00:03:02.590> practical<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.630> I

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
it wasn't really practical so I I

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.700 
it wasn't really practical so I I
decided<00:03:06.030> what<00:03:07.030> was<00:03:07.210> more<00:03:07.540> practical<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.620> it

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
decided what was more practical and it

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.460 
decided what was more practical and it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
explaining this is my new tech to you

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.960 
explaining this is my new tech to you
guys<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:08.620> says<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.070> this<00:04:09.160> cocoon<00:04:09.580> bubble

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
guys it says that this cocoon bubble

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.780 
guys it says that this cocoon bubble
kind<00:04:10.209> of<00:04:10.360> thing<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.840> don't<00:04:11.620> see<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:12.730> if

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
kind of thing you don't see it and so if

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.490 
kind of thing you don't see it and so if
you<00:04:12.880> throw<00:04:13.120> out<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.269> EMP<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.050> then<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.260> throw

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
you throw out the EMP and then you throw

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.349 
you throw out the EMP and then you throw
this<00:04:14.680> because<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.489> could<00:04:15.640> throw<00:04:15.760> them<00:04:16.239> in

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
this because you could throw them in

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.330 
this because you could throw them in
with<00:04:16.390> fast<00:04:16.720> hands<00:04:16.989> really<00:04:17.260> fast<00:04:17.500> so<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.190> could

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
with fast hands really fast so you could

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.979 
with fast hands really fast so you could
throw<00:04:18.519> like<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.700> flashbang

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
throw like a flashbang

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.749 
throw like a flashbang
for<00:04:20.319> instantaneously<00:04:21.069> then<00:04:21.340> blow<00:04:21.549> him<00:04:21.669> up

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 
for instantaneously then blow him up

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.260 
for instantaneously then blow him up
well<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.449> new<00:04:22.599> tech<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.110> learned<00:04:24.270> was

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
well the new tech that I learned was

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.909 
well the new tech that I learned was
that<00:04:25.300> if<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:26.830> throw<00:04:27.250> out<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.460> EMP<00:04:28.120> early<00:04:28.630> on

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
that if you throw out the EMP early on

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.219 
that if you throw out the EMP early on
at<00:04:29.919> a<00:04:29.949> hellstorm<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.849> creates<00:04:31.599> a<00:04:31.720> bubble<00:04:32.080> over

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
at a hellstorm it creates a bubble over

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.990 
at a hellstorm it creates a bubble over
you<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.770> I<00:04:33.250> don't<00:04:33.310> know<00:04:33.460> if<00:04:33.580> this<00:04:33.669> is<00:04:33.729> right

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
you and I don't know if this is right

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.150 
you and I don't know if this is right
and<00:04:34.210> then<00:04:34.360> another<00:04:35.050> big<00:04:35.289> video<00:04:35.500> before<00:04:35.650> this<00:04:35.979> I

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
and then another big video before this I

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.400 
and then another big video before this I
try<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.729> throw<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.060> out<00:04:37.240> too<00:04:37.630> late<00:04:37.780> but<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.199> think

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
try to throw it out too late but I think

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.499 
try to throw it out too late but I think
you<00:04:38.500> have<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.650> time<00:04:39.009> it<00:04:39.039> just<00:04:39.220> right<00:04:39.520> it'll<00:04:40.300> put

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
you have to time it just right it'll put

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.110 
you have to time it just right it'll put
a<00:04:40.539> bubble<00:04:40.990> out<00:04:41.110> around<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:42.310> they'll<00:04:42.819> stop

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
a bubble out around you and they'll stop

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.020 
a bubble out around you and they'll stop
it<00:04:43.330> from<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.870> particulate<00:04:44.470> or<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:45.610> helmet

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
it from the particulate or the helmet

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.330 
it from the particulate or the helmet
lights<00:04:46.270> tells<00:04:46.569> from<00:04:46.840> hitting<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:48.160> other

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
lights tells from hitting you the other

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.309 
lights tells from hitting you the other
crazy<00:04:48.819> thing<00:04:49.150> that<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.389> learned<00:04:49.539> in<00:04:49.810> our<00:04:49.930> and

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
crazy thing that I learned in our and

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.710 
crazy thing that I learned in our and
you<00:04:50.530> probably<00:04:50.710> already<00:04:50.889> know<00:04:51.069> this<00:04:51.099> but<00:04:51.720> you

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
you probably already know this but you

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.960 
you probably already know this but you
could<00:04:52.900> throw<00:04:53.050> out<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.710> bubble<00:04:54.099> also<00:04:54.310> stops

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
could throw out the bubble also stops

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.309 
could throw out the bubble also stops
the<00:04:55.479> radius<00:04:55.990> on<00:04:56.199> the<00:04:56.380> EMP<00:04:56.800> stops<00:04:57.729> any<00:04:58.319> hunter

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
the radius on the EMP stops any hunter

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.460 
the radius on the EMP stops any hunter
killer<00:04:59.590> drones<00:04:59.949> and<00:05:00.270> if<00:05:01.270> this<00:05:01.900> another<00:05:02.229> thing

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
killer drones and if this another thing

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.830 
killer drones and if this another thing
I<00:05:02.560> learned<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:02.949> hold<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.729> EMP<00:05:04.270> in<00:05:04.389> your<00:05:04.539> hand

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
I learned you hold the EMP in your hand

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.570 
I learned you hold the EMP in your hand
if<00:05:05.110> hunter<00:05:05.440> killer<00:05:05.680> drone<00:05:05.770> comes<00:05:06.190> around<00:05:06.460> with

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
if hunter killer drone comes around with

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.610 
if hunter killer drone comes around with
your<00:05:06.880> weight<00:05:07.030> it's<00:05:07.330> crazy<00:05:07.659> they<00:05:08.199> just<00:05:08.440> keep

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
know if this is actual helps it works

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.300 
know if this is actual helps it works
all<00:05:12.789> time<00:05:13.090> but<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.690> EMTs<00:05:14.199> are<00:05:14.380> hella<00:05:14.650> powerful

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.629 
ecology and EMP you get mad SMP score
per<00:05:24.610> minute<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.449> it<00:05:26.320> just<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.800> just<00:05:26.860> piles<00:05:27.250> up
