00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.570
 i am a huge cosmo and wanda fan 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.340
 I watch the series whenever I can 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.140
 no matter what time it is 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.300
 I was pretty some time ago 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.970
 so I have many new ones 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.820
 follow from season 5 missed later 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.860
 came the follow in a dvd-box out and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.440
 I wanted to buy it but unfortunately 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.000
 I did not have enough money to be a friend 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 was so nice and lent me his copy 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.800
 so I follow the missed ones 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.320
 could look after me as the box 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.800
 I took a closer look and noticed that 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.120
 Nickelodeon logo was missing on the cover 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.430
 I did not think anymore 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.540
 about it and me when and when 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.400
 I could always follow the consequences 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.720
 when I arrived at the last episode 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.280
 I noticed that there were 21 episodes 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.500
 Usually in every season 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.460
 including only 20 episodes 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.300
 contain 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.370
 the name was sweet revenge i was looking for 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.760
 immediately on the internet afterwards but found 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.890
 Nothing 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.070
 and as you can already imagine 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.220
 i played it off the episode started in 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.660
 almost crystal clear resolution so much 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.229
 better than everyone else 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.210
 The first scene was played by teenagers 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.360
 awaiting his parents welcomed him 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.479
 and so on that was following the others 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.900
 very similar after a minute left 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.640
 he's the room to go downstairs 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.500
 about five seconds after he got down 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.300
 arrived a date with a 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.390
 bloodstained marked by the picture 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.630
 jimi of something as scared as me too 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.869
 the time was called what did you have 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.050
 Dated something muttered something I did 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.540
 did not understand but I believe that 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.310
 to have heard out about silverberg 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.090
 my head was confused with that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.570
 to process 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.980
 which it was normally only 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.420
 a criminal expression in his 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.750
 face through the living room in the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.450
 kitchen 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.850
 He pulled a knife out of his pocket and 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.640
 Put it back in the drawer as if 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.470
 nothing has been my mind said 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.220
 me that it is better the tv 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.260
 make out 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.510
 But I 've got through to it 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.640
 continue to watch 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.830
 the episode cut to the next scene 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.049
 Timmy is the fearful one in his 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.540
 room with an expression as if he had 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.030
 seen a ghost 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.980
 the camera angle waved something 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.890
 so that you can get out of his room door 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.930
 I could see the shadow 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.349
 his date with the machete in his 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.379
 Hand Cosmo warned team quickly and 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.900
 she tried to charm her away but how 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.700
 However some managed to put through 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.239
 the wall and tried his son too 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.730
 catch 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.189
 he threw the knife at him but the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.700
 forever and the knife met cosmo im 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.439
 eye 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.620
 Cosmo is his terrible one 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:14.010
 scream and breathe quickly 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.930
 somehow wandering over the floor 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.290
 as if she had not seen anything with her 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.540
 Cosmo passed her magic away team II 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.310
 landed in the downtown style and style 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.239
 Wanted to look for a phone around the police 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.720
 to agree 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.900
 arrived as a phone booth and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.849
 he heard a voice 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.519
 that was the voice of his dad in 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.680
 a demonic sound like petrified 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.909
 closed his eyes and tried out of the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.389
 to wake up nightmare 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.760
 but all that was not a dream at once 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.090
 could not open his eyes and 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.340
 it seemed like they were melting 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.819
 the blood comes in his eyes then 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.590
 a devil's pentacle of the episode 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.769
 jumped again to another scene 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.510
 chemistry opens in his bed and 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.950
 It only seemed like it was real 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.830
 everything was just a dream 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.769
 but his parents were not there to him 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.860
 greeted there he could scream shouting 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.890
 hear so first could also see 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.220
 why she screamed the machete puts that 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.169
 cosmos head blood gushing out so that 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.500
 a huge puddle on the floor 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.120
 where the ministers went outside 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.730
 Couple his neighbors on one 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.490
 gigantic pole skewered goods 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.740
 Without warning, his eyes became blood red 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.010
 and a binary code flight at the top 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.040
 screen margin then the result was too 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.050
 end and the credits would be shown me 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.720
 looked up hastily took her paper and 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.010
 pen and wrote me the code in im 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.990
 internet i was looking for a sooner 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.590
 translator and entered the numbers 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.290
 stood in the Translation 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.040
 he was the first you are the next 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.710
 his 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.230
 when you see the red light you will 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.820
 to die 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.680
 the next day my parents had to 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.170
 force to go to school 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.640
 When I was almost there I started the 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.880
 Impact of my insomnia 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.410
 tracing the last one 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.610
 I closed my eyes for a few 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.070
 seconds to close 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.920
 I suddenly saw an incredibly bright 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.480
 red flash of light i can scare the 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.750
 I saw the light when I saw it 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.730
 did not express as me 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.880
 When I opened my eyes again I saw the 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:29.260
 friend the box lee he brought himself 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.860
 Laughing yourself with a knife around time 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.560
 after that 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.540
 after the fateful day where I have the 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.160
 I saw myself feeling pretty much like this 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.850
 bad and tells of my parents 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.760
 from that 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.010
 my mother called a psychiatrist to me 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.190
 told him what happened and he 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.170
 said if you are from a friend or 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.450
 a friend dvds a series 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.660
 want to lend it from now on 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.620
 rather 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.780
 I think you should do that too 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.110
 if you do not want to end it's like 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.110
 I
