very pleased with how well it goes on
they<00:00:53.010> suggest<00:00:53.370> doing<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> small<00:00:54.120> three

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
they suggest doing like a small three

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.060 
they suggest doing like a small three
foot<00:00:54.539> by<00:00:54.570> three<00:00:54.690> foot<00:00:54.840> section<00:00:55.379> kind<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.949> did

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
foot by three foot section kind of did

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920 
foot by three foot section kind of did
that<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.910> can't<00:00:57.239> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.719> back<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
that but I can't kind of going back and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.000 
that but I can't kind of going back and
forth<00:00:58.230> because<00:00:58.680> your<00:00:59.460> technique<00:01:00.120> changes<00:01:01.010> as

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
forth because your technique changes as

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
forth because your technique changes as
it<00:01:02.070> goes<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.760> everything<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:04.470> kind<00:01:04.619> of

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
it goes and everything and just kind of

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.010 
it goes and everything and just kind of
went<00:01:04.739> through<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.790> has<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> edges<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
went through it has the edges and the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.910 
went through it has the edges and the
edges<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> blow<00:01:09.080> but<00:01:10.080> yeah<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.439> your

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
edges is a blow but yeah like your

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.200 
edges is a blow but yeah like your
technique<00:01:11.100> kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.520> changes<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> little<00:01:12.090> bit

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
technique kind of changes a little bit

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.210 
technique kind of changes a little bit
so<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.990> don't<00:01:13.020> want<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.159> know

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
