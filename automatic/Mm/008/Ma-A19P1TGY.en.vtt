here<00:00:04.650> we<00:00:04.770> are<00:00:04.799> we<00:00:05.040> going<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.310> look<00:00:05.430> at<00:00:06.770> doing

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
here we are we going to look at doing

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.450 
here we are we going to look at doing
the<00:00:07.859> wiring<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.500> mockingbirds<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.830> this

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
the wiring on the mockingbirds and this

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.200 
the wiring on the mockingbirds and this
is<00:00:11.610> part<00:00:11.910> one<00:00:13.219> wiring<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.309> three-way<00:00:14.790> switch

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
is part one wiring the three-way switch

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.099 
is part one wiring the three-way switch
okay<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.619> have<00:00:16.830> two<00:00:17.070> sets<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.640> wires<00:00:17.880> here<00:00:18.119> we

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
okay we have two sets of wires here we

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.189 
okay we have two sets of wires here we
have<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.619> purple<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.970> gray<00:00:21.180> wire<00:00:21.539> together

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
have a purple and a gray wire together

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.769 
have a purple and a gray wire together
and<00:00:22.650> then<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> longest<00:00:24.029> wise<00:00:24.269> you're<00:00:24.600> going

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
and then the longest wise you're going

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.279 
and then the longest wise you're going
to<00:00:24.840> get<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> kit<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> red

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
to get in the kit and we have a red

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.310 
to get in the kit and we have a red
brown<00:00:28.289> black<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.400> white<00:00:30.000> they're<00:00:30.900> slightly

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
brown black and white they're slightly

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.180 
brown black and white they're slightly
shorter<00:00:32.219> than<00:00:32.510> the<00:00:33.510> gray<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.559> purple

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
shorter than the gray and purple

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030 
shorter than the gray and purple
now<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.450> doesn't<00:00:37.350> matter<00:00:37.469> if<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> end<00:00:37.920> up

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
now just doesn't matter if you end up

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.510 
now just doesn't matter if you end up
using<00:00:38.219> different<00:00:38.640> colored<00:00:38.910> wires<00:00:40.040> as<00:00:41.040> long<00:00:41.340> as

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
using different colored wires as long as

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880 
using different colored wires as long as
you<00:00:41.670> follow<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> same<00:00:42.360> steps<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.500> will<00:00:43.710> all

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
you follow the same steps it will all

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.430 
you follow the same steps it will all
work<00:00:44.190> out<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:47.180> what's<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.629> here<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> we

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
work out so what's going on here is we

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.810 
work out so what's going on here is we
have<00:00:50.030> twisted<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.059> red<00:00:51.420> wire<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:53.160> brown<00:00:53.460> wire

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
have twisted the red wire the brown wire

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.279 
have twisted the red wire the brown wire
and<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.660> purple<00:00:55.110> wire<00:00:55.770> together<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.289> these

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and the purple wire together and these

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.200 
and the purple wire together and these
are<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.770> attached<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> outside

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
are going to be attached to the outside

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:10.640 
are going to be attached to the outside
of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.109> three-way<00:01:01.770> switch

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.420 

two<00:01:11.650> of<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:11.890> wise<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:13.330> brown<00:01:13.660> and<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.110> red

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
two of the wise the brown and the red

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.990 
two of the wise the brown and the red
are<00:01:15.430> going<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.820> go<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.030> our<00:01:16.980> volume<00:01:17.980> pots<00:01:21.000> or

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
are going to go to our volume pots or

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.910 
are going to go to our volume pots or
our<00:01:22.390> volume<00:01:22.780> controls<00:01:23.290> and<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.290> purple<00:01:26.710> wire

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
our volume controls and the purple wire

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.430 
our volume controls and the purple wire
is<00:01:27.910> going<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.210> end<00:01:28.450> up<00:01:28.570> going<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:28.930> our<00:01:29.140> jack

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
is going to end up going to our jack

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.950 
is going to end up going to our jack
plug<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.979> that's<00:01:30.370> why<00:01:30.610> it's<00:01:30.790> longer<00:01:31.210> because

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
plug and that's why it's longer because

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.570 
plug and that's why it's longer because
it<00:01:32.080> needs<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.380> go<00:01:32.530> all<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.040> way<00:01:33.160> through<00:01:33.460> the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
it needs to go all the way through the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.360 
it needs to go all the way through the
body<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.210> back

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
body and out the back

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.550 
body and out the back
okay<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.380> just<00:01:41.410> soldering<00:01:42.190> that<00:01:42.340> on<00:01:43.560> so

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
okay so just soldering that on so

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.719 
okay so just soldering that on so
there's<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:44.890> there<00:01:45.130> should<00:01:45.340> be<00:01:45.369> like<00:01:45.670> a

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
there's that there should be like a

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.540 
there's that there should be like a
little<00:01:46.060> ring<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:47.590> can<00:01:47.740> just<00:01:47.950> bend<00:01:48.250> up

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
little ring that you can just bend up

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.820 
little ring that you can just bend up
and<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.930> should<00:01:50.140> be<00:01:50.229> able<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.470> put<00:01:50.650> those

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
and you should be able to put those

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.030 
and you should be able to put those
three<00:01:51.280> wires<00:01:51.900> through<00:01:52.900> that<00:01:53.110> ring<00:01:53.440> on<00:01:53.710> the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
three wires through that ring on the

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.230 
three wires through that ring on the
outside<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:55.060> switch<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:57.610> leaves<00:01:57.910> us

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
outside of the switch so that leaves us

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.530 
outside of the switch so that leaves us
with<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:59.619> black<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.369> white<00:02:00.610> wire<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
with a black and a white wire and the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.139 
with a black and a white wire and the
gray<00:02:04.750> wire<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.979> gray<00:02:06.160> wire<00:02:06.490> goes<00:02:06.790> in<00:02:07.030> the

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
gray wire so the gray wire goes in the

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.120 
gray wire so the gray wire goes in the
center<00:02:09.780> now<00:02:10.780> remember<00:02:11.200> it's<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.530> gray<00:02:11.830> wire

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
center now remember it's the gray wire

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.800 
center now remember it's the gray wire
and<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.640> purple<00:02:13.090> wire<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:16.060> are<00:02:16.120> going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.660> go

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
and the purple wire that are going to go

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.720 
and the purple wire that are going to go
to<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.049> jack<00:02:17.290> plug<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.130> we're<00:02:18.370> putting<00:02:18.519> that

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
to the jack plug so we're putting that

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:28.460 
to the jack plug so we're putting that
through<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.120> center<00:02:19.780> little<00:02:20.500> hole

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.440 

remember<00:02:29.470> they're<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.710> longest<00:02:30.130> ones<00:02:30.850> you're

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
remember they're the longest ones you're

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.650 
remember they're the longest ones you're
going<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.720> get<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.200> kit<00:02:33.360> because<00:02:34.360> they

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
going to get in the kit because they

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.150 
going to get in the kit because they
need<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.960> go<00:02:35.080> all<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.380> way<00:02:35.590> through<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.070> body

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
need to go all the way through the body

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.760 
need to go all the way through the body
so<00:02:39.240> one's<00:02:40.240> been<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.840> soldered<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.380> center

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
so one's been it soldered to the center

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.010 
so one's been it soldered to the center
pin<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.130> one<00:02:43.030> has<00:02:43.240> been<00:02:43.450> soldered<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
pin and one has been soldered to the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:52.410 
pin and one has been soldered to the
shield<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:45.370> should<00:02:45.580> make<00:02:45.790> sense<00:02:51.090> alright<00:02:52.090> so

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
shield it should make sense alright so

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.420 
shield it should make sense alright so
here<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:53.830> jumped<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.220> bit<00:02:54.250> we're<00:02:54.910> um

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
here just jumped a bit we're um

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.700 
here just jumped a bit we're um
soldering<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.640> black<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.240> white<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:59.590> the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
soldering the black and the white to the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.510 
soldering the black and the white to the
two<00:02:59.890> outer<00:03:00.160> pins<00:03:02.160> now<00:03:03.160> think<00:03:03.460> of<00:03:03.580> it<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:03.820> way

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
two outer pins now think of it this way

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.940 
two outer pins now think of it this way
those<00:03:06.520> are<00:03:06.550> going<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.210> go<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.080> volume<00:03:08.500> pots

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
those are going to go to the volume pots

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.380 
those are going to go to the volume pots
and<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:12.040> volume<00:03:12.340> pots<00:03:12.580> also<00:03:12.970> need<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.270> be

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
and the volume pots also need to be

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.560 
and the volume pots also need to be
earth<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:14.080> that's<00:03:14.920> why<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:17.470> soldered<00:03:18.570> the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
earth and that's why we soldered the

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.380 
earth and that's why we soldered the
other<00:03:19.840> two<00:03:20.230> wires<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.670> outside<00:03:22.210> of<00:03:22.240> the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
other two wires to the outside of the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.920 
other two wires to the outside of the
switch<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:24.130> everything<00:03:24.970> now<00:03:25.180> has<00:03:25.450> an<00:03:25.630> earth

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
switch so everything now has an earth

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:34.730 
switch so everything now has an earth
and<00:03:26.550> an<00:03:27.550> active

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.520 

okay<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:36.240> hope<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.600> makes<00:03:36.780> sense<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:39.530> tune

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
okay so I hope that makes sense and tune

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.270 
okay so I hope that makes sense and tune
in<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.860> part<00:03:41.460> 2
