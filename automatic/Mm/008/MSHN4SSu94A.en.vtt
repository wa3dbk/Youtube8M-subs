00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.460 

so<00:04:47.850> saying<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.660> polished<00:04:50.139> version<00:04:50.200> of

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470

so saying the the polished version of
glittering<00:04:50.860> has<00:04:51.100> all<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.580> same<00:04:51.790> stats<00:04:52.180> I
