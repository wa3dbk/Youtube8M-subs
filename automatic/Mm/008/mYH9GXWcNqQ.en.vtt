we're going to do is we're going to turn
it<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.610> once<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.509> we're<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:36.840> to

it on and once it's on we're going to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.230 
it on and once it's on we're going to
hit<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.140> button<00:01:38.509> turns<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.900> gun<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:41.240> it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
hit this button turns on the gun and it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.030 
hit this button turns on the gun and it
usually<00:01:43.049> heat<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> about<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> hundred

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
usually heat up to about a hundred

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.719 
usually heat up to about a hundred
degrees<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.700> its<00:01:44.880> own<00:01:45.979> once<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:47.460> we

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
degrees on its own once it's there we

people preheat these motherboards before
they<00:02:11.620> do<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:13.060> long<00:02:13.239> as<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.510> don't

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
they do this as long as you don't

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.380 
they do this as long as you don't
overheat<00:02:14.019> it<00:02:14.290> won't<00:02:14.440> warp<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.950> i<00:02:15.390> preheated

overheat it won't warp it i preheated

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.070 
overheat it won't warp it i preheated
this<00:02:16.599> one<00:02:16.750> before<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.080> put<00:02:17.349> it<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:19.080> most

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
this one before I put it on here most

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.690 
this one before I put it on here most
people<00:02:20.440> use<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> regular<00:02:20.890> old<00:02:21.099> griddle<00:02:21.549> you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
people use a regular old griddle you

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.680 
people use a regular old griddle you
could<00:02:21.849> buy<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.030> cook<00:02:22.299> food<00:02:22.540> with<00:02:22.870> at<00:02:23.230> Walmart

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
could buy to cook food with at Walmart

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.170 
could buy to cook food with at Walmart
I'm<00:02:25.690> going<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.959> go<00:02:26.110> up<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.760> say<00:02:28.349> 228<00:02:29.349> whatever

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
I'm going to go up to say 228 whatever

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.800 
I'm going to go up to say 228 whatever
let<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.299> get<00:02:31.390> warm<00:02:33.329> this<00:02:34.329> is<00:02:34.510> your<00:02:34.660> air

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
let it get warm this is your air

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.910 
let it get warm this is your air
pressure<00:02:35.110> here<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.799> got<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.760> set<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.000> 50<00:02:40.739> just<00:02:41.739> go

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
pressure here I got it set to 50 just go

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.819 
pressure here I got it set to 50 just go
up<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:43.140> mean<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:45.459> method<00:02:45.910> works<00:02:46.030> for<00:02:46.329> me<00:02:46.829> how

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
up I mean this method works for me how

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.470 
up I mean this method works for me how
the<00:02:47.890> methods<00:02:48.370> might<00:02:48.519> work<00:02:48.760> for<00:02:48.790> other<00:02:49.090> people

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the methods might work for other people
