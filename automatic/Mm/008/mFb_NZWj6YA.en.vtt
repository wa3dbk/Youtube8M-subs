but I finally got my hands on one and
I've<00:00:15.570> been<00:00:15.690> experimenting<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.590> for<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
I've been experimenting with it for the

I've been experimenting with it for the
last<00:00:16.920> few<00:00:17.160> weeks<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.790> I<00:00:18.180> thought<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> would

made<00:00:42.900> up<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.110> three<00:00:43.379> parts<00:00:43.610> you<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.729> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
made up of three parts you have the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.299 
made up of three parts you have the
porcelain<00:00:45.089> jug<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.260> porcelain<00:00:46.799> Iliad<00:00:47.129> and

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
porcelain jug the porcelain Iliad and

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
porcelain jug the porcelain Iliad and
this<00:00:48.030> filter<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.839> kind<00:00:49.080> of<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.229> core

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
this filter which is kind of the core

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.250 
this filter which is kind of the core
it's<00:00:49.949> stainless<00:00:50.369> steel<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.119> it's<00:00:51.570> photo<00:00:51.960> etch

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
it's stainless steel and it's photo etch

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.079 
it's stainless steel and it's photo etch
so<00:00:52.650> there's<00:00:52.830> about<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.070> half<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.489> million<00:00:53.699> tiny

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
so there's about a half a million tiny

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.950 
so there's about a half a million tiny
holes<00:00:54.479> in<00:00:54.720> here<00:00:54.900> and<00:00:55.790> mr.<00:00:56.790> salamis<00:00:57.299> theory<00:00:57.690> is

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
holes in here and mr. salamis theory is

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
holes in here and mr. salamis theory is
that<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.619> treat<00:00:59.010> coffee<00:00:59.309> really<00:00:59.699> bad<00:00:59.879> he

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
that we treat coffee really bad he

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.660 
that we treat coffee really bad he
thinks<00:01:00.540> you<00:01:00.839> know<00:01:00.960> using<00:01:01.350> paper<00:01:01.920> filters<00:01:02.400> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
thinks you know using paper filters it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.939 
thinks you know using paper filters it
it<00:01:03.119> keeps<00:01:03.330> all<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.659> oils<00:01:04.019> from<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> cup<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
it keeps all the oils from the cup and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
it keeps all the oils from the cup and
the<00:01:05.670> French<00:01:05.909> press<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.420> violently<00:01:06.930> matches

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the French press it violently matches

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.280 
the French press it violently matches
the<00:01:07.680> grounds<00:01:08.190> so<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.910> his<00:01:09.060> solution<00:01:09.630> so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the grounds so this is his solution so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.710 
the grounds so this is his solution so
what<00:01:10.440> happens<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.490> water<00:01:11.700> softly<00:01:12.390> seeps

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
what happens is the water softly seeps

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.080 
what happens is the water softly seeps
through<00:01:12.900> all<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> these<00:01:13.350> tiny<00:01:13.710> holes<00:01:14.100> brewing

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
through all of these tiny holes brewing

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.780 
through all of these tiny holes brewing
a<00:01:15.180> rich<00:01:15.480> flavorful<00:01:16.200> cup<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.220> catching<00:01:17.610> much

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
a rich flavorful cup but catching much

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.640 
a rich flavorful cup but catching much
more<00:01:18.000> sediment<00:01:18.540> than<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.410> with<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
more sediment than you would get with a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.790 
more sediment than you would get with a
French<00:01:19.890> press<00:01:20.160> so<00:01:21.110> it's<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.320> simple<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
French press so it's really simple so

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.860 
French press so it's really simple so
I'm<00:01:22.980> gonna<00:01:23.070> make<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> pop<00:01:23.610> right<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.030> first

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
I'm gonna make a pop right now first

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.290 
I'm gonna make a pop right now first
what<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.370> take<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.880> fresh

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
what you do is you take your fresh

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.540 
what you do is you take your fresh
grinds<00:01:27.660> which<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.260> ground<00:01:28.560> before<00:01:28.800> I<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.400> this

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
grinds which I ground before I make this

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.860 
grinds which I ground before I make this
video<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.860> pour<00:01:32.190> them<00:01:32.720> right<00:01:33.720> into

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
video and you just pour them right into

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.660 
video and you just pour them right into
the<00:01:34.140> stainless<00:01:34.409> steel<00:01:34.590> filter<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:37.460> you've<00:01:38.460> got

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the stainless steel filter so you've got

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.690 
the stainless steel filter so you've got
that<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.720> there<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.440> prefer<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> grind

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
that there in there I prefer a grind

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.790 
that there in there I prefer a grind
that's<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.630> coarse<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> French<00:01:43.440> press

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
that's not as coarse as a French press

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.250 
that's not as coarse as a French press
but<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.420> than<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> pour<00:01:45.960> over

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
but a little more so than a pour over

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.830 
but a little more so than a pour over
like<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.440> Hari<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:46.979> Kim<00:01:47.310> X<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.670> found<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.570> that

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
like a Hari or Kim X I found that that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.020 
like a Hari or Kim X I found that that
produces<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.440> best<00:01:49.590> cup<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.729> brews

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
produces the best cup and then it brews
