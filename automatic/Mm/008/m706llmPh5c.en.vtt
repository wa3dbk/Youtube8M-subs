on<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.490> blue<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.849> give<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.060> more<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.240> like<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
on the blue to give it more of like a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.330 
on the blue to give it more of like a
glow-in-the-dark<00:00:30.720> fluorescent<00:00:31.650> feel<00:00:31.830> while

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340

video like I mentioned modded car I did
-<00:03:34.769> there's<00:03:35.100> intorno<00:03:35.430> which<00:03:35.640> is<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:35.880> the

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000

classic Tron Lamborghini and I also did

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.870 
classic Tron Lamborghini and I also did
the<00:03:39.000> dubs<00:03:39.359> -<00:03:39.600> 6x6<00:03:40.440> which<00:03:40.620> was<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.920> DLC<00:03:41.430> vehicle

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
the dubs - 6x6 which was the DLC vehicle

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.550 
the dubs - 6x6 which was the DLC vehicle
both<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.359> more<00:03:42.480> DLC<00:03:42.630> actually<00:03:43.140> but<00:03:43.290> either<00:03:43.410> way

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
both of more DLC actually but either way

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.199 
both of more DLC actually but either way
both<00:03:44.160> emitted<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.519> same<00:03:44.670> thing<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:44.910> got<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
both emitted the same thing I got the

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.940 
both emitted the same thing I got the
black<00:03:45.630> paint<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.109> mixed<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.620> with<00:03:46.739> like<00:03:46.920> a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
black paint and mixed it with like a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.190 
black paint and mixed it with like a
pearlescent<00:03:47.609> metallic<00:03:48.030> blue<00:03:48.239> mix<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.049> two

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
pearlescent metallic blue mix the two

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.630 
pearlescent metallic blue mix the two
paints<00:03:49.590> they<00:03:49.739> both<00:03:49.920> layered<00:03:50.220> on<00:03:50.310> top<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.489> each

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
paints they both layered on top of each

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.039 
paints they both layered on top of each
other<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.030> like<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.570> could<00:03:51.720> see<00:03:51.900> through

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
other and like you could see through

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.810 
other and like you could see through
them<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.799> none<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.130> them<00:03:53.280> were<00:03:53.430> way<00:03:53.579> too<00:03:53.609> less

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
them so none of them were way too less

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.699 
them so none of them were way too less
of<00:03:53.940> pearlescent<00:03:54.450> if<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.630> makes<00:03:54.810> sense<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.260> it

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
of pearlescent if that makes sense so it

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.410 
of pearlescent if that makes sense so it
creates<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.069> matte<00:03:56.430> black<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.150> dark

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
creates like a matte black in the dark

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.210 
creates like a matte black in the dark
but<00:03:57.810> in<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.989> light<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.410> does<00:03:58.650> look<00:03:58.859> kind<00:03:59.100> of

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
but in the light it does look kind of

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.590 
but in the light it does look kind of
blueish<00:03:59.609> so<00:03:59.790> that's<00:03:59.940> why<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.120> tried<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.390> film

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
blueish so that's why I tried to film

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.720 
blueish so that's why I tried to film
all<00:04:00.750> this<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.200> dark<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:02.160> also<00:04:02.400> added

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
all this in the dark and I also added

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.930 
all this in the dark and I also added
some<00:04:02.940> values<00:04:03.480> on<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.489> secondary<00:04:05.489> color<00:04:05.790> to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
some values on the secondary color to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.819 
some values on the secondary color to
make<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.329> bright<00:04:06.660> almost<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.170> cyan<00:04:07.530> a

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
make it a bright almost like a cyan a

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.940 
make it a bright almost like a cyan a
bright<00:04:08.459> blue<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.090> has<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.720> shiny<00:04:10.230> a

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
bright blue and it has like a shiny a

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.430 
bright blue and it has like a shiny a
very<00:04:11.370> shiny<00:04:11.700> glowing<00:04:12.090> thing<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.840> well<00:04:13.319> it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
very shiny glowing thing to it well it

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.259 
very shiny glowing thing to it well it
isn't<00:04:13.590> really<00:04:13.739> anything<00:04:14.400> special<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.090> didn't

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
isn't really anything special I didn't

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.969 
isn't really anything special I didn't
use<00:04:15.359> any<00:04:15.540> glow<00:04:15.780> modifications<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.590> edited<00:04:16.859> the

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
use any glow modifications I edited the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.009 
use any glow modifications I edited the
color<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.820> would<00:04:17.940> have<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.120> real<00:04:18.329> shiny<00:04:18.690> glow

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
color so it would have a real shiny glow

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.210 
color so it would have a real shiny glow
and<00:04:19.200> it's<00:04:19.320> combined<00:04:19.560> with<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.769> little<00:04:20.039> bit<00:04:20.130> of

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
and it's combined with a little bit of

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.460 
and it's combined with a little bit of
chrome<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.789> give<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.120> bright<00:04:22.019> shiny

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
chrome to give it that bright shiny
