00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.670
 they also teach you to walk 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.010
 contracts I do not know do not come back because I 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.010
 I keep working 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.990
 changing hernÃ¡n you who are there 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.450
 in because respect we do not see outside 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.140
 this can change the hand because all 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.259
 They want to see a selection in three days 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.550
 in such a short time is to say safe well 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.920
 with the united states again frame in 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.390
 Japan was played accepting car to china 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.989
 so what must there be is 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.989
 a constancy 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.890
 in this position that is has always been 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.540
 the same criticize loses the match 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.510
 criticism you have to remove it comes or you have to 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.170
 take it out you have to put another one is one is a 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.820
 situation that you ask 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.500
 we changed but there are some 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.300
 you who do not change because always 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.769
 that is in this position always has 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.379
 the parties that owe to another that comes 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.180
 that you do not maintain a 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.159
 does not keep a record if we go to 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.780
 do a process to see what happens 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.329
 here a year to two years to see what 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.549
 it happens and apart 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.110
 the result but if they were results 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.549
 then many selectors in all 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.179
 sides of the world would take away all three 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.179
 split steps 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.439
 and here yes here if I do not say it now that 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.240
 I spoke with my friend now he told me what 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.880
 same here is a hot potato because 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.730
 here they have things fast and they do not use 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.350
 several of you see the other 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.550
 if you want to continue with the same swing 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.550
 let's continue with the same and bng
