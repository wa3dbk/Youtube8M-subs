on<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.369> nice<00:00:20.520> car<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.789> think<00:00:21.140> one<00:00:22.140> that

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
on a really nice car I think one that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.590 
on a really nice car I think one that
usually<00:00:23.460> doesn't<00:00:23.760> change<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.240> much<00:00:24.300> but

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
usually doesn't change that much but

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.960 
usually doesn't change that much but
they<00:00:24.689> actually<00:00:25.310> kind<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.400> changed<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:26.849> a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
they actually kind of changed it up a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.339 
they actually kind of changed it up a
little<00:00:27.119> bit<00:00:27.240> I'm<00:00:27.570> not<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> fan<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> driver

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
little bit I'm not a fan of the driver

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.650 
little bit I'm not a fan of the driver
but<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.279> car<00:00:29.460> um<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.480> here's

glance<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.910> probably<00:00:42.120> won't<00:00:42.300> notice<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
glance you probably won't notice you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
glance you probably won't notice you
probably<00:00:43.350> think<00:00:43.530> oh<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:44.160> looks<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.489> same

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
probably think oh it just looks the same

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
probably think oh it just looks the same
as<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.879> always<00:00:44.940> did<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.899> actually<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.649> really

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
as it always did I'm actually not really

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.069 
as it always did I'm actually not really
it<00:00:47.340> doesn't<00:00:47.489> there's<00:00:47.940> some<00:00:48.180> major<00:00:48.510> changes

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it doesn't there's some major changes

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.750 
it doesn't there's some major changes
this<00:00:49.260> year<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.920> did<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.340> see<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
this year that we did not see in the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.170 
this year that we did not see in the
past<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.260> think<00:00:52.530> we're<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.890> better

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
past and I think we're for the better

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.510 
past and I think we're for the better
and<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.570> thing<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> point<00:00:55.230> out<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.770> also

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and one thing to point out this is also

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.450 
and one thing to point out this is also
has<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.030> new<00:00:57.570> spoiler<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.129> without

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
has the new spoiler there and without

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.830 
has the new spoiler there and without
the<00:00:59.609> splitter<00:00:59.940> bars<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.300> can't<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.629> see

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the splitter bars you can't really see

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.090 
the splitter bars you can't really see
here<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.199> you'll<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.500> when<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.680> take<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:01.980> out

is there's no brown M&amp;Ms on the car
anymore<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.330> don't<00:04:30.810> think<00:04:31.200> they<00:04:31.350> got<00:04:31.470> rid<00:04:31.650> of

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
anymore I don't think they got rid of

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.980 
anymore I don't think they got rid of
like<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:32.040> brown<00:04:32.220> M&amp;M<00:04:32.670> in<00:04:32.850> real<00:04:33.210> life<00:04:33.420> so<00:04:33.720> I

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
like the brown M&amp;M in real life so I

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.330 
like the brown M&amp;M in real life so I
don't<00:04:34.410> know<00:04:34.500> why<00:04:34.560> they<00:04:34.680> decided<00:04:34.889> to<00:04:35.070> take<00:04:35.220> it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
don't know why they decided to take it

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.100 
don't know why they decided to take it
off<00:04:35.490> but<00:04:35.820> I<00:04:36.030> didn't<00:04:36.450> really<00:04:36.540> like<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.930> brown

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
off but I didn't really like the brown

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.070 
off but I didn't really like the brown
M&amp;M<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.620> just<00:04:37.770> kind<00:04:38.100> of<00:04:38.130> looked<00:04:38.340> pretty<00:04:38.730> bad

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
M&amp;M it just kind of looked pretty bad

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.320 
M&amp;M it just kind of looked pretty bad
and<00:04:40.100> they<00:04:41.100> replaced<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.610> brown<00:04:41.790> M&amp;M<00:04:42.150> with<00:04:42.270> a

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
and they replaced the brown M&amp;M with a

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.879 
and they replaced the brown M&amp;M with a
green<00:04:42.570> one<00:04:42.780> so<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:43.020> think<00:04:43.169> that<00:04:43.500> was<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.680> nice

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
green one so I think that was a nice

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.400 
green one so I think that was a nice
change<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:44.460> looks<00:04:44.610> really<00:04:44.880> nice<00:04:45.260> colors<00:04:46.260> go
