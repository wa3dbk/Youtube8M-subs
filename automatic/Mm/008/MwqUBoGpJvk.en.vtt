know last month my last video I came to
guys<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:31.920> having<00:00:32.099> little<00:00:32.399> problems<00:00:32.759> as

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
guys and I was having little problems as

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.060 
guys and I was having little problems as
usual<00:00:33.050> but<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> weight<00:00:34.680> loss<00:00:34.860> has

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
usual but you know the weight loss has

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.770 
usual but you know the weight loss has
slowed<00:00:35.430> down<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.210> able<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> pick<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
slowed down but I was able to pick it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.590 
slowed down but I was able to pick it
back<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.469> my<00:00:37.920> 10<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.489> did<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:38.820> lose<00:00:39.030> not<00:00:39.540> one

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
back up and my 10 I did not lose not one

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.319 
back up and my 10 I did not lose not one
pound<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.379> didn't<00:00:40.739> gain<00:00:40.920> weight<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.550> didn't<00:00:42.120> lose

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
pound I didn't gain weight I didn't lose

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
pound I didn't gain weight I didn't lose
any<00:00:42.540> weight<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> guess<00:00:43.710> maybe<00:00:44.010> that's<00:00:44.129> why<00:00:44.460> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
any weight so I guess maybe that's why I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.270 
any weight so I guess maybe that's why I
was<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.390> really<00:00:46.140> excited<00:00:46.649> about<00:00:46.770> doing<00:00:47.100> the
