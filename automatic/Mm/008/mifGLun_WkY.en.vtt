00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:23.029
 and that this time we are in 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.250
 minecraft and then nothing and I am the doctor 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.500
 and stable I bring a super seed that 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.840
 It's very very pro, you know, I'll let you 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.590
 in the description of this video and everything 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.110
 It's cool and so good support and good that 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.590
 has this seed that has all the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.290
 biomes or all the biomes that is and 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.660
 is quite select and all this wave and 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.460
 well let's start here is where 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.990
 we appear with when we start the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.030
 seed I think that here always appears 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.100
 all and well then here simply what 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.930
 is what we have the mushroom island like that 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.300
 is that if you want to live pure 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.160
 mushroom stew just come 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.770
 here is pretty cool is this 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.020
 big is nothing more than an island 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.330
 and as always I always be in everything 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.979
 is where the island is and that is 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.299
 pretty cool and all this wave now 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.860
 we went to the next side there 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.630
 who coordinates as always and 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.479
 just on this side that is what 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.490
 we have just got off and that is what 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.800
 what are we going to find we are going to find 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.690
 so you already saw a spa 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.860
 it's spiders so well 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.540
 it serves to make the farm of 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.250
 experience as I always say and everything 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.630
 this wave helps us a lot to do the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.460
 experience farm and what it is that 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.410
 we have in the chests in which we have 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.330
 a disc of these that are but that is 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.620
 very difficult to find them and we have the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.480
 that is being a book of these 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.340
 toilets that I think was but it was 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.080
 protection 1 and all this band and now 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.060
 We passed the next side and as always 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.830
 there are the coordinates and here we have 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.410
 a villa that is not very, very 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.330
 let's say but has has the food 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.980
 essential to be able to survive in this 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.630
 which is the minecraft there are as you can see 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.000
 is the wheat the carrot I think 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.590
 has potatoes and all this wave and so 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.300
 It's pretty cool and now we're going 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.100
 from the next side and it's another villa 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.110
 which is built here in a pond 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.060
 I do not know why but it is but and has a 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.980
 Blacksmith's house and well what is not 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.900
 I was struck by what called me the 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.080
 attention was not the house of blacksmiths but 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.730
 that there is a villager with a profession 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.070
 blacksmith who changes you I do not know what thing 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.590
 Well, and it gives you a diamond front 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.060
 Here's but this and as good now 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.840
 we pass is the next side and here 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.370
 we have another of these villas but this 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.010
 it's sandstone that are very 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.360
 they are quite project of this wave and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.819
 here is what we have been finding 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.159
 we have a cap this iron all of 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.379
 iron but it's pretty cool and 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.420
 everything is where to go and now let's move 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.730
 forward and how can you see there that 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.790
 is what we have home has created that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.349
 we have a spam again another spawn but 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.180
 This is zombies, it comes to us 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.980
 pretty good to tell experience and 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.659
 all this wave in the chest 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.000
 we just have what I'm doing 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.739
 what is remarkable is the saddle for 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.659
 the serve and all this wave and this 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.030
 side we have a super cave but that already 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.739
 have to explore you and well 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.359
 now we move on to what has been the 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.060
 east temple of sand that is also 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.829
 pretty cool and everything is where to go and 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.180
 Well, we're just going to go down as if 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.370
 there would not be a dish that we're going to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.109
 explode a plate of your pressure and 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.239
 staff that is what we come 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.400
 finding here we have gold like that already 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.590
 heaps is a lot of golds is 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.870
 quite exaggerated the good gold not much 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.299
 but there is quite a nice booth and king 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.760
 and here is what we simply have 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.760
 they have to dig down 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.980
 it's just carmen es carmen and ya and what 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.900
 is what we have there 4 d 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.390
 joaquin they call that is pretty but 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.360
 the diamond or the diamond comes pretty well 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.819
 be who needs a seed and apart 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.190
 he goes looking for diamonds nobody good 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.170
 I do not know but well here I think we 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.540
 we found finding are these four 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.400
 of diamond and this is quite 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.440
 well because there's more diamond I found 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.060
 more diamond out there is pretty cool 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.920
 now we spend what is being this 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.750
 side and we have a temple of these from 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.000
 jungle that is also pretty but 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.230
 They are very cool and everything is so virgin and 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.239
 here also what we come for 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.220
 finding is something very very priori is 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.650

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.319

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.720
 pretty cool and all this band after 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.220
 just in that jungle and decided a 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.050
 little bit further and it's a bit 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.539
 separate this we have what comes 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.820
 being another temple of these left a like 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.770
 they are quite pro and here is what 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.229
 We have been finding this chest not 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.689
 they take importance is a mess 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.569

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:48.669
 as always there are the coordinates 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.069
 I had not shown them and all this 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.839

 Diamond highlight all you can from 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:57.549
 everything is all these things and then here 

00:04:55.119 --> 00:05:00.219
 What we have is a gift 

00:04:57.549 --> 00:05:02.349
 this is the most but I think you do 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:04.509
 looser of the seed they are 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.689

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:14.499
 that a mine of these abandoned that 

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:16.719
 here we can find infinity of 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:18.249
 things and I 'm just not going to show 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.800
