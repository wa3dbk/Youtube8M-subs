00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.690
 the ripe banana and in perfect many 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.100
 do not even know what to eat ripe banana 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.820
 is and how the tastes ripe banana 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.199
 tastes sweeter a lot easier to digest 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.670
 maybe as a planning so the week 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.289
 is it shit then 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.560
 but with the large amount of bananas 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.760
 Kiwis on general fruit should be 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 always make sure that they are rice 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.040
 the feature is a difference like day 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.600
 and night 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.930
 and most, and let's just say 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.420
 win by Froese children that otherwise 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.719
 you are, so to speak, wrong and if you are 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.340
 so to speak no crack here at the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.350
 no longer tearing down the game 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.710
 available then you know that's right 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
 and what else I have noticed 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.289
 I do not know if that's true of you too 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.030
 ever noticed which is me 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.350
 Interested more there you can mine 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.829
 giving feedback would really bother me 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.449
 looking forward 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.359
 I have now tried on 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.879
 three times already and like bio banana 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.540
 and conventional banner on each other 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.560
 compared and when bio bananas 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.390
 I bring it to the point I have 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.400
 still no fruit thrown away in the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.010
 For the last two years approximately 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.150
 now that I'm really busy in it 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.470
 boxes and so on and at the biohof 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.479
 seems to be like that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.130
 a natural, so to speak 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.350
 Natural protection have this 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.930
 conventional bananas if the outside 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.490
 dots will turn black then 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.040
 inwardly away then those are inside 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.329
 scrap quite often taken at the bio 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.909
 do not do this so that you have all 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.280
 very rarely that the inside then one 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.840
 Macke on good German and I think so 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.680
 a blatant thing would be personal to me 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.590
 also to give thought 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.970
 So if the fruit could grab it so 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.729
 if now we could say to bio 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.360
 then grab it and do it anyway 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.869
 but the topic should be because, as it were, me 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.230
 some, so to speak, as carbohydrates 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.750
 fanatics so to speak 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.590
 designation that I have a kind of phobia 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.180
 and so on I just put it very much 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.310
 worth three times that I say very much 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.440
 low in fat and low in fat calories so 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.850
 under ten or fifteen if necessary 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.410
 you work hard yours was that 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.040
 But movement makes for the normal 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.480
 I would say ten percent less 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.210
 but that does not mean that me or 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.400
 we have a phobia too 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.500
 Regularly a fat one good fat 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.950
 But you have to think about it 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.580
 example users fall a very 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.110
 limited period in the fall 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.730
 So only a short time to 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.520
 maybe something from winter bacon 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.440
 apart from that, ours are ours 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.900
 ancestors pulled up here in the cold 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.880
 climate that was also a fucking action 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.210
 in good German said 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.300
 but these refined oils are similar 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.410
 coconut oil or olive oil in bottles 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.300
 is so refined 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.190
 concentrated form there that exists 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.540
 it will not give the nature in the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.370
 nature, you still have those 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.770
 fiber in the water 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.700
 a lot of other stuff i do 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.110
 I wanted to show you what I am 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.790
 regularly, for example, next to 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.770
 avocados and also I have to me 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.450
 the way before then because these are 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.520
 so I save myself leven times now 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:15.430
 packaging will be exactly again 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.100
 really dream olives are mature and 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.920
 You do not like it 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.300
 raw food quality that's a hammer that 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.550
 is really the only thing I like 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.860
 Would you like it if you have it 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.780
 would give these olives to a glass and 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.880
 not welded in a vacuum 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.590
 pack 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.150
 but that is really a dream of it 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.239
 It is regularly used almost every day 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.209
 almost every day not always but almost and 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.450
 then so five six seven eight- piece and 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.000
 I tried it again recently 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.350
 more than ten pieces or actually was 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.750
 but even the limit is the last 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.709
 Two I tortured myself more than 819 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.790
 You can only eat pieces at the piece 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.230
 natural barrier you already have it 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.430
 full while the first still fantastic 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.220
 tastes you know I do not need 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.120
 further explain the point is 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.970
 fits how many olives 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.440
 Press is the extract would have to in 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.180
 the social pressure pressure pressure do 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.830
 and about the salad, so to speak, the oil 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.739
 tips or the fat in a pan or 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.609
 cost your fat in any euro 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.229
 Something very close to dozens 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.900
 if not even in the three digits 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.040
 this is crazy and then think 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.620
 the people yes I like our shop 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.240
 and salad whole calculator from 70 percent 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.440
 Fat calories and wonder why they are 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.500
 get fat or something 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.320
 That's the problem because of that 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.660
 I always recommend spring sources, so to speak 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.650
 from very small water are in here 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.419
 fiber in it 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.810
 they taste very different than when you 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.550
 somehow a refined oil from that 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.889
 is really a difference like day and 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.389
 night to eat this stuff and then 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.830
 comes to the natural lock then 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.260
 you do not need to worry about it 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.850
 make all these artificial things there 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.990
 are partially working the 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.240
 receptors no longer the 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.289
 taste buds bloggers stopper 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.090
 so to speak, and is easy to crap 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.310
 Example , even if you meat your coconut 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.139
 is because you is not much first time 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.810
 of a cocoon young coconut 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.830
 meat so hate enough so so 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.570
 will you no longer all too much fat 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.130
 this is only a small recommendation 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.389
 olives from liter and wanted to 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.060
 I cling again that we too 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.650
 eat fat and also regularly good 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.960
 fat but just not the piece 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.720
 are any artificial things 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.800
 So any clever things 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.210
 and there is nothing left in it 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.580
 fiber no water no 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.190
 carbohydrates nothing more 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.060
 and that's just the point so natural 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.000
 eat as possible 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.520
 and that really makes the difference 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.840
 and then the pounds pult 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.370
 then the power goes up yours 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.900
 blood values would be better you have 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.639
 no problem with diabetes or with 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.590
 digestion because you do not fat so much 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.780
 eat in a natural form can be it 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.310
 because you eat but I have to know that 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.860
 So far, the raw food faction has made the 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.580
 biggest faction 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.260
 otherwise he can not actually 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.090
 happen because of course we're perez 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.160
 So who is trying more than ten olives? 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.990
 of these things at the piece creates 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.820
 is really good the really good me 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.680
 did not make it and it is for me 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.430
 that's just a sign that just like that 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.130
 accept 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.560
 The natural principle is the right way 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:20.080
 Thanks again for seeing and 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.080
 Write below until next time
