00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.670 
enough new content it didn't really
improve<00:00:30.900> anything<00:00:32.120> so<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:34.050> didn't<00:00:34.469> fit

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
improve anything so it just didn't fit

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.229

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the price tag at the time so I'm like

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.959 
the price tag at the time so I'm like
okay<00:00:37.110> whatever<00:00:37.380> I'll<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> judge<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.879> that

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
okay whatever I'll be the judge of that

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.930 
okay whatever I'll be the judge of that
myself<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.590> I<00:00:40.590> actually<00:00:40.739> got<00:00:41.100> empires<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
myself and I actually got empires in the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.030 
myself and I actually got empires in the
gold<00:00:42.149> edition<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.620> wasn't<00:00:43.980> that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
gold edition so it really wasn't that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.560 
gold edition so it really wasn't that
big<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.489> deal<00:00:45.050> but<00:00:46.050> anyway<00:00:46.879> they<00:00:47.879> did<00:00:48.120> add<00:00:48.329> in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
big of a deal but anyway they did add in

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.510 
big of a deal but anyway they did add in
new<00:00:48.780> content<00:00:49.379> they<00:00:49.559> did<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:49.950> change<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
new content they did not change the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.400 
new content they did not change the
visuals<00:00:50.940> at<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.719> looks<00:00:51.870> exactly<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
visuals at all so it looks exactly the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.290 
visuals at all so it looks exactly the
same<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.860> sounds<00:00:53.579> exactly<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.000> same<00:00:54.180> true

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
same it sounds exactly the same true

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.250 
same it sounds exactly the same true
they<00:00:54.390> didn't<00:00:54.629> change<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> sound<00:00:55.050> design

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
they didn't change the sound design

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
they didn't change the sound design
either<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.489> don't<00:00:56.760> need<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> talk<00:00:57.210> about

like<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.350> stuff<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.530> cool<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.340> general

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
like that stuff it's cool but in general

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.389 
like that stuff it's cool but in general
it's<00:01:41.850> only<00:01:42.090> available<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.750> certain<00:01:43.079> epochs<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it's only available in certain epochs so

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.880 
it's only available in certain epochs so
when<00:01:45.060> you're<00:01:45.270> actually<00:01:45.689> playing<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.619> game

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
when you're actually playing this game

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800 
when you're actually playing this game
and<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.520> come<00:01:47.729> across<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.030> sieve<00:01:48.420> power<00:01:48.659> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and you come across a sieve power it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.510 
and you come across a sieve power it
generally<00:01:49.470> doesn't<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.130> big<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.460> an

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
generally doesn't have that big of an

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
generally doesn't have that big of an
effect<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.799> kind<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.630> weird<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.899> have

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
effect so it's kind of weird to have

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.719 
effect so it's kind of weird to have
this<00:01:55.200> new<00:01:55.409> feature<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.009> would<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.399> kind<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
this new feature that would be kind of

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.320 
this new feature that would be kind of
cool<00:01:56.840> but<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.170> doesn't

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
cool but it really doesn't

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.300 
cool but it really doesn't
the<00:01:59.570> game<00:01:59.780> all<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.170> much<00:02:00.380> kind<00:02:01.280> of

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
the game all that much kind of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.420 
the game all that much kind of
depressing<00:02:01.550> but<00:02:01.850> oh<00:02:01.910> well<00:02:03.010> um<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.280> new

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
depressing but oh well um the new

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.960 
depressing but oh well um the new
content<00:02:04.910> they<00:02:05.000> added<00:02:05.390> was<00:02:06.070> kind<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.280> odd<00:02:07.520> too

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
content they added was kind of odd too

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.969 
content they added was kind of odd too
they<00:02:08.210> added<00:02:08.570> in<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.660> Space<00:02:09.170> Age<00:02:09.470> which<00:02:09.770> was

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
they added in the Space Age which was

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.300 
they added in the Space Age which was
the<00:02:10.160> 15th<00:02:10.670> epic<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.930> as<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.290> result<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.980> have

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the 15th epic and as a result you have

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.380 
the 15th epic and as a result you have
this<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:14.120> already<00:02:14.920> extremely<00:02:15.920> slow<00:02:16.880> game

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
this this already extremely slow game

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.360 
this this already extremely slow game
that<00:02:18.230> was<00:02:18.320> my<00:02:18.440> major<00:02:18.710> complaint<00:02:19.010> with<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
that was my major complaint with the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.640 
that was my major complaint with the
original<00:02:19.580> empire<00:02:20.150> earth<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.570> did<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.470> this

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
original empire earth it did have this

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.920 
original empire earth it did have this
problem<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.550> micromanagement<00:02:23.210> took<00:02:23.510> way

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
problem of the micromanagement took way

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.180 
problem of the micromanagement took way
too<00:02:23.960> long<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.860> process<00:02:26.950> resource<00:02:27.950> gathering

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
too long the process resource gathering

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.700 
too long the process resource gathering
took<00:02:28.640> way<00:02:29.060> too<00:02:29.090> long<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.260> couldn't<00:02:30.530> really

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
took way too long so you couldn't really

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.630 
took way too long so you couldn't really
get<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.220> anything<00:02:31.540> worthwhile<00:02:32.590> until<00:02:33.640> you

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
get to anything worthwhile until you

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.550 
get to anything worthwhile until you
basically<00:02:35.120> SAT<00:02:35.480> through<00:02:35.690> micromanaging<00:02:36.410> for

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
basically SAT through micromanaging for

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.410 
basically SAT through micromanaging for
an<00:02:36.620> hour<00:02:36.740> or<00:02:36.980> two<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.910> even<00:02:38.270> then<00:02:38.390> you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
an hour or two and even then you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.300 
an hour or two and even then you
probably<00:02:38.690> only<00:02:38.900> be<00:02:39.020> in<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.560> don't<00:02:39.950> know<00:02:40.070> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
probably only be in I don't know the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.030 
probably only be in I don't know the
Bronze<00:02:40.910> Age<00:02:41.209> maybe<00:02:41.800> if<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:42.950> were<00:02:43.040> lucky<00:02:45.040> so

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
Bronze Age maybe if you were lucky so

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.130 
Bronze Age maybe if you were lucky so
whereas<00:02:46.550> in<00:02:46.700> age<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.090> empires<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.750> can<00:02:47.900> get<00:02:48.110> up

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
whereas in age of empires you can get up

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.050 
whereas in age of empires you can get up
to<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.980> final<00:02:49.730> age<00:02:49.970> within<00:02:51.130> 20-30<00:02:52.130> minutes<00:02:52.610> no

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
to the final age within 20-30 minutes no

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.710 
to the final age within 20-30 minutes no
problem<00:02:54.070> so<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.550> was<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.730> major<00:02:56.060> problem<00:02:56.630> I

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
problem so that was a major problem I

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.570 
problem so that was a major problem I
had<00:02:56.900> with<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.230> original<00:02:57.560> game<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:58.040> pacing

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
had with the original game the pacing

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.150 
had with the original game the pacing
was<00:02:58.700> way<00:02:59.150> too<00:02:59.209> slow<00:02:59.810> and<00:02:59.990> they<00:03:00.410> did<00:03:00.650> not<00:03:00.860> fix

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
was way too slow and they did not fix

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.040 
was way too slow and they did not fix
this<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:02.150> art<00:03:02.300> of<00:03:02.390> conquest<00:03:02.900> they

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
this in the art of conquest they

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.350 
this in the art of conquest they
actually<00:03:03.560> made<00:03:03.709> it<00:03:03.830> worse<00:03:04.190> by<00:03:04.970> adding<00:03:05.330> that

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
actually made it worse by adding that

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.650 
actually made it worse by adding that
15th<00:03:05.930> epic<00:03:06.320> now<00:03:06.950> granted<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.940> Space<00:03:08.209> Age<00:03:08.450> is

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
15th epic now granted the Space Age is

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.630 
15th epic now granted the Space Age is
kind<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.200> cool<00:03:09.320> everything's<00:03:09.890> basically<00:03:10.430> a

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
kind of cool everything's basically a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.310 
kind of cool everything's basically a
robot<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:12.459> does<00:03:13.459> everything<00:03:13.959> lasers<00:03:14.959> and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
robot that does everything lasers and

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.470 
robot that does everything lasers and
plasma<00:03:16.100> beams<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.550> stuff<00:03:16.760> or<00:03:16.880> just<00:03:16.910> blasting

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
plasma beams and stuff or just blasting

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.290 
plasma beams and stuff or just blasting
everything<00:03:17.570> it's<00:03:18.200> pretty<00:03:18.470> cool<00:03:19.060> but<00:03:20.060> at<00:03:20.180> the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
everything it's pretty cool but at the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.660 
everything it's pretty cool but at the
same<00:03:20.510> time<00:03:20.720> it's<00:03:21.050> really<00:03:21.380> not<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:21.830> big<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.430> a

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
same time it's really not that big of a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.470 
same time it's really not that big of a
deal<00:03:24.459> everything<00:03:25.459> basically<00:03:25.760> looks<00:03:26.150> like<00:03:26.239> it

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
deal everything basically looks like it

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.350 
deal everything basically looks like it
was<00:03:26.630> in<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.900> Nano<00:03:27.080> age<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:28.130> it's<00:03:28.640> they<00:03:29.120> really

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
was in the Nano age so it's they really

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.610 
was in the Nano age so it's they really
didn't<00:03:29.600> change<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.900> lot<00:03:29.989> they<00:03:30.110> just<00:03:30.260> added<00:03:30.410> a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
didn't change a lot they just added a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.800 
didn't change a lot they just added a
few<00:03:30.860> new<00:03:30.920> things<00:03:31.070> here<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:31.970> there<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.690> it

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
few new things here and there and it

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.300 
few new things here and there and it
really<00:03:32.989> wasn't<00:03:33.140> that<00:03:33.350> impressive<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.190> be

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
really wasn't that impressive to be

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.479 
really wasn't that impressive to be
honest<00:03:34.610> with<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.860> was<00:03:37.010> kind<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.250> cool<00:03:37.430> to

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
honest with you it was kind of cool to

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.729 
honest with you it was kind of cool to
have<00:03:37.820> this<00:03:38.060> new<00:03:38.239> stuff<00:03:38.540> but<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.230> more<00:03:39.380> I<00:03:39.410> play

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
have this new stuff but the more I play

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.740 
have this new stuff but the more I play
with<00:03:39.890> it<00:03:40.040> I'm<00:03:40.130> like<00:03:40.280> this<00:03:41.209> was<00:03:41.450> kind<00:03:41.630> of

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
with it I'm like this was kind of

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.780 
with it I'm like this was kind of
unnecessary<00:03:42.050> it<00:03:42.860> didn't<00:03:43.130> really<00:03:43.220> feel<00:03:43.550> right

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
unnecessary it didn't really feel right

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.670 
unnecessary it didn't really feel right
and<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.690> campaigns<00:03:45.140> were<00:03:45.350> kind<00:03:45.590> of

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
and the campaigns were kind of

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.350 
and the campaigns were kind of
lackluster<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:46.130> mean<00:03:46.280> they<00:03:46.340> weren't<00:03:46.489> bad<00:03:46.940> but

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
lackluster I mean they weren't bad but

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.090 
lackluster I mean they weren't bad but
they<00:03:47.810> were<00:03:47.870> just<00:03:47.959> kind<00:03:48.350> of<00:03:48.440> average<00:03:48.680> and

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
they were just kind of average and

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.500 
they were just kind of average and
there's<00:03:49.220> really<00:03:49.340> nothing<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.790> say<00:03:50.090> much<00:03:50.360> about

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
there's really nothing to say much about

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.570 
there's really nothing to say much about
them<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.959> new<00:03:54.110> content<00:03:54.860> really<00:03:55.250> didn't

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
them but the new content really didn't
