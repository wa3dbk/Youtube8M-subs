00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.549 
Aqua power you'll see two door springs
and<00:00:43.250> they<00:00:43.339> serve<00:00:43.640> two<00:00:43.850> functions<00:00:44.390> one<00:00:44.659> is<00:00:44.930> the

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
and they serve two functions one is the

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.229 
and they serve two functions one is the
to<00:00:46.100> close<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.430> door<00:00:46.610> when<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.879> pump<00:00:47.089> turns

to close the door when the pump turns

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.990 
to close the door when the pump turns
off<00:00:47.650> another<00:00:48.650> function<00:00:49.100> is<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:49.519> keep<00:00:49.729> it<00:00:49.879> from

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
off another function is to keep it from

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.850 
off another function is to keep it from
opening<00:00:50.180> more<00:00:50.869> than<00:00:51.019> one-and-a-half<00:00:51.290> inches

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
opening more than one-and-a-half inches

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.469 
opening more than one-and-a-half inches
and<00:00:52.040> that's<00:00:52.100> what<00:00:52.309> creates<00:00:52.729> all<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.030> suction

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:53.479 
and that's what creates all the suction

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:55.450 
and that's what creates all the suction
is<00:00:53.659> that<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.440> doors<00:00:54.619> don't<00:00:54.769> open<00:00:54.949> all<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.339> way

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
is that the doors don't open all the way

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.649 
is that the doors don't open all the way
they<00:00:55.610> open<00:00:55.850> only<00:00:55.909> about<00:00:56.180> one<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:56.479> a<00:00:56.510> half

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
they open only about one and a half

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.950 
they open only about one and a half
inches<00:00:56.989> up<00:00:57.879> brings<00:00:58.879> also<00:00:59.180> create<00:00:59.449> tension<00:00:59.869> to

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
inches up brings also create tension to

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.590 
inches up brings also create tension to
keep<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.260> doors<00:01:01.210> functioning<00:01:02.210> no<00:01:02.420> matter

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
it and that keeps the aqua power level

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.540 
it and that keeps the aqua power level
in<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.290> pool<00:01:09.500> why<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.770> pool<00:01:10.010> is<00:01:10.100> being<00:01:10.130> used

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
in the pool why the pool is being used

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.940 
in the pool why the pool is being used
and<00:01:11.030> there's<00:01:11.660> ways<00:01:11.810> graded<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.620> the<00:01:12.740> pool

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
and there's ways graded in the pool

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.180 
and there's ways graded in the pool
it'll<00:01:13.820> keep<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.090> aqua<00:01:14.300> power<00:01:14.480> from<00:01:14.810> moving

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
it'll keep the aqua power from moving

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.440 
it'll keep the aqua power from moving
and<00:01:16.190> you<00:01:16.280> notice<00:01:16.550> these<00:01:16.730> bumps<00:01:17.120> up<00:01:17.240> here

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
and you notice these bumps up here

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.030 
and you notice these bumps up here
they're<00:01:17.630> called<00:01:17.810> dowels<00:01:18.050> and<00:01:18.440> they<00:01:18.500> keep<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
they're called dowels and they keep the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.520 
they're called dowels and they keep the
aqua<00:01:19.430> power<00:01:19.640> from<00:01:20.570> rotating<00:01:21.140> in<00:01:21.230> the<00:01:21.290> skimmer

aqua power from rotating in the skimmer

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.550 
aqua power from rotating in the skimmer
also<00:01:22.010> give<00:01:22.550> it<00:01:22.640> more<00:01:22.760> balance<00:01:23.180> in<00:01:23.360> there<00:01:23.570> so

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
also give it more balance in there so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.840 
also give it more balance in there so
that's<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.800> quick<00:01:24.950> look<00:01:25.160> of<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.400> parts<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.760> the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.969 
you can actually disconcert the Aqua
power<00:01:53.799> comes<00:01:54.549> from<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.970> box<00:01:55.179> with<00:01:55.420> these

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
power comes from in the box with these

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.710 
power comes from in the box with these
inserts<00:01:56.979> already<00:01:57.280> in<00:01:57.490> there<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:58.299> just<00:01:58.420> slide

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
inserts already in there you just slide

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.459 
inserts already in there you just slide
it<00:01:58.869> in<00:02:00.149> slide<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.299> on<00:02:01.420> one<00:02:01.539> side<00:02:01.719> and<00:02:01.899> is<00:02:02.020> simply

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
it in slide it on one side and is simply

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.190 
it in slide it on one side and is simply
compress<00:02:02.799> to<00:02:03.130> spring<00:02:03.520> then<00:02:04.479> let<00:02:04.659> it<00:02:04.689> go<00:02:04.899> in<00:02:05.049> and

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
compress to spring then let it go in and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.529 
compress to spring then let it go in and
no<00:02:05.380> right<00:02:06.369> into<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.670> holes<00:02:06.880> there<00:02:07.149> like<00:02:07.329> that

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
no right into the holes there like that

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.410 
no right into the holes there like that
so<00:02:07.780> that's<00:02:07.960> one<00:02:08.110> way<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.289> install<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.420> Aqua

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
so that's one way to install the Aqua

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.600 
so that's one way to install the Aqua
power<00:02:10.599> if<00:02:11.530> your<00:02:11.769> skimmer<00:02:12.040> doesn't<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.370> holes

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
power if your skimmer doesn't have holes

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.150 
power if your skimmer doesn't have holes
you<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.480> take<00:02:13.840> those<00:02:14.019> pins<00:02:14.349> out<00:02:14.590> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
you have to take those pins out and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.500 
you have to take those pins out and
you'll<00:02:15.340> insert<00:02:15.640> these<00:02:15.819> rubber<00:02:16.030> plugs<00:02:16.420> that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
you'll insert these rubber plugs that

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.780 
you'll insert these rubber plugs that
come<00:02:16.720> with<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.959> Aqua<00:02:17.230> power<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.519> just<00:02:18.670> you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
come with the Aqua power so you just you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.100 
come with the Aqua power so you just you
need<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.000> get<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> pair<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.420> pliers<00:02:19.630> or<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:20.049> wrench

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
need to get a pair of pliers or a wrench

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.510 
need to get a pair of pliers or a wrench
and<00:02:20.739> they<00:02:21.160> pull<00:02:21.400> right<00:02:21.549> out

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.110 

and<00:02:27.520> you'll<00:02:27.640> stick<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:27.970> plugs<00:02:28.240> in<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.970> take

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
and you'll stick the plugs in just take

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.550 
and you'll stick the plugs in just take
the<00:02:31.240> rubber<00:02:31.450> plugs<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.080> we'll<00:02:32.170> stick<00:02:32.470> them

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
the rubber plugs and we'll stick them

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.390 
the rubber plugs and we'll stick them
right<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.740> see<00:02:35.920> them<00:02:36.010> on<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.190> other<00:02:36.280> side

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
right in and see them on the other side

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.200 
right in and see them on the other side
here<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:41.950> your<00:02:42.100> skimmer<00:02:42.370> without<00:02:43.060> the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
here this is your skimmer without the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.570 
here this is your skimmer without the
hole<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.660> would<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:43.960> slide<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:45.130> aqua<00:02:45.400> power

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
hole you would just slide the aqua power

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.840 
hole you would just slide the aqua power
in<00:02:45.930> we<00:02:46.930> would<00:02:47.140> compress<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.190> let<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.640> go

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
in we would compress it and let it go

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.090 
in we would compress it and let it go
you<00:02:49.780> want<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:49.930> make<00:02:50.080> sure<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.530> it's<00:02:50.740> just<00:02:50.950> at

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
you want to make sure that it's just at

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.390 
you want to make sure that it's just at
the<00:02:51.220> very<00:02:51.520> bottom<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:52.120> your<00:02:52.270> skimmer<00:02:52.540> also

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the very bottom of your skimmer also

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.470 
the very bottom of your skimmer also
make<00:02:54.400> sure<00:02:54.430> it's<00:02:54.670> flush<00:02:54.850> with<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.150> bottom<00:02:55.300> of

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
make sure it's flush with the bottom of

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.330 
make sure it's flush with the bottom of
the<00:02:55.600> skimmer<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.710> have<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.010> foot<00:02:57.190> right

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
the skimmer you have the foot right

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.430 
the skimmer you have the foot right
there<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.300> those<00:02:58.450> are<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.660> two<00:02:58.780> methods<00:02:58.960> to

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
there so those are the two methods to

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.140 
there so those are the two methods to
install<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.130> Aqua<00:03:00.460> power<00:03:00.640> pretty<00:03:01.240> simple

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.860 

of<00:03:05.780> course<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.080> is<00:03:06.230> their

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
of course this is their

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
of course this is their
this<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.799> back<00:03:07.950> end<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.340> aqua<00:03:08.580> power

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
this is the back end of the aqua power

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.809 
this is the back end of the aqua power
so<00:03:09.000> I'm<00:03:09.060> going<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.420> put<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:09.930> direction

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
so I'm going to put it in this direction

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.190 
so I'm going to put it in this direction
yes<00:03:11.819> at<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.060> Aqua<00:03:12.299> power<00:03:12.480> right<00:03:12.750> that's<00:03:12.989> where

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
yes at the Aqua power right that's where

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.490 
yes at the Aqua power right that's where
the<00:03:13.379> white<00:03:13.620> ends<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.459> skimmer<00:03:15.409> it's<00:03:16.409> a

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
the white ends on the skimmer it's a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.339 
the white ends on the skimmer it's a
better<00:03:16.650> look<00:03:16.890> at<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.129> from<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> other<00:03:17.489> side

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
better look at it from the other side

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.080 
better look at it from the other side
let's<00:03:19.349> sit<00:03:19.500> right<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.860> there<00:03:20.069> okay<00:03:20.879> when<00:03:21.030> you

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
let's sit right in there okay when you

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.399 
let's sit right in there okay when you
install<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.569> Aqua<00:03:21.810> power<00:03:21.989> we<00:03:22.080> want<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.290> make

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
install the Aqua power we want to make

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.050 
install the Aqua power we want to make
sure<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.769> it's<00:03:22.950> all<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.099> way<00:03:23.250> flush<00:03:23.579> against

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
sure that it's all the way flush against

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.640 
sure that it's all the way flush against
the<00:03:24.090> ground<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:24.720> I'm<00:03:25.170> gonna<00:03:25.290> make<00:03:25.470> sure<00:03:25.500> that

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
the ground so I'm gonna make sure that

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.110 
the ground so I'm gonna make sure that
it's<00:03:25.950> not<00:03:26.069> sticking<00:03:26.310> up<00:03:26.519> at<00:03:26.700> all<00:03:26.819> there's<00:03:27.030> no

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
it's not sticking up at all there's no

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.420 
it's not sticking up at all there's no
gap<00:03:27.360> between<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:28.470> floor<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.890> skimmer<00:03:29.159> and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
gap between the floor of the skimmer and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.050 
gap between the floor of the skimmer and
the<00:03:29.519> Aqua<00:03:29.819> power<00:03:30.000> unit<00:03:30.450> itself<00:03:30.799> ticular

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
the Aqua power unit itself ticular

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.670 
the Aqua power unit itself ticular
skimmer<00:03:33.060> had<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.420> gate<00:03:33.690> built<00:03:34.049> into<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.470> front

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
skimmer had a gate built into the front

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.140 
skimmer had a gate built into the front
gate<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:34.950> see<00:03:35.159> it's<00:03:35.280> all<00:03:35.370> cracked<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.940> broken

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
gate I see it's all cracked and broken

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.180 
gate I see it's all cracked and broken
so<00:03:36.900> I'll<00:03:37.019> put<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.260> alcohol<00:03:37.379> right<00:03:37.860> behind

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
so I'll put the alcohol right behind

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.479 
so I'll put the alcohol right behind
that<00:03:38.450> now<00:03:39.450> go<00:03:39.569> ahead<00:03:39.629> and<00:03:39.780> use<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:41.310> I'll<00:03:41.400> go

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
that now go ahead and use and I'll go

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.920 
that now go ahead and use and I'll go
ahead<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.730> use<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.970> plugs<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.510> this<00:03:42.720> one

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
ahead and use the plugs and this one

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.170 
ahead and use the plugs and this one
since<00:03:43.290> doesn't<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.769> holes<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:45.090> I'm

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
since doesn't have the holes and so I'm

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.580 
since doesn't have the holes and so I'm
going<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.359> slide<00:03:45.569> it<00:03:45.690> into<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.959> skimmer<00:03:46.290> here

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
going to slide it into the skimmer here

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.190 
going to slide it into the skimmer here
on<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.769> end<00:03:47.060> push<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.180> forward<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:49.019> that's

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
on this end push it forward and that's

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.750 
on this end push it forward and that's
about<00:03:49.379> as<00:03:49.560> far<00:03:49.739> forward<00:03:50.010> as<00:03:50.190> it'll<00:03:50.459> go<00:03:50.489> in<00:03:50.730> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
about as far forward as it'll go in the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.330 
about as far forward as it'll go in the
skimmer<00:03:51.120> since<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.659> has<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.049> built<00:03:52.859> in<00:03:53.010> front

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
skimmer since it has that built in front

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.110 
skimmer since it has that built in front
gate<00:03:53.519> that's<00:03:53.730> broken<00:03:54.120> off<00:03:55.849> make<00:03:56.849> sure<00:03:57.000> it's

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
gate that's broken off make sure it's

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.809 
gate that's broken off make sure it's
flush<00:03:57.299> all<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.569> way<00:03:57.659> to<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.870> bottom

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
flush all the way to the bottom

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.520 
flush all the way to the bottom
if<00:03:59.819> this<00:04:00.060> skimmer<00:04:00.359> doesn't<00:04:00.599> have<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.109> hole<00:04:01.290> so

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
if this skimmer doesn't have the hole so

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.770 
if this skimmer doesn't have the hole so
I<00:04:01.560> put<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.829> tabs<00:04:02.069> on<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:02.459> one<00:04:02.640> also<00:04:02.790> and

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
I put the tabs on this one also and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.270 
I put the tabs on this one also and
again<00:04:03.870> for<00:04:04.260> correct<00:04:04.470> installation<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:05.099> want

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
again for correct installation you want

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.830 
again for correct installation you want
to<00:04:05.370> put<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.579> as<00:04:05.670> far<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.209> put<00:04:06.390> them<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.599> skimmer

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
to put it as far and put them a skimmer

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.330 
to put it as far and put them a skimmer
as<00:04:06.959> possible<00:04:07.409> you<00:04:07.500> want<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.709> flush<00:04:07.950> on<00:04:08.250> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
as possible you want it flush on the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.210 
as possible you want it flush on the
ground<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.540> skimmer<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.889> should<00:04:11.069> look

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
ground to the skimmer it should look

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.770 
ground to the skimmer it should look
something<00:04:11.430> like<00:04:11.549> that

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.569 

so<00:04:19.380> when<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.560> install<00:04:19.860> the<00:04:19.980> aqua<00:04:20.220> power<00:04:20.430> and

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
so when you install the aqua power and

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.750 
so when you install the aqua power and
water<00:04:20.700> levels<00:04:21.090> also

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
water levels also

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.730 
water levels also
factor<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.870> don't<00:04:23.020> want<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.200> water<00:04:23.320> too<00:04:23.560> high

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
factor you don't want the water too high

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.830 
factor you don't want the water too high
otherwise<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:24.400> occupier<00:04:25.090> won't<00:04:25.330> work<00:04:25.540> you

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
otherwise the occupier won't work you

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.210 
otherwise the occupier won't work you
can<00:04:26.020> see<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.200> water<00:04:26.380> level<00:04:26.470> right<00:04:26.830> there<00:04:26.920> is

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
can see the water level right there is

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.760 
can see the water level right there is
about<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.880> little<00:04:28.420> less<00:04:28.540> than<00:04:28.690> halfway<00:04:28.900> up<00:04:29.140> the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
about a little less than halfway up the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.679 
about a little less than halfway up the
front<00:04:30.430> doors<00:04:30.700> or<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.030> aqua<00:04:31.330> power

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:36.689 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.079 

to<00:04:37.349> the<00:04:37.469> aqua<00:04:37.709> power<00:04:37.860> fit<00:04:38.189> most<00:04:38.369> skimmers<00:04:38.819> this

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:39.089 
to the aqua power fit most skimmers this

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:41.509 
to the aqua power fit most skimmers this
one<00:04:39.269> here<00:04:39.479> will<00:04:39.779> fit<00:04:40.110> for<00:04:40.289> sure<00:04:40.499> this<00:04:41.249> is<00:04:41.399> one

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:41.519 
one here will fit for sure this is one

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:43.449 
one here will fit for sure this is one
of<00:04:41.549> the<00:04:41.699> first<00:04:41.909> skimmers<00:04:42.869> that<00:04:43.049> was

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:43.459 
of the first skimmers that was

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:46.339 
of the first skimmers that was
manufactured<00:04:44.459> back<00:04:44.909> in<00:04:45.059> the<00:04:45.149> day<00:04:45.329> so<00:04:45.599> that

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
manufactured back in the day so that

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.089 
manufactured back in the day so that
they<00:04:46.529> won't<00:04:46.709> fit<00:04:47.039> a<00:04:47.069> weird<00:04:47.309> gate<00:04:47.519> of<00:04:47.699> any<00:04:47.819> type
