00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello halloi my dear friends 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.710
 Today there is again in a small 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.780
 minecraft video and I want you 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.509
 Show this, yes it seems 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.400
 already seen that was this big 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.859
 project what in this teaser the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.640
 I had announced 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.350
 probably my vote is one 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.500
 little is it different from that already 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.630
 a little bit of a cold I wanted 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.560
 Just here this monumental 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.119
 show how fierce big is 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.579
 just is and what is with everything 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.590
 have built so well I have the thing 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.360
 completely on planing out of combinations 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.540
 built up to the roof but that show 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.120
 I'll give you something else later 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.219
 have our little sprinkler system say 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.190
 I have our irrigation system the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.020
 your source of water from the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.700
 I refer to source here above 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.690
 Everything made this little hole extra 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.010
 is the lead and somehow 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.780
 something I know I have no idea 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.960
 in the plumber area is called the flows 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.239
 Keep that glass basin here 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.710
 and where that flows, we see that 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.220
 But right now I want you 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 the roof shows the thing here 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.430
 glass with you why this weird 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.770
 stones are on the roof 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.170
 we will see that when we are in the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.720
 pyramid in there are and yes the pyramid 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.140
 is not square but I think it's all right 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 cool 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 yes come in and find out a ha yes i found 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 it's kinda funny i just have to do it 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.540
 by douglas clown and yes we are now 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.400
 right here inside the pyramid 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.590
 that's why we see big 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.540
 still the glass ceiling with the whole 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 stone top on top so beautiful yes 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 at aunt the best to show and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.009
 I had a short trailer here 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.509
 sorry from old button pressed so this 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.180
 just monstrous does not have any 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.130
 I'm not sure what exactly everything will build 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.590
 and yes now we see why these stones 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.329
 on the roof are good and form 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.689
 she needs a beautiful caro on the 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.060
 ground 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.149
 the idea was of kate 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.240
 a bit stolen sorry decay has 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.500
 even with your will has looked down yes 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.069
 and yes floor we go down again 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.079
 and 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.209
 me yesterday some time soon 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.849
 to build the thing and make these routes freely 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.269
 do it here and it's just one of 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.579
 a partner and because and yes I like 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.920
 the stone-hellstone runs thin 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.590
 in German from monastery and I have 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.930
 here for expression 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.700
 and yes, here is another shield crafting and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.219
 I think that's just right 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.980
 awesome as it has become hammergeil 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.510
 stephans look at this with you 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.719
 a ship comes the water forth from 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.230
 not determined above 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:50.129
 it must be unhindered in the young 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.319
 green really okay that our 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.430
 Fountain and do not ask me how it is 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.180
 did not manage that water 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.859
 overflows 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.019
 It is a miracle of the physics of nature 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.250
 I do not know what, I think it's very short 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.530
 looks really cool and that 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.599
 Rhineland so we have next 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.909
 we have the hearth again 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.639
 Either I'm just full 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.930
 to the decoration or to the show throw away something 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.979
 now at what will demonstrate how 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.879
 that works if you give us one 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:22.409
 stone go there and press 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.269
 throw the stone away and say that 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.750
 but burns the actual plant for 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.949
 that's what we have here 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.810
 Disposal caution fictitious only 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:34.409
 Carefully use burns 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.879
 third degree are the consequences of two 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.189
 use yes I have that's right 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.689
 read out full errors in it 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.930
 and that's just a big one 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:45.090
 basin with but that knows you are now 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.340
 maybe we have our crafting 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.879
 area with a group with a big one 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.889
 tor and of course an oven in which we 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.790
 do all our stuff and show 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.189
 store 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.540
 and yes that what is now on the force ago 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:02.969
 I will build up a bit more 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.680
 But for now I think so because 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.530
 room really cool and the whole pyramid 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.509
 has just become brilliant and how 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.419
 I still need a few ideas 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:13.949
 what's to be built next 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.539
 everything was subterranean 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:18.590
 underground works and also one 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:20.820
 a little something inside has to admit yes 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.360
 how big is the thing I have none 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.600
 I know it is 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.910
 32 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.600
 so far so far as I know it yesterday 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.350
 still counted and at least once 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.500
 the double or maybe 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:42.060
 threefold of the width is long 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:45.060
 but well that's it in principle already 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.660
 again with this video again from above 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.770
 on it because that just did dpa 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.690
 back there we will probably 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.370
 a bit more to build the pyramid 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.970
 was not the last thing to come 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.360
 believe me 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.500
 and as I said, I either need it 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.280
 a few ideas that I can think of 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.120
 let me or you give it to me and 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.890
 Finally, a little something yourself 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.120
 I'm going to come by Bus and Train 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:11.900
 talk about it a little bit more and 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.280
 what we have left everything I show you 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.990
 Damn the dirt I'll show you this 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.250
 Do it again from above and all yourself 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.160
 wonder what I'm here right now 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.930
 tool handles that is the car is 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.250
 the ultimate fist like me too 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.890
 call fist of god 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.580
 you can really destroy everything with that 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.330
 at the first try and yes that was 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.310
 the pyramid 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.510
 that was my video we are in 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.500
 next minecraft video my friends 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.500
 Until next time
