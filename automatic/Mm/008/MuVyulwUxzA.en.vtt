00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.400
 the flowering typical along with a nice shot in front of buyers 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400
 accessible the european airspace pro league 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.440
 the dutch bobsleepers has been in the ditch for a while 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.800
 it is stable and am baath party 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.810
 when pilots are brought on board ships 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.800
 also were there is now also a time of the trumps of this type of ship 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.200
 the purchase procedure will be completed shortly 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.990
 in antwerp, circus was allowed to be residents of its country 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.470
 tricks they show darling craft 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.690
 is a very special type of time 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.970
 she asks that we remain very stable because of the very special one 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.370
 construction that it has 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.130
 and the side of the pilot 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.330
 tops golf one of the approximately five meters high 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.360
 And so practically where we are now with the current system 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.130
 of headers and gig one 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.420
 we have 40 to 45 days a year 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.960
 that we are not in the classical way we can or they by the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.170
 weather conditions 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.570
 with this issue will be the 40 and 45 days 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.740
 the relapse night two three days a year 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.890
 this takes time and is now two and a half years in operation, almost three years 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.470
 can say no in the past two winters have only one to two 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.730
 days out of service because of 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.670
 obs the bad weather 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.600
 thanks to the sallandse in ten points but also a very dangerous helicopter 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.690
 Pilotage is about to become a thing of the past 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.990
 if we look at the experiences of our German colleagues 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.470
 at the elbe and now also start said okada doing the same 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.080
 with it rarely this smells of pilotage 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.900
 I can tell you that to achieve the headline piloting on the images is as good as 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.750
 nonexistent is a few moments 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.820
 another very special case where the person needs it also here 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.070
 can assume if we look at the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.220
 in the past two winters with this issue they don't have any helicopters on 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.230
 prevent pilotage from occurring at the vocal cord, this is expected to be expected 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.420
 the results are therefore not a trend 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.400
 and because the Netherlands in our country worked together for piloting our country not 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.949
 stay behind longer 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:18.439
 The official procedure that are as good as completed normally will be the destination 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.319
 for dries it was to be placed in a mothership within a few months 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.209
 everyone has to plan for this concert, both the shed and the people who attend it 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.239
 have to sail 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.249
 but we both have a huge problem with the old pilot vessels 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.419
 the tickets cost 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.930
 so we really have to do something in you 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.810
 and as important that we are in our interest is the Flemish interest and the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.090
 Flemish interest is our interest in this because we of course serve both 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.960
 scheldevaart and then no longer dodge and hamas have the flocks thick 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.539
 salaries and we our aldermen 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:51.909
 and we have an enormous interest 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.969
 costs a good way because we do it for free because of that cooperation 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.760
 we leave that to the Flemings 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.700
 at the walker 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.349
 The Flemings then let it go for both the stone marten 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.019
 the door is indeed on our side as far as possible 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:07.979
 a soft compulsion is already behind the table 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:13.169
 it is a black moped that will be fit on the flemish side in 2013 or in it 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.719
 worst case by 2013 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.719
 vab expected 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.349
 beautiful 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.069
 the antwerp port in the first months of 2008 with the iphone 4 percent 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.639
 grown 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.599
 compared to the same period last year 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.889
 and it has to be said that it is mainly the containers that have a strong start 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.689
 of the year 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:44.029
 with two million 75,000 euros or quotes from Antwerp for the fourth quarter 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:48.799
 in a row the magic border of two million teu our other Flemish ports 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.949
 generally take time with good quarterly figures 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.079
 so grows and zeebrugge with greece 2 percent 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:01.429
 container throughput climbs with a 15 come 7 percent top 500 47 thousand euros 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:05.909
 the escalator cycle path ticks 3 percent of the total treated sea bridge already 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.539
 tens of 3 million tonnes of goods 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:12.759
 with plus ten coming 8 percent, the port of Ghent is the strongest grower 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:16.989
 the maritime throughput in the first quarter weekend grew out of five 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.809
 comma 88 million tons after the six and a half million tons 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:25.059
 the supply increases with the seven kommarin percent the supply by no less than 10 24 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:26.509
 per cent 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.439
 it is striking that gent scores very well in almost all good categories 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.969
 agricultural products double but also building materials best of and 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.509
 metal products I'm 14 percent more ahead of it 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.550
 cities figures so in antwerp zeebrugge and ghent only costs 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.810
 in the first quarter because behind he uses a traffic decrease of almost 6 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.879
 per cent 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.739
 This decrease is the result of the ro-ro traffic that occurred after the acquisition of VWS 

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:56.629
 until cobelfret has not fully recovered in the middle of last year 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.960
 cobelfret was still with the five ships instead of six and therefore 

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:07.330
 fell the number of celebrities because the 86 thousand units after the 77 thousand 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.069
 pieces a decrease of 11 percent 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.889
 as a cobelfret his search for the extra ship can be successfully completed 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.740
 without that jump post and the doll can't get positive numbers 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.740
 register 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.229
 6 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.789
 6 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.609
 no
