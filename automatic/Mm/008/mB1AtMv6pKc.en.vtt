00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
 the traditional one was going to share his skills with me 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.000
 carlos valerÃ³n you're ready first I'll teach you how to create a lance this 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.190
 It will be our goal 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.809
 I can put a coconut 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.350
 the skills of the inc 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.949
 they have passed from generation to generation 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.410
 fishing was crucial for the survival of their ancestors 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.069
 what you have to do is put the weight on the back foot and then on points with 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.589
 finger 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.589
 your finance case is expected 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.759
 the cost is to pick it up 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.759
 here the Balearic who plays 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.940
 besides rosell he assured that he supports the weight on the back leg 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.940
 morals has it easy 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 as much as it would have been 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.550
 the corpse of this one has been better truth this is how it is done 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.020
 now it's better to be able to share a little more 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.609
 the chs 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.690
 it's lovely I have one 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.980
 but before I get in the water I have to do one more thing 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.780
 tamara the deadly box jellyfish 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.080
 these animals kill more people in australia a year than snakes 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.080
 Sharks and crocodiles together need protection 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.700
 I am like to heal attractive for them assured that you are starting from the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.810
 laugh we think they will whistle 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.270
 look at you where I am a fashion victim 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.870
 now in January because you do not wear these suits or disguise 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.950
 sport-express that used to bite Europe when the Mercedes in 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.590
 the leg of your tentacles you think you choose to stay away if you know 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.320
 move and break your aesthetic spectacle 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.620
 and the bite is dangerous the truth yes the power to send so special not love you 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.760
 people and everyone 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.560
 how good 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.950
 today's goal is to fish enough to feed the family 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.170
 of the fan 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.420
 but the rain dragged so much follow-up to the water that our goal 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.500
 it's almost impossible 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.200
 from where it is a bit dirty we are going to enter to put the network 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.770
 I'll ask the guys to drag the reuters we have to have the spears 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.850
 ready because if something goes out of the network it's ours we have to throw the lamp 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.170
 turned on before it runs out I have no idea what the network will bring 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.250
 but I have the spear ready and I'm ready to jump 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.519
 let us escape 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.519
 jch act good morning 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.699
 photo dies something taken out the fish a pet 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:29.629
 it was about 47 meters away we have a mullet and a few dry canal in 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.159
 florence 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.139
 the aborigines have been living for thousands of years from the natural resources of 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.719
 australia and the small communities that continue to fish with these methods 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:39.980
 traditional 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.049
 they have the right to stay with whatever they want, whether you are big or small 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.159
 that state 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.269
 this is a small barramundi 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.509
 in fixed foios there are only all 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.229
 and they have all the right 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:57.249
 strict metro fishing rules divided do this so pass the 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.169
 day with lync and his family is a privilege despite the clear weather 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.280
 fepex is the biggest of the day I will tell you that with this clamp 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.399
 one could start in the attempt 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.979
 they escaped 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.249
 blanket to stop 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:15.749
 tapalpa 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:17.269
 p 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.199
 conference 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.059
 for it 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:25.149
 this unrealistic maneuver thought I was wearing this outfit for the jellyfish not 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.989
 I have been told by the crabs that the crabs choose from behind that it is 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.019
 exactly what they do but the piece of fucker has taken me 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:38.389
 and it's not the only thing that misleads me is a hinge of Mars is clear if I had 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.479
 atypical tentacles in theory a lot of it 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:45.120
 and you are immune to their bites they also explain as much as others 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.120
 I'm glad to wear the suit 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.539
 brings us a variety of small fish but the most precious of all 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.169
 is the blanket stripe 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.369
 apparently they are everywhere 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:04:01.399
 but they speak these conditions is not easy, I hope not to stumble upon a 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:05.239
 photo to the porters that you look at the others lack if something moves corral to 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.539
 Calm taste if you see any movement on the surfaces because there are some 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:09.939
 who decides to launch 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.939
 although larger blanket 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.819
 every camera low 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.359
 we only see fleeting movements even link 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.359
 struggle to reach an invisible goal 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.139
 luckily we have the network 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:35.550
 in league the size of its population is gorgeous I know how it's called a 

00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:39.839
 stream to absorb transport and this is what causes wounds sometimes 

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:42.279
 they have two on top and one on lawyers 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.719
 it's a blanket is what we were looking for 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.309
 unfortunately this one is not edible 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:51.139
 and why can not we eat it and it's the biggest we've caught and not 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.210
 we can eat it 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.550
 by the way there are many varieties and not all are dead 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.550
 the richest are those that we carry with the silver one 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.479
 the blanket is not part of the menu 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.029
 but when it will escape to feed the family it is not about what you have 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:09.839
 fish but of itself until been quite dyn the interest and commissions of 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.210
 every day if there are almost every day we go out loans what 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.240
 We need to bring it home and cook it. Turn it around 15 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.999
 it's a big feast 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.619
 the best are the crab legs locally known as the
