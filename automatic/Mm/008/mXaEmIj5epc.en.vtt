00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Now all the boys are back on 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.440
 channel today we are here on tenths 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.230
 today we will see two weapons in quotation marks 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.889
 exotic that will have to come out of the different 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.369
 de cata that will be inserted on destiny 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.140
 we hope they are decent weapons in the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.080
 say of the wolf family that should 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 be should land in these 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.580
 days these days next month or 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.340
 in two months on the consoles if 4 e 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.109
 xbox one then guys don't know if 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.440
 precisely there will be only these two 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.930
 I don't know if there will be exotic weapons 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.290
 exclusive only for ps4 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.510
 I don't know if there will be another weapon 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.910
 type that of the ppp dl that of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.860
 osiride now I do not know if precisely there 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.719
 will be other weapons but let's start a 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.260
 see these two years that surely 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.160
 they will come out for dr yes and I am the lord 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.780
 the lord of wolves and nassi had 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.830
 347 the gentlemen of the wolves is a shot gun 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.590
 that is, a gun with a solar pump weapon 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.180
 special his abilities are let's say 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.220
 decent at first glance it seemed 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.390
 the union of two weapons now we go to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.939
 see and labile and then I have to say the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.460
 truth the statistics seem to me a 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.189
 little bit strange in what sense you say 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.729
 the range of abilities that the rate has 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.280
 fire is very low has an impact 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.829
 devastating for a shotgun has a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.720
 ray of fire very low to one 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.250
 stability 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.430
 let's say average for a rifle a 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.640
 pump is a fairly low recharge e 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.490
 to a maximum of five shots 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.530
 then guys the problem with this weapon 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.810
 in itself it is not so much the impact but they are 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.020
 all other statistics skills 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.640
 of the weapon prediction increased that is 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.950
 increases damage if you don't aim 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.200
 sincerely to facilitate in a certain 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.490
 meaning the use of this weapon in pvp 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.290
 there is in that sense 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.569
 unlike the universal remote control 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.290
 that increased mine that is increased the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.939
 ray of fire if aiming 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.340
 this difference weapon of the remote control 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:18.819
 universal if you do not aim for an inter 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.290
 ray of fire this weapon can be 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.000
 really really devastating 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.069
 especially for those with a range of 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.959
 really low fire unlocking 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.720
 that hypothetically one should 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.310
 start seeing his true ones 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.189
 potential especially with an impact 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.680
 so high then devil's eye 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.599
 this weapon can cause burn if 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.260
 damage is dealt in succession 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:44.049
 that is, in what sense it has difference like 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.200
 the spine when you shoot 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.169
 the spine from the poison, that is, in the sense of 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.629
 damage that persists over time 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:55.290
 this weapon precisely because not with the first 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:58.419
 blow but with many strokes in succession 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.669
 they can inflict damage in the 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.590
 time, however, there is a small problem 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:04.480
 fire ray the rate of fire of 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.030
 this weapon is really really very much 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.980
 low so it's quite difficult between 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.810
 quotes to activate precisely 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.209
 the devil's eye skill unless 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.189
 you don't hit it from afar with a 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.859
 high that is from afar and the enemy is 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.419
 really stupid not to see you and you 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.940
 to fire two shots even if not 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:24.489
 kill with hypothetically burn 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.639
 here we talk about burning ifat 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.069
 and they have over time and it is a very good one 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.959
 good thing at least I see it this way 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.269
 so hypothetically this is a weapon 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.370
 that a shot gun that can be used should be used 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.620
 used both close up mainly 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.699
 ppp here when we talk about shopping is 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.379
 always ppp mainly from ppp that can 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:47.829
 be used both from medium distance 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.659
 and then close up makes you via prè ass 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.900
 especially with such a high impact 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.970
 so in a certain sense I look 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.370
 really so much to say to see 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.650
 how many in abi will use this shot 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.299
 gun and I hope it's not as devastating as 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.370
 how do i think 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.909
 the plot instead boys and a rifle from 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.919
 reconnaissance or dynasty vesta 347 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.129
 which has a kinetic damage so it does not have 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:14.439
 elemental damage and then two abilities 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.289
 in a sense it has three though it has 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.310
 two of skill in which without us how 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.760
 weapons lately of 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.639
 of the different the darkness from the deep as 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.970
 for example such as the area of 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.730
 youth who follows her first skill 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.520
 a two slot ie that if and choose one not 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.760
 you can also choose the other dynasty 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.590
 dress has a skill that is two 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.240
 skill that if you choose a year you can 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.669
 choose you can't choose the other e 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.340
 I'm david and goliath thanks to that fucking 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.160
 what beautiful names we give to our weapons and 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.440
 their goliath ability if chosen 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.810
 increases the armor statistics 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.330
 then the star verses resistance between 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.780
 quotation marks for 15 seconds the difference 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.700
 david increases agility for 15 seconds 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.350
 the agility statistic for 15 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.540
 seconds then in a way we will see 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.970
 to all who use goliaths and none 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.410
 that will use david finally to his 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.419
 skill is life support recovers 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.050
 health after a critical state ie 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.150
 when you reach the red bar then 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.430
 guarantees additional ammunition is a 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.190
 charging speed increased this me 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.490
 very reminiscent of the red court I must say 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:32.510
 truth and red death to some extent 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.580
 this skill is not that it is dinners 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.770
 without the monterosso that a rifle from 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.270
 reconnaissance 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.840
 I see an excellent thing above all 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.780
 because red death and devastating dynasty 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.539
 I don't know when I will use it 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.490
 surely in pvp it will really be 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:52.610
 difficult to use especially with 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.840
 these parameters especially with 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.850
 these parameters will really be 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.639
 difficult to use but 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.419
 mainly with the skills he has not 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.220
 I see a big step forward 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.580
 in desks I didn't want a weapon that 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:11.210
 let opi be a weapon that succeeds in 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:15.200
 compete with the weapons present now in the 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:18.110
 wedge-shaped hawk type game yes 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:23.390
 always means of ppp falconara cuneo 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:25.520
 then other weapons that are used in 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.220
 tv vabbè there are others though 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.720
 mainly when I play in ppv I see 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.250
 always people using these two 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:36.740
 weapons apart from red death and crasta vito e 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.550
 but this weapon I must say the other 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.560
 truth inspires me in the sense that it is beautiful 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.830
 Above all, they are nice 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.930
 this fact of exchanging the ability between 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.640
 Agility armor for 15 seconds then 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.340
 they are activated so I don't know for 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.710
 How long this can be useful 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.900
 great skill and life support that 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.630
 instead it increases health recovery 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.280
 in a critical state even though I think that 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.050
 on several occasions quite useless because 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.570
 they throw you down in your state's pescina 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.420
 critical and guarantees ammunition 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.160
 additional charging speed 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.250
 if it were additional ammunition this is 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.920
 useful because it has only nineteen though 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.710
 I think I think it can go very well 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.840
 in the sense that it can be seen 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.850
 sometimes in pvp apart from that 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.770
 they always used falconara and this 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.050
 sir the yes millions of wolves I think 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:30.200
 be really very strong 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.400
 ok guys then the video ends here 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.990
 we will see you for a while if you stay forever 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.940

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.110
 think 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.120
 if you want to know something else for 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.230
 when it comes to the case of wolves I will bring 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.300

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.370
 exotic equipment 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.800
 if there will be any news regarding it 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:52.430
 exotic weapons you will see a new video 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:55.220

 detailed 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.820
 see you next is always fixed on
