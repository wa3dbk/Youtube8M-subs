00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.210
 so welcome on a canal 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.590
 Today shows how you now 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.990
 windows 8 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.280
 Here you can do the grouping here 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.780
 with the microsoft computer multimedia 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.349
 programs and I know what you know 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.330
 wanted to have the grouping of the 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.330
 apps just that is actually quite 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.519
 easy you can down here on here 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.390
 bottom right in the corner on the minus sign 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.840
 step on it then has here the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.630
 all the whole groupings you 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.180
 you have already expressed yourself here 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.210
 on the right mouse button on one 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.320
 grouping then stands down here 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.480
 Call grouping 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.360
 she pushes on it and let's say 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.900
 we'll do it against a computer 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.810
 computer two out then we go too 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.780
 call and then we push the again 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.059
 left mouse button and then we have here 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.159
 we have two computers out of this 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.840
 and that's all 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.030
 okay you can here 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.370
 this grouping is different 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.970
 that means you can left here 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.170
 it remain mouse button on a map 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.670
 go slowly to the right and here 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.100
 opened here this 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.689
 this box and that pushes it then 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.560
 the app in and then you can go back 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.670
 make a new groupings of it and 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.979
 which could then again in which to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.020
 for example, no idea photos or so and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.470
 then you can do all your photo foto 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.570
 Folder or so do it clean so ok 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.110
 we undo it the way it does 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.830
 was before 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.860

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.430

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.460
 acquisitions 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.520

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.050
 So to group the apps and I hope
