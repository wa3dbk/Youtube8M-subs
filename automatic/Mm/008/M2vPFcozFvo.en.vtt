00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.910 
very well I highly recommend this
program<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:57.090> recommend<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.929> to<00:01:57.960> my<00:01:58.079> family<00:01:58.409> my

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
program I recommend it to my family my

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.249 
program I recommend it to my family my
friends<00:01:59.240> anybody<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.390> visits<00:02:00.689> my<00:02:00.840> website

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
friends anybody that visits my website

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
friends anybody that visits my website
because<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.189> really<00:02:02.429> does<00:02:02.670> work<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.179> mean<00:02:03.479> just

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
because it really does work I mean just

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.099 
because it really does work I mean just
imagine<00:02:03.840> if<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.859> had<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.249> manually<00:02:05.609> scan<00:02:06.109> 124

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
imagine if you had to manually scan 124

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.160 
imagine if you had to manually scan 124

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
you have to go on google and try to find

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.670 
you have to go on google and try to find
and<00:02:10.090> see<00:02:10.569> if<00:02:10.660> there's<00:02:10.840> updated<00:02:11.319> drivers

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
and see if there's updated drivers

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.740 
and see if there's updated drivers
because<00:02:12.250> hardware<00:02:12.790> manufacturers<00:02:13.540> they

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
because hardware manufacturers they

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.510 
because hardware manufacturers they
update<00:02:14.230> their<00:02:14.380> drivers<00:02:14.800> all<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.310> time

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
update their drivers all the time

you automatically imagine if you had to

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.449 
you automatically imagine if you had to
do<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.110> you'd<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.590> download<00:02:53.860> each<00:02:54.160> driver

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
do it you'd have to download each driver

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.030 
do it you'd have to download each driver
and<00:02:54.730> then<00:02:55.150> install<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.720> now<00:02:55.900> some<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:56.980> these

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040

25th 2010 that's over two years imagine
how<00:03:10.060> much<00:03:10.239> better<00:03:10.299> this<00:03:10.840> hardware<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.410> now

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
how much better this hardware is now

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.160 
how much better this hardware is now
with<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.280> newer<00:03:12.609> version<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.269> driver<00:03:13.540> no

security loopholes no problems I bet you

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.199 
security loopholes no problems I bet you
the<00:03:17.470> new<00:03:17.680> driver<00:03:17.980> would<00:03:18.280> make<00:03:18.489> this<00:03:18.700> Hardware

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
the new driver would make this Hardware

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.530 
the new driver would make this Hardware
run<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.660> lot<00:03:20.049> faster<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.890> lot<00:03:21.070> better<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:22.420> as

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
run a lot faster and a lot better so as

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.270 
run a lot faster and a lot better so as
you<00:03:22.630> can<00:03:22.720> see<00:03:22.959> there's<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.560> lot<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:23.859> different

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
you can see there's a lot of different

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.460 
you can see there's a lot of different
hardware<00:03:24.609> devices<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.299> bet<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.109> that<00:03:26.320> your

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
hardware devices I bet you that your

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.670 
hardware devices I bet you that your
computer<00:03:26.650> has<00:03:27.329> 24<00:03:28.329> drivers<00:03:28.930> or<00:03:29.109> even<00:03:29.440> more
