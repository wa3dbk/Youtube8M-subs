00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.750
 turn gold on the campuses 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.970
 the Association of Waste Pickers 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.730
 if you do not leave btc in our great partner 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.520
 almost there would be no association of scavengers with the scar reached 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.470
 ronaldão salary worth the tata discarded 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.720

 many families survive on the sale of recyclable materials 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.990
 but now with the dairy industry that further improve the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.350
 people's lives 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.490
 the so-called para-minas project, so it created the sustainable cooperativism 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.340
 initiative will change the face of the city will serve as an example for me 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.369
 many Brazilian municipalities or worse the project is a partnership of the company with the 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.729
 prefecture and the campuses the city hall she supplies the shed 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.310
 water infrastructure 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.080
 energy and all 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.229
 infrastructure for the operation of the warehouse 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.389
 and the campuses we made available for him to collect material inside the itambé 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:18.409
 do sorting learning and cleaning of material with ae 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.339
 Also, the pulp is intended for all unused 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:23.179
 the champions 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:27.519
 This corresponds to one thousand tons of waste per year to 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.349
 initiative in practice, the dairy industry trained the 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.399
 to work in the factory 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:36.079
 they wear uniforms that learn to avoid contamination 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.559
 all within the norms so that the project succeeds guaranteed the sale of the 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.579

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:45.340
 environmental 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.209
 and with the oversight of itambé 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.149
 the sustainable cooperativism project will generate more profit the association 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:56.459
 scavengers are celebrating that they already calculate how much the initiative 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.690
 render for each in the scenario that is in the network from 500 to 600 reais 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.800

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.099
 passport will introduce non-prescription news 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.510
 but so that the partnership between and is also the city in action that continue 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.170
 the scavengers need to make a contribution to stop mines' 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.660

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:38.349
 also the commitment commitment compartments 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.950

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.639

 from the environmental area through work safety to the 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.759
 marketing of products 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.109

 recyclable to decrease 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.139
 we saw that it matched perfectly with our goal 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.760
 that's because it favors 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.019

 one of the points that remained like the other 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.060
 it's as if the world has gone crazy because it does not have a much better future
