these little little darlings over here

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.849 
these little little darlings over here
uh-huh<00:02:26.060> are<00:02:26.269> they<00:02:26.900> there<00:02:27.349> are<00:02:27.409> about<00:02:27.560> two

centimetres long up to about 16 inches

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.649 
centimetres long up to about 16 inches
now<00:02:30.489> they're<00:02:31.489> not<00:02:31.670> necessarily<00:02:32.060> fatty<00:02:32.420> but

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
now they're not necessarily fatty but

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.149 
now they're not necessarily fatty but
they<00:02:32.780> grow<00:02:32.959> in<00:02:33.019> brackish<00:02:33.409> water<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:33.920> they<00:02:34.010> grow

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
they grow in brackish water so they grow

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.610 
they grow in brackish water so they grow
in<00:02:34.280> saltwater<00:02:34.659> but<00:02:35.659> their<00:02:35.810> saltiness<00:02:36.319> comes

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
in saltwater but their saltiness comes

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.020 
in saltwater but their saltiness comes
from<00:02:36.859> the<00:02:36.980> way<00:02:37.069> that<00:02:37.219> they're<00:02:37.370> traditionally

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
from the way that they're traditionally

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.490 
from the way that they're traditionally
preserved<00:02:38.450> okay<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.169> they're<00:02:39.349> usually

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
preserved okay so they're usually

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.860 
preserved okay so they're usually
skinned<00:02:40.159> gutted<00:02:40.579> and<00:02:40.969> they're<00:02:41.419> packed<00:02:41.689> in

want<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.570> do<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:46.200> have<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.440> whole<00:04:46.740> bunch<00:04:47.130> of

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
chunks of garlic in the dressing because

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.360 
chunks of garlic in the dressing because
that<00:04:50.910> can<00:04:51.060> absolutely<00:04:51.360> end<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.810> first<00:04:52.020> date

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
that can absolutely end a first date

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.610 
that can absolutely end a first date

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
and you're gonna spread it really press

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.010 
and you're gonna spread it really press
down<00:05:01.050> hard<00:05:01.560> okay<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.610> just<00:05:03.030> nibble<00:05:03.690> away<00:05:03.780> at

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
down hard okay and just nibble away at

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.890 
down hard okay and just nibble away at
that<00:05:04.140> garlic<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.830> turn<00:05:05.040> it<00:05:05.130> into<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.340> paste

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
that garlic and turn it into a paste

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.780 
that garlic and turn it into a paste
just<00:05:06.900> like<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:08.100> what<00:05:08.280> that'll<00:05:08.490> do<00:05:08.760> is

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
just like that and what that'll do is

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.450 
just like that and what that'll do is
it'll<00:05:09.440> smash<00:05:10.440> up<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.680> garlic<00:05:10.920> so<00:05:11.190> when<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.340> put

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
it'll smash up the garlic so when I put

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.920 
it'll smash up the garlic so when I put
into<00:05:11.610> my<00:05:11.700> dressing<00:05:11.940> will<00:05:12.270> disperse<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.810> when

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
into my dressing will disperse and when

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.960 
into my dressing will disperse and when
I'm<00:05:13.020> chunks<00:05:13.260> of<00:05:13.350> garlic<00:05:13.440> but<00:05:14.070> also<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.640> lot<00:05:14.880> of

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
I'm chunks of garlic but also a lot of

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.010 
I'm chunks of garlic but also a lot of
the<00:05:15.030> oil<00:05:15.060> is<00:05:15.330> going<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.510> go<00:05:15.570> into<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:15.810> salt

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
the oil is going to go into the salt

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.540 
the oil is going to go into the salt
sure<00:05:16.500> so<00:05:16.800> instead<00:05:16.980> of<00:05:17.040> it<00:05:17.190> going<00:05:17.250> into<00:05:17.400> the

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
sure so instead of it going into the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.530 
sure so instead of it going into the
cutting<00:05:17.760> board<00:05:17.970> it's<00:05:18.090> going<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.270> go<00:05:18.330> into<00:05:18.480> the

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
cutting board it's going to go into the

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.030 
cutting board it's going to go into the
salt<00:05:18.750> so<00:05:19.080> all<00:05:19.230> we<00:05:19.320> have<00:05:19.410> to<00:05:19.500> do<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.710> just<00:05:19.890> adjust

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
salt so all we have to do is just adjust

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.440 
salt so all we have to do is just adjust
the<00:05:20.340> amount<00:05:20.580> of<00:05:20.700> salt<00:05:20.880> that<00:05:20.940> we<00:05:21.090> have<00:05:21.240> in<00:05:21.360> our

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
the amount of salt that we have in our

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.570 
the amount of salt that we have in our
finished<00:05:21.750> dish<00:05:21.780> because<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.590> salts<00:05:22.980> abrasive

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
finished dish because the salts abrasive

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.940 
finished dish because the salts abrasive
is<00:05:23.700> that<00:05:23.880> what<00:05:24.060> makes<00:05:24.270> it<00:05:24.480> exactly<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:25.830> the

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
is that what makes it exactly and the

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.350 
is that what makes it exactly and the
salt<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.310> we're<00:05:26.430> using<00:05:26.580> this<00:05:26.790> kosher<00:05:27.120> salt

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
salt that we're using this kosher salt

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.970 
salt that we're using this kosher salt
so<00:05:27.480> it's<00:05:27.630> a<00:05:27.660> bigger<00:05:27.840> crisp<00:05:28.110> act<00:05:28.320> so<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:28.770> would

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
so it's a bigger crisp act so I would

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.170 
so it's a bigger crisp act so I would
recommend<00:05:29.130> this<00:05:29.490> over<00:05:29.880> something<00:05:30.150> like

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
recommend this over something like

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.640 
recommend this over something like
diamond<00:05:30.660> you<00:05:30.780> know<00:05:30.810> dime<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:31.080> crystal<00:05:31.500> salt

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
diamond you know dime a crystal salt

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.920 
diamond you know dime a crystal salt
something<00:05:32.040> like<00:05:32.160> that<00:05:32.340> okay<00:05:32.670> all<00:05:33.240> right<00:05:33.420> so

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
something like that okay all right so

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.750 
something like that okay all right so
we're<00:05:34.470> gonna<00:05:34.560> go<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.800> our<00:05:34.890> next<00:05:35.100> segment<00:05:35.310> but<00:05:35.610> I

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
we're gonna go to our next segment but I
