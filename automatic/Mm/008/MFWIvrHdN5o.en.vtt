a range of four different types of
couplers<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:09.450> currently<00:00:09.660> sell<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:11.420> already

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
couplers we currently sell and already

couplers we currently sell and already
on<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.750> websites<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.259> have<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> chart<00:00:13.679> for<00:00:13.830> two

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
on the websites we have a chart for two

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.189 
on the websites we have a chart for two
millimeter<00:00:14.400> or<00:00:14.610> inch<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> quarter<00:00:15.199> inch

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
millimeter or inch and a quarter inch

millimeter or inch and a quarter inch
and<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.379> quarter<00:00:16.500> coupler<00:00:16.980> which<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.550> use<00:00:17.850> to

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
and a quarter coupler which we use to

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.130 
and a quarter coupler which we use to
combine<00:00:18.990> join<00:00:19.560> together<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.250> two<00:00:20.789> poles<00:00:21.140> each

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
combine join together and two poles each

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.439 
combine join together and two poles each
of<00:00:22.470> our<00:00:22.500> two<00:00:22.740> two<00:00:22.890> millimeter<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
of our two two millimeter or we have a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.910 
of our two two millimeter or we have a
larger<00:00:24.869> version<00:00:25.050> which<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> fifty

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
larger version which is a fifty

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.029 
larger version which is a fifty
millimeter<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.550> two<00:00:26.580> inch<00:00:27.000> version<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.039> and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
millimeter or two inch version and and

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.769 
millimeter or two inch version and and
then<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.460> much<00:00:29.789> simpler<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.480> hold

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
then we have much simpler and hold

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
then we have much simpler and hold
hopper<00:00:31.019> here<00:00:31.349> which<00:00:31.830> were<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.460> simply<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.910> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
hopper here which were we simply have a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.910 
hopper here which were we simply have a
pole<00:00:33.390> goes<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.710> it's

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
pole goes in here and here and it's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.250 
pole goes in here and here and it's
flexible<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.700> terms<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.120> height<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.690> so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
flexible in terms of the height and so

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.840 
flexible in terms of the height and so
we<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.680> had<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:38.399> two<00:00:38.640> inch

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
we can have had up to about two inch

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.290 
we can have had up to about two inch
hole<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.420> okay<00:00:40.129> now<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> new<00:00:41.730> part<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.180> we

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
hole here okay now a new part that we

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.600 
hole here okay now a new part that we
were<00:00:42.390> asked<00:00:42.690> by<00:00:43.079> customers<00:00:43.590> ahead<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
were asked by customers ahead on is this

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.510 
were asked by customers ahead on is this
new<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.300> copper<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.230> which<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:47.100> actually

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
new and copper here which is actually

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
new and copper here which is actually
different<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.660> fixed<00:00:48.930> size<00:00:49.110> more<00:00:49.649> or

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
different and it's a fixed size more or

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.100 
different and it's a fixed size more or
less<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> different<00:00:51.449> size<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.840> so

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
less it's on a different size and so

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.020 
less it's on a different size and so
it's<00:00:52.289> designed<00:00:52.530> pacifically<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> thirty

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it's designed pacifically for a thirty

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.600 
it's designed pacifically for a thirty
two<00:00:54.300> millimeter<00:00:54.570> pole<00:00:55.140> slotted<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.370> end

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
two millimeter pole slotted on this end

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.630 
two millimeter pole slotted on this end
and<00:00:56.960> I'll<00:00:57.960> rotate<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.500> around<00:00:58.680> -<00:00:59.039> far<00:00:59.399> side

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and I'll rotate this around - far side

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.740 
and I'll rotate this around - far side
and<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:01.219> 37<00:01:02.219> millimeter<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.149> end<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.719> just

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and a 37 millimeter on this end and just

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.719 
and a 37 millimeter on this end and just
to<00:01:04.049> show<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.229> how<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.830> locking<00:01:05.220> mechanism

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
to show you how the locking mechanism

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.570 
to show you how the locking mechanism
works<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.810> thirteen<00:01:07.380> millimeter<00:01:07.710> or

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
works we have a thirteen millimeter or

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.899 
works we have a thirteen millimeter or
13<00:01:09.510> millimeter<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.260> head<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.369> note<00:01:11.610> and

13 millimeter and head on this note and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.870 
13 millimeter and head on this note and
we<00:01:12.090> love<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.479> into<00:01:12.750> position<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.610> inside<00:01:14.610> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
we love this into position and inside of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.789 
we love this into position and inside of
pole<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.720> thing<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.110> you'll<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.500> able<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
pole the thing here you'll be able to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.230 
pole the thing here you'll be able to
see<00:01:16.950> your<00:01:17.159> others<00:01:17.400> angle<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:17.970> slightly

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
see your others angle up slightly

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.390 
see your others angle up slightly
there's<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.560> far<00:01:19.740> end<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.250> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
there's actually the far end of that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.090 
there's actually the far end of that
bolt<00:01:20.670> when<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.270> tighten<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.780> will<00:01:21.960> actually

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
bolt when we tighten it will actually

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.160 
bolt when we tighten it will actually
trapped<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.030> pole<00:01:24.450> itself<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> lock

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
trapped in on the pole itself and lock

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.010 
trapped in on the pole itself and lock
into<00:01:25.409> position<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:26.430> halfway<00:01:26.850> down<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.659> this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
into position now halfway down and this

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.550 
into position now halfway down and this
particular<00:01:29.720> coupler<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:31.290> there's<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
particular coupler you can see there's a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.039 
particular coupler you can see there's a
bolt<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.310> slots<00:01:32.640> directly<00:01:33.210> true<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
bolt that slots directly true and it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.130 
bolt that slots directly true and it
stops<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.520> makes<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.000> sure<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.930> pole

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
stops and it makes the sure that pole

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.380 
stops and it makes the sure that pole
can<00:01:37.439> only<00:01:37.590> go<00:01:37.799> halfway<00:01:38.130> down<00:01:38.340> along<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.270> we

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
can only go halfway down along so we

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.480 
can only go halfway down along so we
have<00:01:39.540> equal<00:01:39.900> clamps<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.619> both<00:01:40.770> ends<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
have equal clamps and both ends of the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
have equal clamps and both ends of the
pole<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.450> two<00:01:42.630> notes

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
pole so we have two notes

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.410 
pole so we have two notes
lock<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.619> each<00:01:43.829> pole<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.369> two<00:01:44.579> knots<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
lock in each pole so two knots here and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.270 
lock in each pole so two knots here and
two<00:01:45.930> nuts<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> third<00:01:46.590> pole<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.040> far-end

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
two nuts on the third pole and far-end

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
the process on the fire end

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.020 
the process on the fire end
I<00:03:02.200> plan<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.590> pull<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.130> on<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.489> fireman<00:03:03.819> so<00:03:03.970> we

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
I plan to pull in on the fireman so we

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.819 
I plan to pull in on the fireman so we
could<00:03:04.150> do<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.359> same<00:03:04.569> here<00:03:04.870> animation<00:03:05.440> quarter

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
could do the same here animation quarter

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.680 
could do the same here animation quarter
so<00:03:06.190> certain<00:03:06.579> amount<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.850> flexibility<00:03:07.359> on<00:03:07.480> this

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
so certain amount of flexibility on this

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.539 
so certain amount of flexibility on this
if<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.140> look<00:03:08.380> at<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.560> actual<00:03:08.709> pole<00:03:09.160> when<00:03:09.430> it's

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
if you look at the actual pole when it's

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.509 
if you look at the actual pole when it's
being<00:03:09.730> installed<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.859> it's<00:03:11.859> camped<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.310> here

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
being installed and it's camped in here

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.830 
being installed and it's camped in here
so<00:03:12.730> although<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.239> says<00:03:13.390> perfect<00:03:13.600> you

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
so although it says perfect you

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.090 
so although it says perfect you
millimeter<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.560> could<00:03:14.680> have<00:03:14.769> a<00:03:14.829> slightly

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
millimeter you could have a slightly

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.710 
millimeter you could have a slightly
larger<00:03:15.370> polling<00:03:15.970> that's<00:03:16.060> probably<00:03:16.359> by<00:03:16.480> maybe

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
larger polling that's probably by maybe

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.840 
larger polling that's probably by maybe
two<00:03:16.930> or<00:03:17.049> three<00:03:17.079> mils<00:03:17.470> under<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.160> city<00:03:18.400> London

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
two or three mils under the city London

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.879 
two or three mils under the city London
and<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.359> same<00:03:19.569> goals<00:03:19.810> in<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.049> fire<00:03:20.260> end<00:03:20.470> and

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
and the same goals in the fire end and

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.789 
and the same goals in the fire end and
then<00:03:21.329> but<00:03:22.329> ideally<00:03:22.750> an<00:03:23.200> inch<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> quarter

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
then but ideally an inch and a quarter

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.440 
then but ideally an inch and a quarter
on<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.250> end<00:03:24.489> an<00:03:24.700> inch<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.030> half<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:25.329> this

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
on this end an inch and a half in this

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.569 
on this end an inch and a half in this
end<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:26.049> it's<00:03:26.380> it's<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.650> good<00:03:26.799> way<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.010> extending

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
end so it's it's a good way of extending

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.430 
end so it's it's a good way of extending
a<00:03:27.819> pole<00:03:28.030> I'm<00:03:28.450> particularly<00:03:28.900> useful<00:03:29.079> if<00:03:29.380> you

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
a pole I'm particularly useful if you

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.920 
a pole I'm particularly useful if you
already<00:03:29.620> had<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.040> pole<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:31.030> situ<00:03:31.480> would<00:03:31.750> say

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
already had a pole in situ would say

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.539 
already had a pole in situ would say
particularly<00:03:32.350> if<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.620> went<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.859> a<00:03:32.889> location

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
particularly if you went to a location

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.190 
particularly if you went to a location
and<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:34.209> get<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:34.569> there<00:03:34.690> was<00:03:34.780> an<00:03:34.900> inch<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.170> a

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
and I get it there was an inch and a

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.199 
and I get it there was an inch and a
half<00:03:35.230> pole<00:03:35.650> there<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.400> want<00:03:36.549> it<00:03:36.670> extended

half pole there and you want it extended

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.599 
half pole there and you want it extended
to<00:03:37.359> raise<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.200> high<00:03:38.350> area<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:39.040> higher<00:03:39.250> and

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
to raise the high area to a higher and
