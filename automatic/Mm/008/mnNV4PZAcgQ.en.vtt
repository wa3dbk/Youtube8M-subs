not
and<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:46.260> thing<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.590> won<00:03:46.770> me<00:03:46.800> over<00:03:47.069> was<00:03:48.060> the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
and the thing that won me over was the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.320 
and the thing that won me over was the
way<00:03:48.510> she<00:03:48.540> described<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.890> watched<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.090> I

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
way she described it I watched it and I

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.830 
way she described it I watched it and I
was<00:03:51.480> just<00:03:51.959> lonely<00:03:52.170> my<00:03:52.860> Brenda<00:03:53.220> sweat<00:03:53.400> what

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840

was just lonely my Brenda sweat what
she's<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.050> think<00:03:55.350> what<00:03:55.530> she<00:03:55.650> said<00:03:55.680> was<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.730> is

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
she's I think what she said was it is

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.100 
she's I think what she said was it is
dystopian<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.400> people<00:03:59.880> are<00:04:00.270> separated

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
dystopian and the people are separated

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.890 
dystopian and the people are separated
into<00:04:01.230> colors<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.580> it's<00:04:03.060> awesome<00:04:03.270> ours

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
into colors and it's awesome ours

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.500 
into colors and it's awesome ours
and<00:04:04.110> at<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.100> point<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.520> was<00:04:05.640> like<00:04:05.730> what<00:04:06.180> it's

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
and at that point I was like what it's

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.260 
and at that point I was like what it's
all<00:04:06.720> ours<00:04:07.170> looking<00:04:07.560> back<00:04:07.770> on<00:04:07.800> it<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.340> think<00:04:08.490> it

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
all ours looking back on it I think it

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.840 
all ours looking back on it I think it
was<00:04:09.600> a<00:04:09.630> greatly<00:04:10.230> executed<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.310> stoke<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.730> end

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
was a greatly executed to stoke the end

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.760 
was a greatly executed to stoke the end
story<00:04:12.300> it<00:04:12.390> was<00:04:12.600> unique<00:04:12.900> in<00:04:13.080> a<00:04:13.170> sense<00:04:13.200> but<00:04:13.620> then

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
story it was unique in a sense but then

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.740 
story it was unique in a sense but then
again<00:04:13.890> it<00:04:14.220> was<00:04:14.370> kind<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.730> mash-up<00:04:15.120> of<00:04:15.239> Hunger

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
again it was kind of a mash-up of Hunger

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.170 
again it was kind of a mash-up of Hunger
Games<00:04:16.019> pretties<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.220> Game<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.459> Thrones<00:04:17.609> and

I'm<00:04:47.640> really<00:04:48.000> good<00:04:48.270> but<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.169> execution<00:04:49.640> not<00:04:50.640> so

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
I'm really good but the execution not so

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.790 
I'm really good but the execution not so
much<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.330> lot<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.750> explanations<00:04:52.320> are<00:04:52.440> missing

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
much a lot of explanations are missing

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.409 
much a lot of explanations are missing
this<00:04:53.100> is<00:04:53.220> part<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.550> series<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:54.030> maybe<00:04:54.270> it'll

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
this is part of a series so maybe it'll

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.050 
this is part of a series so maybe it'll
be<00:04:54.600> become<00:04:55.080> richer<00:04:55.620> as<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.280> series<00:04:56.610> goes<00:04:56.700> on

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
be become richer as the series goes on

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.380 
be become richer as the series goes on

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
and even though the pacing was fine all

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.159
