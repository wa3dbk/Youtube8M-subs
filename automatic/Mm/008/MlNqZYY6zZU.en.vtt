00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 Aan 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:17.670
 I am Daisei Young, but this is my practice method when I think of starting ear copy 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:22.950
 I would like to talk about 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:26.289
 Although I think that many there to say shadow Ki think that say try a 3 copy 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:31.060
 For example, the amount of the song I want to play 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:35.710
 Although I think that there is a variety or stand up because I want to improve the witch Soo-hyun feeling 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:41.040
 8If you play the guitar before , look for a guitar phrase 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:44.220
 I think there are a lot of people trying to forecast together 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.840
 Let's actually do it with a guitar phrase 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:54.450
 There are a lot of phrases that are usually difficult for men to listen with their ears 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:01.060
 For example, if it is an accompaniment to a song, it is often attracted to me 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:06.940
 The scene of the sudden sound because it is an instrument with such a wide range only for this guitar solo 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:13.120
 I think that there are many people who are alone or not, and the phrase is quick. 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.680
 That's why I want to recommend it there, so I try to copy the melody to the song 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.600
 Recommend to say 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.650
 I simply play the melody of the song with my guitar . 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.450
 Well 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:33.190
 While listening to 2 I 'm ok at all in my favorite song in the mouth with no air 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:34.540
 But the practice is to play in the head of your favorite song in memory and take that sound 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.820
 Really received 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.640
 I think there are two at first, so this practice method is fine if you try 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.790
 difficult 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:50.119
 I think you may notice that 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:55.310
 When I played probably know is that sing a song that's I think that Ya and actually in this finger board 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.240
 There are quite a few things that I will try to become this fret and the 4th of the control such as air sound and so on 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.630
 I think that 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:04.920
 Say in and Tsu going to take the song of the melody in the memory It is a while 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:09.479
 If you keep on practicing, then just listen to the motor this time 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.679
 As you can see what I'm playing around and picking off that touch of the fret around Ratia 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.190
 You come to 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:20.310
 If this is the case, I'm done, from there already 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.650
 I think that it is at all ok fished another copy of the bitter It is and has gone through this process 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.780
 bitter 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:33.489
 3 I think that something movement of speed to go up with a jerk of when to take something a phrase 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:37.960
 Because I think because of the normally have type practice now it is a relatively Hey practice easy way to tackle 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:44.970
 Mix down the practice I mean Iku' in good melody of the song in between 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.970
 Please try practice . The other party is over with this time Thank you 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.420
 Hmm 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.980
 1 minute
