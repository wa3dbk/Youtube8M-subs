embossing<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:25.980> design<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:27.510> machine<00:03:27.900> will

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
embossing the design the machine will

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.220 
embossing the design the machine will
cut<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.650> contour<00:03:29.310> around<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.270> embossed<00:03:30.660> image

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:49.220 
and when it's finished I'll show you
what<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.300> looks<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:47.120> I'm<00:03:48.120> going<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.510> feed<00:03:49.020> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
what it looks like I'm going to feed the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.320 
what it looks like I'm going to feed the
mat<00:03:49.470> out<00:03:49.830> of<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.070> machine

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.540 

now<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.360> have<00:03:54.750> long<00:03:55.080> nails<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.040> mat<00:03:56.250> is

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
now I have long nails and the mat is

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.430 
now I have long nails and the mat is
sticky<00:03:57.180> so<00:03:57.390> for<00:03:58.170> me<00:03:58.319> it's<00:03:58.530> easier<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.370> remove

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
sticky so for me it's easier to remove

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.430 
sticky so for me it's easier to remove
the<00:04:01.440> excess<00:04:01.890> paper<00:04:02.220> first<00:04:03.050> but<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.230> can

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
the excess paper first but you can

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.470 
the excess paper first but you can
remove<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.980> design<00:04:05.310> first<00:04:05.700> whatever<00:04:06.000> works

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
remove the design first whatever works

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.040 
remove the design first whatever works
best<00:04:06.630> for<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:07.940> now<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.209> want<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.570> give<00:04:09.750> this<00:04:09.990> a
