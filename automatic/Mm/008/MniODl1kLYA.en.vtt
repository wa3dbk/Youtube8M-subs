timing belt replacement on a 2008 EAA
this<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.379> 40<00:00:07.680> valve<00:00:07.859> engine<00:00:08.570> and<00:00:09.570> I

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
this is the 40 valve engine and I

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.540 
this is the 40 valve engine and I
figured<00:00:10.590> I'd<00:00:10.679> shoot<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.099> I've<00:00:11.250> done<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.490> a

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
figured I'd shoot this I've done this a

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.030 
figured I'd shoot this I've done this a
couple<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.940> times<00:00:12.179> now<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.710> wanted<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
couple of times now and I just wanted to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.410 
couple of times now and I just wanted to
let<00:00:14.130> everybody<00:00:14.340> see<00:00:14.639> how<00:00:14.670> much<00:00:14.849> room<00:00:15.059> there<00:00:15.120> is

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
let everybody see how much room there is

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.500 
let everybody see how much room there is
on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:17.010> a8<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.640> don't<00:00:17.789> think<00:00:17.940> it's<00:00:18.029> true<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
on the a8 I don't think it's true on the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.140 
on the a8 I don't think it's true on the
sixes<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.400> can<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.910> without

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
sixes so you can do this without

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.340 
sixes so you can do this without
removing<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.109> whole<00:00:22.439> lot<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:24.140> headlights<00:00:25.140> in

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
removing a whole lot so headlights in

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.019 
removing a whole lot so headlights in
bumpers<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.599> alternators<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.720> place<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
bumpers on alternators in place and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.139 
bumpers on alternators in place and
basically<00:00:30.029> all<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:31.550> lock<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.820> crank

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
basically all you do is lock the crank

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.410 
basically all you do is lock the crank
with<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> plug<00:00:34.250> it's<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.309> crank<00:00:35.579> lock<00:00:35.790> tool<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
with the plug it's a crank lock tool you

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.389 
with the plug it's a crank lock tool you
definitely<00:00:36.809> want<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.989> use<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.219> I'll<00:00:38.219> show

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
definitely want to use that I'll show

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.490 
definitely want to use that I'll show
you<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.790> second<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.989> also<00:00:40.140> need<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
you that in a second you also need the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.150 
you that in a second you also need the
cam<00:00:40.739> locking<00:00:41.280> bar<00:00:41.489> which<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
cam locking bar which is here and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.910 
cam locking bar which is here and
there's<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> real<00:00:44.399> good<00:00:44.579> reason<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.000> use<00:00:45.180> those

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
there's a real good reason to use those

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.470 
there's a real good reason to use those
I've<00:00:46.920> had<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.219> car<00:00:47.430> about<00:00:47.610> two<00:00:47.820> years<00:00:48.030> it's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
I've had this car about two years it's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.049 
I've had this car about two years it's
never<00:00:48.660> run<00:00:49.280> right<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:50.670> never<00:00:50.820> felt

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
never run right it's just never felt

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.689 
never run right it's just never felt
like<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.170> had<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.469> much<00:00:52.620> power<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.070> my<00:00:53.550> other

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
like it's had as much power as my other

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
like it's had as much power as my other
eight<00:00:53.940> which<00:00:54.300> has<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.719> lot<00:00:55.110> more<00:00:55.140> miles<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
eight which has a lot more miles on it

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.090 
eight which has a lot more miles on it
almost<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.250> hundred<00:00:56.489> thousand<00:00:56.789> miles<00:00:56.940> more<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
almost a hundred thousand miles more and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
almost a hundred thousand miles more and
it's<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.370> always<00:00:59.550> felt<00:00:59.910> slow<00:01:00.329> off<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.930> line

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
it's just always felt slow off the line

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
it's just always felt slow off the line
it's<00:01:01.379> never<00:01:01.590> had<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.949> kick<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> seat

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it's never had that kick in the seat

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
it's never had that kick in the seat
like<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> other<00:01:03.840> car<00:01:04.110> does<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> one

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
like the other car does and the one

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.649 
like the other car does and the one
before<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.339> owned<00:01:05.729> which<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> same<00:01:06.420> one

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
before I owned which was the same one

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.950 
before I owned which was the same one
and<00:01:07.310> I've<00:01:08.310> always<00:01:08.460> been<00:01:08.729> suspect<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
and I've always been suspect to the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.179 
and I've always been suspect to the
timing<00:01:10.350> I've<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.619> never<00:01:10.740> really<00:01:10.860> gotten

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
timing I've just never really gotten

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.460 
timing I've just never really gotten
enough<00:01:11.520> time<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.970> take<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> look<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.350> if

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
enough time to take a look and see if

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.260 
enough time to take a look and see if
that<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> case<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.310> sure<00:01:15.030> enough<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that was the case so sure enough I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.370 
that was the case so sure enough I
locked<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> crank<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:17.420> when<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.450> try<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.229> put

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
locked the crank and when I try to put

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.450 
locked the crank and when I try to put
the<00:01:19.560> crank<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> cam<00:01:20.850> bar<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:22.220> pop<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.369> on

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the crank or the cam bar on pop it on

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
the crank or the cam bar on pop it on
one<00:01:23.640> side<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:25.100> come<00:01:26.100> around<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
one side here come around here and you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.530 
one side here come around here and you
can<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.500> doesn't<00:01:28.740> line<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> think

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
can see it doesn't line up so I think

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870 
can see it doesn't line up so I think
it's<00:01:30.810> off<00:01:31.020> about<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> half<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.189> tooth<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's off about a half a tooth on the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.780 
it's off about a half a tooth on the
belt<00:01:33.500> I've<00:01:34.500> read<00:01:34.860> where<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.490> has<00:01:35.610> happened

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
belt I've read where this has happened

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.460 
belt I've read where this has happened
to<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.090> couple<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> other<00:01:36.479> guys<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.229> Carl

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
to a couple of other guys and the Carl

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.310 
to a couple of other guys and the Carl
run<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.369> won't<00:01:38.610> throw<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> cell<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.780> won't<00:01:40.229> get

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
run it won't throw a cell you won't get

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.850 
run it won't throw a cell you won't get
any<00:01:40.439> codes<00:01:41.479> it'll<00:01:42.479> run<00:01:42.689> okay<00:01:43.049> it'll<00:01:43.560> start

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
any codes it'll run okay it'll start

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.179 
any codes it'll run okay it'll start
fine<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.060> won't<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.390> enough<00:01:45.630> power<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
fine it just won't have enough power and

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.990 
fine it just won't have enough power and
so<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.630> car<00:01:48.899> had<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.649> had<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.340> water<00:01:50.729> pump

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so the car had actually had a water pump

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.109 
so the car had actually had a water pump
and<00:01:51.210> thermostat<00:01:51.750> put<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.110> before<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.530> bought<00:01:52.829> it

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
and thermostat put in before I bought it

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.030 
and thermostat put in before I bought it
so<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.780> know<00:01:54.899> pretty<00:01:55.290> good<00:01:55.380> chance<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.860> they

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
so you know pretty good chance that they

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.539 
so you know pretty good chance that they
used<00:01:56.930> just<00:01:57.930> marking<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> belt<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.219> method

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
used just marking the belt as the method

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.050 
used just marking the belt as the method
to<00:02:00.409> pull<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.590> thermostat<00:02:02.430> out<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.759> replace

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
to pull the thermostat out and replace

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.719 
to pull the thermostat out and replace
that<00:02:03.110> they<00:02:04.110> didn't<00:02:04.619> lock<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.799> crank<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that they didn't lock the crank or the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.850 
that they didn't lock the crank or the
cams<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.390> sure<00:02:06.930> enough<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.290> been<00:02:07.409> off<00:02:07.530> so

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
cams and sure enough it's been off so

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.339 
cams and sure enough it's been off so
there's<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.910> real-life<00:02:09.300> example<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.869> why

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
there's a real-life example of why

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.180 
there's a real-life example of why
getting<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.250> tools<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:12.050> important

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
getting the right tools is important

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.120 
getting the right tools is important
so<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.310> terms<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.760> removal<00:02:16.420> its<00:02:17.170> again<00:02:17.890> pretty

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
so in terms of removal its again pretty

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.350 
so in terms of removal its again pretty
it's<00:02:18.280> pretty<00:02:18.460> easy<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.970> car<00:02:19.180> because

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
it's pretty easy on this car because

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.810 
it's pretty easy on this car because
there's<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.660> lot<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.840> room<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:21.340> only<00:02:21.460> thing<00:02:21.700> I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
there's a lot of room the only thing I

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.150 
there's a lot of room the only thing I
only<00:02:22.570> things<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.050> do<00:02:23.110> are<00:02:23.910> one<00:02:25.980> remove<00:02:26.980> the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
only things that I do are one remove the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.330 
only things that I do are one remove the
tensioner<00:02:27.580> pulley<00:02:28.530> for<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.650> for<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.100> drive

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340

tensioner pulley for the for the drive
belt<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.150> called<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:32.010> ribbed<00:02:33.010> belt<00:02:33.310> in

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
belt this is called the ribbed belt in

belt this is called the ribbed belt in
the<00:02:34.300> Bentley<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.960> timing<00:02:35.320> belt<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.590> called

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
the Bentley the timing belt is called

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.670 
the Bentley the timing belt is called
the<00:02:36.010> tooth<00:02:36.220> belt<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:38.170> think<00:02:38.350> that's<00:02:38.500> an<00:02:38.590> 8

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
the tooth belt and I think that's an 8

the tooth belt and I think that's an 8
millimeter<00:02:39.100> hex<00:02:40.440> just<00:02:41.440> remove<00:02:41.710> that<00:02:41.740> pull

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
millimeter hex just remove that pull

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.480 
millimeter hex just remove that pull
that<00:02:42.460> out<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:44.460> once<00:02:45.460> you<00:02:45.640> do<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:47.340> there's<00:02:48.340> a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
that out and once you do that there's a

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.850 
that out and once you do that there's a
I<00:02:48.970> think<00:02:49.120> it's<00:02:49.240> a<00:02:49.300> 17<00:02:49.750> millimeter<00:02:49.930> bolt<00:02:50.470> here

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
I think it's a 17 millimeter bolt here

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.570 
I think it's a 17 millimeter bolt here
in<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.070> top<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.670> front<00:02:52.110> engine<00:02:53.110> mount

in the top of the front engine mount
just<00:02:54.580> pop<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:54.820> out<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.300> then<00:02:55.720> there's<00:02:55.900> three

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
just pop that out and then there's three

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.030 
just pop that out and then there's three
12<00:02:57.820> meter<00:02:58.140> millimeter<00:02:59.140> bolts<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.590> hold<00:02:59.770> this

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
I'm not going to open up the cooling

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.220 
I'm not going to open up the cooling
system<00:03:43.150> that'll<00:03:43.390> save<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.600> little<00:03:43.780> bit<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:43.989> time

and<00:03:44.970> other<00:03:45.970> than<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.800> it's<00:03:47.800> a<00:03:47.920> pretty

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
and other than that it's a pretty

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.220 
and other than that it's a pretty
straightforward<00:03:48.489> job<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.630> only<00:03:49.840> tricky<00:03:50.200> part

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
straightforward job the only tricky part

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.470 
straightforward job the only tricky part
that<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.100> found<00:03:53.010> has<00:03:54.010> been<00:03:54.040> locking<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.030> crank

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
that I found has been locking the crank

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.170 
that I found has been locking the crank
and<00:03:55.890> there's<00:03:56.890> two<00:03:57.100> reasons<00:03:57.310> it's<00:03:57.700> been<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.880> pain

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
and there's two reasons it's been a pain

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.030 
and there's two reasons it's been a pain
one<00:03:58.570> is<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.930> location<00:03:59.790> shine<00:04:00.790> light<00:04:01.090> up<00:04:01.239> here

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
one is the location shine light up here

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.300 
one is the location shine light up here
so<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.280> on<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.520> driver's<00:04:04.120> side<00:04:04.150> of<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
so this is on the driver's side of the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.990 
so this is on the driver's side of the
engine<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:08.410> can<00:04:08.530> see<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.890> socket<00:04:09.459> it's<00:04:09.700> just

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
engine you can see the socket it's just

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.680 
engine you can see the socket it's just
forward<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:11.730> point<00:04:12.730> down<00:04:12.880> here<00:04:13.209> you<00:04:13.360> there's

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
forward but point down here you there's

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.270 
forward but point down here you there's
a<00:04:13.780> control<00:04:14.080> arm<00:04:14.320> for<00:04:14.620> reference<00:04:15.010> it's<00:04:16.000> up<00:04:16.180> here

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
a control arm for reference it's up here

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.729 
a control arm for reference it's up here
it's<00:04:18.280> right<00:04:18.459> above<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:19.299> plug<00:04:19.959> for<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.320> engine

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
it's right above the plug for the engine

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.070 
it's right above the plug for the engine
mount<00:04:20.890> actually<00:04:21.340> your<00:04:22.270> socket<00:04:22.690> will<00:04:22.780> probably

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
mount actually your socket will probably

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.040 
mount actually your socket will probably
hit<00:04:23.200> that

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
hit that

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.140 
hit that
so<00:04:24.860> there's<00:04:25.129> two<00:04:25.310> things<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.699> I<00:04:25.789> would<00:04:26.000> say

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
so there's two things that I would say

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.339 
so there's two things that I would say
your<00:04:26.360> one<00:04:26.660> is<00:04:27.289> make<00:04:27.710> sure<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:28.550> that<00:04:29.419> hex

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
your one is make sure that that hex

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.279 
your one is make sure that that hex
socket<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:31.729> use<00:04:31.940> is<00:04:32.360> seated<00:04:33.110> all<00:04:33.229> the

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
socket that you use is seated all the

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.670 
socket that you use is seated all the
way<00:04:34.419> this<00:04:35.419> one<00:04:35.629> was<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.840> little<00:04:36.020> scary<00:04:36.349> because

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
way this one was a little scary because

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.860 
way this one was a little scary because
whoever<00:04:37.340> did<00:04:37.520> it<00:04:37.610> before<00:04:39.099> or<00:04:40.099> maybe<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.430> did<00:04:40.729> it

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
whoever did it before or maybe I did it

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.230 
whoever did it before or maybe I did it
because<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.289> the<00:04:42.949> hex<00:04:43.129> plug<00:04:43.430> wasn't<00:04:43.879> seated

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
because the the hex plug wasn't seated

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.260 
because the the hex plug wasn't seated
all<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.389> way<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:46.340> looks<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.639> me<00:04:46.789> like<00:04:46.819> this<00:04:47.120> is

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
all the way it looks to me like this is

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.260 
all the way it looks to me like this is
slightly<00:04:47.870> rounded<00:04:48.289> over<00:04:48.590> so<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:49.220> got<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.580> little

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
slightly rounded over so I got a little

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.149 
slightly rounded over so I got a little
bit<00:04:50.389> of<00:04:50.449> a<00:04:50.509> panic<00:04:50.900> because<00:04:51.169> if<00:04:51.409> that<00:04:51.590> slipped

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 
bit of a panic because if that slipped

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.510 
bit of a panic because if that slipped
and<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:53.389> strip<00:04:53.840> this<00:04:54.080> I<00:04:54.379> have<00:04:54.860> no<00:04:55.069> idea<00:04:55.099> how<00:04:55.460> to

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
and I strip this I have no idea how to

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.490 
and I strip this I have no idea how to
get<00:04:55.669> it<00:04:55.789> out<00:04:55.930> there's<00:04:56.930> really<00:04:57.110> just<00:04:57.380> not

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
get it out there's really just not

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.140 
get it out there's really just not
enough<00:04:57.710> access<00:04:58.099> here<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:58.580> it<00:04:58.669> was<00:04:58.759> in<00:04:58.909> pretty

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
enough access here and it was in pretty

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.659 
enough access here and it was in pretty
tight<00:04:59.360> so<00:04:59.599> this<00:04:59.780> might<00:04:59.960> have<00:05:00.080> been<00:05:00.430> if<00:05:01.430> my

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
tight so this might have been if my

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.670 
tight so this might have been if my
theory<00:05:02.060> is<00:05:02.090> correct<00:05:02.240> then<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.139> guys<00:05:03.259> who<00:05:03.500> did

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
theory is correct then the guys who did

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.260 
theory is correct then the guys who did
this<00:05:03.800> before<00:05:04.250> or<00:05:04.490> when<00:05:04.639> they<00:05:04.759> did<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.060> pump

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
this before or when they did the pump

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.390 
this before or when they did the pump
and<00:05:05.389> the<00:05:05.479> thermostat<00:05:06.020> they<00:05:06.979> never<00:05:07.159> actually

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
and the thermostat they never actually

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.270 
and the thermostat they never actually
locked<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.060> crank<00:05:08.620> I'm<00:05:09.620> actually<00:05:10.039> almost

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
locked the crank I'm actually almost

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.010 
locked the crank I'm actually almost
sure<00:05:10.520> that<00:05:10.550> now<00:05:10.880> because<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.389> cam<00:05:11.569> bar

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
sure that now because that cam bar

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.080 
sure that now because that cam bar
doesn't<00:05:12.380> fit<00:05:12.620> so<00:05:13.220> this<00:05:13.370> was<00:05:13.520> probably<00:05:13.729> tight

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
doesn't fit so this was probably tight

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.200 
doesn't fit so this was probably tight
from<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.360> factory<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:16.310> bid<00:05:16.490> I<00:05:16.520> put<00:05:16.880> in<00:05:17.000> there

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
from the factory the bid I put in there

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.719 
from the factory the bid I put in there
was<00:05:17.539> was<00:05:17.930> maybe<00:05:18.169> slightly<00:05:18.710> worn<00:05:18.979> it<00:05:19.219> slipped<00:05:19.639> a

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
was was maybe slightly worn it slipped a

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.360 
was was maybe slightly worn it slipped a
little<00:05:19.849> bit<00:05:20.090> so<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.360> stopped<00:05:20.750> immediately

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
little bit so I stopped immediately

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.640 
little bit so I stopped immediately
pulled<00:05:22.370> it<00:05:22.460> back<00:05:22.580> out<00:05:22.870> got<00:05:23.870> a<00:05:23.900> new<00:05:24.110> one<00:05:24.319> and

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
pulled it back out got a new one and

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.529 
pulled it back out got a new one and
then<00:05:24.740> I<00:05:24.889> tapped<00:05:25.219> it<00:05:25.400> in<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.969> make<00:05:26.210> sure<00:05:26.330> it<00:05:26.419> was

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
then I tapped it in to make sure it was

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.559 
then I tapped it in to make sure it was
fully<00:05:26.840> seated<00:05:27.169> and<00:05:27.759> it<00:05:28.759> was<00:05:28.849> on<00:05:29.000> tight<00:05:29.300> and

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
fully seated and it was on tight and

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.749 
fully seated and it was on tight and
then<00:05:29.719> I<00:05:29.810> cranked<00:05:30.650> then<00:05:30.800> it<00:05:30.919> snapped<00:05:31.219> loose<00:05:31.460> but

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
then I cranked then it snapped loose but

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.399 
then I cranked then it snapped loose but
again<00:05:32.030> if<00:05:32.150> this<00:05:32.270> rounded<00:05:32.690> over<00:05:32.960> he'd<00:05:33.199> be<00:05:33.319> in

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
again if this rounded over he'd be in

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.659 
again if this rounded over he'd be in
trouble<00:05:33.770> so<00:05:35.020> location<00:05:36.020> is<00:05:36.289> kind<00:05:37.280> of<00:05:37.370> tricky

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
trouble so location is kind of tricky

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.420 
trouble so location is kind of tricky
here<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:39.169> other<00:05:39.319> thing<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:39.529> I<00:05:39.650> found<00:05:39.979> is<00:05:40.190> if

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
here the other thing that I found is if

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.550 
here the other thing that I found is if
you<00:05:40.520> drop<00:05:40.819> this<00:05:41.090> it<00:05:41.479> can<00:05:41.630> fall<00:05:41.870> into<00:05:42.199> the<00:05:42.289> frame

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
you drop this it can fall into the frame

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.990 
you drop this it can fall into the frame
that<00:05:42.830> happened<00:05:43.099> to<00:05:43.159> me<00:05:43.279> once<00:05:43.460> before<00:05:43.610> it<00:05:43.940> I

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
that happened to me once before it I

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.519 
that happened to me once before it I
couldn't<00:05:44.270> find<00:05:44.479> it<00:05:44.690> and<00:05:44.810> of<00:05:44.990> course<00:05:45.139> I<00:05:45.380> didn't

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:45.529 
couldn't find it and of course I didn't

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:47.469 
couldn't find it and of course I didn't
have<00:05:45.620> another<00:05:45.770> one<00:05:45.919> with<00:05:46.069> me<00:05:46.219> so<00:05:47.180> when<00:05:47.360> you're

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
have another one with me so when you're

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:48.879 
have another one with me so when you're
ordering<00:05:47.779> parts<00:05:48.199> it<00:05:48.319> might<00:05:48.469> not<00:05:48.620> be<00:05:48.740> a<00:05:48.770> bad

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
ordering parts it might not be a bad

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.290 
ordering parts it might not be a bad
idea<00:05:48.949> to<00:05:49.310> order<00:05:49.639> an<00:05:49.729> extra<00:05:50.000> one<00:05:50.120> of<00:05:50.150> those

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
idea to order an extra one of those

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.290
