 the people 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.600
 goodnight, my calendars, and visited one 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.340
 integral farm that has become 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.650
 seed of peace for the community 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.330
 indigenous that inhabits the stage for 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.099
 this initiative is the municipality of 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.099
 plateaus in the meta department 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.550
 in search of another seed of hope and 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.410
 of peace that germinates in our geography 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.420
 we undertake our journey through 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.690
 municipality of plateaus in the department 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.690
 of the goal 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.650
 We are located in the lane of the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.110
 cominera about 14 km from the urban area 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.480
 of the municipality of plateaus we are going to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.180
 start the ascent to the farm 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.710
 integral of the shelter villa-lucía 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.710
 located on the avenida naranjal 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.670
 a reservation made up of indigenous people 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.440
 countries from Cauca that 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.950
 they came to these lands in search of 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.950
 new horizons 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.720
 a few families come and explore in 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.310
 the metal that alternative to get 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.320
 new lands that are very suitable for 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.650
 their activities and therefore 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.810
 definitely have a good place and 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.610
 invites new families to be 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.770
 join them in this initiative of 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.330
 form an indigenous reservation of the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.450
 community seems in the department of 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.450
 goal 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.370
 little by little they settled in the 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.590
 eastern cordillera in the faults of the 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.840
 páramo of sumapaz with the knowledge and 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.540
 customs of the people nasa the community 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.280
 arrival towards the 70s and 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.350
 begins to organize as a meeting of 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.420
 communal action and subsequently towards 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.940
 the late 80's is already organized as 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.910
 cabildo and later said the decade 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.270
 of the 90 is constituted as shelter and 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.920
 awarded them a piece of land 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.260
 to establish and develop their 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.540
 productive activities in this area 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.150
 through the cultivation of coffee they have maintained 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.130
 an own economy however the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.750
 harvest and quality in the grain has not been 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.820
 a guarantee for your safety 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.280
 food the birds that have the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.650
 suddenly enter by the coffee they 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.930
 they do not have the food security that 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.910
 guarantees a balanced diet and a 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.040
 good nutrition through the program 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.810
 development and peace of the goal led by 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.730
 core of peace with the financing of the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.310
 European Union through the third 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.500
 peace laboratory some leaders of the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.720
 community found the possibility of 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.240
 guarantee their own food and I said the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.650
 proposal to the common 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.900
 and introduce ourselves with a project with the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.150
 peace core accompaniment was formed and 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.370
 trained the production community 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.430
 sustainable tropical agriculture and 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.250
 natural resource management a model 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.560
 that today benefits the 79 families that 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.820
 they make up the shelter by establishing 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.410
 some activities for both livestock and 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.760
 farmers are established some pigs 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.100
 rearing laying hens is established 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.770
 a batch of 30 dairy cows for 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.760
 encourage therefore basically supplying 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.760
 protein to the community 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.730
 and me then some crops that are 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.420
 connected with feeding them in 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.709
 the proposal of the peace laboratory is 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.170
 establish an integral farm where 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.849
 can establish a model for later 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.640
 replicate it in each of the farms 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.800
 as a result 80 percent of the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.410
 families in the community increased 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.790
 your income by 40 percent here 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.209
 this exercise is more than sovereignty 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.580
 food that they are either the 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.769
 feeding is determined is by 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.420
 they do not have external agents and I 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.160
 food security the contribution needs 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.140
 Equal money to go buy food 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.690
 suddenly imported as part of their 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.400
 traditions and work and minga has been 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.299
 essential for the performance of the 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.880
 farm collective work what I said 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.489
 directly in the one that calls the minga of 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.410
 pain through what has been 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.370
 working here 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.470
 and the rules as well and the rule does not 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.170
 they are directly from the territory 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.380
 because among others what it is to respect 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.660
 because the norm created directly the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.150
 own community and approved by the same 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.250
 community the farm has also been a 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.020
 initiative to implement a 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.170
 project environmental responsibility 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.530
 with their water resources what they seek 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.030
 the hydroponic green borage is that with 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.070
 the proper use of water 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.470
 we are generating a process of 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.470
 Water recycling for the same job 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.660
 they make very efficient use of 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.920
 water in terms of there being a 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.900
 recirculation of nutrients and not 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.730
 waste water and that green fodder 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.000
 Hydroponics serves as nutrition for 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.430
 hens pigs for calves the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.040
 hydroponics in this case with corn we 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.380
 contributes up to 80 percent water and 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.410
 up to 50 percent protein for 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.820
 the animals as a result of the project 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.130
 obtained by the ministry of 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.620
 environment and the foundation for tico 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.380
 the prize for the youth protector of 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.110
 water 2011 this award represented him 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.390
 them a few incentives in technology 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.700
 computers some encyclopedias and they are 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.030
 gives a cash prize so that 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.560
 continue with the work of df ph el 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.810
 Hydroponic green forage within 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.060
 center of the farm the project what 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.910
 seeks to make rational use of water 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.230
 as with friendly technologies with 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.110
 environment 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.240
 can we use the water without 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.250
 Need for pollution without need 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.800
 to waste the one integration of 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.270
 the knowledge of them with the application 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.270
 of new technologies 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.050
 the knowledge and customs of the Nasa people 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.169
 they bloom with hope in lands 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.169
 llaneras
