00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.569
 in this video we are going to see how we are going to 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.430
 to be able to examine the use of our battery 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.650
 with the application so good they want 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.950
 know the video and we're going to start with 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.019
 this application that is called widget 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.210
 erbol battery that brings us as it says 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.029
 name widgets and bring us an application 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.070
 and it brings us a notification to be able 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.039
 use it from our notifications 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.259
 as we can see here on the screen like this 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.699
 How good is our team? 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.949
 to open the application as you can see 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.710
 here in me on my home screen I have a 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.710
 he widget 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.540
 is quite a father so that 's what 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.540
 this is all and until next time 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.190
 the application here I have it is this 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.450
 says battery widget flange be here 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.450
 so let's open it 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.260
 good to enter our a circle t with 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.480
 a battery the percentage and a circle 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.100
 it tells us from the bottom as soon as 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.350
 is going to download our equipment the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.960
 battery temperature and the we can 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.900
 see the use of the battery 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.360
 we can see it very quickly we go to the 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.729
 next tab is the history of the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.700
 hour and in the load that has had 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.710
 battery plus some more cycles that we 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.729
 handles here as the statistics of 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.729
 current cycle 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 the charger in disconnected statistics 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.690
 average over the period these these 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.600
 depending on each android 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.250
 the notifications if we want that 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.450
 we have the bar here 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.960
 He disappeared 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.450
 the asset and customize them to 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.799
 just shrink it with your two fingers 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.880
 They do this 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.829
 if they want to enlarge they do this 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.829
 to the girls so it's like that 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.330
 tells us that in the notification that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.850
 we want you to show us in this case I 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.510
 I put him to show us a circle 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.630
 white as in kitkat there you can see it 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.760
 here is this this corner so 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.729
 How good is that to your liking for 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.800
 another one and the white one and it brings the blue ayala 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.390
 change in this case because the rom that 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.300
 bring white and I like the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.880
 white color I put it there that we want 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.610
 that we display on the other part 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.950
 I put that 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.350
 the remaining time of my life 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.290
 battery in this case here is already 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.150
 showing 15 hours 34 minutes and the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.520
 my android temperature for 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.710
 configure or remove this simply you 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.660
 I plugged the option and selected the one 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.120
 you want brings us here several and 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.180
 it brings us several down here 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.549
 for the part below that we want 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.060
 advanced options if we want the 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.709
 graphic of this is great we can 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.420
 shrink and enlarge how many times 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.159
 I want to activate it because it is 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.310
 pretty useful or you can disable it 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:59.050
 from here and now he deactivated it and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.950
 last we can see 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.129
 to energy saving settings 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.180
 we can activate it in night mode 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.709
 configuration of a tour mode is going to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.660
 pay all this we have for the 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.420
 medium although I do not have activated that 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.610
 active and good here if we want to eat 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.470
 fahrenheit degrees and all that so 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.790
 well the application is very complete is 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.519
 question that you check it now 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.870
 that is very very long the application is 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.910
 a three minute video that I am 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.540
 recording today and his video today 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.489
 same so I hope you like this one 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.830
 is everything and until the next android is 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.519
 so they give a like in this video if 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.860
 you liked it and if you want more of this kind 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.459
 of simple fast applications without 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.540
 need root useful and free and 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.220
 this is all 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.560
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.849
 next androids now yes then the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.099
 application will be down here in the 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.720
 free version and the pay version 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.269
 it's also going to be down here but it's 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.190
 obviously they have to buy it now 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.080
