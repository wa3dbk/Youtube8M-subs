00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.979 
animation it pretty much has that slow
animation<00:04:08.500> as<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:08.680> guys<00:04:08.829> saw<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.750> dry

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
animation as you guys saw and the dry

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.289 
animation as you guys saw and the dry
and<00:04:11.019> just<00:04:11.290> shot<00:04:11.500> me<00:04:11.709> with<00:04:11.889> one<00:04:12.190> of<00:04:12.310> his<00:04:12.430> shouts

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
and just shot me with one of his shouts

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.409 
and just shot me with one of his shouts
and<00:04:13.629> interrupted<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.440> animation<00:04:14.949> so<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:16.269> was

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
and interrupted the animation so it was

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.569 
and interrupted the animation so it was
really<00:04:16.599> hard<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.199> kind<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.709> get<00:04:17.859> that<00:04:18.010> off<00:04:18.219> but

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
really hard to kind of get that off but

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.149 
really hard to kind of get that off but
then<00:04:18.789> I<00:04:18.909> just<00:04:19.090> kind<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.359> stuck<00:04:19.719> to<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.799> regular

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
then I just kind of stuck to the regular

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.150 
then I just kind of stuck to the regular
dual<00:04:21.370> casting<00:04:21.820> spell

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
dual casting spell

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.820 
dual casting spell
I<00:04:22.420> don't<00:04:23.420> know<00:04:23.510> really<00:04:24.020> about<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.410> master

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
I don't know really about the master

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.340 
I don't know really about the master
spells<00:04:25.100> but<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:26.090> seems<00:04:26.630> like<00:04:26.810> they're<00:04:27.170> not

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
spells but it seems like they're not

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.160 
spells but it seems like they're not
really<00:04:27.560> worth<00:04:27.920> it<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.550> be<00:04:28.640> honest<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.330> mean

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
really worth it to be honest I mean

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.430 
really worth it to be honest I mean
they're<00:04:30.320> good<00:04:30.760> but<00:04:31.760> you<00:04:32.630> can<00:04:32.840> deal<00:04:33.050> way<00:04:33.260> more

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
they're good but you can deal way more

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.460 
they're good but you can deal way more
damage<00:04:33.860> by<00:04:34.070> just<00:04:34.280> casting<00:04:34.790> duel<00:04:35.470> expert

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
damage by just casting duel expert

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.520 
damage by just casting duel expert
spells<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.160> do<00:04:37.790> way<00:04:37.910> more<00:04:38.060> damage<00:04:38.530> because

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
spells and do way more damage because

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.760 
spells and do way more damage because
one<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.950> cast<00:04:40.220> them<00:04:40.400> faster<00:04:40.850> too<00:04:41.180> um<00:04:41.770> it

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
one you cast them faster too um it

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.320 
one you cast them faster too um it
doesn't<00:04:43.010> go<00:04:43.190> through<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.460> slow<00:04:43.670> animation<00:04:44.180> like

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
doesn't go through a slow animation like

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.900 
doesn't go through a slow animation like
that<00:04:44.950> although<00:04:45.950> it<00:04:46.070> does<00:04:46.220> look<00:04:46.490> pretty<00:04:46.670> cool

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
that although it does look pretty cool

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.900 
that although it does look pretty cool
looking<00:04:48.220> but<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.250> don't<00:04:49.520> know<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.610> that's

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
looking but I don't know that that's

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.970 
looking but I don't know that that's
just<00:04:50.060> my<00:04:50.270> personal<00:04:50.660> preference<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:51.350> really

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
just my personal preference I really

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.730 
just my personal preference I really
don't<00:04:52.100> see<00:04:52.490> how<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.960> other<00:04:53.990> master

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
don't see how the other master

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.500 
don't see how the other master
destruction<00:04:55.460> spells<00:04:55.580> are<00:04:55.880> beneficial

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
destruction spells are beneficial

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.410 
destruction spells are beneficial
because<00:04:56.860> one<00:04:57.860> there<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:58.280> animations<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.180> two

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
because one there so animations and two

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.890 
because one there so animations and two
um<00:05:00.580> if<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.700> enemy<00:05:01.940> gets<00:05:01.970> close<00:05:02.330> enough<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.780> you

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
um if the enemy gets close enough to you

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.590 
um if the enemy gets close enough to you
then<00:05:03.620> you're<00:05:04.130> kind<00:05:04.490> of<00:05:04.610> you're<00:05:05.180> probably

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
then you're kind of you're probably

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.340 
then you're kind of you're probably
gonna<00:05:05.780> die<00:05:05.870> more<00:05:06.710> unlikely<00:05:08.050> so<00:05:09.050> I'm<00:05:09.170> just

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
gonna die more unlikely so I'm just

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.220 
gonna die more unlikely so I'm just
really<00:05:09.620> healing<00:05:09.800> myself<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:11.210> really<00:05:12.080> what's

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
really healing myself the really what's

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.530 
really healing myself the really what's
hurting<00:05:12.440> me<00:05:12.620> is<00:05:12.830> just<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.310> shout<00:05:13.610> their<00:05:14.240> breath

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540
