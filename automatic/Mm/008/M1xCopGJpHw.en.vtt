00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.080 

since<00:00:14.259> November<00:00:14.799> I<00:00:14.980> looked<00:00:15.580> at<00:00:15.730> these<00:00:15.879> images

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
since November I looked at these images

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.170 
since November I looked at these images
quite<00:00:16.840> off<00:00:17.079> that<00:00:17.289> so<00:00:17.680> why<00:00:18.489> is<00:00:18.520> it<00:00:18.699> so<00:00:18.939> difficult

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
quite off that so why is it so difficult

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.960 
quite off that so why is it so difficult
to<00:00:19.509> communicate<00:00:19.810> my<00:00:20.289> feeling<00:00:20.710> now<00:00:21.669> we<00:00:21.730> know

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
to communicate my feeling now we know

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.790 
to communicate my feeling now we know
the<00:00:22.180> results<00:00:22.300> of<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.869> first<00:00:22.900> measurements<00:00:23.650> on

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
the results of the first measurements on

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.700 
the results of the first measurements on
the<00:00:23.949> comet<00:00:24.279> but<00:00:24.969> one<00:00:25.149> we<00:00:25.300> do<00:00:25.419> not<00:00:25.570> know<00:00:25.779> is<00:00:26.020> what

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
the comet but one we do not know is what

00:00:26.710 --> 00:01:17.110 
the comet but one we do not know is what
happened<00:00:27.099> to<00:00:27.250> feeling

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.220 

on<00:01:18.120> the<00:01:18.240> comment<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.180> saw<00:01:21.480> also<00:01:22.020> at<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
on the comment so we saw also at the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.010 
on the comment so we saw also at the
same<00:01:22.260> time<00:01:22.800> that<00:01:23.400> filia<00:01:24.150> was<00:01:24.300> still<00:01:24.510> rotating

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
same time that filia was still rotating

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.460 
same time that filia was still rotating
and<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.160> could<00:01:26.340> only<00:01:26.490> mean<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.320> were

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and this could only mean that we were

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.210 
and this could only mean that we were
flying<00:01:28.740> everywhere<00:01:31.100> there<00:01:32.100> were

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
flying everywhere there were

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.920 
flying everywhere there were
celebrations<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.479> about<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
celebrations on going about the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.410 
celebrations on going about the
successful<00:01:34.380> landing<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.760> at<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.030> same<00:01:36.210> time

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
successful landing but at the same time

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.359 
successful landing but at the same time
we<00:01:36.600> knew<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.440> landing<00:01:37.860> could<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.190> been

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
we knew that the landing could have been

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.420 
we knew that the landing could have been
just<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.700> touchdown<00:01:39.210> touch<00:01:39.720> n<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.710> looks<00:01:40.979> as

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
just a touchdown touch n go it looks as

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.190 
just a touchdown touch n go it looks as
if<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.880> angles<00:01:42.530> in<00:01:43.530> short<00:01:44.720> what<00:01:45.720> actually

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
if the angles in short what actually

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.500 
if the angles in short what actually
happened<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.130> bounced<00:01:47.760> off<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
happened is that we bounced off the

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.920 
happened is that we bounced off the
surface<00:01:48.930> again<00:01:49.580> we<00:01:50.580> jumped<00:01:51.030> quite<00:01:51.540> far

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
surface again we jumped quite far

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.200 
surface again we jumped quite far
approximately<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> kilometer<00:01:53.640> kilometer<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
approximately a kilometer kilometer and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.260 
approximately a kilometer kilometer and
a<00:01:54.270> half<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.280> what<00:01:56.280> went<00:01:56.460> through<00:01:56.729> my<00:01:56.790> head<00:01:56.910> at

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a half and what went through my head at

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.120 
a half and what went through my head at
that<00:01:57.300> moment<00:01:57.660> was<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.770> we<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.880> no<00:02:00.180> way<00:02:01.130> to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that moment was that we have no way to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.910 
that moment was that we have no way to
verify<00:02:02.160> if<00:02:02.759> we're<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.750> come<00:02:04.649> back<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
verify if we're going to come back to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.880 
verify if we're going to come back to
the<00:02:05.160> Comets<00:02:05.580> surface<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:06.240> ever<00:02:06.780> flying<00:02:07.410> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the Comets surface or ever flying and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.160 
the Comets surface or ever flying and
we're<00:02:08.450> flying<00:02:09.450> away<00:02:10.100> so<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:11.280> was<00:02:11.460> a<00:02:12.050> it's<00:02:13.050> a

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
we're flying away so this was a it's a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.500 
we're flying away so this was a it's a
very<00:02:13.380> worrisome<00:02:14.070> moment<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.730> two<00:02:14.880> hours<00:02:15.270> where

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
very worrisome moment of two hours where

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.620 
very worrisome moment of two hours where
we<00:02:15.540> simply<00:02:16.200> had<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.470> wait<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.480> say

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
we simply had to wait and and and say

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.550 
we simply had to wait and and and say
hope

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.619 

we<00:02:26.560> were<00:02:26.709> very<00:02:26.860> lucky<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.370> we<00:02:27.730> did<00:02:27.910> not<00:02:28.150> jump

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
we were very lucky that we did not jump

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.369 
we were very lucky that we did not jump
back<00:02:29.019> into<00:02:29.349> deep<00:02:29.920> space<00:02:30.510> during<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.810> lender

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
back into deep space during the lender

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.190 
back into deep space during the lender
control<00:02:32.739> center<00:02:33.160> we<00:02:33.400> realized<00:02:34.200> approximately

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
control center we realized approximately

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.650 
control center we realized approximately
two<00:02:35.620> hours<00:02:35.800> after<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.700> first<00:02:36.940> touchdown<00:02:37.239> at

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
two hours after the first touchdown at

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.440 
two hours after the first touchdown at
the<00:02:37.690> land<00:02:37.959> landed<00:02:38.890> again<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.430> was<00:02:39.760> standing

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the land landed again and was standing

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.330 
the land landed again and was standing
on<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.780> comet<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.510> these<00:02:43.660> hours

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
on the comet so in these hours

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.250 
on the comet so in these hours

soft as people were expecting beforehand
for<00:03:41.180> example<00:03:41.629> the<00:03:41.720> Potala<00:03:42.049> me<00:03:42.230> team<00:03:42.470> was

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
for example the Potala me team was

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.949 
for example the Potala me team was
overly<00:03:43.549> excited<00:03:44.120> about<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.540> successful

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
overly excited about the successful

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.869 
overly excited about the successful
measurement<00:03:45.680> where<00:03:45.799> they<00:03:45.980> wouldn't<00:03:46.730> double

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
measurement where they wouldn't double

the<00:03:47.239> signs<00:03:47.480> outcome<00:03:48.049> of<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.379> instrument<00:03:49.010> in

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
the signs outcome of the instrument in

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.210 
the signs outcome of the instrument in
his<00:03:49.400> last<00:03:49.609> hours<00:03:53.140> so<00:03:54.140> this<00:03:54.319> all<00:03:54.530> added<00:03:54.859> to

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
his last hours so this all added to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.309 
his last hours so this all added to
their<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:56.150> atmosphere<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.840> was<00:03:57.019> here<00:03:57.200> in

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
their the atmosphere that was here in

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.470 
their the atmosphere that was here in
the<00:03:57.379> control<00:03:57.769> room<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:58.280> actually<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.299> best

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
the control room and actually the best

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.690 
the control room and actually the best
moment<00:03:59.930> was<00:03:59.989> on<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.590> friday<00:04:00.829> night<00:04:01.099> when<00:04:01.489> we

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
moment was on the friday night when we

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.270 
moment was on the friday night when we
were<00:04:02.450> here<00:04:02.750> with<00:04:02.959> all<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.349> all<00:04:04.250> the

were here with all the all the

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.039 
were here with all the all the
scientists<00:04:04.849> were<00:04:04.970> still<00:04:05.269> there<00:04:05.299> all<00:04:05.720> the

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
scientists were still there all the

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.050 
scientists were still there all the
cameras<00:04:06.410> were<00:04:06.590> gone<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.579> it<00:04:07.700> was<00:04:07.849> quite

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
cameras were gone so it was quite

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.390 
cameras were gone so it was quite
intimate<00:04:08.870> science<00:04:10.239> facts<00:04:11.239> today<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.200> we<00:04:13.190> saw

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
intimate science facts today and we saw

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.190 
intimate science facts today and we saw
during<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.940> very<00:04:14.150> last<00:04:14.389> communication<00:04:14.959> of

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
during the very last communication of

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.930 
during the very last communication of
fillet<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.829> the<00:04:15.950> voltage<00:04:16.130> was<00:04:16.519> decreasing

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
fillet that the voltage was decreasing

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.690 
fillet that the voltage was decreasing
and<00:04:17.209> decreasing<00:04:17.329> so<00:04:18.109> we<00:04:18.229> knew<00:04:18.410> that<00:04:18.700> okay

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
and decreasing so we knew that okay

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.089 
and decreasing so we knew that okay
we've<00:04:19.880> done<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.120> job<00:04:20.510> we've<00:04:21.320> made<00:04:21.590> everybody

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.120 
after seven months in the bambor it was
taken<00:05:46.370> to<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:46.900> 67p<00:05:47.900> comet<00:05:48.320> by<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:48.590> Rosetta

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
taken to the 67p comet by the Rosetta

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.580 
taken to the 67p comet by the Rosetta
spacecraft<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:49.850> then<00:05:50.180> lost<00:05:50.780> contact<00:05:51.380> with

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
spacecraft and then lost contact with

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.250 
spacecraft and then lost contact with
earth<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:52.180> today<00:05:53.180> it<00:05:53.480> said<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.780> first

earth and today it said the first
greetings<00:05:55.010> which<00:05:55.370> have<00:05:55.610> been<00:05:55.790> put<00:05:56.120> on<00:05:56.270> the

greetings which have been put on the
Landers<00:05:57.020> very<00:05:57.290> own<00:05:57.500> Twitter<00:05:57.860> page<00:05:58.130> mission

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
Landers very own Twitter page mission

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.790 
Landers very own Twitter page mission
will<00:05:59.000> provide<00:05:59.300> understanding<00:05:59.990> of<00:06:00.110> how<00:06:00.410> the

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
will provide understanding of how the

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.360 
will provide understanding of how the
earth<00:06:01.100> was<00:06:01.250> formed<00:06:01.730> and<00:06:01.880> the<00:06:02.330> origins<00:06:02.660> of<00:06:02.750> life

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.850 

we<00:06:07.940> establish<00:06:08.570> contact<00:06:09.020> but<00:06:09.169> unfortunately

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
we establish contact but unfortunately

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.060 
we establish contact but unfortunately
the<00:06:09.979> contact<00:06:10.430> was<00:06:10.639> not<00:06:10.970> very<00:06:11.630> reliable<00:06:12.260> so

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
the contact was not very reliable so

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.129 
the contact was not very reliable so
trying<00:06:13.430> to<00:06:13.639> put<00:06:13.820> together<00:06:13.940> the<00:06:14.750> different

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
trying to put together the different

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:16.810 
trying to put together the different
pieces<00:06:15.590> of<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:15.979> puzzle<00:06:16.160> we<00:06:16.460> have<00:06:16.580> on<00:06:16.729> our

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
pieces of the puzzle we have on our

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.000 
pieces of the puzzle we have on our
table<00:06:17.300> to<00:06:17.479> improve<00:06:17.840> the<00:06:17.990> contact<00:06:18.440> with<00:06:18.620> filet

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
table to improve the contact with filet

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.010 
table to improve the contact with filet
so<00:06:19.430> what<00:06:19.610> I'm<00:06:19.729> hoping<00:06:19.910> for<00:06:20.120> at<00:06:20.419> the<00:06:20.540> moment<00:06:20.960> is

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
so what I'm hoping for at the moment is

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.250 
so what I'm hoping for at the moment is
of<00:06:21.169> course<00:06:21.380> that<00:06:21.680> we<00:06:21.889> can<00:06:22.160> reestablish

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
of course that we can reestablish

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.810 
of course that we can reestablish
regular<00:06:24.260> and<00:06:24.410> predictable<00:06:24.639> contacts<00:06:25.639> with

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
regular and predictable contacts with

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.850 
regular and predictable contacts with
feel<00:06:26.060> a<00:06:26.210> longer<00:06:26.690> duration<00:06:26.810> contact<00:06:27.620> so<00:06:27.830> that

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
feel a longer duration contact so that

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.860 
feel a longer duration contact so that
we<00:06:28.160> can<00:06:28.400> restart<00:06:29.060> the<00:06:29.270> scientific

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
we can restart the scientific

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.510 
we can restart the scientific
measurements<00:06:30.470> switch<00:06:30.889> on<00:06:31.100> all<00:06:31.310> the

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
measurements switch on all the

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.879 
measurements switch on all the
instruments<00:06:32.180> what<00:06:33.020> I<00:06:33.050> very<00:06:33.380> much<00:06:33.470> would<00:06:33.830> like

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
instruments what I very much would like

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.820 
instruments what I very much would like
to<00:06:34.160> see<00:06:34.340> is<00:06:34.520> a<00:06:34.550> nice<00:06:34.900> panorama<00:06:35.900> image<00:06:36.139> to<00:06:36.590> show

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
to see is a nice panorama image to show

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.800 
to see is a nice panorama image to show
how<00:06:37.220> the<00:06:37.250> comet<00:06:37.729> change<00:06:38.000> in<00:06:38.300> all<00:06:38.419> these<00:06:38.540> months

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
how the comet change in all these months

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.550 
how the comet change in all these months
of<00:06:39.699> course<00:06:40.699> we<00:06:40.910> do<00:06:41.030> not<00:06:41.150> know<00:06:41.389> precisely<00:06:41.900> how

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
of course we do not know precisely how

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.800 
of course we do not know precisely how
many<00:06:42.800> energy<00:06:43.580> we<00:06:43.729> will<00:06:43.880> have<00:06:44.030> available<00:06:44.510> to<00:06:44.660> do

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
many energy we will have available to do

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.110 
many energy we will have available to do
science<00:06:45.110> could<00:06:45.919> also<00:06:46.130> be<00:06:46.340> that<00:06:46.370> we<00:06:46.639> never<00:06:46.850> ever

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
science could also be that we never ever

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.939 
science could also be that we never ever
hear<00:06:47.539> anything<00:06:47.780> from<00:06:47.990> feel<00:06:48.229> anymore<00:06:48.500> but<00:06:48.800> this

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
hear anything from feel anymore but this

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:57.129 
hear anything from feel anymore but this
is<00:06:49.130> what<00:06:49.430> we're<00:06:49.610> all<00:06:49.760> waiting<00:06:50.180> for

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.159 

progression<00:06:57.860> is<00:06:57.979> based<00:06:58.310> on<00:06:58.550> picking

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169 
progression is based on picking

and<00:07:04.210> if<00:07:04.390> you<00:07:04.540> wish<00:07:04.810> to<00:07:05.050> innovate<00:07:05.440> you<00:07:06.250> have<00:07:06.400> to

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
and if you wish to innovate you have to

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.440 
and if you wish to innovate you have to
take<00:07:06.730> risks<00:07:07.650> so<00:07:08.650> risk<00:07:08.980> these<00:07:09.400> are<00:07:09.580> also<00:07:09.820> daily

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:10.450 
take risks so risk these are also daily
