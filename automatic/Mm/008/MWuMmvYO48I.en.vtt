home I live in Michigan where it gets
kind<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.330> cold<00:00:09.480> nice<00:00:09.809> part<00:00:10.080> about<00:00:10.139> hooks<00:00:10.620> into

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:10.799 
kind of cold nice part about hooks into

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:12.650 
kind of cold nice part about hooks into
your<00:00:10.920> hot<00:00:11.099> air<00:00:11.339> vents<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:12.059> way<00:00:12.330> better<00:00:12.540> than

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
your hot air vents it's way better than

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.150 
your hot air vents it's way better than
like<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> wood<00:00:13.139> stove<00:00:13.379> just<00:00:13.589> for<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.889> fact

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
like a wood stove just for that fact

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.199 
like a wood stove just for that fact
right<00:00:14.339> there<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.610> runs<00:00:14.759> through<00:00:14.879> all<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> hot

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
right there it runs through all the hot

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.710 
right there it runs through all the hot
air<00:00:15.240> vents<00:00:15.629> in<00:00:15.750> my<00:00:15.870> home<00:00:16.460> it<00:00:17.460> also<00:00:17.640> has<00:00:18.360> a<00:00:18.390> cold

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
air vents in my home it also has a cold

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.160 
air vents in my home it also has a cold
air<00:00:18.900> return<00:00:19.580> for<00:00:20.580> efficient<00:00:21.510> circulation<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
air return for efficient circulation of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.570 
air return for efficient circulation of
the<00:00:22.230> air<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.830> when<00:00:22.950> you're<00:00:23.070> pushing<00:00:23.220> air<00:00:23.430> in

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the air so when you're pushing air in

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.920 
the air so when you're pushing air in
you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.850> pull<00:00:24.030> it<00:00:24.120> out<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.600> basically

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
you can pull it out so it's basically

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.350 
you can pull it out so it's basically
just<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.260> running<00:00:25.590> your<00:00:25.710> gas<00:00:25.950> furnace<00:00:26.430> stuff

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
just like running your gas furnace stuff

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.640 
just like running your gas furnace stuff
that<00:00:27.510> you're<00:00:27.630> running<00:00:27.750> would<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.530> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
that you're running would have the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.620 
that you're running would have the
filter<00:00:28.980> box<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> back

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
filter box in the back

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.209 
filter box in the back
burns<00:00:31.140> cold<00:00:31.579> corn<00:00:32.629> wood<00:00:33.629> it's<00:00:34.019> very<00:00:34.649> efficient

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
burns cold corn wood it's very efficient

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.110 
burns cold corn wood it's very efficient
system<00:00:35.370> very<00:00:36.089> efficient<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.920> can<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.100> 14<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> 16

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
system very efficient I can get 14 to 16

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.840 
system very efficient I can get 14 to 16
our<00:00:39.390> birds<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.839> of<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.050> no<00:00:40.140> problem<00:00:40.649> has<00:00:41.640> an

you got your flue damper here and out

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.120 
you got your flue damper here and out
for<00:01:05.489> control<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.180> leave<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.450> closed<00:01:06.720> I

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
for control I just leave it closed I

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.400 
for control I just leave it closed I
just<00:01:08.130> run<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> manual<00:01:08.850> air<00:01:09.810> control<00:01:10.260> down

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
just run the manual air control down

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.650 
just run the manual air control down
here<00:01:10.680> they<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.390> electronic<00:01:12.390> ones<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
here they have the electronic ones you

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.400 
here they have the electronic ones you
can<00:01:12.810> hook<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.260> your<00:01:14.210> thermostat<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.510> those

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
can hook up to your thermostat but those

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.110 
can hook up to your thermostat but those
seem<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> burn<00:01:17.040> more<00:01:17.280> wood<00:01:17.550> and<00:01:17.790> create<00:01:18.030> more

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
seem to burn more wood and create more

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.480 
seem to burn more wood and create more
creosote<00:01:18.690> so<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.170> figured<00:01:19.470> out<00:01:19.620> after<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
creosote so I just figured out after a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.340 
creosote so I just figured out after a
little<00:01:20.640> bit<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.940> use<00:01:21.090> where<00:01:21.510> to<00:01:21.600> set<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.050> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
little bit of use where to set this and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.070 
little bit of use where to set this and
it's<00:01:22.470> been<00:01:22.830> very<00:01:22.890> efficient<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.670> me<00:01:23.730> I<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.990> not

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it's been very efficient for me I do not

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's been very efficient for me I do not
use<00:01:25.440> my<00:01:25.650> furnace<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.220> all<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.300> I<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.540> use

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
use my furnace at all at all I don't use

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.880 
use my furnace at all at all I don't use
the<00:01:27.900> blower<00:01:28.110> anything<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.710> has<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the blower anything that has a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.970 
the blower anything that has a
sufficient<00:01:29.430> blower<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.760> it<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:31.680> only<00:01:31.830> thing

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
sufficient blower on it the only thing

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.070 
sufficient blower on it the only thing
that<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.310> use<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.880> my<00:01:33.210> gas<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:33.990> is

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
that I use this for my gas one is for is

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.210 
that I use this for my gas one is for is
if<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.290> could<00:01:34.380> happen<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> go<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.800> of<00:01:34.830> town<00:01:34.920> or

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
if we could happen to go out of town or

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.910 
if we could happen to go out of town or
something<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.550> might<00:01:35.700> kick<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:37.500> very

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
something I might kick it on a very
