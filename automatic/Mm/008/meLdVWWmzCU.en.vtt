splashing through the wooden boats but

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.450 
splashing through the wooden boats but
whatever<00:01:24.259> it's<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.380> cool<00:01:25.680> how<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.040> steam

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
whatever it's really cool how the steam

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 
whatever it's really cool how the steam
comes<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.540> ships<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> everything

comes out of the ships and everything

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.030

and<00:01:29.780> right<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.800> I<00:01:31.830> was

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and right here you can see that I was

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.520 
and right here you can see that I was
getting<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.399> little<00:01:32.550> jumpy<00:01:32.940> with<00:01:33.360> my<00:01:33.570> general<00:01:34.380> i

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
getting a little jumpy with my general i

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.290 
getting a little jumpy with my general i
was<00:01:34.649> actually<00:01:34.860> slowing<00:01:35.340> down<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.820> gun<00:01:36.030> boats

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
was actually slowing down the gun boats

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.940 
was actually slowing down the gun boats
on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.540> torpedo<00:01:37.020> boats<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.800> they

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
on the torpedo boats so that they

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.340 
on the torpedo boats so that they
weren't<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:39.060> they<00:01:39.210> were<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.539> at<00:01:39.690> slow<00:01:39.990> speed

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
weren't or they were going at slow speed

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.430 
weren't or they were going at slow speed
because<00:01:41.280> i<00:01:41.610> thought<00:01:41.820> my<00:01:42.570> general<00:01:42.990> was<00:01:43.140> going

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
because i thought my general was going

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.580 
because i thought my general was going
to<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:43.850> there<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> lot<00:01:45.270> later<00:01:46.020> than<00:01:46.110> they<00:01:46.380> were

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to get there a lot later than they were

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
to get there a lot later than they were
but<00:01:46.830> i<00:01:47.130> wasn't<00:01:47.789> paying<00:01:47.940> attention<00:01:48.149> i<00:01:48.600> was

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
but i wasn't paying attention i was

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.029 
but i wasn't paying attention i was
looking<00:01:49.050> at<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.289> boats<00:01:49.500> because<00:01:49.770> they're<00:01:49.950> all

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
looking at the boats because they're all

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.290 
looking at the boats because they're all
shiny<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.869> that<00:01:51.869> really<00:01:52.020> distracts<00:01:52.590> me<00:01:53.300> you

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
shiny and that really distracts me you

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.419 
shiny and that really distracts me you
can<00:01:54.450> already<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:54.990> i'm<00:01:55.560> firing<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.310> my

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
can already see that i'm firing and my

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.080 
can already see that i'm firing and my
enemy<00:01:56.820> fired<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.300> little<00:01:57.509> bit<00:01:57.660> ago<00:01:57.780> i<00:01:58.170> saw<00:01:59.090> so

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
enemy fired a little bit ago i saw so

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.540 
enemy fired a little bit ago i saw so
it's<00:02:01.050> not<00:02:01.200> really<00:02:01.350> good<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.369> my

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
it's not really good that I have my

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.980 
it's not really good that I have my
general<00:02:03.030> up<00:02:03.179> in<00:02:03.300> this<00:02:03.420> front-line<00:02:03.929> position

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
general up in this front-line position

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.509 
general up in this front-line position
so<00:02:07.160> definitely<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.280> mistake<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.850> my<00:02:08.880> partner

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
so definitely a mistake on my partner

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.729 
so definitely a mistake on my partner
though<00:02:11.540> technically<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.660> am<00:02:12.780> firing<00:02:13.200> back<00:02:13.530> in

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
didn't make a lot of sense because I

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.320 
didn't make a lot of sense because I
fired<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.260> torpedo<00:04:51.410> off<00:04:51.980> and<00:04:52.280> it<00:04:52.610> just<00:04:52.850> went<00:04:53.060> in

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
fired a torpedo off and it just went in

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.200 
fired a torpedo off and it just went in
one<00:04:53.810> side<00:04:53.840> of<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.290> wreckage<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:54.980> out<00:04:55.970> the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
one side of the wreckage and out the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.590 
one side of the wreckage and out the
other<00:04:57.220> well<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.340> can<00:04:58.490> see<00:04:58.700> I<00:04:58.730> have<00:04:58.880> plenty<00:04:59.570> of

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
other well you can see I have plenty of

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.630 
other well you can see I have plenty of
4p<00:05:00.140> toes<00:05:00.320> that<00:05:00.530> are<00:05:00.590> just<00:05:00.890> going<00:05:01.190> every<00:05:01.490> which

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
4p toes that are just going every which

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.870 
4p toes that are just going every which
way<00:05:01.700> here<00:05:02.680> just<00:05:03.680> trying<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.280> annihilate<00:05:04.850> a

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
way here just trying to annihilate a

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.820 
way here just trying to annihilate a
ship's<00:05:05.270> he's<00:05:05.510> only<00:05:05.690> got<00:05:05.930> two<00:05:06.170> and<00:05:06.380> I<00:05:06.440> got<00:05:06.650> about

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
ship's he's only got two and I got about

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.740 
ship's he's only got two and I got about
three<00:05:07.160> ships<00:05:07.460> right<00:05:07.670> now<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:09.590> right<00:05:09.830> here

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
three ships right now and right here

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.580 
three ships right now and right here
that's<00:05:11.750> a<00:05:11.930> successful<00:05:12.350> hit<00:05:12.740> no<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.970> didn't

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
that's a successful hit no it didn't

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.710 
that's a successful hit no it didn't
destroy<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.770> ship<00:05:15.830> it's<00:05:16.340> still<00:05:16.610> hit<00:05:16.850> which<00:05:17.540> is

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
destroy the ship it's still hit which is

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.540 
destroy the ship it's still hit which is
a<00:05:17.750> huge<00:05:18.170> demoralise<00:05:18.800> ER<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.010> you<00:05:19.100> can<00:05:19.250> see<00:05:19.430> all

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
a huge demoralise ER and you can see all

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.730 
a huge demoralise ER and you can see all
of<00:05:19.580> these<00:05:19.880> people<00:05:20.150> went<00:05:20.510> flying<00:05:20.930> off<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:21.500> ship

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
of these people went flying off the ship

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.910 
of these people went flying off the ship
I<00:05:22.210> don't<00:05:23.210> know<00:05:23.510> how<00:05:23.810> they're<00:05:24.320> all<00:05:24.560> still<00:05:24.860> alive

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
I don't know how they're all still alive

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.700 
I don't know how they're all still alive
if<00:05:25.400> they<00:05:25.580> were<00:05:25.820> just<00:05:26.090> an<00:05:26.300> explosion<00:05:26.930> but

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
if they were just an explosion but

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.580 
if they were just an explosion but
apparently<00:05:28.340> they<00:05:28.460> were<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:29.230> you<00:05:30.230> can<00:05:30.380> see<00:05:30.560> I

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
apparently they were and you can see I

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.590 
apparently they were and you can see I
just<00:05:30.740> lost<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.640> torpedo<00:05:31.940> boat<00:05:32.420> and

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
just lost that torpedo boat and

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.630 
just lost that torpedo boat and
technically<00:05:33.170> that<00:05:33.410> was<00:05:33.500> both<00:05:33.740> torpedo<00:05:34.310> boats

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
technically that was both torpedo boats

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.570 
technically that was both torpedo boats
so<00:05:35.480> unfortunately<00:05:36.140> that's<00:05:36.800> all<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.010> torpedo

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
so unfortunately that's all the torpedo

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.600 
so unfortunately that's all the torpedo
action<00:05:38.000> we<00:05:38.120> get<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.420> see<00:05:38.630> in<00:05:38.810> this<00:05:38.960> battle<00:05:39.380> but

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
action we get to see in this battle but

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.220 
action we get to see in this battle but
you<00:05:40.610> can<00:05:40.760> see<00:05:40.970> that<00:05:41.150> that<00:05:41.180> ship<00:05:41.630> caught<00:05:41.900> fire

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
you can see that that ship caught fire

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.200 
you can see that that ship caught fire
from<00:05:42.260> the<00:05:42.650> torpedo<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:45.280> it's<00:05:46.280> his<00:05:46.669> general

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
from the torpedo and it's his general

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.560 
from the torpedo and it's his general
versus<00:05:47.780> my<00:05:48.140> general<00:05:48.620> and<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:49.160> gunboat<00:05:49.640> which

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
versus my general and the gunboat which

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.990 
versus my general and the gunboat which
my<00:05:50.900> general<00:05:51.320> you<00:05:51.440> can<00:05:51.620> see<00:05:51.890> has<00:05:52.700> been

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
my general you can see has been

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.690 
my general you can see has been
extraordinarily<00:05:53.840> damaged<00:05:54.800> it's<00:05:55.040> yellow<00:05:55.520> on

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
extraordinarily damaged it's yellow on

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.800 
extraordinarily damaged it's yellow on
both<00:05:55.940> sides<00:05:56.300> and<00:05:57.610> you<00:05:58.610> can<00:05:58.760> see<00:05:58.970> that<00:05:59.000> yeah<00:05:59.540> it

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
both sides and you can see that yeah it

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.270 
both sides and you can see that yeah it
is<00:06:00.280> quite<00:06:01.280> damaged<00:06:02.260> when<00:06:03.260> i<00:06:03.320> zoom<00:06:03.440> up<00:06:03.890> to<00:06:04.100> it

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
is quite damaged when i zoom up to it

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.550 
is quite damaged when i zoom up to it
there's<00:06:04.760> lots<00:06:05.090> of<00:06:05.360> cracks<00:06:05.630> in<00:06:05.960> the<00:06:06.140> hole<00:06:06.320> and

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
there's lots of cracks in the hole and

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.480 
there's lots of cracks in the hole and
whatnot<00:06:06.980> so<00:06:08.260> definitely<00:06:09.260> need<00:06:09.800> to<00:06:10.040> get<00:06:10.280> some

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
whatnot so definitely need to get some

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.550 
whatnot so definitely need to get some
repairs<00:06:10.880> when<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.180> get<00:06:11.450> back<00:06:11.570> to<00:06:11.810> port<00:06:12.080> later<00:06:12.320> if

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
repairs when I get back to port later if

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.550 
repairs when I get back to port later if
that<00:06:12.770> ship<00:06:13.070> makes<00:06:13.310> it<00:06:13.490> out

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
that ship makes it out

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.650 
that ship makes it out
but<00:06:16.460> right<00:06:16.700> now<00:06:16.850> you<00:06:16.910> can<00:06:17.180> see<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.540> enemy

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
but right now you can see the enemy

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.350 
but right now you can see the enemy
general<00:06:18.260> is<00:06:18.410> wavering<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:21.910> he's<00:06:22.910> trying<00:06:23.270> to

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
general is wavering and he's trying to

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.930 
general is wavering and he's trying to
make<00:06:23.450> his<00:06:23.780> shift<00:06:24.110> come<00:06:24.380> around<00:06:24.650> in<00:06:25.190> range<00:06:25.669> to

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
make his shift come around in range to

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.600 
make his shift come around in range to
where<00:06:26.060> he<00:06:26.240> can<00:06:26.360> get<00:06:26.540> his<00:06:27.040> Gatling<00:06:28.040> guns<00:06:28.280> fired

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
where he can get his Gatling guns fired

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.550 
where he can get his Gatling guns fired
or<00:06:28.820> at<00:06:28.940> least<00:06:29.120> that's<00:06:29.330> what<00:06:29.510> i<00:06:29.540> think<00:06:29.660> is<00:06:30.230> plan

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
or at least that's what i think is plan

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.220 
or at least that's what i think is plan
once<00:06:30.860> he<00:06:31.790> could<00:06:32.000> have<00:06:32.120> been<00:06:32.330> getting<00:06:32.990> closer

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
once he could have been getting closer

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.780 
once he could have been getting closer
to<00:06:33.350> my<00:06:33.530> general<00:06:33.919> so<00:06:34.100> that<00:06:34.220> he<00:06:34.280> could<00:06:34.430> get<00:06:34.550> into

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
to my general so that he could get into

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.210 
to my general so that he could get into
ramming<00:06:35.180> position<00:06:35.660> but<00:06:36.590> one<00:06:36.770> thing<00:06:36.950> that<00:06:36.980> i

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
ramming position but one thing that i

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.460 
ramming position but one thing that i
did<00:06:37.280> notice<00:06:37.820> is<00:06:38.150> that<00:06:38.180> he<00:06:38.660> didn't<00:06:39.080> take<00:06:39.230> out

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
did notice is that he didn't take out

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.290 
did notice is that he didn't take out
this<00:06:39.650> gun<00:06:39.919> boat<00:06:40.190> which<00:06:40.400> would<00:06:40.790> have<00:06:40.910> probably

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
this gun boat which would have probably

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.150 
this gun boat which would have probably
wanted<00:06:41.870> for<00:06:42.110> him<00:06:42.260> i'm<00:06:42.380> not<00:06:42.680> sure<00:06:43.040> exactly

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
wanted for him i'm not sure exactly

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.940 
wanted for him i'm not sure exactly
because<00:06:43.730> he<00:06:44.480> was<00:06:44.630> fairly<00:06:44.930> be<00:06:45.169> motivated<00:06:45.740> but

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
because he was fairly be motivated but

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.420 
because he was fairly be motivated but
that's<00:06:46.940> the<00:06:47.210> end<00:06:47.330> of<00:06:47.480> the<00:06:47.570> battle<00:06:47.810> so<00:06:48.430> let's

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
that's the end of the battle so let's

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.000 
that's the end of the battle so let's
take<00:06:49.639> a<00:06:49.700> look<00:06:49.940> at<00:06:50.030> the<00:06:50.180> stat<00:06:50.450> now<00:06:51.440> as<00:06:51.500> you<00:06:51.889> can

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
take a look at the stat now as you can

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.670 
take a look at the stat now as you can
see<00:06:52.070> what<00:06:52.430> the<00:06:52.580> stats<00:06:52.910> i<00:06:53.300> deployed<00:06:53.930> five<00:06:54.290> more

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
see what the stats i deployed five more

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.100 
see what the stats i deployed five more
but<00:06:55.040> a<00:06:55.250> little<00:06:55.550> bit<00:06:55.700> less<00:06:55.910> crew<00:06:56.540> on<00:06:56.720> all<00:06:56.960> of

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
but a little bit less crew on all of

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.930 
but a little bit less crew on all of
them<00:06:57.229> overall<00:06:58.040> and<00:06:58.280> he<00:06:58.940> deployed<00:06:59.360> four<00:07:00.940> losses

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
them overall and he deployed four losses

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.900 
them overall and he deployed four losses
were<00:07:02.419> at<00:07:02.630> 44<00:07:03.320> and<00:07:03.590> enemies<00:07:03.919> killed<00:07:04.220> and<00:07:04.580> says

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910 
were at 44 and enemies killed and says

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.629 
were at 44 and enemies killed and says
only<00:07:05.240> about<00:07:05.600> 29<00:07:06.229> enemies<00:07:06.740> killed<00:07:07.040> but<00:07:07.430> no

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 
only about 29 enemies killed but no

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.350 
only about 29 enemies killed but no
honesty<00:07:08.240> looking<00:07:09.200> at<00:07:09.350> his<00:07:09.560> losses<00:07:09.889> and

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
honesty looking at his losses and

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.280 
honesty looking at his losses and
whatnot<00:07:11.360> you<00:07:11.510> have<00:07:11.630> to<00:07:11.810> take<00:07:11.990> the

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
whatnot you have to take the

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.129 
whatnot you have to take the
consideration<00:07:13.100> that<00:07:13.479> most<00:07:14.479> of<00:07:14.660> those<00:07:14.810> losses

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:15.139 
consideration that most of those losses

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:18.730 
consideration that most of those losses
were<00:07:15.710> due<00:07:15.919> to<00:07:16.190> mend<00:07:16.520> rounding<00:07:17.120> so<00:07:18.050> in

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740 
were due to mend rounding so in

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.130 
were due to mend rounding so in
comparison<00:07:19.040> to<00:07:19.700> OC<00:07:20.090> so<00:07:20.240> you<00:07:20.330> can<00:07:20.510> definitely

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
comparison to OC so you can definitely

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.460 
comparison to OC so you can definitely
see<00:07:21.380> that<00:07:21.410> i<00:07:21.620> took<00:07:21.890> a<00:07:21.919> lot<00:07:22.190> less<00:07:22.630> but<00:07:23.630> no<00:07:24.169> virol

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
see that i took a lot less but no virol

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.930 
see that i took a lot less but no virol
when<00:07:24.650> you<00:07:24.740> look<00:07:24.890> at<00:07:25.039> enemies<00:07:25.280> killed<00:07:25.640> that's

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:25.940 
when you look at enemies killed that's

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.500 
when you look at enemies killed that's
not<00:07:26.120> really<00:07:26.419> in<00:07:26.539> my<00:07:26.720> opinion<00:07:27.050> a<00:07:27.380> very<00:07:27.470> valid

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.510 
not really in my opinion a very valid

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.210 
not really in my opinion a very valid
overall<00:07:29.740> comparison<00:07:31.270> but<00:07:32.270> GG<00:07:33.229> to<00:07:33.440> my<00:07:33.650> opponent

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220 
overall comparison but GG to my opponent

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.170 
overall comparison but GG to my opponent
