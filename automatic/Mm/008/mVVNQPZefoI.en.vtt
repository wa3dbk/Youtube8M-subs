00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.020
 m 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.700
 where the ranger with rubber boots 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.550
 It can always sink with the mediator 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.100
 the caterpillars are still harvested from wood 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.620
 like excavator with a loading area is 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.320
 equipped with oversized chains the 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.940
 prevent a sinking 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.000
 so the elevator increases with 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.699
 special orders used such as in 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.269
 solling around the raised bogs of spruce trees 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.269
 to free 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.050
 Here we can see the elevator at one 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.160
 Presentation in the weser-ems area 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.110
 observe 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.740
 Again, there are often difficult ones 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.740
 conditions
