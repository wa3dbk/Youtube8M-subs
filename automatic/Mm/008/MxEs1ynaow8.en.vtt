00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:48.210 
grabbed Lea crane to show us around and
here's<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.170> saw

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.080 

I<00:00:49.080> first<00:00:50.080> start<00:00:50.350> competing<00:00:50.830> in<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.700> Senior

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
I first start competing in the Senior

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.900 
I first start competing in the Senior
Bowl<00:00:52.120> during<00:00:52.420> cups<00:00:52.750> when<00:00:53.290> I<00:00:53.320> was<00:00:53.590> 16<00:00:54.100> or<00:00:54.220> 17<00:00:54.280> and

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
Bowl during cups when I was 16 or 17 and

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.520 
Bowl during cups when I was 16 or 17 and
then<00:00:55.540> I<00:00:55.570> didn't<00:00:55.840> do<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.050> for<00:00:56.200> a<00:00:56.230> couple<00:00:56.350> years

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
then I didn't do it for a couple years

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.320 
then I didn't do it for a couple years
from<00:00:56.950> one<00:00:57.190> reason<00:00:57.460> or<00:00:57.550> another<00:00:57.610> and<00:00:58.030> I<00:00:58.300> think

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
from one reason or another and I think

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.650 
from one reason or another and I think
in<00:00:58.660> total<00:00:59.140> this<00:00:59.290> is<00:00:59.350> probably<00:01:00.010> my<00:01:00.490> third<00:01:01.180> or

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
in total this is probably my third or

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.770 
in total this is probably my third or
fourth<00:01:02.200> season<00:01:02.770> with<00:01:03.310> very<00:01:03.640> big<00:01:04.330> gaps<00:01:04.570> in

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
fourth season with very big gaps in

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:13.110 
fourth season with very big gaps in
between<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.500> last<00:01:11.680> year<00:01:11.830> didn't<00:01:12.130> go<00:01:12.250> so<00:01:12.790> well

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
between the last year didn't go so well

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.090 
between the last year didn't go so well
for<00:01:13.150> me<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.690> had<00:01:14.290> to<00:01:14.410> miss<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.650> whole<00:01:14.680> season

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
for me I had to miss the whole season

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.500 
for me I had to miss the whole season
the<00:01:15.160> competition<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.670> due<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.000> shoulder

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
problem don't really want to call it an

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.340 
problem don't really want to call it an
injury<00:01:18.580> because<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.180> wasn't<00:01:19.480> really<00:01:19.690> like<00:01:20.320> a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
injury because it wasn't really like a

that I have to complete it to get to

00:04:43.479 --> 00:05:02.309 
that I have to complete it to get to
semi-final<00:04:44.050> because<00:04:44.289> it's<00:04:44.439> not<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> hard<00:04:44.889> block

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.399

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
and immediately I'm thinking this looks

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:23.210 
and immediately I'm thinking this looks
like<00:05:08.749> a<00:05:08.810> problem<00:05:09.110> that<00:05:09.469> was<00:05:09.560> built<00:05:09.830> for<00:05:09.889> me
