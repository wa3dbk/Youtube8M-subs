you know it's it's just like when you're

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.699 
you know it's it's just like when you're
a<00:03:33.450> little<00:03:33.510> kid<00:03:33.660> if<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.320> know<00:03:34.380> someone's

a little kid if you know someone's

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:35.509 
a little kid if you know someone's
picking<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.160> it's<00:03:35.250> probably<00:03:35.340> because

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
picking on you it's probably because

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.979
