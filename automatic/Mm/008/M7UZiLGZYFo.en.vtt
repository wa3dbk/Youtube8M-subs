00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
and so does her I mean do that's that's

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.300 
and so does her I mean do that's that's
gross<00:01:19.250> um<00:01:20.020> yeah<00:01:21.020> but<00:01:21.259> I<00:01:21.409> really<00:01:21.770> do<00:01:21.950> like<00:01:22.130> the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310

lightsaber<00:01:22.790> hilts<00:01:23.360> it's<00:01:23.899> on<00:01:24.259> Count<00:01:24.829> Dooku

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
lightsaber hilts it's on Count Dooku

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.520

style<00:01:25.490> it's<00:01:26.270> curved<00:01:26.780> that's<00:01:27.200> why<00:01:27.380> I<00:01:27.409> think

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
style it's curved that's why I think

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.590 
style it's curved that's why I think
it's<00:01:27.770> countered<00:01:28.250> this<00:01:28.399> style<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:29.420> comes

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
it's countered this style and it comes

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.530 
it's countered this style and it comes
to<00:01:29.720> two<00:01:30.020> red<00:01:30.649> light<00:01:30.979> red<00:01:31.220> on<00:01:31.670> lightsabers
