00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello to all and then two cases 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.120
 I hope you are fine 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.370
 today I want to say that I 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.630
 am in the mood a bit explosive while 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.840
 simply because today we are going 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.890
 discover together the map man I am 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.270
 bomberman 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.400
 so as you can see behind 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.840
 me there is a nice pixel art bomberman 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.550
 which was drawn on this map 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.140
 this is a fairly simple map to the east 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.750
 no there's nothing to anything specific on 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.180
 this map but it's a map bac that is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.280
 excellent in multi like as are 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.000
 besides the bonderman games if you 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.090
 have never played 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.790
 go get it you're invited there are 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.040
 on the xbox live and we found a little 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 from everywhere and on pc of them to 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.420
 the amazing emulators even if it's not 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.410
 good but some versions 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.180
 we can take now 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.309
 which dates a little bit so it's 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.949
 still as fun of June bomberman is 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.480
 so there the map the same we'll see 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.430
 it's a map that resumes precisely 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.239
 the bomberman universe so she was 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.369
 created by planet pixels ak and kfc 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.200
 warriors and as you will be able to 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.880
 see right after it's nothing complicated 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.030
 and it's just not getting farted 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.010
 fuck with friends so kill the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.650
 other players with the tnt the rules on 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.420
 will say right after just good will 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.100
 remember it during the chain hajj 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.000
 youtube of the creator these planets pixels 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.670
 so go visit 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.329
 because because what he has 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.670
 done that's fine then the rules 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.619
 rules not to hit the players 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.020
 rules of use just use the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.479
 tnt so the tnt that goes that will replace 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.860
 bomberman bombs 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.290
 rule 3 once the iron doors 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.610
 was not going back possible if a 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.920
 door disappears stay in the arena 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.060
 so that's it we do not care so here it is 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.530
 was not translated a name that had 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.939
 not much to translate yet another 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.229
 time but I still wanted to translate it into 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.030
 French it makes a map more 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.590
 France is anyway like I 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.810
 wanted to say on my channel I know I 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.670
 tight in as far as possible from 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.500
 you translate the maps because 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.030
 I find it much more fun then 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.590
 to start so it's very simple 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.060
 take a full stock of TNT before you 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.480
 start so you have chests 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.430
 who are all shielded from tnt cannes is 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.090
 everywhere so what do you do you 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.160
 fill up your TNT inventory as 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.720
 this so the map can be play up 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.520
 eight so at 8 I think it must be 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.800
 a damn broth in any case it must 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.050
 really exploded everywhere 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.840
 and here I am armored we move to a 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.790
 panel we're going to gt1 for that fact that's 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.510
 the tnt goes so you have tnt 1 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.810
 in all the chests 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.920
 there is really enough to do and so 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.360
 yes it can be played up to eight so 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.850
 and 8 it must be a hell of a mess because 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.350
 that casually I think it's 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.580
 a little bit small so now 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.930
 for sure it's a lot more 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.970
 a lot more fun to play but maybe 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.670
 a little small anyway and suddenly 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.780
 down each each player will go through 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.180
 one of his door so we will take 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.209
 a 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.680
 up with opened teeth same temple 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.150
 so here we go here and the party 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.019
 start so you give yourself there is no 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.880
 there is no timing 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.019
 they did not do anything happens 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.140
 stone that makes the doors open 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.400
 at the same time so it's up to you 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.799
 say go on it's everywhere we go and 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.310
 hop we could at the same time is fast 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.959
 and so here is the map the map is that 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.510
 that's where I blow myself up the 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.799
 head of the drug bay everywhere so the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.820
 goal is to do everything was in celebration 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.959
 so if you play eight you go 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.190
 have your colleagues who are going to be there 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.870
 on the other side that are going to be a little bit of 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.890
 all over 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.269
 so here I am in faty end mode this is 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.220
 for that my tnt do not go down 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.540
 as you can see I do not fit 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.769
 yet done that I was in practice I 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.850
 want them to not have blundered into 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.079
 dancing by throwing the party and so 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.600
 Here the goal is to get rate the 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.310
 head in terms is going to blow themselves up 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.720
 here and so we passed a map that is 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.130
 quite simple there is no I do not have big 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.380
 more thing to tell you is going to 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.820
 fly over a little bit for you see a 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.620
 little so its area as I wanted 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.120
 tell me I think it's a small 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.330
 little small tits it's a bit of a pity 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.090
 if I find another bomb berman 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.550
 game I would also put it to you 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.870
 downloading 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.860
 because because it's nice for them 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.170
 fast multi parts 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.260
 it's a bit like the rush maps 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.370
 had seen before or the map the wall and 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.660
 except that we love it even more 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.450
 Quick is reached and then it's gone 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.239
 that we will expose our heads and have nothing 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.350
 complicated in this map but but I 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.450
 I found rather nice I found the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.320
 pixel art also nice bomberman and 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.900
 then it's a map 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.090
 it's a quick map to play as I 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.470
 wanted to say said listen I do not have much 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.260
 actually to tell you more about this video 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.970
 which we are going to leave here I am going to 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.750
 put back in front of the world their manna 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.430
 to finish so yes I'll leave you 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.080
 on it I'll let you download the 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.660
 map with the link as usual just 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.390
 below and then finds himself 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.870
 Anyway soon for 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.280
 next maps 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.280
 come on hi everyone
