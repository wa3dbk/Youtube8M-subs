00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.910 
teaspoons of the cream of tartar so you
want<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.970> dump<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.510> as<00:02:42.630> well<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.860> then

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
want to dump that in as well and then

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.390 
want to dump that in as well and then
you<00:02:47.100> want<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.430> just<00:02:47.670> take<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.239> mix<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:50.340> up

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you want to just take and mix that up

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.430 
you want to just take and mix that up
really<00:02:50.940> well<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.780> kind<00:02:52.080> of<00:02:52.110> combines

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
really well so that kind of combines

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:04.360 
really well so that kind of combines
together<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:02.580> then<00:03:03.209> your<00:03:03.450> boiling<00:03:03.750> water

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
together and then your boiling water

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.530 
together and then your boiling water
which<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.610> two<00:03:05.790> cups<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.329> put<00:03:06.480> in

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
which is the two cups that you put in

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.270 
which is the two cups that you put in
the<00:03:06.600> microwave<00:03:06.750> you're<00:03:07.470> going<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.950> want<00:03:08.190> to

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the microwave you're going to want to

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.470 
the microwave you're going to want to
add<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.690> mixture

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.699 

you<00:03:15.959> wanna<00:03:16.140> mix<00:03:16.379> that<00:03:16.800> up<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:19.110> then<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.349> also

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
you wanna mix that up and then you also

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.320 
you wanna mix that up and then you also
want<00:03:20.159> to<00:03:20.220> take<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.760> add<00:03:20.970> two<00:03:21.629> teaspoons<00:03:22.409> of

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
want to take and add two teaspoons of

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:34.339 
want to take and add two teaspoons of
vegetable<00:03:24.330> oil<00:03:32.780> actually<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.930> think<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.200> might

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
vegetable oil actually I think I might

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.530 
vegetable oil actually I think I might
have<00:03:34.410> said<00:03:34.560> once<00:03:35.400> it's<00:03:35.610> actually<00:03:35.819> tablespoons

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
have said once it's actually tablespoons

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.380 
have said once it's actually tablespoons
I<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.049> so<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.040> two<00:03:38.310> tablespoons<00:03:39.030> of

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
I know that so it's two tablespoons of

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:50.509 
I know that so it's two tablespoons of
vegetable<00:03:39.750> oil<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:41.190> one<00:03:49.069> okay<00:03:50.069> then<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.370> want

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
vegetable oil so one okay then you want

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.000 
vegetable oil so one okay then you want
to<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:50.700> continue<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.540> stir<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.349> all<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.590> and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
to just continue to stir that all in and

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.059 
to just continue to stir that all in and
then<00:03:53.069> we're<00:03:53.280> going<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.489> put<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.359> on<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:55.109> medium

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
then we're going to put this on a medium

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.880 
then we're going to put this on a medium
heat<00:03:56.519> after<00:03:57.150> we<00:03:57.269> have<00:03:57.420> everything<00:03:57.900> combined

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
heat after we have everything combined

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.369 
heat after we have everything combined
here<00:03:59.250> we're<00:04:00.239> gonna<00:04:00.329> put<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.569> on<00:04:00.599> a<00:04:00.750> medium<00:04:01.140> heat

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
here we're gonna put it on a medium heat

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.410 
here we're gonna put it on a medium heat
for<00:04:01.950> Oh<00:04:02.959> probably<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.170> couple<00:04:04.620> minutes<00:04:04.879> and<00:04:05.879> the

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
for Oh probably a couple minutes and the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.509 
for Oh probably a couple minutes and the
mixture<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.900> going<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.140> start<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.620> form<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:08.220> ball

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
mixture is going to start to form a ball

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.059 
mixture is going to start to form a ball
it'll<00:04:09.359> pull<00:04:09.629> away<00:04:09.690> from<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.530> sides<00:04:10.769> and

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
it'll pull away from the sides and

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.710 
it'll pull away from the sides and
everything<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.819> from<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.060> bottom<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.629> it

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
everything and from the bottom and it

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.979 
everything and from the bottom and it
will<00:04:12.870> start<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.290> form<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.769> ball<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:14.579> now<00:04:15.569> this<00:04:15.810> is

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
will start to form a ball so now this is

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.659 
will start to form a ball so now this is
mixed<00:04:16.350> we're<00:04:16.709> gonna<00:04:16.799> go<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.070> transfer<00:04:17.579> it

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
mixed we're gonna go and transfer it

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
has finished pulling down you can just

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.450 
has finished pulling down you can just
give<00:05:11.039> it<00:05:11.160> a<00:05:11.220> couple<00:05:11.460> of<00:05:12.740> little<00:05:13.740> twists<00:05:14.280> and

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
give it a couple of little twists and

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.159 
give it a couple of little twists and
turns<00:05:14.639> here<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.300> make<00:05:15.539> sure<00:05:15.720> it's<00:05:15.870> all<00:05:16.139> mixed
