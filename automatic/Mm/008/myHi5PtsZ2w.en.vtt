00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.870
 nice day my ladies and mens 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.299
 name is lawyer christian solmecke 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.849
 from the Cologne media law firm Wilde 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.090
 beuger &amp; solmecke and in ours 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.900
 today's video blog otherwise about this topic 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.180
 because the topic is football 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.600
 The football World Cup is indeed 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.010
 just past but already located were the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 next spectacle 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.869
 in the coming week starts again 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.000
 the bundesliga and thus start too 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.640
 illegal activities of all those 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.620
 the bundesliga on the internet for free 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.780
 look and we want to do that today 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.480
 So it's about the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.610
 I may ask internet streams in the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.290
 In particular, I'm allowed to watch internet 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.780
 Watch the Bundesliga on the internet 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.820
 this is to be distinguished first 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.210
 which technical platform I use it 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.489
 So there is the streaming on the one hand 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.860
 portals the bundesliga just 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.260
 and on the other hand there is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.969
 software with which I received signals 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 and at the same time again walter 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.199
 sends this software based on the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.229
 so called ppp so peer to peer 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.689
 file sharing technology to the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.380
 streaming portals I represent the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.170
 theory that watching streaming 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.110
 film is legal 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.600
 there is no permanent copy on the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.630
 computer of the user is made 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.700
 should be a streaming portal then 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.990
 make durable copies then 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 well that would be illegal 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 However, the lawyers argue about it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.909
 whether already the fleeting copy in the frame 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.670
 So in the volatile memory of the computer 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.590
 already as a copy in the sense of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.600
 copyright law 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.369
 I think that's it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.829
 Although a copy, however, is the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.659
 privileged because it serves only the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.630
 Internet transmission and there's it 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.579
 exception regulations so much so the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.170
 complicated subject to the streaming 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.100
 portal that is also available for that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.649
 theme football 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.490
 In any case, the illegal 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.049
 use of peer-to-peer clients 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.670
 football matches to look at 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.960
 because there is the technology 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.640
 I not only designed that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.790
 am consumer throughout history 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.330
 but at the same time 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.510
 widen 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.490
 the signals of the tv signals is that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.420
 So it's highly illegal to do that 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.790
 leave your fingers 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.810
 I assume that premiere already 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.780
 soon or 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.350
 sky soon such 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.300
 copyright infringement massive 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.950
 will be done 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.500
 that's the next one from my point of view 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.120
 consistent step after the many 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.190
 filesharing warnings like the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.390
 seen last years 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.350
 and then it is better to one 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.480
 pay sky abo complete 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.470
 as here the signals in this way 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.090
 tap off 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.430
 because his copyright infringement will 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.890
 then expensive there are directly 1200 euro per 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.970
 warning that due it certainly 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.280
 no trifling 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.410
 you should get more information too 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.720
