really hoping that the second episode

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.840 
really hoping that the second episode
this<00:00:30.380> explains<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.800> opening<00:00:32.309> scene<00:00:32.550> because

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
this explains the opening scene because

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.819 
this explains the opening scene because
they<00:00:32.940> kind<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.210> touch<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> they<00:00:34.590> talk

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
they kind of touch on it and they talk

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.520 
they kind of touch on it and they talk
about<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.489> opening<00:00:35.850> scene<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.329> bit<00:00:36.630> so

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
about the opening scene a little bit so

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.750 
about the opening scene a little bit so
i<00:00:37.559> think<00:00:37.680> we're<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> learn<00:00:38.430> some<00:00:38.730> things

I'm<00:02:31.130> really<00:02:31.520> really<00:02:31.670> interested<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.030> see

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
I'm really really interested to see

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.340 
I'm really really interested to see
where<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.360> goes<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.750> looks<00:02:32.900> like<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.260> was

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
where this goes it looks like that was

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.110 
where this goes it looks like that was
about<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.650> fight<00:02:33.800> three<00:02:34.190> people<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:37.120> don't

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
about to fight three people and I don't

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.670 
about to fight three people and I don't
think<00:02:38.360> he's<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.690> powerful<00:02:38.870> maybe<00:02:39.320> we'll<00:02:39.590> get

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
think he's that powerful maybe we'll get

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.360 
think he's that powerful maybe we'll get
to<00:02:39.739> see<00:02:39.980> an<00:02:40.070> upgraded<00:02:40.520> form<00:02:41.860> because<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:42.950> assume

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
to see an upgraded form because I assume

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.979 
to see an upgraded form because I assume
that<00:02:43.610> double<00:02:44.090> has<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.360> have<00:02:44.450> at<00:02:44.540> least<00:02:44.569> one<00:02:44.810> of

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
that double has to have at least one of

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.400 
that double has to have at least one of
those<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.670> hey<00:02:46.670> it's<00:02:47.420> been<00:02:47.720> nine<00:02:47.930> episodes

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
those and hey it's been nine episodes

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.540 
those and hey it's been nine episodes
and<00:02:48.500> there<00:02:48.620> hasn't<00:02:48.739> been<00:02:48.860> an<00:02:48.980> upgrade<00:02:49.280> form

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
and there hasn't been an upgrade form

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:58.840 
and there hasn't been an upgrade form
yet<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:56.269> if<00:02:56.989> this<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.290> half<00:02:57.640> season<00:02:58.640> I

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
yet so and if this is a half season I

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.759 
yet so and if this is a half season I
would<00:02:59.780> assume<00:02:59.989> that<00:03:00.050> we<00:03:00.260> would<00:03:00.350> get<00:03:00.470> one<00:03:00.620> by

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
would assume that we would get one by

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.430 
would assume that we would get one by
now<00:03:01.060> or<00:03:02.060> we<00:03:02.239> would<00:03:02.450> get<00:03:02.540> one<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:03.080> know<00:03:03.200> around

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
now or we would get one you know around

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.780 
now or we would get one you know around
now<00:03:05.530> I'm<00:03:06.530> still<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.130> still<00:03:07.190> don't<00:03:07.489> know<00:03:07.580> if<00:03:07.700> this

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
now I'm still I still don't know if this

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.160 
now I'm still I still don't know if this
is<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.940> half<00:03:08.060> season<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.540> still<00:03:08.840> know<00:03:08.959> if<00:03:09.019> there's

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
is a half season I still know if there's

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.770 
is a half season I still know if there's
only<00:03:09.320> like<00:03:09.640> 25<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.790> 30<00:03:10.970> episodes<00:03:11.300> or<00:03:11.600> if<00:03:11.660> this

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
only like 25 to 30 episodes or if this

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.530 
only like 25 to 30 episodes or if this
is<00:03:11.870> going<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.019> be<00:03:12.110> a<00:03:12.140> full<00:03:12.350> series<00:03:13.239> I'm<00:03:14.239> almost

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
is going to be a full series I'm almost

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.050 
is going to be a full series I'm almost
kind<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.260> leaning<00:03:15.620> towards<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.130> 25<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.820> 30

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
kind of leaning towards the 25 to 30

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.479 
kind of leaning towards the 25 to 30
just<00:03:17.330> because<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.570> think<00:03:17.930> it's<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:18.230> good<00:03:18.500> III

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
just because I think it's so good III

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.850 
just because I think it's so good III
don't<00:03:20.030> know<00:03:20.209> if<00:03:20.360> they<00:03:20.480> can<00:03:20.660> keep<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.650> good

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
don't know if they can keep it so good

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.490 
don't know if they can keep it so good
for<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> entire<00:03:22.630> for<00:03:23.630> an<00:03:23.720> entire<00:03:23.959> 50<00:03:24.410> episodes

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
for the entire for an entire 50 episodes

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.530 
for the entire for an entire 50 episodes
uh<00:03:26.920> but<00:03:27.920> yeah<00:03:28.549> this<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> really<00:03:29.450> good

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
uh but yeah this is a really good

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.210 
uh but yeah this is a really good
episode<00:03:29.690> I'm<00:03:30.140> really<00:03:30.590> looking<00:03:30.890> forward<00:03:30.920> to

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
episode I'm really looking forward to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.340 
episode I'm really looking forward to
next<00:03:31.549> week<00:03:31.700> or<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.030> guess<00:03:32.269> later<00:03:32.450> today<00:03:32.630> if<00:03:32.930> DVD

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
next week or I guess later today if DVD

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.180 
next week or I guess later today if DVD
heart<00:03:33.530> gets<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.799> up<00:03:35.049> episode<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:38.110> yeah<00:03:39.190> I

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
heart gets it up episode and yeah I

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.890 
heart gets it up episode and yeah I
definitely<00:03:40.370> think<00:03:40.790> that<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.450> show<00:03:41.600> is<00:03:41.630> back

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
definitely think that the show is back

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.140 
definitely think that the show is back
on<00:03:42.110> track<00:03:42.290> after<00:03:42.430> two<00:03:43.430> kinds<00:03:43.850> of<00:03:43.940> poor

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
on track after two kinds of poor

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.870 
on track after two kinds of poor
episodes<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.610> well<00:03:46.610> I<00:03:46.640> thought<00:03:46.760> was

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
episodes and well I thought was

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.330 
episodes and well I thought was
interesting<00:03:47.030> was<00:03:47.299> that<00:03:47.420> in<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.720> recap<00:03:48.340> they

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
interesting was that in the recap they

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.039 
interesting was that in the recap they
specifically<00:03:49.940> show<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.450> whole<00:03:50.630> heavens

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
specifically show the whole heavens

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.720 
specifically show the whole heavens
tornado<00:03:51.440> thing<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:51.890> maybe<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.459> going<00:03:52.670> to

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
tornado thing so maybe that is going to

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.630 
tornado thing so maybe that is going to
come<00:03:52.880> back<00:03:53.030> maybe<00:03:53.239> I'm<00:03:53.480> wrong<00:03:54.160> maybe<00:03:55.160> there<00:03:55.549> is

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
come back maybe I'm wrong maybe there is

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.850 
come back maybe I'm wrong maybe there is
going<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.850> come<00:03:55.970> back<00:03:56.260> another<00:03:57.260> possibility

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
going to come back another possibility

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.640 
going to come back another possibility
for<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.250> next<00:03:58.489> step<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:58.940> is<00:03:59.500> not<00:04:00.500> an

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
for the next step so it is not an

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.060 
for the next step so it is not an
upgraded<00:04:01.130> form<00:04:01.400> but<00:04:01.790> another<00:04:02.660> writer<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.290> I'd

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
upgraded form but another writer and I'd

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.319 
upgraded form but another writer and I'd
be<00:04:04.220> interested<00:04:04.340> in<00:04:04.579> seeing<00:04:04.700> what<00:04:04.820> another

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
be interested in seeing what another

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.600 
be interested in seeing what another
rider<00:04:05.570> looks<00:04:05.870> like<00:04:06.019> in<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.230> series<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:07.220> yeah

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
rider looks like in the series but yeah

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.100

although<00:04:07.970> this<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.209> very<00:04:08.450> good<00:04:08.510> episode<00:04:08.930> I

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
although this is very good episode I

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.280 
although this is very good episode I
highly<00:04:09.350> recommend<00:04:09.470> checking<00:04:09.769> it<00:04:10.160> out
