00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.380
 hello how about I'm julia towers and 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.679
 let's say a different cooler or magic 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.990
 let's put tricks with cards 

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:13.749
 manipulation and everything that you are going to 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.630
 learn today is going to be for you 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.859
 do it with your families and friends 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.859
 they simply have to trust the 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:23.830
 things that they do for themselves to trust is 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:28.650
 the objective that I'm going to try to make 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.650
 you can reach confidence 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.880
 nothing more than that and I think you 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.120
 themselves in their homes can do each 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.120
 one 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.000
 hello how are you good today 0 this trick 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.260
 we will quickly show the effect and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 then I will show the tutorial 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.559
 first of all I will enter the letters 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.899
 simply because of the fact that there is no 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.119
 have to have the letters ordered so that 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.470
 do not think I cheat 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.880
 answer the letters on the table and 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.210
 tell a viewer that he chooses a 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.210
 letter 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.760
 and put it aside 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.590
 already but the sector 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.590
 that sees it and that the letter says it 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.890
 and I'm going to mix again to 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.229
 that there is no doubt that they manipulate us 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.360
 the cards what I'm going to do now is 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.900
 cut by the same soria stone spector 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.920
 to place the media letter 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.729
 without showing me the letter 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.020
 and now you should see what cut again 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.020
 exactly in more 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.750
 all right 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.630
 quickly expand the letters 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.329
 in this way 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.060
 and what I'm going to do now should be the 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.299
 viewer who thinks about his letter and who 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.420
 tell me what is the letter of your letter in 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.240
 let's say if a number is a number and if 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.140
 is letter by letter what number or letter 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.170
 I touched the letter 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.170
 from 1 to 13 which number is 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:22.730
 311 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.730
 now you have to place your finger on top 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.420
 and you are going to count the number of your letter 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.770
 understandably said one 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.880
 in his letter is nothing more and nothing less than 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.880
 those of heart 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.150
 good to do the trick simply 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:53.060
 they have to do it calmly 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.340
 have a lot a lot of contact with the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.670
 viewer so that this trick is more 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.409
 most credible the first step they have 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.299
 what to do is mix the letter commonly 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.760
 for us we can make the 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.849
 viewer mind that there is no problem a 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.049
 Once we mix we give you a choice 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:16.770
 letter whatever we are going to show 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:19.710
 only they are going to grab the mallet 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.870
 let's mix again and now it's coming 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.810
 the important part of memorizing a 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.930
 letter as a key letter what do I mean 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.390
 when we memorize the last letter 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.120
 we can locate the letter without seeing it 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.110
 let's see how we first memorize 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.690
 this letter but of pica and we are going to cut 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.540
 in this way grabbing with these two 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.480
 fingers and grabbing the top to 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.410
 that we have the 2 below the cut 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.480
 higher 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.660
 we tell him the spector reset his letter 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.580
 above the glass and that we complete 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.770
 with the cut that we had previously 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.800
 in this way it would seem totally 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.300
 lost to look more like a 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.200
 lost let's tell him to go back to 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.510
 cut anywhere and complete 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.170
 This way you will generate attention 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.880
 different 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.489
 we say it's for the letters 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.200
 quickly and here is the moment where 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:20.040
 let's find out what your letter is 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.350
 once we see that the key letter the 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.880
 we have obviously located this 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.880
 it has to be very fast so that it does not 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.940
 note we obviously go the letter of the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.410
 viewer in which is the right 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.340
 let's pick up the cards and with your finger 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.480
 thumb let's fall on our letter 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.180
 key 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.450
 once we get the key letter 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.430
 we simply do as we unite 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.280
 all the letters but let's make a 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.560
 break with the little finger we have the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.600
 key letter we make a finger risk 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.480
 little finger 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.970
 and in this way it would seem that the mallet 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.080
 It is fully bonded and will not passed 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.160
 absolutely nothing 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.730
 the next thing is with the break grab the 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.760
 mallet and do a cut simulation by 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.470
 where we had obviously left our 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.670
 this letter to get the second one here not 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.340
 It is true 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.919
 Then what do we do? 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.580
 in this way making a false cut 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:26.720
 this part below and another part for 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.990
 in this way we will have 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.620
 2 below and the effect chart now 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.490
 What we have left to do now is 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.420
 tell him to put his finger on it and that 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.060
 depending on the number that has 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.340
 touched or the letter for example quotas 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.820
 it would be docile because it is given to life 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.550
 is 13 then we tell them to count 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.530
 up to 12 once the account is finished 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.960
 viewer is going to account for your letter and 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.680
 surprisingly the letter will find 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.849
 up and good friends, hopefully 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.400
 video search 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.560
 learn magic with me remember that 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.340
 okay is doing the magic videos 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.340
 on Tuesdays 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.970
 that all the videos reach you 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.220
 feed to your channel 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.960
 do not forget 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.040
 in the little button that you can see above 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.850
 favorites 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.230
 I thought it was a good video and leave online 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:32.710
 Any questions you have and comments 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:35.050
 is that your friends learn as well as 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.080
