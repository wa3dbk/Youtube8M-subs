00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
gauge yourself with a turn obviously you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.520 
gauge yourself with a turn obviously you
need<00:01:08.310> speed<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.509> need<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.719> long<00:01:09.990> corner<00:01:10.469> at

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
need speed and you need a long corner at

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.499 
need speed and you need a long corner at
least<00:01:10.709> for<00:01:10.859> the<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.039> I<00:01:11.069> do<00:01:11.219> it<00:01:11.429> so<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.999> would<00:01:12.270> say

here we go ready make sure to get a lot
of<00:01:45.650> speed<00:01:45.860> coming<00:01:46.100> into<00:01:46.250> this<00:01:46.400> section<00:01:46.670> right

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
of speed coming into this section right

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.540 
of speed coming into this section right
now<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:48.500> as<00:01:48.590> soon<00:01:48.770> as<00:01:48.890> we're<00:01:49.040> about<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.400> go

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
we're gonna let off the gas right about

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.060 
we're gonna let off the gas right about
here<00:01:51.350> turn<00:01:51.680> in<00:01:51.920> how<00:01:53.140> clutch<00:01:54.140> hold<00:01:54.650> in<00:01:54.890> your

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
here turn in how clutch hold in your

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.480 
here turn in how clutch hold in your
clutch<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.610> counter<00:01:56.150> steer<00:01:56.390> completely<00:01:57.080> and

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
clutch and counter steer completely and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.040 
clutch and counter steer completely and
then<00:01:58.490> once<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:58.910> let<00:01:59.150> that<00:01:59.300> go<00:01:59.540> there's<00:01:59.900> no

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
then once you let that go there's no

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.450 
then once you let that go there's no
turning<00:02:00.440> back<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:00.860> right<00:02:00.979> there<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.220> was<00:02:01.310> kind

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
turning back so right there it was kind

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.130 
turning back so right there it was kind
of<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.700> little<00:02:01.820> bit<00:02:02.030> under<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:02.509> we<00:02:02.540> need<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.840> kind

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
of a little bit under so we need to kind

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.230 
of a little bit under so we need to kind
of<00:02:03.290> shoot<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.830> little<00:02:04.520> bit<00:02:04.700> farther<00:02:05.000> in

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
of shoot it a little bit farther in

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.630 
of shoot it a little bit farther in
before<00:02:05.540> we<00:02:05.750> actually<00:02:06.040> initiate<00:02:07.040> that<00:02:07.250> corner

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
before we actually initiate that corner

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.100 
before we actually initiate that corner
so<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.850> can<00:02:07.970> kind<00:02:08.240> of<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:08.450> their<00:02:08.600> tire<00:02:08.810> marks

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
so you can kind of see their tire marks

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.670 
so you can kind of see their tire marks
coming<00:02:09.380> back<00:02:09.560> right<00:02:09.830> here<00:02:11.230> almost<00:02:12.230> in<00:02:12.410> terms

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
coming back right here almost in terms

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.590 
coming back right here almost in terms
you<00:02:12.890> know<00:02:12.980> one<00:02:13.250> solid<00:02:13.790> smooth<00:02:14.060> motion<00:02:14.510> you

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
you know one solid smooth motion you

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.000 
you know one solid smooth motion you
don't<00:02:14.720> want<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> be<00:02:14.959> too<00:02:15.200> jerky<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:15.950> you

don't want to correct yourself if you
correct<00:02:17.870> yourself<00:02:18.200> during<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.590> drift<00:02:18.860> you

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
correct yourself during the drift you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.800 
correct yourself during the drift you
will<00:02:19.700> end<00:02:19.880> up<00:02:19.970> spinning<00:02:20.209> on<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.540> guarantee

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
will end up spinning on it I guarantee

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.540 
will end up spinning on it I guarantee
it<00:02:21.260> or<00:02:21.440> you're<00:02:21.590> not<00:02:21.680> gonna<00:02:21.890> hold<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.220> proper

it or you're not gonna hold the proper

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.910 
it or you're not gonna hold the proper
angle<00:02:23.140> alright<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.350> let's<00:02:24.500> try<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.680> one<00:02:24.800> more

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
angle alright so let's try this one more

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.520 
angle alright so let's try this one more
time<00:02:25.220> here<00:02:25.660> alright<00:02:26.660> guys<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:26.930> here<00:02:27.080> we<00:02:27.170> go

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
quick look at this in our replay angles

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.110 
quick look at this in our replay angles
right<00:02:49.200> now<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:50.010> mean<00:02:50.580> as<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.790> said<00:02:50.819> it's

cannot<00:03:09.810> stress<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.230> enough<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.830> right<00:03:11.010> here

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
cannot stress that enough so right here

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.580 
cannot stress that enough so right here
I'm<00:03:11.520> giving<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.450> little<00:03:12.660> bit<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.930> gas<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.410> get

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
I'm giving it a little bit of gas to get

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.930 
I'm giving it a little bit of gas to get
those<00:03:13.800> tires<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.310> see<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.580> tire<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:14.910> a

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
those tires you can see the tire is a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.430 
those tires you can see the tire is a
little<00:03:15.209> bit<00:03:15.300> squealing<00:03:15.750> they're<00:03:16.200> losing

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
little bit squealing they're losing

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.440 
little bit squealing they're losing
traction<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.550> when<00:03:17.700> that's<00:03:17.790> gonna<00:03:17.970> do<00:03:18.239> so

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
traction and when that's gonna do so

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.509 
traction and when that's gonna do so
it's<00:03:18.630> gonna<00:03:18.750> whip<00:03:19.110> all<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.920> way<00:03:20.040> back<00:03:20.310> around

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
done you're gonna hold that e-brake rate

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.860 
done you're gonna hold that e-brake rate
about<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:28.310> countersteer<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:30.120> hold

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
about now countersteer in and just hold

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.400 
about now countersteer in and just hold
it<00:03:31.110> do<00:03:31.590> not<00:03:31.620> let<00:03:32.130> go<00:03:32.190> no<00:03:33.150> matter<00:03:33.390> what<00:03:33.630> guys<00:03:34.200> if
