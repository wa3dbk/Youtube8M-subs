the<00:04:21.870> laptop<00:04:22.229> have<00:04:22.380> never<00:04:22.560> been<00:04:22.770> great<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.099> talk

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
the laptop have never been great to talk

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.830 
the laptop have never been great to talk
about<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.969> same<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.300> case<00:04:24.390> with<00:04:24.570> this

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
about and the same is the case with this

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.400 
about and the same is the case with this
one<00:04:24.900> as

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
one as

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.950 
one as
but<00:04:26.070> still<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.580> can<00:04:26.940> actually<00:04:27.150> surf<00:04:27.480> I<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:27.810> need

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
but still it can actually surf I so need

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.300 
but still it can actually surf I so need
for<00:04:28.200> video<00:04:28.500> calls<00:04:31.550> there<00:04:32.550> are<00:04:32.900> -<00:04:33.900> gasps<00:04:34.530> on<00:04:34.740> two

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
for video calls there are - gasps on two

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.030 
for video calls there are - gasps on two

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
racket of the laptop is not at all like

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.080 
racket of the laptop is not at all like
to<00:05:06.360> get<00:05:06.480> you<00:05:06.660> cannot<00:05:07.020> transmit<00:05:07.380> at<00:05:07.680> work<00:05:08.090> for

example<00:05:09.530> one<00:05:10.530> day<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.710> had<00:05:11.100> a<00:05:11.130> battery<00:05:11.850> of<00:05:12.210> more

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
example one day I had a battery of more

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.590 
example one day I had a battery of more
92%<00:05:13.440> give<00:05:14.310> me<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.700> battery<00:05:15.030> is<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.420> be

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
92% give me that the battery is to be

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.920 
92% give me that the battery is to be
trained<00:05:15.810> left<00:05:16.500> is<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.610> 240<00:05:18.210> art<00:05:18.420> which<00:05:18.900> is

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
trained left is that 240 art which is

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.530 
trained left is that 240 art which is
not<00:05:19.200> liquid<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:20.010> you<00:05:20.160> guys<00:05:20.340> all<00:05:20.490> remove<00:05:20.940> so

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
not liquid and you guys all remove so

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.200 
not liquid and you guys all remove so
you<00:05:22.110> cannot<00:05:22.410> expect<00:05:22.740> that<00:05:23.040> I<00:05:23.160> would<00:05:23.280> recommend

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
you cannot expect that I would recommend

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.600 
you cannot expect that I would recommend
you<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.330> use<00:05:24.510> third-party<00:05:25.290> sofas<00:05:25.950> between<00:05:26.490> the

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
you to use third-party sofas between the

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.540 
you to use third-party sofas between the
agents<00:05:30.410> so<00:05:31.410> my<00:05:31.560> quadrature<00:05:31.980> on<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.220> left<00:05:32.400> of

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
agents so my quadrature on the left of

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.190 
agents so my quadrature on the left of
is<00:05:32.700> that<00:05:32.880> I<00:05:33.150> would<00:05:33.480> highly<00:05:33.690> recommend<00:05:33.780> this

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200
