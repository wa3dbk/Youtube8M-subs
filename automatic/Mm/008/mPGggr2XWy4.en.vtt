00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240 

I<00:00:01.129> just<00:00:02.129> wanted<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.580> demonstrate<00:00:03.799> the<00:00:04.799> vehicle

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
I just wanted to demonstrate the vehicle

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.950 
I just wanted to demonstrate the vehicle
using<00:00:05.609> shore<00:00:05.940> power<00:00:07.309> when<00:00:08.480> when<00:00:09.480> plugged<00:00:09.780> in

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
using shore power when when plugged in

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.810 
using shore power when when plugged in
to<00:00:10.200> power<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.710> air<00:00:11.190> conditioning<00:00:13.549> so<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
to power the air conditioning so I

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.490 
to power the air conditioning so I
actually<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> air<00:00:15.809> conditioning<00:00:16.260> except

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
actually got the air conditioning except

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.750 
actually got the air conditioning except
arranged<00:00:17.060> which<00:00:18.060> means<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.449> going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.660> draw

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
arranged which means it's going to draw

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.400 
arranged which means it's going to draw
lordkin<00:00:20.760> power<00:00:21.060> consumption<00:00:21.660> than<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
lordkin power consumption than on the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.390 
lordkin power consumption than on the
regular<00:00:23.869> ok<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:24.930> we're<00:00:25.260> at<00:00:25.350> 15<00:00:25.769> amp<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.160> just

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
regular ok so we're at 15 amp I just

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
regular ok so we're at 15 amp I just
turned<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.939> i'm<00:00:27.869> doing<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.140> range<00:00:28.349> charge

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
turned it on i'm doing a range charge

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.450 
turned it on i'm doing a range charge
right<00:00:28.980> now

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.830 

very<00:00:32.460> sunny<00:00:32.820> since<00:00:33.090> little<00:00:33.390> hard<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.570> me<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
very sunny since little hard for me to

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.400 
very sunny since little hard for me to
see<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:35.150> the<00:00:36.150> car<00:00:36.390> had<00:00:36.570> reduced<00:00:36.840> chart<00:00:37.230> of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
see but the car had reduced chart of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.160 
see but the car had reduced chart of
amperage<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.670> 15<00:00:40.340> because<00:00:41.340> we're<00:00:41.489> nearing

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
amperage to 15 because we're nearing

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.130 
amperage to 15 because we're nearing
completion<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.890> range<00:00:44.190> charge

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.030 

we're<00:00:49.680> drawing<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.460> kilowatts<00:00:51.559> ok<00:00:52.559> now<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
we're drawing for kilowatts ok now that

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:07.330 
we're drawing for kilowatts ok now that
15<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.790> went<00:00:53.970> up<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:56.480> 19

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.539 

k<00:01:07.880> our<00:01:08.829> 24<00:01:09.829> up<00:01:10.130> five<00:01:10.520> amps<00:01:11.000> at<00:01:11.950> 238<00:01:12.950> volts<00:01:13.429> so

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
k our 24 up five amps at 238 volts so

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.480 
k our 24 up five amps at 238 volts so
it's<00:01:13.729> like<00:01:13.939> drawing<00:01:14.390> 10<00:01:14.600> amps<00:01:14.899> on<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.049> one<00:01:15.289> town

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030 

now<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> when<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> tried<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> few

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
now when I when I tried this a few

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.030 
now when I when I tried this a few
minutes<00:01:23.220> ago<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:24.990> went<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.470> almost

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
minutes ago it actually went up almost

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.090 
minutes ago it actually went up almost
ever<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.909> above<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.149> over<00:01:27.659> nine<00:01:27.899> amps<00:01:28.290> was

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
ever just above just over nine amps was

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.980 
ever just above just over nine amps was
the<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.430> everybody's<00:01:30.030> double<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.640> see

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
the right everybody's double you can see

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.080 
the right everybody's double you can see
consumption<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> five<00:01:35.039> kilowatts<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
consumption is a five kilowatts now so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.840 
consumption is a five kilowatts now so
went<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.390> kilowatt<00:01:37.610> obviously<00:01:38.610> there's<00:01:38.789> no

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
went up kilowatt obviously there's no

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.740 
went up kilowatt obviously there's no
decimal<00:01:39.360> places<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.850> either<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.210> amperage<00:01:42.509> or

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
decimal places so either the amperage or

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.030 
decimal places so either the amperage or
kilowatts<00:01:43.740> so

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.520 

can't<00:01:49.760> get<00:01:49.970> more<00:01:50.180> precise<00:01:50.660> than<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.230> rough

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
can't get more precise than a rough

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.610 
can't get more precise than a rough
estimate<00:01:51.980> there<00:01:52.250> but<00:01:52.930> starting<00:01:53.930> from<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.170> 15

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620

I<00:01:54.950> work<00:01:55.550> to<00:01:55.790> now<00:01:55.940> 22<00:01:56.660> amps<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:57.590> we're<00:01:57.800> up<00:01:58.690> 7<00:01:59.690> amps

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
I work to now 22 amps so we're up 7 amps

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:11.240 
I work to now 22 amps so we're up 7 amps
on<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:01.150> 237<00:02:02.150> volts

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.800 

now<00:02:11.820> during<00:02:12.090> six<00:02:12.480> kilowatts

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.770 

we're<00:02:18.230> now<00:02:18.380> 8<00:02:18.890> amps

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
we're now 8 amps

we're now 8 amps
seems<00:02:21.500> like<00:02:21.650> an<00:02:21.770> awful<00:02:22.160> lot<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:23.060> draw<00:02:23.300> just<00:02:23.600> for

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
seems like an awful lot to draw just for

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.309 
seems like an awful lot to draw just for
air-conditioning<00:02:24.020> especially<00:02:24.860> for<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.069> car

5,000 BTU window air conditioner only
draws<00:02:29.770> about<00:02:30.770> 500<00:02:31.400> watts<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.940> even<00:02:32.510> then

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
draws about 500 watts and even then

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.110 
draws about 500 watts and even then
that's<00:02:32.959> enough<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.380> cool<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.770> upper<00:02:34.730> portion

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
that's enough to cool the upper portion

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.380 
that's enough to cool the upper portion
of<00:02:35.180> my<00:02:35.240> home<00:02:36.670> we're<00:02:37.670> talking<00:02:37.910> about<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.090> little

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
of my home we're talking about a little

of my home we're talking about a little
card<00:02:38.630> here<00:02:38.930> it's<00:02:39.770> really<00:02:39.950> not<00:02:40.130> blown<00:02:40.430> out<00:02:40.610> too

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.940 
card here it's really not blown out too
much<00:02:41.000> so

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.530 

I'd<00:02:46.489> like<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.670> know<00:02:46.879> what<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.120> car<00:02:47.330> actually

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
I'd like to know what the car actually

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.809 
I'd like to know what the car actually
is<00:02:48.080> drawing<00:02:48.470> how<00:02:48.739> much<00:02:48.920> how<00:02:49.129> much<00:02:49.250> juice<00:02:49.580> these

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
is drawing how much how much juice these

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.300 
is drawing how much how much juice these
this<00:02:50.180> air<00:02:50.390> conditioner<00:02:50.420> takes<00:02:51.050> that<00:02:52.040> seems

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
this air conditioner takes that seems

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.979 
this air conditioner takes that seems
like<00:02:52.459> an<00:02:52.610> awful<00:02:53.030> lot<00:02:54.940> personally<00:02:55.989> air

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
like an awful lot personally air

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.630 
like an awful lot personally air
conditioner<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:57.650> this<00:02:57.769> car<00:02:58.010> would<00:02:58.129> be<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.310> lot

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
conditioner in this car would be a lot

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.449 
conditioner in this car would be a lot
more<00:02:58.910> effective<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.650> can<00:03:00.709> draw<00:03:01.099> the<00:03:01.160> lower

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
more effective it can draw the lower

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.040 
more effective it can draw the lower

would<00:03:10.280> increase<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.090> effectiveness<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.720> the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
would increase the effectiveness of the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.430 
would increase the effectiveness of the
air<00:03:12.230> conditioner<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.950> lot<00:03:13.900> want<00:03:14.900> me<00:03:15.049> to<00:03:15.170> turn<00:03:15.319> it

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
air conditioner a lot want me to turn it

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.900 
air conditioner a lot want me to turn it
down<00:03:15.470> nearly<00:03:15.890> as<00:03:16.099> cold<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.489> get<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.730> same

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
down nearly as cold to get the same

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.240 
down nearly as cold to get the same
effect<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.590> we're<00:03:18.739> going<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:18.920> shut<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.190> off

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
effect so we're going to shut that off

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.479 
effect so we're going to shut that off
now<00:03:19.670> see<00:03:20.060> what<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.269> drops<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.720> was<00:03:20.870> 22

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
now see what it drops that was 22

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.039 
now see what it drops that was 22
because<00:03:22.489> a<00:03:22.700> charging<00:03:23.239> current<00:03:23.420> on<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.780> cards

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
because a charging current on the cards

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.380 
because a charging current on the cards
dropped<00:03:24.440> down<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.680> 12<00:03:25.099> so<00:03:25.400> if<00:03:25.519> I<00:03:25.610> was<00:03:25.760> 22<00:03:26.209> we

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
dropped down to 12 so if I was 22 we

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.100 
dropped down to 12 so if I was 22 we
just<00:03:26.599> took<00:03:26.750> 10<00:03:27.620> amps<00:03:27.890> at<00:03:28.040> 200<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.329> just

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
just took 10 amps at 200 and I just

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.660 
just took 10 amps at 200 and I just
round<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.590> 240<00:03:31.190> volt<00:03:32.860> which<00:03:33.860> would<00:03:34.069> be<00:03:34.250> 20

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
round it to 240 volt which would be 20

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:46.000 
round it to 240 volt which would be 20
amps<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.299> 110<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:44.200> got<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.290> get<00:03:45.410> going<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.769> work

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
amps on a 110 I got to get going to work

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.740 
amps on a 110 I got to get going to work
but<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.310> wanted<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.790> see<00:03:46.970> this<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.329> completion

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
but I wanted to see this to completion

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:56.770 
but I wanted to see this to completion
because<00:03:48.019> before<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:49.180> updated<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:54.760> release<00:03:55.780> 4.5

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
because before I updated to release 4.5

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.879 
because before I updated to release 4.5
I<00:03:57.739> had<00:03:58.130> lost<00:03:58.750> 122<00:03:59.750> miles<00:04:00.109> on<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.440> standard

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
I had lost 122 miles on a standard

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:06.490 
I had lost 122 miles on a standard
charge<00:04:04.030> but<00:04:05.030> appears<00:04:05.630> on<00:04:05.900> doing<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.290> range

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
charge but appears on doing a range

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.990 
charge but appears on doing a range
charge<00:04:06.829> now<00:04:07.100> is<00:04:07.280> really<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.609> only<00:04:07.730> way<00:04:07.940> to

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
charge now is really the only way to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.840 
charge now is really the only way to
effectively<00:04:08.750> get<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.769> actual<00:04:10.609> capacity

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
effectively get the actual capacity

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.240 
effectively get the actual capacity
arranged<00:04:11.569> capacity<00:04:12.109> of<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.260> battery<00:04:12.470> reported

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
arranged capacity of a battery reported

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.400 
arranged capacity of a battery reported
and<00:04:13.670> right<00:04:14.299> now<00:04:14.450> i'm<00:04:14.569> up<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.840> two<00:04:14.989> hundred<00:04:15.019> and

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
and right now i'm up to two hundred and

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.219 
and right now i'm up to two hundred and
nine<00:04:15.970> miles<00:04:16.970> which<00:04:17.329> is<00:04:17.359> what<00:04:17.690> i<00:04:17.720> have<00:04:17.930> always

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
nine miles which is what i have always

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.110 
nine miles which is what i have always
gotten<00:04:18.590> doing<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.100> range<00:04:19.310> charge<00:04:19.639> so<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:19.910> looks

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
gotten doing a range charge so it looks

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.840 
gotten doing a range charge so it looks
like<00:04:20.299> after<00:04:20.680> fifty<00:04:21.680> seven<00:04:21.979> hundred<00:04:22.250> miles<00:04:22.520> ish

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
like after fifty seven hundred miles ish

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.920
