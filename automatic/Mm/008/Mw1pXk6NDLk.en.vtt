00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 and go back to the greetings of xativa and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.470
 bring the news today is about 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.610
 call of duty and they're going to fine this new with 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.370
 he says that you do not know what it's called 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.049
 but there is said to be white 2i 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.540
 comments and images and more than good there 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.130
 it's completely fake sir a lot of people 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.539
 he thinks he's going to call for the title 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.090
 top but it has not been confirmed that this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.460
 image is false I do not know let's see is what 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.170
 that is said good we open a little of the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.840
 game modes of this new call of 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.160
 duty which I was seeing our 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.810
 and reading and it seems that it is more 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.730
 competitive and I think he's going to do it 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.219
 little more interesting what was already talked about 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.469
 before the explore mode are the barracks 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.690
 which they were going to change and it's going to be the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.030
 respared a little more fair for both 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.829
 equipment and others and well then now what 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.719
 I will explain a little the new modes 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.940
 of game that supposedly to see in 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.039
 this new genetic pole the first one comes out 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 bad score that should be like escorts and 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.480
 a game mode in which you are going to cut 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.449
 a player through three flags 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.010
 ok if a player arrives at three o'clock 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.199
 flags automatically your team wins 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.730
 the opposing team has to kill 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.800
 that player to 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.990
 and you automatically as you have decided 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.440
 of the player the ways you want to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.540
 silicon explain for a sprint 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.520
 is in English and we play the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.050
 which says that you will be able to appear from 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.630
 a helicopter you will be able to lower the 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.119
 helicopter and you're going to have to go to 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.690
 think with three lives too and you're going to 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.700
 have to grab flags also not 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.410
 you have to save two flags twice 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 was going to be done by torrado in each 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.400
 round with two flags that against 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.290
 something else says if for example I 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.460
 I am the team and I subjective in the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.200
 team I'm driving the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.720
 helicopter in which I can also 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.490
 shoot if the team sees destroys milico 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.380
 but automatically the two teams go 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.090
 to have to go through the helicopter 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.340
 try to grab the flag is very 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.200
 very good this type of game and also 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.060
 it's something like affecting the flag 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.890
 but a domination is a mixture and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.460
 domination by capture the flash something 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.160
 so rinse yzr which hoist needs 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.140
 interesting a little bit confusing but this 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.960
 interesting a type of game in which 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.930
 the players 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.270
 to play to death and every player that 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.130
 will compete for a good flag 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.860
 when with cascon to each team give 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.940
 a flag or player alarm banner 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.810
 automatically a plant will appear 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.819
 can and will you be able to create better or 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.940
 good to create a class and asia 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.770
 you can put new green weapons 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.000
 including this we go bets to put 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.000
 this with this in ruling 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.180
 and well, when the players arrive 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.130
 automatically the power part for 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.560
 leaving would be enough and automatically 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.120
 without the flag and it's good for me to try 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.920
 kill the thrones through five 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.800
 points we are a little confused a 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.140
 little confused this is from the country but 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.660
 soon will explain much better 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.280
 Well, these are the three types of 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.640
 game which selling a new color and 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.230
 score split spawn and equalizer I'll 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.850
 make another video explaining what we are 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.680
 but it 's better because it ran out in a 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.690
 video about the marsh and what is the but 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.030
 not so I say goodbye to xÃ tiva live 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.330
 Favorites comments and I'll prepare the 7 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.330
 videos 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.340
 a hug and see you until next time 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.340
 gamers
