video<00:00:08.820> we<00:00:09.710> flanged<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.889> fluted<00:00:11.990> the<00:00:12.990> tops<00:00:13.200> in

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
video we flanged and fluted the tops in

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.660 
video we flanged and fluted the tops in
the<00:00:13.440> bottom<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:13.950> nose<00:00:14.219> ripped

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the bottom of this nose ripped

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.279 
the bottom of this nose ripped
now<00:00:15.240> we're<00:00:15.360> gonna<00:00:15.450> flange<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.960> lightening

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
now we're gonna flange the lightening

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.810 
now we're gonna flange the lightening
holes<00:00:16.440> here<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.550> go<00:00:17.930> it's<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:18.990> same<00:00:19.050> jig<00:00:19.820> that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
holes here we go it's the same jig that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.109 
holes here we go it's the same jig that
we<00:00:20.910> use<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> writes<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:22.289> modified

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
we use for the writes I just modified

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.429 
we use for the writes I just modified
some<00:00:24.119> two<00:00:24.269> corners<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.960> actually<00:00:25.289> make<00:00:25.410> it

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
some two corners to actually make it

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.429 
some two corners to actually make it
ambidextrous<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.720> perfectly<00:00:28.170> fits<00:00:30.439> left

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
ambidextrous so it perfectly fits left

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.540 
ambidextrous so it perfectly fits left
and<00:00:32.399> right<00:00:32.610> nose<00:00:32.820> ribs<00:00:34.160> plenty<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.250> surface

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and right nose ribs plenty of surface

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:50.900 
and right nose ribs plenty of surface
area<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.160> what<00:00:50.250> we're<00:00:50.399> gonna<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
area for this and what we're gonna do is

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
area for this and what we're gonna do is
take<00:00:51.059> our<00:00:51.239> dicks<00:00:52.399> which<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.550> actually<00:00:54.469> but<00:00:55.469> we

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
take our dicks which are actually but we

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.180 
take our dicks which are actually but we
bottom<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.399> out<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.629> press<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.890> creates

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
bottom this out on the press it creates

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.420 
bottom this out on the press it creates
a<00:00:59.250> perfect<00:00:59.430> 30<00:00:59.820> 35<00:01:00.329> degree<00:01:00.629> angle<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:02.250> for

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
a perfect 30 35 degree angle it's for

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.850 
a perfect 30 35 degree angle it's for
the<00:01:02.520> larger<00:01:02.940> one<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.420> obviously<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the larger one and obviously for the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:23.700 
the larger one and obviously for the
small<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.540> let's<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.780> got

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.390 

sure<00:01:24.710> we're<00:01:24.890> still<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.430> video<00:01:25.700> frame<00:01:26.240> here

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
sure we're still in the video frame here

00:01:27.400 --> 00:02:02.820 
sure we're still in the video frame here
actually<00:01:28.400> here<00:01:29.410> see<00:01:30.410> more<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.770> press

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.000 

here<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:04.820> can<00:02:04.970> already<00:02:05.150> see<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:06.010> it's

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
here you can already see that it's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:03:16.070 
here you can already see that it's
flanged<00:02:07.490> not<00:02:08.060> as<00:02:08.240> obvious<00:02:08.720> yet

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:25.190 

have<00:03:17.080> that<00:03:17.350> side<00:03:19.140> nice<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.170> even<00:03:20.590> flanges

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.820 

there<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.350> go

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
there you go

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.860 
there you go
it<00:03:27.280> really<00:03:27.790> starts<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.150> tighten<00:03:28.360> up<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.660> nose

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
it really starts to tighten up this nose

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.520 
it really starts to tighten up this nose
rib<00:03:29.490> now<00:03:30.490> what<00:03:30.730> we<00:03:30.850> end<00:03:31.000> up<00:03:31.120> with<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.960> instead

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
rib now what we end up with is instead

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.350 
rib now what we end up with is instead
of<00:03:32.590> being<00:03:33.060> bowed<00:03:34.060> how<00:03:34.390> we<00:03:34.450> were<00:03:35.100> this<00:03:36.100> way<00:03:36.360> when

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
of being bowed how we were this way when

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.230 
of being bowed how we were this way when
we<00:03:37.390> flange<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.959> tops<00:03:38.260> in<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.560> bottom<00:03:39.090> once<00:03:40.090> we

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
we flange the tops in the bottom once we

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.410 
we flange the tops in the bottom once we
get<00:03:40.360> done<00:03:40.540> flange<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.620> lightening<00:03:42.040> holes<00:03:42.420> we
