00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.719
 i 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.650
 Welcome to class online drawing 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.330
 last we learned to draw a figure 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.580
 basic from a line of 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.950
 proportion we made the legs biden 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.619
 as much as the rest of the body we have 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.660
 drawn the head in an oval shape 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.189
 slightly below we had drawn 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.290
 a line that we said would be the line of 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.720
 the clavicles we had generated the 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.480
 form as a and capital letter and from 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.390
 from these points we have already drawn the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.890
 legs of our base doll and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.539
 we also said that the dolls 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.230
 would get to the center of this figure more or 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.960
 less what we learned the transferred 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.240
 well now we will learn some 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:54.980
 specifications about this figurine 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.780
 we want it now is to emphasize the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.760
 that is to say 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.340
 We will make wider portion 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.950
 up and we're going to make it degrade 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.650
 as it approaches the waist this 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.290
 to see arab was the figure a little more 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.390
 smart we will also do more 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.310
 thin arm as it approaches 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.650
 the wrist is to say the thick arm at 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.750
 beginning and thin in the final part 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.400
 we will also do with the legs 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.110
 they will start thicker and as they arrive 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.780
 Ankles will be made every time 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.380
 Thinner legs in shape 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.480
 general are the bodies 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.790
 humans and we will also make a new 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.410
 addition we had said that the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.330
 neck is as wide as the head but 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.280
 now we will draw the trapeze 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.280
 as you can see from the point of 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.950
 the clavicles rise a line and join 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.200
 with the neck from more we do not have 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.170
 this mode we have a base figure a 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.960
 little bit more elaborate and now we're going to 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.530
 do an exercise with this figure to 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.030
 that you see how versatile this can be 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.610
 little doll that suddenly seems so 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.280
 simple and for that we are going to draw a 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.740
 slightly new proportion line 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.070
 curve again let's define the 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.410
 beginning and end of this line of 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.990
 We are also going to look for the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.030
 center and we go again to draw a 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.930
 head more or less small and again 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.710
 let's draw the line that would be 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.920
 the clavicles 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.930
 and the line of the hips if we draw 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.320
 the feet the feet would be curved and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.110
 this would not make much sense so what 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.990
 that we are going to do this foot if we are going to 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.510
 draw more or less corresponding to what 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.100
 along this line of proportion as 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.650
 you can see we do not follow the form of the 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.350
 line but if the line length but 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.450
 the other foot flat we are going to 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.640
 flex in this way 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.069
 The only thing we are looking for is that although 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.860
 We bend the sum of these two lines 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.209
 look as much as this proportion line 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.209
 and the same thing we're going to do with this reason 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.980
 let's draw this arm originally 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.390
 I would get to this point but more or 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.190
 less in the center we would think that 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.140
 would be the elbow so let's look 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.900
 bend this arm looking for this 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.150
 line is as long as this one and this 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.519
 it will be on the wrist we can flex 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.510
 the arm and the other we will draw 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:31.480
 normal is to say originally I would measure 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.270
 this distance we look that looks more or 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.690
 less the same 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.730
 and from this point we draw the 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.040
 doll is more kind of movement 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.140
 it's only for you to see how versatile and 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.270
 how useful it can be to manage 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.160
 correctly this base doll we're going 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.880
 to fill in by applying what we have just 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.100
 learn is to say wider in the part 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.310
 from the shoulders and it's getting thin 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.430
 as it reaches the waist wider 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.750
 the arms at the beginning thinner to 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:09.069
 end wider and they are doing 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.400
 thin at the end we draw the neck 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.260
 the trapeze as we said and 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.919
 we will fill the legs also more 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.859
 wide at the beginning and as they reach the 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:24.240
 ankle are becoming more 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.780
 caritas wider at the beginning and it 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.930
 they make thin 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.450
 at the end very well this is applicable 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.850
 so much for highly detailed figures 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.220
 as for very basic figures like 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.810
 it can be for example the animation 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.440
 so let's do an exercise to 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.330
 what do you see 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.879
 how useful it can be 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.370
 and properly handle this base doll 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:51.520
 we go 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:56.050
 to trace over this sheet and using 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:01.090
 this sketch a figure with shapes 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:04.570
 basic is not so detailed but 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.190
 although they could be 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.889
 maybe for people who see these 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.800
 videos and do not think about specializing in 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.500
 drawing just want to improve a little bit 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.700
 this can be very useful in the 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.980
 animations and you have seen what 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.380
 They seek to simplify the maximum figures 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.240
 to not plot too much and that's what 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.240
 let's do in this exercise 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.540
 in how you see the same thing that we did was 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:40.720
 trace the shapes 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.360
 and that they were on the bottom and 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.590
 now we're just going to put a very eye 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.220
 simple 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.220
 It is very simple 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.740
 and we're going to put it kind of like 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.740
 extremely basic horse 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.780
 and we are going to define some clothes too 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.780
 very simple 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.849
 this can be useful to those who 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.180
 as we said maybe they do not want to make a 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.180
 level 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.560
 it's very complex in your drawing just look 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.919
 improve a little make a few 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.599
 figures they might need and for 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.490
 example this figure that we draw here 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.340
 may well be useful for an illustration 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.750
 and not necessarily detailed 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.630
 although it could be 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.790
 all right 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.220
 then this is the utility that has 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.700
 be able to properly handle a doll 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.070
 with proportion lines well then without 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.820
 more we finish with this class and that you 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.820
 I will say you are practicing
