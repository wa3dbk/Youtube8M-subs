meters<00:01:04.470> which<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.159> helpful<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.760> know

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
meters which are really helpful you know

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.480 
meters which are really helpful you know
earlier<00:01:06.930> versions<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.560> camera<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
earlier versions of this camera like the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.719 
earlier versions of this camera like the
Canon<00:01:09.150> t2i<00:01:09.330> which<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.250> background

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
Canon t2i which I have in the background

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.810 
Canon t2i which I have in the background
back<00:01:11.939> there<00:01:12.180> didn't<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.580> manual<00:01:14.580> audio

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
back there didn't have manual audio

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.899 
back there didn't have manual audio
control<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:16.500> i've<00:01:16.650> done<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:17.250> i've<00:01:17.610> turned

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
control so what i've done is i've turned

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.999 
control so what i've done is i've turned
on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:19.170> sennheiser<00:01:19.880> it's<00:01:20.880> set<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.210> 0<00:01:21.570> DB<00:01:22.009> which

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
on the sennheiser it's set at 0 DB which

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.440 
on the sennheiser it's set at 0 DB which
is<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.460> know<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.060> careful

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
is you know you have to be careful

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
is you know you have to be careful
because<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.049> easily<00:01:25.259> peak<00:01:25.850> the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
because you can easily peak the

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.359 
because you can easily peak the
microphone<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.860> could<00:01:28.979> overload

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
microphone you know you could overload

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.760 
microphone you know you could overload
the<00:01:29.430> microphone<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.420> distortion<00:01:31.079> with

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the microphone and get distortion with

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.920 
the microphone and get distortion with
the<00:01:31.890> mic<00:01:32.070> being<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.119> proximity<00:01:33.479> till<00:01:33.840> i'm

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the mic being in this proximity till i'm

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
the mic being in this proximity till i'm
out<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.439> know<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.560> too<00:01:34.890> far<00:01:35.100> away<00:01:35.189> from<00:01:35.280> my

same no matter where I move you know I

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.320 
same no matter where I move you know I
can<00:02:42.590> even<00:02:42.620> move<00:02:42.920> my<00:02:42.950> head<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.580> little<00:02:44.030> bit<00:02:44.180> and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
my body a little bit and the microphone

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.190 
my body a little bit and the microphone
stays<00:02:46.550> with<00:02:46.790> me<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.090> that's<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.990> real

value of having the microphone attached

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.350 
value of having the microphone attached
to<00:02:50.930> me<00:02:51.230> as<00:02:51.410> opposed<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.070> using<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.970> microphone

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
to me as opposed to using the microphone

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.980 
to me as opposed to using the microphone
on<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.750> camera<00:02:54.010> which<00:02:55.010> I'll<00:02:55.400> show<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.120> or<00:02:56.540> you

on the camera which I'll show you or you
just<00:02:57.170> heard<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:58.790> big<00:02:59.750> difference<00:03:00.110> between

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
just heard is a big difference between

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.320 
just heard is a big difference between

a lot more of the room tone the room I'm

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.130 
a lot more of the room tone the room I'm
in<00:03:25.670> you're<00:03:25.790> going<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.000> hear<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.239> echo<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.840> my

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
in you're going to hear the echo and my

in you're going to hear the echo and my
voice<00:03:27.380> bouncing<00:03:27.950> off<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.250> walls<00:03:28.459> much<00:03:29.060> more

voice bouncing off the walls much more

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.180 
voice bouncing off the walls much more
than<00:03:29.510> when<00:03:29.870> I'm<00:03:29.989> using<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.410> microphone<00:03:30.739> as

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
than when I'm using the microphone as

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.160 
than when I'm using the microphone as
you<00:03:31.670> could<00:03:31.790> hear<00:03:32.120> when<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.780> microphones

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
you could hear when the microphones

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.440 
you could hear when the microphones
attached<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.769> me<00:03:33.950> now<00:03:34.280> I'm<00:03:34.430> about<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.670> foot<00:03:35.180> away

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
attached to me now I'm about a foot away

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.560 
attached to me now I'm about a foot away
from<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.930> camera<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.580> audio<00:03:37.940> is<00:03:38.000> going<00:03:38.450> to

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
from the camera so the audio is going to

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.570 
from the camera so the audio is going to
sound<00:03:38.780> its<00:03:39.140> best<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:39.950> probably<00:03:40.220> going<00:03:40.370> to

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
sound its best that is probably going to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.840 
sound its best that is probably going to
sound<00:03:40.820> in<00:03:41.239> terms<00:03:41.300> of<00:03:42.019> using<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.850> on-board

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
sound in terms of using the on-board

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.940 
sound in terms of using the on-board
microphone<00:03:44.230> but<00:03:45.230> it's<00:03:45.380> still<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.830> probably

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
microphone but it's still you probably

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.009 
microphone but it's still you probably
still<00:03:46.370> notice<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.910> dramatic<00:03:47.180> difference<00:03:47.570> and

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
still notice a dramatic difference and

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.890 
still notice a dramatic difference and
we<00:03:48.680> did<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.980> test<00:03:49.220> with<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.489> lab<00:03:49.900> standing

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
we did the test with the lab standing

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.000 
we did the test with the lab standing
back<00:03:51.050> there<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:51.890> I'm<00:03:51.980> going<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.190> get<00:03:52.310> up<00:03:52.459> here

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
back there so I'm going to get up here

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.120 
back there so I'm going to get up here
I'm<00:03:55.010> going<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.280> actually<00:03:55.400> change<00:03:55.850> focus<00:03:57.130> right

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
I'm going to actually change focus right

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.090 
I'm going to actually change focus right
in<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.370> middle<00:04:01.540> alright<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:02.780> here<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.530> am<00:04:03.680> back

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
in the middle alright so here I am back

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.140 
in the middle alright so here I am back
and<00:04:05.560> it's<00:04:06.560> hard<00:04:06.739> to<00:04:06.830> tell<00:04:07.010> I'm<00:04:07.310> back<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:08.030> know

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
and it's hard to tell I'm back you know

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.690 
and it's hard to tell I'm back you know
back<00:04:08.420> where<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:09.170> stood<00:04:09.530> before<00:04:09.890> about<00:04:10.130> six<00:04:10.459> feet

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
back where I stood before about six feet

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.420 
back where I stood before about six feet
away<00:04:10.970> from<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.450> camera<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.280> you're<00:04:13.280> probably

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
away from the camera and you're probably

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.860 
away from the camera and you're probably
going<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.790> notice<00:04:13.940> I'm<00:04:14.180> even<00:04:14.420> trying<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:14.660> speak

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
going to notice I'm even trying to speak

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.599 
going to notice I'm even trying to speak
up<00:04:15.049> so<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.290> can<00:04:15.500> reach<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:15.950> microphone<00:04:16.430> because

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
up so I can reach the microphone because

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.190 
up so I can reach the microphone because
I<00:04:16.790> know<00:04:16.850> it's<00:04:17.209> just<00:04:17.359> going<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.570> sound<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:18.019> much

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
I know it's just going to sound so much

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.960 
I know it's just going to sound so much
different<00:04:18.590> but<00:04:18.709> I'm<00:04:19.100> talking<00:04:19.430> about<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.760> same

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
different but I'm talking about the same

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.909 
different but I'm talking about the same
level<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:20.510> can<00:04:20.959> definitely<00:04:21.109> hear<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.680> room

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
level you can definitely hear the room

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.100 
level you can definitely hear the room
tone<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.460> probably<00:04:22.850> like<00:04:23.510> just<00:04:23.539> much

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
tone is probably like just much

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.000 
tone is probably like just much
different

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
different

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.550 
different
it's<00:04:25.130> echoey<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.570> microphone<00:04:26.960> just<00:04:27.200> it

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
it's echoey and the microphone just it

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.580 
it's echoey and the microphone just it
doesn't<00:04:27.800> sound<00:04:28.100> as<00:04:28.280> good<00:04:28.750> again<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:30.200> is<00:04:30.440> the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
doesn't sound as good again this is the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.000 
doesn't sound as good again this is the
onboard<00:04:31.190> mic<00:04:32.150> on<00:04:32.480> the<00:04:32.690> Canon<00:04:33.020> CTD<00:04:33.380> I'm<00:04:33.740> not

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
onboard mic on the Canon CTD I'm not

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.770 
onboard mic on the Canon CTD I'm not
using<00:04:34.250> a<00:04:34.400> microphone<00:04:34.790> system<00:04:35.180> I'm<00:04:35.330> just<00:04:35.570> using

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
using a microphone system I'm just using

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.690 
using a microphone system I'm just using
what<00:04:36.320> comes<00:04:36.560> on<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.890> camera<00:04:37.250> something<00:04:37.610> you

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
what comes on the camera something you

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.790 
what comes on the camera something you
generally<00:04:38.060> don't<00:04:38.240> want<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.720> use<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.200> so<00:04:39.380> I've

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
generally don't want to use and so I've

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.450 
generally don't want to use and so I've
also<00:04:40.040> had<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:41.050> really<00:04:42.050> crank<00:04:42.500> up<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.830> preamp

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
also had to really crank up the preamp

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.980 
also had to really crank up the preamp
on<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.700> camera<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.330> there's<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.570> lot<00:04:44.810> more

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
on the camera so there's a lot more

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.230 
on the camera so there's a lot more
noise<00:04:45.310> because<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.430> cameras<00:04:46.790> doing<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:47.090> lot

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
noise because the cameras doing a lot

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.410 
noise because the cameras doing a lot
more<00:04:47.270> work<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:48.620> pick<00:04:49.250> up<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.550> noise<00:04:49.880> floor<00:04:50.150> to

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
more work to pick up the noise floor to

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.980 
more work to pick up the noise floor to
hear<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.320> audio<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.370> know<00:04:53.030> two<00:04:53.750> bad

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
hear the audio so you know two bad

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.170 
hear the audio so you know two bad
things<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.560> camera<00:04:54.950> on<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.790> mic<00:04:56.000> on<00:04:56.150> the

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
things the camera on the the mic on the

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.870 
things the camera on the the mic on the
camera<00:04:56.570> is<00:04:56.690> just<00:04:56.900> not<00:04:57.230> good<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:58.490> preamp

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
camera is just not good and the preamp

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.730 
camera is just not good and the preamp
is<00:04:59.060> working<00:04:59.570> even<00:04:59.660> harder<00:05:00.170> it's<00:05:00.320> up<00:05:00.470> louder

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
is working even harder it's up louder

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.010 
is working even harder it's up louder
the<00:05:01.010> gain<00:05:01.250> on<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.670> my<00:05:02.120> manual<00:05:02.540> microphone

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
the gain on the my manual microphone

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.620 
the gain on the my manual microphone
setting<00:05:03.320> is<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.500> lot<00:05:03.800> louder<00:05:04.040> so<00:05:04.490> these<00:05:05.150> are<00:05:05.420> the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
setting is a lot louder so these are the

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.840 
setting is a lot louder so these are the
two<00:05:05.810> systems<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.800> this<00:05:06.920> is<00:05:07.100> just<00:05:07.310> using<00:05:07.610> the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
two systems and this is just using the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.280 
two systems and this is just using the
onboard<00:05:08.000> camera<00:05:08.570> to<00:05:08.690> give<00:05:08.840> you<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:08.960> comparison

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
onboard camera to give you a comparison

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.590 
onboard camera to give you a comparison
to<00:05:09.800> you<00:05:10.370> know<00:05:10.460> what<00:05:10.790> kind<00:05:11.000> of<00:05:11.060> quality<00:05:11.420> you<00:05:11.450> can

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
to you know what kind of quality you can

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.330 
to you know what kind of quality you can
get<00:05:11.720> out<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:12.020> using<00:05:12.200> a<00:05:12.380> microphone<00:05:12.860> that's

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
get out of using a microphone that's

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.580 
get out of using a microphone that's
actually<00:05:13.670> attached<00:05:13.970> to<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:14.540> and<00:05:14.750> plug<00:05:15.380> right

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
actually attached to you and plug right

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.590 
actually attached to you and plug right
into<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.950> camera<00:05:16.130> so<00:05:16.430> that's<00:05:17.300> what<00:05:17.480> I'm<00:05:17.570> doing

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
into the camera so that's what I'm doing

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.420 
into the camera so that's what I'm doing
with<00:05:17.870> these<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:18.380> this<00:05:18.530> is<00:05:18.710> just<00:05:18.860> a<00:05:18.950> test<00:05:19.220> of

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
with these and this is just a test of

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.240 
with these and this is just a test of
the<00:05:20.360> audio<00:05:20.720> so<00:05:21.050> what<00:05:21.350> you're<00:05:21.500> hearing<00:05:21.710> is<00:05:21.950> the

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
the audio so what you're hearing is the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.840 
the audio so what you're hearing is the
audio<00:05:22.700> going<00:05:23.150> in<00:05:23.300> to<00:05:23.780> this<00:05:24.050> microphone

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
audio going in to this microphone

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.330 
audio going in to this microphone
directly<00:05:25.850> plugged<00:05:26.210> into<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:27.350> Canon<00:05:27.710> 60d<00:05:27.950> and

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
directly plugged into the Canon 60d and

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.970 
directly plugged into the Canon 60d and
I'm<00:05:28.880> not<00:05:29.030> monitoring<00:05:29.750> it<00:05:29.900> with<00:05:30.260> headphones<00:05:30.500> I

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
I'm not monitoring it with headphones I

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.070 
I'm not monitoring it with headphones I
just<00:05:31.490> looked<00:05:31.670> at<00:05:31.790> the<00:05:31.940> manual<00:05:32.300> meters<00:05:32.690> before

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
just looked at the manual meters before

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.220 
just looked at the manual meters before
I<00:05:33.110> pressed<00:05:33.710> record<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:34.660> this<00:05:35.660> is<00:05:35.810> what<00:05:35.960> we<00:05:36.050> got

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
I pressed record and this is what we got

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.220 
I pressed record and this is what we got
let's<00:05:36.770> see<00:05:36.890> you<00:05:36.980> next<00:05:37.130> time
