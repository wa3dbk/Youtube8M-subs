00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.880 
you brought cominius just use how and
surge<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.500> power<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:37.110> stars<00:01:37.500> down<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
surge of power so if the stars down the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.539 
surge of power so if the stars down the
line<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:40.409> can't<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.979> two

beast pet then you'll need to bring in
little<00:01:49.200> bling<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.820> it's<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> look

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
little bling and it's going to look

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
little bling and it's going to look
something<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> I'm<00:01:56.040> basically

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
something like this so I'm basically

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.380 
something like this so I'm basically
just<00:01:56.600> using<00:01:57.649> black<00:01:58.649> claw<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.579> suicide<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> pet

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
just using black claw to suicide the pet

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
just using black claw to suicide the pet
because<00:02:01.200> you're<00:02:01.439> always<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.189> able

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
because you're always going to be able

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.330 
because you're always going to be able
to<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.549> black<00:02:02.759> claw<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.439> just<00:02:07.439> creating<00:02:08.190> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
to get black claw so just creating a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.639 
to get black claw so just creating a
worst-case<00:02:08.670> scenario<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.410> can't

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
worst-case scenario here that you can't

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.140 
worst-case scenario here that you can't
hit<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.220> hit<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.459> them<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.090> get

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
hit get one hit on them but you can get

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.360 
hit get one hit on them but you can get
black<00:02:12.360> claw<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:12.780> them

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
black claw on them

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.820 
black claw on them
so<00:02:13.819> start<00:02:14.150> with<00:02:14.209> make<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.659> rain<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:17.590> then<00:02:18.590> go

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
so start with make it rain and then go

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.649 
so start with make it rain and then go
into<00:02:19.330> inflation<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:23.000> mean<00:02:23.180> that's<00:02:23.360> that's

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
into inflation and I mean that's that's

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.649 
into inflation and I mean that's that's
pretty<00:02:24.049> much<00:02:24.170> going<00:02:24.409> to<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:24.709> wreck<00:02:24.980> them

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
pretty much going to just wreck them

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.910 
pretty much going to just wreck them
even<00:02:26.659> if<00:02:26.780> he<00:02:26.870> does<00:02:27.049> stun<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:27.650> he<00:02:27.769> does

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
even if he does stun you like he does

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.240 
even if he does stun you like he does
here<00:02:31.329> so<00:02:32.329> I'm<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.599> going<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.810> pass<00:02:33.129> with<00:02:34.129> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
here so I'm just going to pass with the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.880 
here so I'm just going to pass with the
flyer<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:36.440> use<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:37.430> gift<00:02:37.879> package<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.680> that

flyer and use the gift package and that

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.410 
flyer and use the gift package and that
takes<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.220> pretty<00:02:40.400> decent<00:02:40.760> chunk<00:02:40.909> off<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.299> them

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
takes a pretty decent chunk off of them

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.130 
takes a pretty decent chunk off of them
and<00:02:42.909> then<00:02:43.909> you<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.239> just<00:02:44.360> basically<00:02:44.599> can<00:02:44.989> do

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
and then you can just basically can do

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.690 
and then you can just basically can do
whatever<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.709> can<00:02:45.799> either<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.160> just<00:02:46.340> make<00:02:46.549> it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
whatever you can either you just make it

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.300 
whatever you can either you just make it
rain<00:02:46.910> or<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.269> can<00:02:47.420> use<00:02:47.920> inflation<00:02:48.920> i<00:02:49.010> think<00:02:49.220> if

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
rain or you can use inflation i think if

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.849 
rain or you can use inflation i think if
i<00:02:49.430> would<00:02:49.609> have<00:02:49.959> refreshed<00:02:50.959> make<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.410> rain<00:02:51.620> and

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
i would have refreshed make it rain and

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.949 
i would have refreshed make it rain and
then<00:02:51.980> use<00:02:52.160> an<00:02:52.280> inflation<00:02:52.790> I've<00:02:53.569> might<00:02:53.840> have

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
then use an inflation I've might have

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.289 
then use an inflation I've might have
been<00:02:54.079> able<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.379> almost<00:02:54.769> kill<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:55.489> guy<00:02:55.700> with
