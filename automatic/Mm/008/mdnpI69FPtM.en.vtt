off the bench off the table and then
over<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.609> dunnage<00:00:24.500> so<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.650> shall<00:00:26.220> prove

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
over to the dunnage so this shall prove

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.749 
over to the dunnage so this shall prove
to<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:27.949> interesting<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:30.320> then<00:00:31.610> I'm<00:00:32.610> gonna

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
to be interesting and then I'm gonna

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.170 
to be interesting and then I'm gonna
move<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.480> onto<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> spar<00:00:34.410> table<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
move this up onto the spar table and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.360 
move this up onto the spar table and
commence<00:00:36.590> shaping<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:39.050> well<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.320> far<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.860> good

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
commence shaping it well so far so good

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.910 
commence shaping it well so far so good
but<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.420> got<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> little<00:00:42.870> tricky<00:00:43.320> part<00:00:43.590> coming

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
but we got a little tricky part coming

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.119 
but we got a little tricky part coming
up<00:00:44.629> because<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.200> against<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> support

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
up because I'm up against the support

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.510 
up because I'm up against the support
that<00:00:47.309> I'm<00:00:47.460> holding<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.000> back<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> I'm

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that I'm holding it back with so I'm

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.750 
that I'm holding it back with so I'm
gonna<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> go<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> line<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.699> tie<00:00:53.699> it

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
gonna have to go get a line and tie it

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.310 
gonna have to go get a line and tie it
from<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> different<00:00:56.390> location<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.140> could

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
from a different location so I could

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.139 
from a different location so I could
move<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.680> tripod<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> way<00:00:59.699> and

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
move the tripod out of the way and

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.480 
move the tripod out of the way and
slowly<00:01:03.149> roll<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.480> over<00:01:03.690> under<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.080> dunnage

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.480 

okay<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.420> tied<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.320> line<00:01:10.850> or<00:01:11.850> outside<00:01:12.840> there

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
okay so I tied a line or outside there

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.010 
okay so I tied a line or outside there
anchored<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.909> my<00:01:15.229> lumber<00:01:16.229> pile<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:18.020> coming

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
anchored or my lumber pile is coming

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.960 
anchored or my lumber pile is coming
through<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:22.159> around<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.369> tree<00:01:23.580> couple

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
through here and around the tree couple

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.429 
through here and around the tree couple
times<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.920> back<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.720> hopefully<00:01:28.200> that's
