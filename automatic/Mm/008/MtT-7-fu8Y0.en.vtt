 But what those people like us are curious about , 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:07.930
 I want to be like that regardless of my will from birth. 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:12.220
 Yes, that's what scholars now call a hanger on the research, 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:16.780
 There are elements and inherited elements, and the factors that are born with sexuality are great 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.860
 It's big and I just live with that factor, 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.700
 It is said that there is a point at which it becomes manifestation 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.590

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.580

 There are also people who drink so much, so I do not know that 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.880
 The moments that I realize are coming 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.880
 I can see you somehow these days . 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:12.580

 But now that I 've seen these days, 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:22.450
 So I'm gay so it makes sense to know and come out huh 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.510

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.690
 It's snowing. 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:49.120
 You made a coming out. 4 I want someone to help me out with me. 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:55.660
 I think it's nice in Korea. 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.440
 I feel very burdensome, so I'm at home, 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.700
 do 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:08.230
 Actually, there are some apps that we communicate with each other. 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:09.070
 Oh , young people around the third degree are really too hard to make extreme choices 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.720
 I have a lot. 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:21.070
 I'll keep on sleeping for the letters that come from the ring when I t ring it all night. 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:25.570
 Yet it continues to describe what haejugo can buy something fine and persuade it okay 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.070
 Because they have a position to talk about men, they are an extreme choice 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.200
 Thing 4 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:38.109
 Oh , I know a lot about bullying because of his identity at school. 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:41.769
 Assault is also done and the family is kicked out of the parents and is now around at work 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.500
 If you get kicked out, there are too many of these guys and they are ambiguous. 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.969
 A little 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:52.760
 It's also a lot of people who think you are up to the death 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:54.709
 A few years ago, I had close acquaintances with around 10 people. 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.760
 Yes. Yes. 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:05.540

 Well , what I'm seeing on the air is so light , 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:16.370
 For their trouble really talk about life, talk to you guys serious 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:21.109
 Actually, those who have a little fun on the air now have that sense of distance. 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:25.880
 Is not this distance a little closer to those who are not a different person 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.169
 We also again close the gap a little that street that are all huinoaerak 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.479
 Because I want to 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:36.770
 I get mojareun who have yet to do so, others would Funny People birthplace access

 I heard laughter'm going to get out because he did believe in elections 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:50.840
 I do not think the nuclear power was too light at this time . 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.479
 So I'm not going to dig up that oil . 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.949
 I 've done a lot of objections. 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:05:02.440
