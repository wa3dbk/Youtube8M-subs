00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.029
 with the auspice of good gelman ketchup 

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:08.029
 like the rich tomato as it exerts 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.029
 we present 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.090
 How is your belly? 'Carlos was 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.039
 member that we started to approach it kitchen 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.930
 We are here in the restaurant workshop 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.300
 dances well today we want to make yoghurts 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.099
 natural buy a natural yogurt but 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.660
 how to package it how to take it to the best 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.279
 in a collation or as they call the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.279
 office sees it here in carlos a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.640
 and most importantly when you want 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.380
 consume natural yogurts is to have a 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.620
 container that is quite common and 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.970
 resistant to be able to sterilize what 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.550
 we have to do then to 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.710
 sterilize let's put in a fountain 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.360
 a cloth in the background we will fill with 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.120
 cold water 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.980
 and we are going to put directly on the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.160
 fire 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.260
 and upside down then the jars we go 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.940
 to be here for 15 minutes from 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 they start to boil and for 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.420
 make sure they do not break 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.119
 we put a cloth in the center because it's going to 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.760
 start to vibrate a bit with the process 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.800
 of boiling then one go to one side one 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.150
 towards the other one and we let that already 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.310
 from minutes that it starts to boil 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.200
 we have to count 15 minutes when 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.060
 spend 5 we are going to put the covers that 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.060
 They need 10 minutes of experiences 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.390
 fifteen minutes have passed is a minute of 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.530
 remove them one important thing is that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.600
 let us leave them in one place 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.180
 tempered since there are no currents of 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.330
 air so that we do not have problem of 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.460
 let them stay sad we are 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.710
 there with care and we are ready to 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.710
 fill them with different types of euros 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.290
 let's do a multi barry losing 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.479
 with a few raspberries we put 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.330
 also raspberry pulp and we finish 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.520
 with these great morons that these 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.300
 we only get frozen in this 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.300
 epoch that we put one there the center and 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.770
 we have then the first option this 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.540
 It can be a super collation and really 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.400
 if we do not have we know that during the day 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.650
 We will not have much time to 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.549
 to have lunch 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.549
 we are fine 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.430
 what good firm we finished it 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.430
 then with 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.540
 an alternative you also have to like 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.650
 all children is milk with banana 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.200
 and let's make an option with yogurt 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.660
 we have these dehydrated bananas and 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.060
 we are going to mix it 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.040
 with a bit of mango pulp that already 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.110
 It comes sweetened and also gives the touch 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.550
 characteristic comes yellow from 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.420
 banana what makes it more 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.420
 attractive for children 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.730
 and remember to cover tight we press in this 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.730
 part the children can also help 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.849
 and we are going to put here then a 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.290
 alternative of natural yogurts for 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.670
 What do you do in the house as a family? 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.440
 remember that you can have a 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.870
 yogurt and with only one yogurt can 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.310
 prepare pain where 10 to 12 yogurts in 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.840
 a format also a little smaller and 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.120
 where it says big thinking about it being 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.980
 a snack a little stronger options 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.690
 are multiple to not in the house and the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.250
 food diversity is what 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.840
 prevents a lot of diseases like 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.670
 cancer so it's important that 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.349
 we consume dairy products and in different ways 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.349
 recipes you see here in Caracas 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.879
 under the auspices of hellmann's ketchup 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.290
 good as the rich tomato like the one 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.290
 we have presented
