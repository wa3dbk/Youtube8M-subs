00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
and for this tutorial I'm going to be

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.820 
and for this tutorial I'm going to be
using<00:00:16.289> at<00:00:16.470> mate<00:00:16.740> MP<00:00:17.190> 16<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:18.720> receiver<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
using at mate MP 16 the receiver is the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.300 
using at mate MP 16 the receiver is the
thing<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.660> part<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> RC<00:00:22.410> cars<00:00:22.680> radio

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310

system<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.109> what<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.260> does<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.890> actually

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
system and what it does is actually

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.080 
system and what it does is actually
receives<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.570> weight<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.140> radio<00:00:28.590> waves<00:00:29.090> from

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
receives the weight the radio waves from

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.670 
receives the weight the radio waves from
your<00:00:30.710> transmitter<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.899> therefore<00:00:33.899> sends

your receiver and a crystal hey the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.830 
your receiver and a crystal hey the
first<00:01:02.489> thing<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:03.000> need<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.660> actually

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
first thing we need to do is actually

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.719 
first thing we need to do is actually
find<00:01:04.379> where<00:01:04.949> your<00:01:05.869> RC<00:01:06.869> cars<00:01:07.260> receiver<00:01:07.979> case<00:01:08.400> is

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
find where your RC cars receiver case is

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.899 
find where your RC cars receiver case is
kept<00:01:09.060> normally<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> receiver<00:01:10.740> case<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.280> where

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
kept normally the receiver case is where

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.620 
kept normally the receiver case is where
the<00:01:12.540> batteries<00:01:13.140> are<00:01:13.500> located<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.630> is

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the batteries are located and is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.460 
the batteries are located and is
normally<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.330> engine<00:01:18.330> side<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> car

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
normally on the engine side of the car

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.710 
normally on the engine side of the car
other<00:01:20.369> than<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.939> front<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> vehicle

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
other than at the front of the vehicle

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
other than at the front of the vehicle
so<00:01:22.680> first<00:01:23.220> thing<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.520> need<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.270> actually

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
so first thing we need to do is actually

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.069 
so first thing we need to do is actually
open<00:01:26.180> our<00:01:27.229> receiver<00:01:28.229> case<00:01:28.549> in<00:01:29.659> there<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.930> will

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
open our receiver case in there you will

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.880 
open our receiver case in there you will
find<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.829> batteries<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.619> your<00:01:34.619> on/off

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
find your batteries and your on/off

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.560 
find your batteries and your on/off
switch<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.970> well<00:01:37.430> now<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.790> need<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.329> is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
switch as well now what we need to do is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.330 
switch as well now what we need to do is
actually<00:01:39.810> connect<00:01:40.500> these<00:01:40.860> two<00:01:41.369> servo<00:01:41.939> cables

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
actually connect these two servo cables

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
actually connect these two servo cables
into<00:01:44.340> our<00:01:44.670> new<00:01:45.240> receiver<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.820> first<00:01:48.149> thing

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
into our new receiver so the first thing

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.990 
into our new receiver so the first thing
we<00:01:48.450> want<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.740> remove<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.820> battery

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
we want to do is just remove the battery

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.990 
we want to do is just remove the battery
case<00:01:52.159> from<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.640> vehicle<00:01:55.399> it's<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.549> something

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
case from the vehicle it's not something

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.469 
case from the vehicle it's not something
you<00:01:57.119> need<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.899> but<00:01:58.610> doing<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.969> will<00:02:00.270> mean

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
you need to do but doing this will mean

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.039 
you need to do but doing this will mean
it<00:02:00.780> easier<00:02:01.310> ok<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.369> once<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> battery<00:02:03.450> case<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it easier ok so once the battery case is

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.540 
it easier ok so once the battery case is
removed<00:02:05.240> simply<00:02:06.240> put<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.659> over<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.550> hey

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
removed simply put that over there hey

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.290 
removed simply put that over there hey
now<00:02:09.030> there<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.660> our<00:02:09.840> receiver<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:11.180> all<00:02:12.180> we

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
now there is our receiver and all we

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.120 
now there is our receiver and all we
have<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.480> do

it<00:03:31.690> should<00:03:31.959> look<00:03:32.140> like<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:34.780> should<00:03:35.080> have

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
it should look like this you should have

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.790 
it should look like this you should have
the<00:03:35.650> steering<00:03:36.120> servo<00:03:37.120> plugged<00:03:37.900> into<00:03:38.200> channel

kind of sign there saying battery or
something<00:03:55.209> like<00:03:55.360> that<00:03:56.310> next<00:03:57.310> what<00:03:57.760> we<00:03:57.850> need<00:03:58.000> to

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
something like that next what we need to

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.810 
something like that next what we need to
do<00:03:58.300> is<00:03:58.600> actually<00:03:59.080> install<00:03:59.650> what's<00:04:00.370> called<00:04:00.670> the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
do is actually install what's called the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.020 
do is actually install what's called the
crystal<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:02.200> crystal<00:04:02.230> actually<00:04:03.130> is<00:04:03.790> the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
crystal the crystal actually is the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.410 
crystal the crystal actually is the
thing<00:04:04.300> that<00:04:04.600> receives<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.830> radio<00:04:06.400> waves<00:04:06.760> from

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
thing that receives the radio waves from

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.890 
thing that receives the radio waves from
your<00:04:08.230> radio<00:04:08.640> transmitter<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:10.000> actually

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
your radio transmitter and actually

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.509 
your radio transmitter and actually
sends<00:04:11.290> them<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.890> receiver

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
sends them to the receiver

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.440 
sends them to the receiver
therefore<00:04:13.480> sending<00:04:14.140> them<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.489> servos<00:04:16.060> and

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
therefore sending them to the servos and

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.060 
therefore sending them to the servos and
therefore<00:04:17.229> controlling<00:04:18.160> your<00:04:19.000> vehicle<00:04:20.070> prior

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
therefore controlling your vehicle prior

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.450 
therefore controlling your vehicle prior
to<00:04:21.340> what<00:04:21.790> you<00:04:22.000> are<00:04:22.030> doing<00:04:22.210> on<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.900> handset<00:04:23.460> so

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
to what you are doing on the handset so

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.690 
to what you are doing on the handset so
the<00:04:25.360> receiver<00:04:25.960> or<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.590> clone<00:04:27.040> oh<00:04:27.070> sorry<00:04:27.490> the

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
the receiver or the clone oh sorry the

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:36.440 
the receiver or the clone oh sorry the
crystal<00:04:29.430> slides<00:04:31.560> into<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:33.660> receiver<00:04:34.660> there

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
crystal slides into the receiver there

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.090 
crystal slides into the receiver there
remember<00:04:37.450> it<00:04:37.720> does<00:04:37.870> not<00:04:37.900> matter<00:04:38.320> what<00:04:38.860> way

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
remember it does not matter what way

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
remember it does not matter what way
round<00:04:39.430> it<00:04:39.820> goes

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
round it goes

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.050 
round it goes
then<00:04:40.630> let's<00:04:42.390> push<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:45.040> receiver<00:04:45.460> back<00:04:45.729> in<00:04:45.880> its

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
then let's push the receiver back in its

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.940 
then let's push the receiver back in its
place

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
place

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.730 
place
put<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.100> on/off<00:04:48.640> switch<00:04:48.669> in<00:04:49.510> its<00:04:49.990> place<00:04:50.380> as

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
put the on/off switch in its place as

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.550 
put the on/off switch in its place as
well<00:04:51.100> how<00:04:51.790> we<00:04:52.360> need<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:52.720> do<00:04:52.900> is<00:04:53.229> actually

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
well how we need to do is actually

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.740 
well how we need to do is actually
install<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:55.210> antenna<00:04:55.720> tube<00:04:56.169> here<00:04:57.060> so<00:04:58.060> on<00:04:58.419> your

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
install the antenna tube here so on your

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.909 
install the antenna tube here so on your
receiver<00:04:59.320> case<00:05:00.390> lid<00:05:01.390> there<00:05:02.320> will<00:05:02.410> be<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.710> little

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
receiver case lid there will be a little

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.920 
receiver case lid there will be a little
hole

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:15.370 

slide<00:05:09.139> the<00:05:10.139> antenna<00:05:10.560> tube<00:05:11.720> through<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.960> hole

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:23.770 

like<00:05:16.380> that

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.580 

okay<00:05:24.780> like<00:05:25.139> that<00:05:26.060> then<00:05:27.060> all<00:05:27.449> we<00:05:27.629> have<00:05:27.659> to<00:05:27.990> do<00:05:28.169> is

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
okay like that then all we have to do is

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.730 
okay like that then all we have to do is
place<00:05:29.129> all<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.580> wires<00:05:29.819> inside<00:05:30.740> the

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
place all the wires inside the

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.360 
place all the wires inside the
compartment<00:05:34.580> put<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.699> lid<00:05:35.879> on<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:37.370> just

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
compartment put the lid on and just

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.140 
compartment put the lid on and just
replace<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.969> lid<00:05:39.180> like<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:40.699> next<00:05:41.699> we<00:05:41.939> have

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
replace the lid like that next we have

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.580 
replace the lid like that next we have
to<00:05:42.330> thread<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:43.020> antenna<00:05:43.500> tube<00:05:46.879> so<00:05:48.349> this<00:05:49.349> can

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
to thread the antenna tube so this can

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:57.140 
to thread the antenna tube so this can
be<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.770> kind<00:05:50.099> of<00:05:50.189> pain<00:05:53.569> thread<00:05:54.569> it<00:05:55.759> so<00:05:56.759> that<00:05:57.000> it

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
be a kind of pain thread it so that it

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.760 
be a kind of pain thread it so that it
goes<00:05:59.270> thus<00:06:00.270> far<00:06:00.599> is<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.169> can<00:06:01.319> get<00:06:01.439> it<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:01.740> go

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
goes thus far is you can get it to go

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:09.320 
goes thus far is you can get it to go
without<00:06:02.159> jamming<00:06:07.400> then<00:06:08.400> just<00:06:08.699> slot<00:06:09.090> the
