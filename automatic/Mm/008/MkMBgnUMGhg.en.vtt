00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.730
 welcome to my cooking channel today in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.399
 the tips section of the old kitchen- 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.039
 let's go with a new pti to prepare 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.590
 our chocolate baskets for 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.170
 desserts fruit salads we are going to 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.170
 simply need chocolate that I 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.970
 I have here melted in a bain-marie and for 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.780
 that does not look harden while I'm 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.050
 working 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.210
 I do not have placed on another cazuelita 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.140
 of hot water in this way it 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.109
 always keeps liquid well and 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.289
 we're just going to need balloons that 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.329
 I already have inflated here the size of 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.429
 that more or less later I want them to be 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.589
 1000 little baskets we're just going to 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.229
 take our balloon and we're going to 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.330
 dip in the chocolate and we're going to 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.700
 submerge as high as we want it to be 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.470
 deep our basket 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.470
 let's go spinning in this way 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.439
 Here I show you how you are doing 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.740
 covering the base of my balloon to be 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.200
 necessary 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.450
 I can already tilt the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.920
 chocolate confectionery to give you more 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.890
 depth 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.140
 now I will lift carefully and without 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.130
 shake this surplus I'm going to 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.640
 move to a paper of these for oven 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.420
 and pressing lightly to be 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.580
 make a base I'm going to let go and so I'm going 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.830
 to leave until the chocolate has 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.840
 hardened once the chocolate has 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.789
 hardened you can accelerate this 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.890
 process placing the new ones in the 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.979
 refrigerator you can see thanks to the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.170
 buttery paper take off without any 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.720
 problem and how we did not slip the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.970
 too much chocolate down here was formed 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.060
 as a base that is ideal for you 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.440
 then our goal stays standing and 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.319
 now just what we have to 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.350
 to do is deflate the balloon and or short 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.989
 here a little bit is much softer this 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.989
 process that prick it to prevent it from 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.910
 Let us break the chocolate and now 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.280
 just carefully let's go 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.930
 removing if necessary we can do 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.930
 a bigger hole 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.980
 very carefully after removing the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.320
 wolves we have our baskets 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.270
 ideal to serve all kinds of sweets 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.270
 and desserts in these holidays 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.239
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.239
 useful and see you in the next
