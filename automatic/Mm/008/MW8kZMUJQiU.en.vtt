to go to all sorts of things but I think
more<00:03:37.750> exciting<00:03:38.740> to<00:03:38.830> people<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.430> predator

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
more exciting to people is the predator

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.540 
more exciting to people is the predator
a<00:03:40.240> legendary<00:03:40.930> predator<00:03:41.440> right<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:42.310> what's

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
a legendary predator right and what's

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.920 
a legendary predator right and what's
cool<00:03:42.760> about<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.030> legendary<00:03:43.330> predator<00:03:43.810> is

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
cool about the legendary predator is

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.020 
cool about the legendary predator is
that<00:03:44.050> you<00:03:44.140> can<00:03:44.290> play<00:03:44.500> as<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:45.130> Predators<00:03:45.580> or

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
that you can play as the Predators or

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.850 
that you can play as the Predators or
the<00:03:46.360> human<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:46.870> play<00:03:47.110> either<00:03:47.350> side<00:03:47.620> and

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
the human so you play either side and

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.310 
the human so you play either side and
then<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.730> since<00:03:49.060> it's<00:03:49.180> 100%<00:03:49.780> compatible<00:03:50.200> with

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
then you since it's 100% compatible with

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.870 
then you since it's 100% compatible with
aliens<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:51.070> can<00:03:51.250> then<00:03:51.370> play<00:03:51.610> as<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
aliens you can then play as the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.780 
aliens you can then play as the
Predators<00:03:52.270> against<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.990> aliens<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.790> that's

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
Predators against the aliens and that's

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.860 
Predators against the aliens and that's
just<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.120> think<00:03:55.150> it's<00:03:55.420> pretty<00:03:55.570> cool<00:03:55.720> they're

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870
