 cute little baby supports year and a half 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.630
 what does it mean that the mother has disappeared 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.630

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.650

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.520
 I sow the matador ponds hiding under 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 the houses the marmots are digging 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.850
 complex terriers that can measure 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.440
 up to 15 meters long she 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.940

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.940
 offspring and escape danger 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.580
 it provides for several exits in case 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.580
 flood plowing the earth 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.680

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.680
 a range of marmots against 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.650
 usually four to six small 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.870
 so there could be others if 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.659
 you see others call me then 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.069
