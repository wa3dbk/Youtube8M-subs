 replace the imported goods will not succeed 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.570
 analogue can be easily found in countries 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.550
 who did not own sanctions against Russia 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.860
 will take meat and 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.140
 and not forgetting the oppressed can be acquired 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.910

 fruits you can buy isa and uncle 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.490

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.720
 where to actually start these products 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.420

 may change the day before in Voronezh 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.720
 Vladimir Putin warned about a neat 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.490
 response to western political sanctions 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.860
 instruments 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.100
 pressure on 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.160
 economy they are not acceptable they 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.540
 contradict all the rules in this regard 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.940
 Russian government has already offered this 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.140
 responding to the so-called sanctions with 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:29.390
 sides of some countries think in 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.470
 modern conditions secure interests 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.510
 domestic producers on 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.370
 could well think about it but 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.830
 Needless to say, this must be done extremely 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.410
 neatly in order to manufacturers 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.230
 Domestic support but consumer

 defense finance 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.680
 high tech industry but how 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.540
 known sanction is a double-edged weapon 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.970
 especially sensitive Russian response 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.430
 will be for European countries in many of
