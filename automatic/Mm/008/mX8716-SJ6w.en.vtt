00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
okay we're ready to start coding this so

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.849 
okay we're ready to start coding this so
once<00:00:03.360> again<00:00:03.510> I've<00:00:03.780> got<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.020> movie<00:00:04.350> clip<00:00:04.500> right

once again I've got a movie clip right
here<00:00:04.920> that's<00:00:05.339> going<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.609> flash<00:00:05.879> loading<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.600> go

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
here that's going to flash loading I go

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.919 
here that's going to flash loading I go
up<00:00:07.470> here<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:08.189> actions<00:00:08.970> layer<00:00:09.240> put<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> blank

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
up here to my actions layer put a blank

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.930 
up here to my actions layer put a blank
keyframe<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.950> what<00:00:11.280> I'm<00:00:11.370> going<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.639> here

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
keyframe and what I'm going to do here

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.020 
keyframe and what I'm going to do here
is<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.780> frame<00:00:13.250> I'm<00:00:14.250> going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.490> open<00:00:14.730> up<00:00:14.849> my

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
is on this frame I'm going to open up my

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.790 
is on this frame I'm going to open up my
ActionScript<00:00:15.929> window<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.529> I'm<00:00:16.590> going<00:00:16.740> to

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
ActionScript window and I'm going to

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.560 
ActionScript window and I'm going to
coat<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:16.980> out<00:00:17.250> first<00:00:17.580> thing<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.850> do<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.029> stop<00:00:18.359> my

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
coat it out first thing I do is stop my

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.170 
coat it out first thing I do is stop my
movie<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.740> I'm<00:00:19.800> gonna<00:00:19.949> stop<00:00:21.920> my<00:00:22.920> movie<00:00:23.279> okay

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
movie so I'm gonna stop my movie okay

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.179 
movie so I'm gonna stop my movie okay
and<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:25.109> I'll<00:00:25.289> say<00:00:25.590> let's<00:00:26.220> see<00:00:26.490> here<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:28.189> open

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
and then I'll say let's see here if open

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.910 
and then I'll say let's see here if open
and<00:00:29.310> closed<00:00:29.519> parenthesis<00:00:30.349> open<00:00:31.349> curly<00:00:31.590> brace

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
and closed parenthesis open curly brace

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000 
and closed parenthesis open curly brace
two<00:00:32.369> lines<00:00:32.640> down<00:00:32.940> close<00:00:33.480> curly<00:00:33.899> brace<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.800> is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
two lines down close curly brace that is

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.060 
two lines down close curly brace that is
the<00:00:35.190> correct<00:00:35.399> format<00:00:35.880> for<00:00:36.090> an<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.360> statement

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
the correct format for an if statement

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.170 
the correct format for an if statement
so<00:00:38.070> I'll<00:00:38.190> say<00:00:38.399> if<00:00:38.840> right<00:00:40.460> frames<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.940> then

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
so I'll say if right frames and then

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869 
so I'll say if right frames and then
capital<00:00:42.690> L<00:00:42.899> loaded<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.250> whole<00:00:44.399> thing<00:00:44.670> should

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
capital L loaded the whole thing should

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.010 
capital L loaded the whole thing should
turn<00:00:45.120> blue<00:00:45.510> okay<00:00:46.700> equal<00:00:47.700> equals<00:00:48.149> which<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
turn blue okay equal equals which is a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.520 
turn blue okay equal equals which is a
test<00:00:49.410> testing<00:00:50.309> equality<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.059> frames<00:00:52.050> loaded

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
test testing equality if frames loaded

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.200 
test testing equality if frames loaded
equal<00:00:53.100> equals<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:53.789> I'm<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> put

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
equal equals and then I'm going to put

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.760 
equal equals and then I'm going to put
in<00:00:54.329> however<00:00:54.480> many<00:00:54.690> frames<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.500> movie

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
in however many frames are in my movie

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.930 
in however many frames are in my movie
in<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:56.610> movie<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:58.170> let's<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
in my movie I have let's see here up to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.779 
in my movie I have let's see here up to
here<00:00:59.969> which<00:01:00.840> i<00:01:00.989> think<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.230> 114<00:01:02.100> frames<00:01:02.430> yep

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
here which i think is 114 frames yep

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.929 
here which i think is 114 frames yep
there<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.270> 114<00:01:04.110> frames<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:05.700> I'll<00:01:05.790> do

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
there it is 114 frames so what I'll do

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.450 
there it is 114 frames so what I'll do
is<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.240> back<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> first<00:01:06.930> frame<00:01:07.460> highlight

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
is go back to the first frame highlight

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.240 
is go back to the first frame highlight
that<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> go<00:01:09.689> back<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.350> frames<00:01:10.830> loaded

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that a go back here if frames loaded

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.899 
that a go back here if frames loaded
equals<00:01:12.799> 114<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:14.659> if<00:01:15.799> that's<00:01:16.799> true<00:01:17.869> then<00:01:19.909> go

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
equals 114 right if that's true then go

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.530 
equals 114 right if that's true then go
to<00:01:21.780> capital<00:01:22.740> A<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.299> capital<00:01:24.299> P<00:01:24.509> play<00:01:26.540> whatever

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
to capital A and capital P play whatever

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.719 
to capital A and capital P play whatever
the<00:01:27.810> beginning<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.290> my<00:01:28.409> sight<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.740> which<00:01:29.549> would

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the beginning of my sight is which would

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.109 
the beginning of my sight is which would
in<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.909> case<00:01:30.090> it'd<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.390> frame<00:01:30.630> 10<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> i'll

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
in this case it'd be frame 10 so i'll

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.649 
in this case it'd be frame 10 so i'll
say<00:01:33.329> go<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.960> play<00:01:34.280> 10<00:01:35.990> right<00:01:36.990> oops<00:01:38.659> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
say go to and play 10 right oops and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.039 
say go to and play 10 right oops and
I'll<00:01:39.930> put<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> semicolon<00:01:40.320> right<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.810> at

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
I'll put a semicolon right and then at

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.350 
I'll put a semicolon right and then at

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
so if the movie has loaded 114 frames we

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.380 
so if the movie has loaded 114 frames we
jump<00:02:08.650> to<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.340> play<00:02:09.760> frame<00:02:10.600> 10<00:02:10.930> else<00:02:11.770> if<00:02:12.220> not<00:02:12.460> we

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
go back and play one so it's basically a

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.190 
go back and play one so it's basically a
test<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.740> playhead<00:02:18.190> will<00:02:18.760> go<00:02:19.060> here<00:02:19.360> run<00:02:20.170> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
test so the playhead will go here run a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.780 
test so the playhead will go here run a
test<00:02:20.500> they'll<00:02:20.800> say<00:02:20.950> has<00:02:21.100> everything<00:02:21.370> loaded

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
test they'll say has everything loaded

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.900 
test they'll say has everything loaded
yep<00:02:22.480> okay<00:02:22.990> great<00:02:23.200> let's<00:02:23.530> jump<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.950> 10<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.460> play

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
yep okay great let's jump to 10 and play

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.190 
yep okay great let's jump to 10 and play
if<00:02:25.570> not<00:02:26.320> go<00:02:26.680> back<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:27.100> one<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.660> play<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.990> try

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
if not go back to one and play and try

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.530 
if not go back to one and play and try
over<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.160> it'll<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.430> loop<00:02:30.820> here<00:02:31.120> until

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
over and so it'll just loop here until

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.510 
over and so it'll just loop here until
it's<00:02:31.690> loaded<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.170> we'll<00:02:32.260> be<00:02:32.380> all<00:02:32.500> set<00:02:32.530> so

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
it's loaded and we'll be all set so

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.360 
it's loaded and we'll be all set so
let's<00:02:33.730> try<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.030> out<00:02:34.180> hit<00:02:34.510> ctrl<00:02:34.660> enter<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:38.370> we

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
let's try it out hit ctrl enter and we

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.040 
let's try it out hit ctrl enter and we
just<00:02:39.550> get<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.820> flashing<00:02:40.270> loading<00:02:40.600> side<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
just get the flashing loading side and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.930 
just get the flashing loading side and
we<00:02:41.140> never<00:02:41.410> go<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.650> play<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.400> there's<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.640> problem

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
we never go to play so there's a problem

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.650 
we never go to play so there's a problem
it's<00:02:43.510> not<00:02:43.840> working<00:02:45.210> so<00:02:46.210> we<00:02:46.270> have<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.510> go<00:02:46.630> back

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
it's not working so we have to go back

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.940 
it's not working so we have to go back
and<00:02:47.020> look<00:02:47.110> at<00:02:47.260> our<00:02:47.350> code<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.240> say<00:02:49.420> okay<00:02:49.950> all

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
and look at our code so we say okay all

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.310 
and look at our code so we say okay all
right<00:02:51.490> we<00:02:51.730> stop<00:02:52.060> there<00:02:52.360> if<00:02:53.610> frames<00:02:54.610> loaded

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
right we stop there if frames loaded

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.810 
right we stop there if frames loaded
what<00:02:56.320> if<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.500> put<00:02:56.650> an<00:02:56.740> underscore<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.250> front<00:02:57.550> no

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
what if I put an underscore in front no

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.200 
what if I put an underscore in front no
how<00:02:58.570> about<00:02:58.600> if<00:03:00.600> if<00:03:01.600> frames<00:03:02.560> loaded<00:03:03.220> equal

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
how about if if frames loaded equal

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.210 
how about if if frames loaded equal
equals<00:03:04.830> 114<00:03:06.090> there<00:03:07.090> are<00:03:07.440> 114<00:03:08.440> frames<00:03:08.830> in<00:03:09.070> my

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
equals 114 there are 114 frames in my

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.890 
equals 114 there are 114 frames in my
movie<00:03:10.709> huh<00:03:11.820> alright<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.120> let's<00:03:13.300> try<00:03:13.600> this<00:03:13.660> out

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
movie huh alright so let's try this out

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.650 
movie huh alright so let's try this out
again<00:03:14.459> how<00:03:15.459> about<00:03:15.700> if<00:03:16.590> underscore<00:03:17.590> root<00:03:18.660> dot

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
again how about if underscore root dot

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.110 
again how about if underscore root dot
frames<00:03:20.290> loaded<00:03:20.800> equals<00:03:21.760> 114<00:03:23.459> right<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.910> root

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
frames loaded equals 114 right the root

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.260 
frames loaded equals 114 right the root
timeline<00:03:25.720> if<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.620> root<00:03:26.830> timeline<00:03:27.340> equal<00:03:27.610> 114

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
timeline if the root timeline equal 114

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.580 
timeline if the root timeline equal 114
go<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.870> play<00:03:28.930> 10<00:03:29.320> else<00:03:30.250> go<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.880> play<00:03:31.180> one

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
go to and play 10 else go to a play one

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.830 
go to and play 10 else go to a play one
ok<00:03:32.700> control<00:03:33.700> enter

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.190 

okay<00:03:39.590> yeah<00:03:39.800> that's<00:03:40.099> not<00:03:40.310> working

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
okay yeah that's not working

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.010 
okay yeah that's not working
you

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.320 

so<00:03:50.020> we<00:03:50.110> have<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.320> try<00:03:50.500> something<00:03:50.800> else<00:03:51.330> and

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
so we have to try something else and

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.130 
so we have to try something else and
about<00:03:52.600> route<00:03:54.420> dot<00:03:55.420> go<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.840> inflate<00:03:56.500> n<00:03:58.140> yeah

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
about route dot go to inflate n yeah

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:07.280 
about route dot go to inflate n yeah
looks<00:03:59.470> good

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:21.659 

and<00:04:08.290> that's<00:04:08.709> not<00:04:08.830> working

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.710 

great<00:04:22.669> I<00:04:22.880> solved<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:23.419> problem<00:04:24.729> if<00:04:25.729> and<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:26.539> can

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
great I solved the problem if and I can

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.570 
great I solved the problem if and I can
probably<00:04:26.870> get<00:04:27.110> rid<00:04:27.259> of<00:04:27.320> frames<00:04:27.680> loaded<00:04:28.250> root

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
probably get rid of frames loaded root

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.659 
probably get rid of frames loaded root
get<00:04:29.090> rid<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.300> root<00:04:29.650> get<00:04:30.650> rid<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:30.830> route<00:04:31.070> there<00:04:31.460> I

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
get rid of root get rid of route there I

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.320 
get rid of root get rid of route there I
said<00:04:32.419> if<00:04:32.960> frames<00:04:33.380> loaded<00:04:33.860> is<00:04:33.979> greater<00:04:34.639> than<00:04:35.000> or

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
said if frames loaded is greater than or

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.900 
said if frames loaded is greater than or
equal<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:36.100> 114<00:04:37.120> let's<00:04:38.120> try<00:04:38.389> that<00:04:39.009> boom<00:04:40.009> we<00:04:40.729> go

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
equal to 114 let's try that boom we go

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.409 
equal to 114 let's try that boom we go
right<00:04:40.940> there<00:04:41.530> okay<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.820> it<00:04:44.120> took<00:04:44.240> a<00:04:44.300> little

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
right there okay so it took a little

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.409 
right there okay so it took a little
playing<00:04:45.020> with<00:04:45.259> but<00:04:45.889> if<00:04:46.130> frames<00:04:46.789> loaded

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
playing with but if frames loaded

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.070 
playing with but if frames loaded
capital<00:04:47.930> l<00:04:48.110> is<00:04:48.830> greater<00:04:49.190> than<00:04:49.490> or<00:04:49.669> equal<00:04:49.759> to

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
capital l is greater than or equal to

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.010 
capital l is greater than or equal to
114<00:04:51.080> there<00:04:51.470> is<00:04:51.620> 114<00:04:52.400> frames<00:04:52.699> in<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:52.940> movie<00:04:53.270> go

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
114 there is 114 frames in the movie go

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.320 
114 there is 114 frames in the movie go
to<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.349> play<00:04:54.380> frame<00:04:54.770> 10<00:04:55.039> else<00:04:55.370> go<00:04:55.759> to<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.240> play

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
to and play frame 10 else go to and play

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.860 
to and play frame 10 else go to and play
one<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:58.610> works<00:04:59.050> okay<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:02.270> you<00:05:02.479> can<00:05:02.660> see

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
one and that works okay and you can see

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.140 
one and that works okay and you can see
that<00:05:02.900> it<00:05:03.139> flashes<00:05:03.680> for<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:03.919> while<00:05:04.190> on<00:05:04.550> that<00:05:04.849> and

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
that it flashes for a while on that and

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.830 
that it flashes for a while on that and
then<00:05:05.389> goes<00:05:05.630> there<00:05:05.990> now<00:05:06.590> if<00:05:06.860> you<00:05:07.669> don't<00:05:08.479> like

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
then goes there now if you don't like

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.900

the white background and I'm not digging

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.550 
the white background and I'm not digging
that<00:05:11.180> white<00:05:11.389> background<00:05:11.960> what<00:05:12.139> I<00:05:12.169> might<00:05:12.380> do<00:05:12.530> is

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
that white background what I might do is

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.680 
that white background what I might do is
click<00:05:12.889> on<00:05:13.009> my<00:05:13.160> background<00:05:13.639> layer<00:05:13.849> click<00:05:14.509> on
