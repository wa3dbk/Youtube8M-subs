00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.130
Just look at this soil: Dry as a bone.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.030
This drought across the country is affecting
everyone.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.770
And if you don't believe it just wait until
you see grocery prices going up.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.300
That's why I wanted to talk about managing
your garden the best possible way.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.220
You can still pull it through the drought.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.950
But with vegetables, you wanna make sure that
you're doing certain things right.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.580
They gotta have water.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.480
You see, water is essential.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.140
Unlike some plants, vegetables cannot respond
to a drought by simply going dormant.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.649
They just die.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.600
You just wanna make sure that the plants have
consistent water.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.920
It's best to water in the early, early morning.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.829
You wanna deep soak the soil around the plants.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.850
Avoid any water contact on the leaves.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.870
You really just wanna soak the soil.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.260
And be consistent.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.300
Don't let the plants dry out and then come
in and water and expect to save them.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.989
They're not gonna produce any fruit if you
let them become dry.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.510
You also wanna eradicate any weeds as soon
as they appear.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.070
Avoid letting weeds spread as they're gonna
compete for the water that your vegetables

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.070
need.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.000
Now to conserve some of that moisture, you
can place an organic mulch such as grass clippings

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.570
or leaves or straw or pine needles around
your vegetables to reduce the loss of water

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.570
to evaporation.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.340
And when you apply the mulch, you wanna at
least put down quarter of an inch.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.469
I'd recommend two or three, actually.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.390
So you may be asking, "How do I keep the soil
consistently moist?"

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.409
Well, you can water your vegetables with a
soaker hose.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.710
You see, this hose has perforations along
its length.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.549
Place the hose along the rows of plants, water
at a low pressure for about 15 to 20 minutes,

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.250
again, early in the morning.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.450
Also, take advantage of Mother Nature.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.149
If you don't have a rain collection system,
install one.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.590
Place a rain collection barrel under the gutters
to collect rain and use it to water your garden.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.310
And when caring for your containers, one thing
to think about is move them into some shade.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.820
All they need is morning sun when it's as
hot as it is.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.820
And water them regularly.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.429
And to help conserve water, think about using
a drip irrigation system.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.930
And most certainly, put a saucer under them
to conserve that water.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.010
Now we've talked about how to keep your plants
from stressing out in the heat, how about

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.260
some tips for us humans?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.080
My friend Brian Smith from the National Weather
Service has some tips that we should all think

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080
about.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.300
One of things that we encourage people to
do during periods of hot weather like in a

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.980
drought is to stay hydrated.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.120
Drink plenty of non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated
beverages.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.190
Avoid being outside during the hottest part
of the day, which is usually mid to late afternoon.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.120
If you have to be outside, take frequent breaks.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.280
Wear lightweight, light colored and loose
fitting clothing.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.060
Make sure your watering your plants.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:15.000
If possible, avoid watering during peak hours.
