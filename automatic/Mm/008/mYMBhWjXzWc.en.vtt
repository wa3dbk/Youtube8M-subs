I thought somebody wouldn't just stand
at<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.310> top<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.639> ladder<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.120> couldn't

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
at the top of the ladder so I couldn't

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.660 
at the top of the ladder so I couldn't
use<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.569> lot<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.079> when<00:02:52.290> giant<00:02:53.250> explosive

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
use a lot of it when giant explosive

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.050 
use a lot of it when giant explosive
aliens<00:02:54.180> are<00:02:54.450> attacking<00:02:54.689> me<00:02:55.430> got<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.609> part<00:02:56.879> do

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
aliens are attacking me got that part do

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.039 
aliens are attacking me got that part do
you<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.269> part<00:02:57.599> where<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.870> wouldn't

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
you like that part where you wouldn't

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.539 
you like that part where you wouldn't
let<00:02:58.170> me<00:02:58.230> up<00:02:58.439> the<00:02:58.560> ladder<00:02:58.769> so<00:02:59.129> then<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> game

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
let me up the ladder so then the game

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.360 
let me up the ladder so then the game
released<00:02:59.909> more<00:03:00.359> explosive<00:03:00.930> aliens<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:02.220> be

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
released more explosive aliens to be

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.819 
released more explosive aliens to be
honest<00:03:02.669> that<00:03:02.849> was<00:03:02.879> my<00:03:03.120> favorite<00:03:03.450> part<00:03:03.650> got<00:03:04.650> it

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
honest that was my favorite part got it

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.360 
honest that was my favorite part got it
could<00:03:05.340> be<00:03:05.430> perfectly<00:03:05.849> honest<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.739> far<00:03:07.980> it

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
could be perfectly honest so far it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.429 
could be perfectly honest so far it
seems<00:03:08.849> like<00:03:09.510> they<00:03:09.689> haven't<00:03:09.900> really<00:03:10.049> changed

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
seems like they haven't really changed

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.750 
seems like they haven't really changed
that<00:03:10.799> apart<00:03:11.189> from<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.370> weapon<00:03:11.639> customization

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
that apart from the weapon customization

to the threat game in this trilogy is

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.179 
to the threat game in this trilogy is
kind<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.060> crazy<00:03:54.409> especially<00:03:55.409> when<00:03:55.829> the

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
kind of crazy especially when the

kind of crazy especially when the
learning<00:03:56.459> curve<00:03:56.549> is<00:03:56.729> for<00:03:56.939> what<00:03:57.060> should<00:03:57.269> be

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
learning curve is for what should be

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.629 
learning curve is for what should be
pretty<00:03:57.569> simple<00:03:57.840> things<00:03:58.229> that's<00:03:59.129> dead<00:03:59.400> space<00:03:59.609> 3

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
pretty simple things that's dead space 3

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.189 
pretty simple things that's dead space 3
it's<00:04:00.090> all<00:04:00.209> about<00:04:00.419> not<00:04:00.750> knowing<00:04:00.930> what<00:04:01.109> the

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
it's all about not knowing what the

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.050 
it's all about not knowing what the
hell's<00:04:01.379> going<00:04:01.650> on<00:04:01.769> sure<00:04:02.609> it'll<00:04:02.759> make<00:04:02.909> some
