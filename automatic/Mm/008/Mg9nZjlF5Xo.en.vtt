again here from Earl Strickland 11-4 and
as<00:00:31.530> you<00:00:31.650> were<00:00:31.770> saying

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.190 
as you were saying

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.310 
as you were saying
Zion<00:00:32.970> did<00:00:33.300> put<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.810> little<00:00:34.110> bit<00:00:34.200> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
Zion did put you in a little bit of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.900 
Zion did put you in a little bit of
pressure<00:00:34.530> Leon<00:00:35.070> DeNiro

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
pressure Leon DeNiro

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.290 
pressure Leon DeNiro
yeah<00:00:36.360> he's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.900> good<00:00:37.110> player<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.239> kind<00:00:39.239> of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
yeah he's a good player and I kind of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.850 
yeah he's a good player and I kind of
got<00:00:39.480> him<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> safety<00:00:40.230> game<00:00:40.380> a<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.620> bit

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
got him in the safety game a little bit

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.020 
got him in the safety game a little bit
and<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.070> think<00:00:41.130> that<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> difference<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and I think that was the difference in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.840 
and I think that was the difference in
the<00:00:42.150> match<00:00:42.470> yeah<00:00:43.470> he<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> mean<00:00:44.340> couple<00:00:44.670> dry

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the match yeah he I mean couple dry

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090 
the match yeah he I mean couple dry
breaks<00:00:45.180> earlier<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.650> struggled

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
breaks earlier on and you struggled

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
breaks earlier on and you struggled
through<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.640> looked<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:47.970> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
through a little bit looked like you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.820 
through a little bit looked like you
were<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.900> know<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.050> were<00:00:49.140> testing<00:00:49.680> yourself

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
were you know you were testing yourself

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.320 
were you know you were testing yourself
but<00:00:50.280> I'll<00:00:50.370> tell<00:00:50.580> you<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.820> end<00:00:50.970> you<00:00:51.120> found

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
but I'll tell you at the end you found

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.420 
but I'll tell you at the end you found
another<00:00:51.480> gear<00:00:51.900> yeah<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.590> was<00:00:52.800> braking<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
another gear yeah I was braking with the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
another gear yeah I was braking with the
other<00:00:53.610> stick<00:00:53.970> and<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.270> was<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:55.140> one's

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
other stick and it was that one's

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.110 
other stick and it was that one's
extremely<00:00:55.800> heavy<00:00:56.010> compared<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:56.970> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
extremely heavy compared to this one and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.560 
extremely heavy compared to this one and
I<00:00:58.020> think<00:00:58.589> the<00:00:59.129> lighter<00:00:59.339> cue<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.940> helping<00:01:00.480> me

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
I think the lighter cue was helping me

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.880 
I think the lighter cue was helping me
get<00:01:00.720> through<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:00.960> hands<00:01:01.290> through<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.589> shot

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
get through my hands through the shot

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.680 
get through my hands through the shot
better<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.400> break<00:01:02.610> that's<00:01:03.089> that<00:01:03.420> was<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
better on the break that's that was the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.490 
better on the break that's that was the
difference<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> end

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
difference in the end

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
difference in the end
