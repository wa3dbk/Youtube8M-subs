00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.849 
two elastics that is where you ps3 slim
goes<00:03:21.579> so<00:03:22.090> let's<00:03:22.269> take<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.319> put<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.650> in

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
goes so let's take that and put it in

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.830 
goes so let's take that and put it in
and<00:03:24.609> the<00:03:24.700> elastics<00:03:25.180> are<00:03:25.329> there<00:03:25.450> so<00:03:25.630> it<00:03:25.690> doesn't

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
and the elastics are there so it doesn't

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.650 
and the elastics are there so it doesn't
slide<00:03:26.169> around<00:03:26.200> right<00:03:27.160> like<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.389> fits

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
slide around right like that and it fits

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.559 
slide around right like that and it fits
all<00:03:29.109> nice<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:29.950> good<00:03:30.340> then<00:03:31.120> we're<00:03:31.419> going<00:03:31.540> to

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
all nice and good then we're going to

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.940 
all nice and good then we're going to
throw<00:03:31.780> in<00:03:31.870> some<00:03:31.900> games<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:32.500> we<00:03:32.650> got<00:03:32.769> these<00:03:32.889> two

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
throw in some games so we got these two

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.599 
throw in some games so we got these two
pouches<00:03:33.370> up<00:03:33.760> here<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.389> each<00:03:34.720> pouch<00:03:35.400> can<00:03:36.400> hold

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
pouches up here and each pouch can hold

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.400 
pouches up here and each pouch can hold
two<00:03:36.849> games<00:03:37.859> which<00:03:38.859> is<00:03:39.069> nice<00:03:39.870> now<00:03:40.870> they<00:03:41.079> are<00:03:41.230> did

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
two games which is nice now they are did

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.800 
two games which is nice now they are did
you<00:03:41.440> fit<00:03:41.739> in<00:03:41.859> a<00:03:41.919> bit<00:03:42.099> snug<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.730> then<00:03:42.940> the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
you fit in a bit snug and then the

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.479 
you fit in a bit snug and then the
elastics<00:03:44.319> will<00:03:44.440> stretch<00:03:44.769> out<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.040> little<00:03:45.280> bit

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
elastics will stretch out a little bit

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.520 
elastics will stretch out a little bit
so<00:03:45.700> it'll<00:03:45.849> be<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.030> little<00:03:46.209> bit<00:03:46.329> easier<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.500> more

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
so it'll be a little bit easier the more

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.949 
so it'll be a little bit easier the more
you<00:03:47.739> use<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.310> bag<00:03:48.519> but<00:03:49.120> it's<00:03:49.239> probably<00:03:49.510> good

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
you use the bag but it's probably good

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.720 
you use the bag but it's probably good
to<00:03:50.169> have<00:03:50.349> it<00:03:50.530> tighter<00:03:50.799> than<00:03:51.040> looser<00:03:51.489> because

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
to have it tighter than looser because

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.400 
to have it tighter than looser because
you<00:03:51.819> want<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:52.150> stuff<00:03:52.299> all<00:03:52.599> flipping<00:03:53.260> and

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
you want this stuff all flipping and

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.039 
you want this stuff all flipping and
flopping<00:03:53.590> around<00:03:53.889> in<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.849> case<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.810> there<00:03:55.959> we

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
flopping around in the case so there we

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:56.460 
flopping around in the case so there we
go

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
go

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.240 
go
we<00:03:56.769> got<00:03:56.950> our<00:03:57.099> four<00:03:57.340> games<00:03:57.669> in<00:03:57.940> there
