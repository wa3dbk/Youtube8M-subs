00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.650
 and let's go 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.550
 and let's see if with a tube we have 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.430
 we're all going to do it with one and the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.730
 I'm going to do the tubing 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 hair 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.980
 we even reach to see we can not reach 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.980
 watch 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.200
 although what the base so the sun or the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.050
 hair up 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.960
 but I give it a turn two turns 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.410
 and on the third round I'm going to put the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.410
 little paper 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.510
 now the tips 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.710
 and rolled 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.600
 and I put the butterfly 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.120
 if I want in this part of here I can 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.330
 put another tube so that once the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.330
 hair are molded since I'm going to make them 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.690
 for the paper 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.340
 important I wear it 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.340
 and on the roll in this way 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.549
 there is an emotion of grabbing it 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.899
 great though here with our second 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.899
 tube 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.360
 and we can do the same as installed 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.190
 and I'm just going to grab the tube that the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.190
 hair that has just been cut 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.390
 here city be separated all 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.450
 in the first part it hits 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.450
 in radio 2 and the third 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.789
 I put the paper 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.590
 and they ended up rolling and I put a 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.500
 little more there for him to do 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.610
 space where to put the new tube that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.310
 is going to be this one that I'm going to put 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.830
 continuation 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.830
 and I'm also going to comb it up 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.520
 I put it behind the hair and roll it 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.150
 nothing else the new hair that is 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.150
 just put 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.970
 and I put the piece of paper 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.340
 at least to roll 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.150
 there are a few that were left 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.310
 they are going to leave I put another paper 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.620
 term relief and this has to be 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.640
 the same height of 8 for what 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.569
 it combs well at the moment of 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.319
 that the defeat is going to be 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.189
 and he left it for a little bit for two minutes 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.189
 less 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.520
 it's been two minutes and I'm going to 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.120
 get first with the first one that I put 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.980
 that was the one above and I'm going to 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.890
 unrolling little by little 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.890
 to see that it has already become wavy 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.220
 Well, there you can see this from home. 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.709
 on the side to which it faces opposite which 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.300
 it means that he needs time and 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.310
 because I'm not going to put the engine back 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.910
 to put another high that is more 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.910
 hot 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.970
 so do not give more until now 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.910
 and there I put the piece of paper 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.520
 This is going to take the pieces of paper 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.050
 in the ray 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.750
 It usually happens there I put another 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.990
 and good here I am already of new accounts 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.720
 with another tube because as they saw they know 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.150
 I above 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.700
 put the pieces of paper so that the tips 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.890
 stay inside and come celebrate in the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.360
 senate 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.209
 I want 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.209
 and I'll hold it again 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.410
 and I wait another 34 minutes 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.960
 well let's check again 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.960
 it was already three minutes 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.680
 to her it can be said that the 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.170
 done and if this is already football 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:49.230
 but what we mean is that the 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:51.840
 Immediately knitted fabric is ready and no longer 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.020
 it would be enough to wait one or two more minutes 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.910
 to remove the next side is 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.430
 again a little bit, they are already 2 min 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.260
 here I can put more a tube to this 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.470
 that is a little more straight from all the 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.240
 hair and if I'm going to put it on what 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.580
 is ready this I'll put you nothing else 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.580
 to this part of here point and tomÃ¡s 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.250
 although I'm going to take our 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.250
 following 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.370
 this force when we put in 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.020
 installed and if you're already in second want 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.180
 say that the first one obviously obviously already 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.260
 quite this too 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.810
 here is our 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.880
 fringe there are people that what they do is 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.310
 than restoring the fringe and then you 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.080
 this hair bands 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.120
 it can also be done but in this case 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.580
 As you are going to comb, it is preferable that 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.830
 have little hair up to cover the 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.690
 new and hairs down so that also the 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.980
 that the others were already put in this way 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:11.700
 natural I will remove the other 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.440
 and there was our fringe already made and 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.060
 made the person is going to 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.190
 put her what is going to make her 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.250
 will form with your hair so that it 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.990
 it's going to be what it is, it's the crepe 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.300
 and then either comb it like that towards 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.410
 behind 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.110
 just like that you will find it with your 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.530
 hair here I 'm not going to tell you how 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.140
 your hair would be combed 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.270
 in this way obviously here goes to 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.100
 Bring spray and carry spray this already 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.790
 is going to be accommodated in the way that 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.790
 I need 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:48.120
 and the fringe and automatically disappears 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.840
 even for the whole it will look good 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:04.480
 a wig yes 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.169
 although we have our final result 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:12.220
 the wig that once had fringes 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:14.380
 Well, he does not have it anymore, thanks 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.830
 I hope you liked the tutorial of 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.830
 today
