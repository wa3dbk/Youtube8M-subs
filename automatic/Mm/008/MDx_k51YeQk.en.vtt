robots and production quality wise it's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.650 
robots and production quality wise it's
on<00:00:48.140> par<00:00:48.739> with<00:00:48.770> Hasbro<00:00:49.190> it's<00:00:49.790> pretty<00:00:50.239> much<00:00:50.420> the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
on par with Hasbro it's pretty much the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.040 
on par with Hasbro it's pretty much the
same<00:00:50.690> sort<00:00:51.290> of<00:00:51.410> scale<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.280> Stern<00:00:52.850> style<00:00:53.329> it's

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
very tough hard wearing plastic and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.470 
very tough hard wearing plastic and
these<00:00:57.079> are<00:00:57.290> fairly<00:00:57.530> popular<00:00:57.800> in<00:00:58.129> China<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.239> I

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
these are fairly popular in China so I

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.240 
these are fairly popular in China so I
thought<00:00:59.840> I'd<00:00:59.930> have<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.079> look<00:01:00.290> at<00:01:00.440> one<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:00.890> is

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
thought I'd have a look at one this is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.180 
thought I'd have a look at one this is
them<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:02.270> voyager<00:01:02.989> scaled<00:01:03.500> version<00:01:03.950> they<00:01:04.129> do

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
them the voyager scaled version they do

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.420 
them the voyager scaled version they do
a<00:01:04.399> deluxe<00:01:05.149> and<00:01:05.539> a<00:01:05.690> scout<00:01:05.930> version<00:01:06.350> as<00:01:06.500> well<00:01:06.649> and

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
a deluxe and a scout version as well and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.770 
a deluxe and a scout version as well and
yeah<00:01:07.550> I<00:01:07.610> thought<00:01:07.759> I'd<00:01:07.910> go<00:01:08.090> for<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.390> Voyager

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
yeah I thought I'd go for the Voyager

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.660 
yeah I thought I'd go for the Voyager
cuz<00:01:08.899> I<00:01:08.960> have<00:01:09.200> some<00:01:09.470> pretty<00:01:09.860> cool<00:01:09.950> transformer

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
cuz I have some pretty cool transformer

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.440 
cuz I have some pretty cool transformer
voyages<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.450> yeah<00:01:12.050> this<00:01:12.950> is<00:01:13.340> his<00:01:13.670> first<00:01:14.180> mode

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
voyages and yeah this is his first mode

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.290 
voyages and yeah this is his first mode
which<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.140> tank<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:16.640> case<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:16.970> hadn't

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
which is a tank in case you hadn't

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.420 
which is a tank in case you hadn't
guessed<00:01:17.600> just<00:01:18.380> taking<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.770> look<00:01:18.979> around<00:01:19.160> the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
guessed just taking a look around the

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.609 
guessed just taking a look around the
entirety<00:01:19.910> of<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.299> tank<00:01:20.540> you've<00:01:20.750> got<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.200> H

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
entirety of the tank you've got the H

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.010 
entirety of the tank you've got the H
style<00:01:22.400> that<00:01:23.330> we<00:01:23.390> seem<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.570> be<00:01:23.630> getting<00:01:23.750> with<00:01:23.990> a

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
style that we seem to be getting with a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.260 
style that we seem to be getting with a
lot<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.909> Transformers<00:01:25.909> these<00:01:26.060> days

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
lot of Transformers these days

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.550 
lot of Transformers these days
everything<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:26.659> kind<00:01:26.869> of<00:01:26.900> hard-hit<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.409> think

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
everything is kind of hard-hit I think

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.310 
everything is kind of hard-hit I think
hardhead<00:01:27.950> was<00:01:28.070> probably<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.520> first<00:01:28.820> H<00:01:29.810> styled

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
hardhead was probably the first H styled

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.260 
hardhead was probably the first H styled
tank<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:30.950> we<00:01:31.189> had<00:01:31.490> their<00:01:31.700> various<00:01:32.000> others

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
tank then we had their various others

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.710 
tank then we had their various others
like<00:01:32.420> Armada<00:01:32.960> Megatron<00:01:33.680> etc<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:34.640> yeah<00:01:35.090> it's<00:01:35.600> a

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
like Armada Megatron etc but yeah it's a

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.660 
like Armada Megatron etc but yeah it's a
fairly<00:01:35.930> good<00:01:36.049> tank<00:01:36.259> mode<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:36.680> joint<00:01:37.369> on<00:01:37.610> the

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
fairly good tank mode the joint on the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.730 
fairly good tank mode the joint on the
actual<00:01:38.090> turret<00:01:38.420> itself<00:01:38.570> is<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.259> little<00:01:39.650> bit

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
actual turret itself is a little bit

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.570 
actual turret itself is a little bit
loose<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.670> we<00:01:41.299> use<00:01:41.540> it<00:01:41.750> for<00:01:41.780> another<00:01:42.580> variation

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
loose so we use it for another variation

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.060 
loose so we use it for another variation
when<00:01:43.939> we<00:01:44.030> transform<00:01:44.479> him<00:01:44.689> into<00:01:44.840> his<00:01:45.320> scorpion

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
when we transform him into his scorpion

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.280 
when we transform him into his scorpion
mode<00:01:46.280> but<00:01:47.000> all-in-all<00:01:47.270> it's<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.900> fairly

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
mode but all-in-all it's a fairly

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.080 
mode but all-in-all it's a fairly
substantial<00:01:48.619> figure<00:01:49.189> it's<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.520> fairly<00:01:49.820> nice

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
substantial figure it's a fairly nice

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.420 
substantial figure it's a fairly nice
size<00:01:50.540> as<00:01:50.990> well<00:01:51.170> as<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.560> masterpiece<00:01:51.950> figures<00:01:52.310> to

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
size as well as a masterpiece figures to

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.100 
size as well as a masterpiece figures to
give<00:01:52.549> you<00:01:52.610> an<00:01:52.700> idea<00:01:52.790> of<00:01:53.000> scale<00:01:53.180> see<00:01:53.600> he<00:01:53.720> is<00:01:53.930> a

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
give you an idea of scale see he is a

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.100 
give you an idea of scale see he is a
really<00:01:54.380> good<00:01:54.579> voyager<00:01:55.579> scale<00:01:56.119> transformation

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
really good voyager scale transformation

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.050 
really good voyager scale transformation
he<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.829> fairly<00:01:58.130> straightforward<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.759> this<00:01:58.909> guy

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
he is fairly straightforward on this guy

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.030 
he is fairly straightforward on this guy
you<00:01:59.630> want<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.869> pull<00:02:00.320> out<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.470> these<00:02:00.770> sections

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
you want to pull out to these sections

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.450 
you want to pull out to these sections
here<00:02:01.450> rotate<00:02:02.450> those<00:02:02.570> round<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.200> pull<00:02:03.979> out<00:02:04.130> the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
here rotate those round and pull out the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.510 
here rotate those round and pull out the
claws<00:02:05.119> do<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:06.229> both<00:02:06.439> sides<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:06.979> slide<00:02:07.310> that

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
claws do that both sides so slide that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.190 
claws do that both sides so slide that
out<00:02:10.209> alright<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:11.769> rotate<00:02:12.769> pull<00:02:13.579> that<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.200> pull

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
out alright so rotate pull that and pull

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.699 
out alright so rotate pull that and pull
that<00:02:15.519> come<00:02:16.519> around<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.150> tank<00:02:17.420> turret<00:02:17.709> fold

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
that come around to the tank turret fold

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.259 
that come around to the tank turret fold
that<00:02:18.829> up<00:02:18.950> at<00:02:19.070> that<00:02:19.190> hinge<00:02:19.430> round<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.090> then

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
that up at that hinge round and then

and there we have scorpion kind of tank
mode<00:02:53.560> again<00:02:54.560> it's<00:02:54.800> probably<00:02:54.950> not<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.490> most

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
mode again it's probably not the most

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.860 
mode again it's probably not the most
creative<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:57.340> transformations<00:02:58.340> but<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.750> know

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
creative of transformations but you know

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.560 
creative of transformations but you know
it<00:03:00.230> works<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.280> think<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.700> it's<00:03:02.180> reminiscent

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
it works I think it's it's reminiscent

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.720 
it works I think it's it's reminiscent
of<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.870> scorpion<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:03.440> it's<00:03:03.890> no<00:03:04.130> less

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
of a scorpion and it's no less

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.760 
of a scorpion and it's no less
scorpion<00:03:05.330> like<00:03:05.600> than<00:03:05.870> what<00:03:06.020> we<00:03:06.170> got<00:03:06.410> with<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
scorpion like than what we got with the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.979 
scorpion like than what we got with the

you<00:03:09.560> know<00:03:09.739> for<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.070> small<00:03:10.430> Voyager<00:03:10.850> figure<00:03:11.150> it's

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
you know for a small Voyager figure it's

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.949 
you know for a small Voyager figure it's
in<00:03:12.470> essence<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.220> triple<00:03:13.700> changer<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.420> kind

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
in essence a triple changer and I kind

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.780 
in essence a triple changer and I kind
of<00:03:15.020> like<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.470> Scorpion<00:03:15.800> are<00:03:16.040> done<00:03:16.430> with<00:03:16.610> maybe

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
of like the Scorpion are done with maybe

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.150 
of like the Scorpion are done with maybe
some<00:03:17.090> sort<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.630> facial<00:03:18.170> features<00:03:18.830> something

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
some sort of facial features something

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.949 
some sort of facial features something
on<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> front<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.760> Scorpion<00:03:20.180> mode<00:03:20.390> or

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
on the front of the Scorpion mode or

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.340 
on the front of the Scorpion mode or
maybe<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.410> slightly<00:03:21.950> longer<00:03:22.930> extending<00:03:23.930> tank

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
maybe a slightly longer extending tank

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.160 
maybe a slightly longer extending tank
turret<00:03:24.830> but<00:03:25.520> all<00:03:26.180> in<00:03:26.330> all<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.660> think<00:03:26.810> the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
turret but all in all I think the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.560 
turret but all in all I think the
Scorpion<00:03:27.620> mode<00:03:27.800> does<00:03:28.100> kind<00:03:28.459> of<00:03:28.610> work<00:03:28.760> now<00:03:29.510> to

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
Scorpion mode does kind of work now to

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.210 
Scorpion mode does kind of work now to
get<00:03:29.900> him<00:03:29.989> into<00:03:30.290> bot<00:03:30.560> mode<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.890> want<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.040> fold

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
get him into bot mode you want to fold

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.880 
get him into bot mode you want to fold
up<00:03:31.810> these<00:03:32.810> leg<00:03:33.050> sections<00:03:33.380> again<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.709> place

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
up these leg sections again and place

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.259 
up these leg sections again and place
those<00:03:34.100> back<00:03:34.430> where<00:03:34.670> they<00:03:34.760> were<00:03:36.220> like<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:37.400> come

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
those back where they were like so come

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.360 
those back where they were like so come
round<00:03:38.510> these<00:03:38.870> legs<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.440> just<00:03:40.010> pull<00:03:40.190> them<00:03:40.310> down

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
round these legs I just pull them down

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.330 
round these legs I just pull them down
and<00:03:40.549> extend<00:03:41.000> them<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:41.630> pull<00:03:42.260> out<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.860> foot

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
and extend them and pull out the foot

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.380

to<00:04:30.950> fold<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.430> down<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.850> does<00:04:32.000> look<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.210> bit

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
to fold that down it does look a bit

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.330 
to fold that down it does look a bit
silly<00:04:32.600> facing<00:04:33.110> up<00:04:33.260> on<00:04:33.410> that<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.710> was<00:04:34.070> hoping

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
silly facing up on that I was hoping

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
silly facing up on that I was hoping
that<00:04:34.400> there<00:04:34.669> was<00:04:34.790> some<00:04:35.000> sort<00:04:35.330> of<00:04:36.460> other<00:04:37.460> plugin

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
that there was some sort of other plugin

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.719 
that there was some sort of other plugin
could<00:04:38.479> you<00:04:38.570> take<00:04:38.780> it<00:04:38.900> on<00:04:38.990> his<00:04:39.140> hand<00:04:39.610> give

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
could you take it on his hand give

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.540 
could you take it on his hand give
I<00:04:40.759> go<00:04:40.999> shall<00:04:41.240> we<00:04:41.360> there<00:04:42.259> we<00:04:42.319> go<00:04:42.439> there<00:04:43.219> we<00:04:43.249> go<00:04:43.309> we

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
I go shall we there we go there we go we

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.070 
I go shall we there we go there we go we
poke<00:04:43.759> it<00:04:43.849> on<00:04:43.939> his<00:04:44.029> hand<00:04:44.240> like<00:04:44.449> that<00:04:44.479> that<00:04:44.809> looks

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
poke it on his hand like that that looks

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.980 
poke it on his hand like that that looks
much<00:04:45.469> better<00:04:45.889> doesn't<00:04:46.099> it<00:04:46.279> there<00:04:46.999> we<00:04:47.360> go

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
much better doesn't it there we go

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.829 
much better doesn't it there we go
I<00:04:48.020> think<00:04:48.680> BOTS<00:04:49.159> mouths<00:04:49.430> probably<00:04:50.059> his<00:04:50.360> best

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:50.839 
I think BOTS mouths probably his best

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:53.769 
I think BOTS mouths probably his best
option<00:04:51.080> he<00:04:51.379> does<00:04:51.650> look<00:04:51.979> really<00:04:52.759> really<00:04:53.629> nice

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:53.779 
option he does look really really nice

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.679 
option he does look really really nice
in<00:04:54.139> this<00:04:54.499> mode<00:04:54.710> I<00:04:55.009> just<00:04:55.759> think<00:04:55.999> the<00:04:56.210> colors

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:56.689 
in this mode I just think the colors

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.119 
in this mode I just think the colors
work<00:04:56.900> really<00:04:57.199> well<00:04:57.379> it's<00:04:57.589> a<00:04:57.620> nice<00:04:57.770> contrast

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
work really well it's a nice contrast

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.269 
work really well it's a nice contrast
between<00:04:58.639> the<00:04:59.029> kind<00:04:59.300> of<00:04:59.330> aqua<00:04:59.809> resk<00:05:00.020> green<00:05:00.979> and

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
between the kind of aqua resk green and

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.659 
between the kind of aqua resk green and
the<00:05:01.789> gray<00:05:02.509> kind<00:05:02.900> of<00:05:03.020> shoulders<00:05:03.439> elbows<00:05:04.039> there

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
the gray kind of shoulders elbows there

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.089 
the gray kind of shoulders elbows there
I<00:05:04.699> like<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.419> tank<00:05:05.870> tracks<00:05:06.139> on<00:05:06.349> him<00:05:06.469> and<00:05:06.650> it's<00:05:06.949> a

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
I like the tank tracks on him and it's a

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.829 
I like the tank tracks on him and it's a
pretty<00:05:07.370> good<00:05:07.639> face<00:05:07.969> sculpt<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.479> him<00:05:08.569> as<00:05:08.659> well

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:08.839 
pretty good face sculpt on him as well

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.899 
pretty good face sculpt on him as well
now<00:05:09.169> we<00:05:09.289> are<00:05:09.469> somewhat<00:05:09.979> limited<00:05:10.339> with<00:05:10.819> the

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
now we are somewhat limited with the

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.610 
now we are somewhat limited with the
articulation<00:05:11.210> they're<00:05:11.749> not<00:05:12.050> up<00:05:12.199> to<00:05:12.409> kind<00:05:12.559> of

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
articulation they're not up to kind of

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.619 
articulation they're not up to kind of
the<00:05:12.680> Hasbro<00:05:13.129> standards<00:05:13.580> with<00:05:13.729> that<00:05:13.969> but<00:05:14.539> all

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:14.629 
the Hasbro standards with that but all

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:16.570 
the Hasbro standards with that but all
in<00:05:14.719> all<00:05:14.779> the<00:05:14.930> quality<00:05:15.319> is<00:05:15.499> pretty<00:05:15.889> darn<00:05:16.309> good

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
in all the quality is pretty darn good

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.519 
in all the quality is pretty darn good
taking<00:05:17.059> a<00:05:17.210> look<00:05:17.389> at<00:05:17.569> the<00:05:17.689> articulation<00:05:17.930> there

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:18.529 
taking a look at the articulation there

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:21.100 
taking a look at the articulation there
is<00:05:18.710> no<00:05:18.979> head<00:05:19.279> movement<00:05:19.729> at<00:05:19.819> all<00:05:19.849> you've<00:05:20.719> got<00:05:20.960> a

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
is no head movement at all you've got a

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.929 
is no head movement at all you've got a
nice<00:05:21.319> up-and-down<00:05:22.009> movement<00:05:22.370> on<00:05:22.430> shoulders

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
no very very slight in and that doesn't

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.969 
no very very slight in and that doesn't
really<00:05:26.479> go<00:05:26.689> up<00:05:26.719> very<00:05:27.199> high<00:05:27.439> that's<00:05:27.680> as<00:05:27.800> high

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
really go up very high that's as high

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:28.959 
really go up very high that's as high
you're<00:05:28.159> gonna<00:05:28.249> get<00:05:28.399> that<00:05:28.550> shoulder

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
there's a nice swivel there above the

there's a nice swivel there above the
bicep<00:05:31.659> really<00:05:32.659> nice<00:05:32.839> clicking<00:05:33.379> joint<00:05:33.800> on<00:05:34.009> the

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
bicep really nice clicking joint on the

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.389 
bicep really nice clicking joint on the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
move slightly in and out but often

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.159 
move slightly in and out but often
that's<00:05:39.289> just<00:05:39.710> due<00:05:40.069> to<00:05:40.099> the<00:05:40.309> transformation

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
that's just due to the transformation

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.889 
that's just due to the transformation
there<00:05:42.169> is<00:05:42.349> no<00:05:42.740> waist<00:05:43.249> swivel<00:05:43.719> really<00:05:44.719> nice

and<00:05:51.349> you<00:05:51.800> do<00:05:51.919> have<00:05:52.039> a<00:05:52.099> little<00:05:52.370> bit<00:05:52.580> of

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
and you do have a little bit of

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.850 
and you do have a little bit of
up-and-down<00:05:53.029> movement<00:05:53.449> on<00:05:53.599> the<00:05:53.959> toes<00:05:54.319> it

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:58.339 
suppose it's more g1 style articulation

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:59.800 
suppose it's more g1 style articulation
than<00:05:58.550> anything<00:05:58.819> else<00:05:59.089> now<00:05:59.330> of<00:05:59.389> course<00:05:59.509> we<00:05:59.689> do

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
than anything else now of course we do

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.300 
than anything else now of course we do
have<00:05:59.990> these<00:06:00.080> sections<00:06:00.560> on<00:06:00.649> the<00:06:00.709> back<00:06:00.860> here<00:06:01.129> and

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
have these sections on the back here and

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.949 
have these sections on the back here and
as<00:06:02.180> these<00:06:02.449> didn't<00:06:02.689> come<00:06:02.719> with<00:06:02.930> any

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:02.959 
as these didn't come with any

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:05.889 
as these didn't come with any
instructions<00:06:03.529> and<00:06:04.129> I'm<00:06:04.999> struggling<00:06:05.509> to<00:06:05.659> find

instructions and I'm struggling to find

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.439 
instructions and I'm struggling to find
out<00:06:06.020> a<00:06:06.050> great<00:06:06.110> deal<00:06:06.680> about<00:06:06.830> these<00:06:07.550> toys<00:06:07.789> I'm

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
out a great deal about these toys I'm

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.469 
out a great deal about these toys I'm
assuming<00:06:08.870> we<00:06:08.959> can<00:06:09.080> have<00:06:09.229> these<00:06:09.379> up<00:06:09.649> in<00:06:09.949> them<00:06:10.479> in

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
assuming we can have these up in them in

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.239 
assuming we can have these up in them in
robot<00:06:11.899> mode<00:06:11.930> there's<00:06:12.409> kind<00:06:12.649> of<00:06:12.709> cannons<00:06:13.099> I

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:13.249 
robot mode there's kind of cannons I

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:17.649 
robot mode there's kind of cannons I
guess<00:06:13.990> I<00:06:14.990> had<00:06:15.439> them<00:06:15.649> in<00:06:16.009> tank<00:06:16.669> and<00:06:16.939> scorpion

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
guess I had them in tank and scorpion

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:18.820 
guess I had them in tank and scorpion
mode<00:06:17.779> I<00:06:17.809> put<00:06:18.409> them<00:06:18.499> out<00:06:18.589> and<00:06:18.649> had<00:06:18.770> a<00:06:18.800> little

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
mode I put them out and had a little

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.339 
mode I put them out and had a little
play<00:06:19.159> I<00:06:19.339> didn't<00:06:19.879> didn't<00:06:20.209> look<00:06:20.389> very<00:06:20.870> good<00:06:21.110> in

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
play I didn't didn't look very good in

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.079 
play I didn't didn't look very good in
that<00:06:21.529> mode<00:06:21.709> but<00:06:21.979> I<00:06:22.159> suppose<00:06:22.459> like<00:06:22.669> this<00:06:22.879> they

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:23.089 
that mode but I suppose like this they

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:25.239 
that mode but I suppose like this they
could<00:06:23.270> be<00:06:23.419> kind<00:06:23.719> of<00:06:23.809> cannons<00:06:24.620> that<00:06:24.919> firing

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:25.249 
could be kind of cannons that firing

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:27.519 
could be kind of cannons that firing
from<00:06:25.610> his<00:06:25.729> shoulders<00:06:26.259> what<00:06:27.259> do<00:06:27.319> you<00:06:27.409> guys

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:27.529 
from his shoulders what do you guys

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:29.799 
from his shoulders what do you guys
think<00:06:27.589> let<00:06:28.370> me<00:06:28.399> know<00:06:28.520> and<00:06:29.300> of<00:06:29.419> course<00:06:29.629> there

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:29.809 
think let me know and of course there

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:32.350 
think let me know and of course there
are<00:06:29.990> more<00:06:30.439> of<00:06:30.740> the<00:06:30.949> Robo<00:06:31.550> Revolution<00:06:32.089> figures

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
are more of the Robo Revolution figures

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.219 
are more of the Robo Revolution figures
on<00:06:32.599> cert<00:06:32.959> eyes<00:06:33.909> this<00:06:34.909> guy<00:06:35.149> doesn't<00:06:35.599> combine

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:36.229 
on cert eyes this guy doesn't combine

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.049 
on cert eyes this guy doesn't combine
but<00:06:36.559> there's<00:06:36.740> a<00:06:36.800> huge<00:06:37.129> section<00:06:37.580> of<00:06:37.669> them<00:06:37.849> that

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:38.059 
but there's a huge section of them that

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:40.089 
but there's a huge section of them that
do<00:06:38.360> combine<00:06:38.689> and<00:06:39.229> they're<00:06:39.409> all<00:06:39.529> labeled<00:06:39.740> out

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:40.099 
do combine and they're all labeled out

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.949 
do combine and they're all labeled out
they<00:06:40.639> will<00:06:40.699> state<00:06:41.029> whether<00:06:41.270> they<00:06:41.419> combine<00:06:41.779> or

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:41.959 
they will state whether they combine or

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:43.269 
they will state whether they combine or
not<00:06:42.139> it's<00:06:42.289> generally<00:06:42.559> the<00:06:42.649> larger<00:06:43.069> scale

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:43.279 
not it's generally the larger scale

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:45.519 
not it's generally the larger scale
figures<00:06:43.669> that<00:06:43.849> do<00:06:43.999> combine<00:06:44.360> and<00:06:44.659> they<00:06:45.289> make

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:45.529 
figures that do combine and they make

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.519 
figures that do combine and they make
some<00:06:45.800> pretty<00:06:45.830> good<00:06:46.479> combiners<00:06:47.479> anyway<00:06:48.199> this

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:48.529 
some pretty good combiners anyway this

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:50.559 
some pretty good combiners anyway this
is<00:06:48.680> my<00:06:48.709> first<00:06:48.829> Robo<00:06:49.669> Revolution<00:06:50.120> figure<00:06:50.329> and<00:06:50.509> I

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:50.569 
is my first Robo Revolution figure and I

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:52.089 
is my first Robo Revolution figure and I
will<00:06:50.839> be<00:06:50.990> getting<00:06:51.229> some<00:06:51.500> more<00:06:51.529> I<00:06:51.740> just<00:06:51.829> think

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
will be getting some more I just think

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:54.159 
will be getting some more I just think
they<00:06:52.189> do<00:06:52.250> look<00:06:52.669> good<00:06:52.729> on<00:06:53.240> display<00:06:53.569> let's<00:06:53.779> spray

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
they do look good on display let's spray

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:55.749 
they do look good on display let's spray
in<00:06:54.379> Springer<00:06:55.129> to<00:06:55.219> give<00:06:55.340> you<00:06:55.400> a<00:06:55.460> size

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
comparison here he is if they are

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.649 
comparison here he is if they are
slightly<00:06:57.740> smaller<00:06:58.159> than<00:06:58.310> your<00:06:58.639> new<00:06:59.150> kind<00:06:59.599> of

slightly smaller than your new kind of

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:01.839 
slightly smaller than your new kind of
voyagers<00:07:00.169> but<00:07:00.650> I'm<00:07:00.830> gonna<00:07:00.979> have<00:07:01.159> these<00:07:01.310> was

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:01.849 
voyagers but I'm gonna have these was

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:04.029 
voyagers but I'm gonna have these was
kind<00:07:02.060> of<00:07:02.120> like<00:07:02.240> an<00:07:02.719> alternative<00:07:03.379> planet<00:07:03.860> that

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 
kind of like an alternative planet that

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:06.129 
kind of like an alternative planet that
the<00:07:04.189> the<00:07:05.060> Autobots<00:07:05.389> and<00:07:05.479> skeptic<00:07:05.870> cons<00:07:06.020> are

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
the the Autobots and skeptic cons are

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.070 
the the Autobots and skeptic cons are
kind<00:07:06.289> of<00:07:06.349> invaded<00:07:06.860> and<00:07:07.039> they<00:07:07.400> found<00:07:07.699> these

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
kind of invaded and they found these

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.179 
kind of invaded and they found these
alter<00:07:09.080> and<00:07:09.199> almost<00:07:09.469> go<00:07:09.710> BOTS<00:07:09.979> like

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:10.189 
alter and almost go BOTS like

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:14.260 
alter and almost go BOTS like
transformers<00:07:11.029> and<00:07:11.419> or<00:07:12.099> changing<00:07:13.099> robots<00:07:13.520> and

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
transformers and or changing robots and

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.670 
transformers and or changing robots and
yeah<00:07:14.779> that's<00:07:15.110> how<00:07:15.229> I'm<00:07:15.289> gonna<00:07:15.379> have<00:07:15.560> the

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
yeah that's how I'm gonna have the

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.369 
yeah that's how I'm gonna have the
display<00:07:16.009> set<00:07:16.340> up<00:07:16.550> so<00:07:17.240> all<00:07:17.389> in<00:07:17.569> all<00:07:17.659> a<00:07:17.870> very<00:07:17.900> nice

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:18.379 
display set up so all in all a very nice

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:20.980 
display set up so all in all a very nice
figure<00:07:18.620> really<00:07:19.189> well<00:07:19.310> made<00:07:19.490> and<00:07:19.990> it's

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:20.990 
figure really well made and it's

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.450 
figure really well made and it's
something<00:07:21.349> different<00:07:21.740> if<00:07:22.069> you're<00:07:22.129> looking

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
something different if you're looking

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.769 
something different if you're looking
for<00:07:22.580> something<00:07:22.909> a<00:07:22.969> little<00:07:23.270> bit<00:07:23.389> different

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:23.779 
for something a little bit different

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:26.200 
for something a little bit different
like<00:07:24.229> I<00:07:24.349> said<00:07:24.499> almost<00:07:24.650> gobots<00:07:25.370> esque<00:07:25.610> then

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.210 
like I said almost gobots esque then

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.540 
like I said almost gobots esque then
maybe<00:07:27.020> this<00:07:27.199> could<00:07:27.409> be<00:07:27.469> for<00:07:27.740> you<00:07:27.770> make<00:07:28.490> sure

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550 
maybe this could be for you make sure

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.339 
maybe this could be for you make sure
