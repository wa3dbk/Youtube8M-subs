00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.799
 Manage so the Bertolli is very 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.420
 exactly combined courses toward the front 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.210
 finally worked adequately 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.370
 somewhere I have my injury the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.740
 of course I cover with the gases 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.600
 either I have here or there below where 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.939
 also adorn it in that about it 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.510
 simply the simplicity of torture 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.060
 I can use normal buttle 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.340
 that is possible or I'm tearing myself 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 calls on the pad further as want 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:43.620
 which you will also find in the French bag 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:45.180
 a few bits from that is now must 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.989
 The flora looks like it has 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:54.300
 really an injury to it best 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.469
 you put that right through then lies 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.149
 It really matters and then it can 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.149
 no friction arise 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.560
 Of course, first of all, I get in contact with you 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.240
 from now on the thing is well padded 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.310
 Always check important when running 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 that should not slip out that should 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.840
 slipped out for some reasons 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.040
 to refill again 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.130
 sometimes the wound is on the thumb 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.310
 then bad injury was before 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.040
 Now I start my padding in u 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.880
 to take shape 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:39.979
 that's the way it works 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:43.070
 I cut you open 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.759
 just once around and start now the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.759
 to wrap up the entire fleet and in 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.270
 Eight tours from top right down 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:02:00.140
 left from bottom right to top left 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:10.610
 to the right and left this system 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:19.050
 The following really is the result 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:23.490
 a herringbone pattern all the nickelig 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.490
 until next but one link 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.810
 I'm sleeping that's why cares important 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.810
 steer for the next 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.830
 note 5 this is a difficult game 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.709
 and the same with the core i7 needs 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.690
 First, the padding I still have 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.860
 relatively loosely applied bin italics 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.640
 I can do that a bit more now 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.640
 penalties apply 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.569
 the customer can see that with the 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:09.120
 herringbone pattern also equal 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:11.900
 also for people in the garden 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.900
 build work 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.400
 You can actually get that in pharmacies 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.500
 I have them individually if I think so 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.180
 you have to be realistic or something 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.190
 but just buy again 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.660
 wrap around when the upholstery and 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.140
 You can be sure to watch out 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.260
 his 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.630
 that holds on this case now is the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.709
 so could the bund so synonymous 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.019
 to the vet walk 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.940
 that will not slip that happens 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.100
 not one pulls you down once insisted 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.280
 It's his turn because he stays tuned 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.450
 he probably when one is unsure 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.180
 to make another plaster on top 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.340
 tumors on over fur or down yet 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.300
 a little bit of plaster on it 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.090
 are not there quickly has is 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.160
 a small additional protection is the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.600
 Great bandage I had right 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.600
 Enjoy lowered
