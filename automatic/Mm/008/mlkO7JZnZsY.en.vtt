00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 well hello everyone friends today we 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.799
 you look at the novelty of the company kz 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.290
 These are new headphones and up to 9 came in such 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.300
 a box there inside us was greeted 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.509
 so packed box with headphones 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.520
 we'll see and then later a little later 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.060
 there was such a headphone case 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.220
 made under carbon in principle pretty 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 such an ordinary soundly such as mine 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.740
 separately served on aliexpress here 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.880
 mesh red here this lightning + well there 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:41.690
 there was still such a card 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:44.370
 then a sticker with the qr-code of the goat and up to 9 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.210
 aliexpress and there it is here 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.890
 Tinker in general, everything is clear with 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.230
 what's come let's look at the very 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.449
 box it looks like this very much 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.300
 nice such soft-touch plastic in Odessa 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.480
 you will see k and d e here probably 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.660
 in Chinese it is written I am such as in 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.900
 general line in the back of our characteristics 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.610
 headphone and then you can see here 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.290
 bottom chinese mix up with english 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.420
 but in principle here everything is clear a 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.100
 what they represent themselves by 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.409
 characteristics further opening up 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.509
 box we will see the headphones themselves 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.540
 decorated so here in foam rubber 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.070
 checks are hidden here and so 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.619
 case and written 01 food from 901 I do not know 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.720
 what does it mean in general so here it looks 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.630
 opening cleans this foam rubber we 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.210
 we find here two sachets with replaceable 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.650
 general ambyushurami and even not only 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.479
 ambyushurami and here still there 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.689
 an interesting feature that I will show you 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.729
 later in general here in the kit two here 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.329
 these nasadochka with interchangeable very here 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.520
 these nozzles and only 2 laces 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.259
 medium sized and in another sachet 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.009
 we had 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.869
 the rest is common now they are wearing 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.810
 where is the headset then a little general 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.820
 I write here medium and large in general 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.430
 they are the same as they were and for example me 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.670
 there were goats and d2 there actually were such 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.770
 same 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.990
 in general let's get the earbuds 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.360
 let's take a closer look at them 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.220
 here here it is here they are by the way l-shaped 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.460
 there is no plug 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.300
 the remote one here has the bayonets here 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.720
 case is written further but it is braided 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.910
 the wire is so pretty solid tight 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.490
 she is not as transparent as decree 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.400
 id2 but faded you show we compare them 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.110
 together and by the sound to and so on than that 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.660
 different overall looks like this 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.420
 further what is remarkable is that there is 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.760
 kit and how I burned nozzles look 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.490
 on him so unscrew hop we 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.620
 we get this 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.300
 lining inside is generally located 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.600
 these are foam 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.450
 there is no him I honestly tried to understand what 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.410
 they are different i listened and quite 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.600
 so wanted to understand but for myself I don’t 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.420
 brought a particular difference how they differ 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.400
 although there's seemingly they certainly 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.760
 different here you can see 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.360
 there is such a huge common nozzle here it is 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.700
 here it is such a narrow mesh 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.800
 foam points on the general I stopped here 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.750
 on these because I didn't understand anything 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.210
 are they better not better i stopped here 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.070
 On standard only changed because 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.460
 always comes in a medium embouchure like me 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.140
 changed to small in general in principle 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.730
 I think you see how they look. 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.650
 look so on well come on now i'm 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.320
 I'll show you the old one because we will 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.870
 compare with them with old ones these are mine 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.700
 old food case 2 headphones 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.150
 behind them are such big nets here 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.880
 too dissatisfied with such bulky here 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.210
 also g-shaped plug but it is a malinche 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.760
 the other is not so beautiful so let's say it 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.910
 already more like a modern look like 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.790
 Generally what more is my old as 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.630
 goat and d-2 were more here wise men by 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.120
 dimensions if you look a little more in 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.250
 In principle, I have already tested them. 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.470
 what's different now tell on 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.140
 than i tested first on what i 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.430
 tested it was iphone 5 sim phone 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.860
 This price which ordered with 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.290
 aliexpress I tested the same 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.870
 songs but it is not as I liked 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.060
 also tested on your sound card 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.040
 focusrite saffire 6 usb 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.260
 besides the phone but 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.760
 ost holidays it will all be in general then 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.090
 than I tested lying behind 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.840
 I stopped at my old mp3 player 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.790
 whether sansa drive plus is generally great 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.070
 the machine didn't stop at it all 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.020
 sounds better than all this 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.530
 here on this little thing here 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.090
 there is a rockbox firmware in general 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.030
 I tested on it and 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.220
 compared these two headphones this is new 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.100
 today's novelty in Kazan to 9 and 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.640
 old goats and d2 now as above you 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.940
 happen to listen listen to this 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.670
 I can say about the tests in general 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.270
 these are also not bad headphones yes they are to me 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:11.240
 I liked not for nothing, I ordered but these 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.240
 no wonder it's stuffed and they better not 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.130
 say that a million times but they are so 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.670
 let's say a head taller too next 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:23.000
 the level here even in Kazan d2 can 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.190
 say that you know more what more 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.260
 loud and rough and here it is a little quieter but 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.880
 he softer they are cleaner more 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.800
 transparent especially i understood there i was listening 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.350
 different songs different genres i them and here 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.440
 I realized that here is not cleaner and 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.050
 top cleaner somehow it's more all well how 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.290
 say well ka is generally better on ordinary 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.440
 Polina Gagarina I listened to her song 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:51.290
 I didn’t especially notice that 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.370
 here it is all better yes even bass like he 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.900
 a bit like but he even he they play cleaner 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.450
 they play better and cleaner for me they 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.270
 liked more volume enough 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.580
 even if you take this player so on 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.630
 first turn it on for some reason 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.980
 turned off here you can see 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.470
 flash rock boom 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.320
 rockbox here i have to test everything 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.510
 here are my songs that I tested 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.680
 let's turn on well let's let it be 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.330
 so here in principle loudness i 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.850
 listened here at this volume they 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.560
 enough pieces of x play but they can 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.000
 add very now I 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.900
 rewind 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.220
 here they play I listened to this but 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:37.260
 stock in general added they yell 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.870
 loud enough better I'll turn off a little 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.620
 Are there any copyrights there 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.450
 I don't love you 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.820
 In general, to listen to the maximum 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.680
 loud enough volume reserve there and 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.630
 at miller's max don't listen because 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.010
 the maximum is already somehow distorted 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.080
 general still 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.940
 This is not so cool headphones to 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.940
 listen to the super maximum in general 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.560
 summing up the headphones better in comparison 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.500
 But with these, I have especially other people 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.200
 There is no here to compare they better they 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.840
 much better go leave them like 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.760
 I think I can find them easily 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.460
 aliexpress of various other Chinese 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.980
 stores and so on on this in general 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.140
 all thanks for watching we like 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.830
 who liked and are waiting for new releases 

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.830
