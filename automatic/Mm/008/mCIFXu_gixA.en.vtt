agents<00:01:44.700> don't<00:01:44.909> actually<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:45.600> into<00:01:45.810> solution

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
agents don't actually go into solution

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.550 
agents don't actually go into solution
they<00:01:46.619> bind<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.369> with<00:01:48.350> phenomics<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
bottom of the tank so they're not

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.850 
bottom of the tank so they're not
actually<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> product<00:01:54.060> um<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.470> normally

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
playing he's called our control so there

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.980 
playing he's called our control so there
would<00:02:09.790> be<00:02:09.820> no<00:02:09.880> fining<00:02:10.300> agent<00:02:10.540> added<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.870> this

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
would be no fining agent added to this

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.800 
would be no fining agent added to this
one<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:12.280> then<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.910> others<00:02:13.150> we'll<00:02:13.390> all<00:02:13.600> get<00:02:13.750> a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
one and then the others we'll all get a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.570 
one and then the others we'll all get a
little<00:02:13.900> bit<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.620> something<00:02:15.220> or<00:02:15.340> other<00:02:15.370> so

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
little bit of something or other so

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.060 
little bit of something or other so
usually<00:02:16.030> what<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.180> do<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> lower<00:02:17.050> dose<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.740> one

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
usually what I do is a lower dose of one

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.400 
usually what I do is a lower dose of one
and<00:02:18.340> then<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.460> higher<00:02:18.670> dose<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.090> one<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.630> lower

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
and then a higher dose of one a lower

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.230 
and then a higher dose of one a lower
dose<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.920> next<00:02:21.160> agent<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.640> hired<00:02:21.850> us<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
dose of the next agent and hired us the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.690 
dose of the next agent and hired us the
next<00:02:22.420> agent<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.710> then<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.890> same<00:02:24.100> goes<00:02:24.520> on

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
next agent and then the same goes on

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.290 
next agent and then the same goes on
went<00:02:25.180> back<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:26.380> you've<00:02:26.590> labeled<00:02:26.860> these

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
went back and you've labeled these

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.360 
went back and you've labeled these
carefully<00:02:28.300> yeah<00:02:29.320> each<00:02:29.560> beaker<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.010> labeled

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
carefully yeah each beaker is labeled

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.060 
carefully yeah each beaker is labeled
with<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.520> letter<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.990> then<00:02:32.320> that<00:02:32.500> way<00:02:32.620> when<00:02:32.830> I

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
with a letter and then that way when I

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.620 
with a letter and then that way when I
taste<00:02:33.340> them<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.030> same<00:02:34.240> thing<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.540> the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
taste them the same thing is the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.660 
taste them the same thing is the
blending<00:02:34.870> trial<00:02:35.170> I'll<00:02:35.950> be<00:02:36.160> able<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.430> they'll

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
blending trial I'll be able to they'll

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.000 
blending trial I'll be able to they'll
be<00:02:36.760> I'll<00:02:36.910> be<00:02:36.970> blind<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:38.500> like<00:02:38.650> everybody

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
be I'll be blind just like everybody

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.710 
be I'll be blind just like everybody
else<00:02:39.160> that's<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.490> tasting<00:02:39.820> panel<00:02:40.030> right

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
else that's on the tasting panel right

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.540 
else that's on the tasting panel right
so<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.410> way<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.860> know<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:44.190> represents<00:02:45.190> a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
so that way I know that you represents a

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.350 
so that way I know that you represents a
low<00:02:45.970> dose<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.540> PvP<00:02:47.230> P<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.940> way<00:02:49.060> when<00:02:49.240> we

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
low dose of PvP P and that way when we

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.240 
low dose of PvP P and that way when we
when<00:02:49.690> we<00:02:49.720> hash<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.470> out<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.740> we<00:02:50.800> decide<00:02:51.040> which

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
when we hash it out and we decide which

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.790 
when we hash it out and we decide which
one's<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.610> best<00:02:51.790> one<00:02:52.080> then<00:02:53.080> we'll<00:02:53.590> come<00:02:53.770> back

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
one's the best one then we'll come back

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.790 
one's the best one then we'll come back
to<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.400> go<00:02:54.520> oh<00:02:54.670> we<00:02:54.850> liked<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.800> now

to that and go oh we liked you now

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.190 
to that and go oh we liked you now
oftentimes<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.640> not<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:58.630> cut<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:58.900> dry

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
oftentimes it's not that cut and dry

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.780 
oftentimes it's not that cut and dry
normally<00:02:59.560> we'll<00:02:59.950> go<00:03:00.070> through<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.520> kind<00:03:00.670> of

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
normally we'll go through and kind of

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.310 
normally we'll go through and kind of
like<00:03:00.910> well<00:03:01.120> we<00:03:01.210> like<00:03:01.360> this<00:03:01.570> one<00:03:01.750> we<00:03:01.960> like<00:03:02.110> this

when they like the mouthfeel on e so
this<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.920> initial<00:03:09.160> trial<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:10.630> could<00:03:10.900> be

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
this is the initial trial it could be

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.870 
this is the initial trial it could be
that<00:03:11.470> I've<00:03:11.650> set<00:03:11.980> up<00:03:12.010> two<00:03:12.340> or<00:03:12.430> three<00:03:12.490> more<00:03:12.760> of

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
that I've set up two or three more of

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.460 
that I've set up two or three more of
these<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.570> know<00:03:13.690> with<00:03:13.900> different

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
these you know with different

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.220 
these you know with different
combinations<00:03:15.070> of<00:03:15.160> fining<00:03:15.490> agents<00:03:15.970> or

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
combinations of fining agents or

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.440 
combinations of fining agents or
different<00:03:17.230> levels<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.400> know<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.000> say<00:03:19.180> we<00:03:19.300> like

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
different levels you know so say we like

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.710 
different levels you know so say we like
the<00:03:19.660> low<00:03:20.110> dose<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.560> PvP<00:03:21.390> like<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.480> high<00:03:22.570> dose

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
the low dose of PvP like the high dose

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.030 
the low dose of PvP like the high dose
of<00:03:22.900> caseinate<00:03:23.380> I'm<00:03:23.680> gonna<00:03:23.890> make<00:03:24.010> a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
of caseinate I'm gonna make a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.890 
of caseinate I'm gonna make a
combination<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.670> those<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.090> may<00:03:25.239> increase<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
combination of those I may increase the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.870 
combination of those I may increase the
level<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.230> or<00:03:27.130> decrease<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.580> level<00:03:27.850> of

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
level of or decrease the level of

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.540 
level of or decrease the level of
caseinate<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:29.680> know<00:03:29.770> just<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.340> kind<00:03:30.520> of

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
caseinate you know just a kind of

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.760 
caseinate you know just a kind of
combination<00:03:30.810> at<00:03:31.810> those<00:03:32.050> those<00:03:32.410> are<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.590> two

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
combination at those those are the two

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.680 
combination at those those are the two
agents<00:03:33.130> this<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.750> PvP<00:03:34.750> P<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.230> is

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
agents this is a PvP P and this is

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.479 
agents this is a PvP P and this is
caseinate<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.260> then<00:03:38.680> I've<00:03:38.770> got<00:03:38.950> my<00:03:38.980> gelatin

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
caseinate and then I've got my gelatin

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.160 
caseinate and then I've got my gelatin
over<00:03:39.550> here<00:03:39.820> pre-mixed<00:03:40.450> in<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:40.930> little

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
over here pre-mixed in this little

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.910 
over here pre-mixed in this little
container<00:03:41.290> here<00:03:42.120> such<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:43.989> what's<00:03:44.620> going<00:03:44.860> on

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
container here such so what's going on

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.650 
container here such so what's going on
here<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:45.250> each<00:03:45.370> one<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.640> these<00:03:45.700> represents<00:03:45.970> the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
here is each one of these represents the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.680 
here is each one of these represents the
tank<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:48.400> course<00:03:48.610> it's<00:03:49.239> not<00:03:49.360> going<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.600> be

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
tank and of course it's not going to be

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.090 
tank and of course it's not going to be
exactly<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.200> same<00:03:50.290> we're<00:03:50.709> just<00:03:50.860> trying<00:03:51.010> to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
exactly the same we're just trying to

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.979 
exactly the same we're just trying to
get<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.250> rough<00:03:51.459> idea<00:03:51.580> so<00:03:52.150> I'm<00:03:52.270> gonna<00:03:52.390> add<00:03:52.690> an

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
get a rough idea so I'm gonna add an

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.600 
get a rough idea so I'm gonna add an
agent<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.410> each<00:03:53.470> one<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.770> these<00:03:53.860> tanks<00:03:54.130> and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
agent to each one of these tanks and

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.960 
agent to each one of these tanks and
then<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:57.160> know<00:03:57.250> again<00:03:57.459> we're<00:03:57.640> gonna<00:03:57.760> let<00:03:57.880> them

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
then you know again we're gonna let them

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.640 
then you know again we're gonna let them
sit<00:03:58.150> overnight<00:03:58.180> we'll<00:03:59.110> taste<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.440> more

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
sit overnight we'll taste it more

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.260 
sit overnight we'll taste it more
afternoon

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
afternoon

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.170 
afternoon
go<00:04:01.080> back<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.470> drawing<00:04:01.620> board<00:04:01.800> or<00:04:02.190> we'll<00:04:02.400> go

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
go back to the drawing board or we'll go

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.000 
go back to the drawing board or we'll go
on<00:04:03.440> but<00:04:04.440> even<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.950> control<00:04:06.590> it's<00:04:07.590> not<00:04:07.770> very

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
on but even a control it's not very

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.490 
on but even a control it's not very
scientific<00:04:08.190> way<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.820> add<00:04:09.060> but<00:04:09.360> I'm<00:04:10.110> gonna<00:04:10.290> go

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
scientific way to add but I'm gonna go

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.030 
scientific way to add but I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.830> stir<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:12.180> control<00:04:12.570> up<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:13.920> it

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
ahead and stir the control up just so it

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.230 
ahead and stir the control up just so it
all<00:04:14.220> that's<00:04:14.550> just<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:14.790> everything<00:04:15.120> gets

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
all that's just so everything gets

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.070 
all that's just so everything gets
treated<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.660> same<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.350> this<00:04:16.560> is<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:17.930> want<00:04:18.930> I'm

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
treated the same so this is I want I'm

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.449 
treated the same so this is I want I'm
gonna<00:04:19.170> sloshing<00:04:19.680> him<00:04:19.770> just<00:04:19.980> as<00:04:20.100> much<00:04:20.280> I'm

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
gonna sloshing him just as much I'm

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.820 
gonna sloshing him just as much I'm
gonna<00:04:20.580> slosh<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.090> others<00:04:21.330> just<00:04:21.620> in<00:04:22.620> case

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
gonna slosh the others just in case

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.410 
gonna slosh the others just in case
there<00:04:23.130> was<00:04:23.250> some<00:04:23.460> sort<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:29.060> reaction<00:04:30.060> with<00:04:30.390> the

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
there was some sort of reaction with the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.260 
there was some sort of reaction with the
stirring<00:04:31.110> as<00:04:31.650> far<00:04:31.860> as<00:04:31.980> like<00:04:32.100> oxido<00:04:32.550> oxidizing

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
stirring as far as like oxido oxidizing

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.800 
stirring as far as like oxido oxidizing
or<00:04:33.360> something<00:04:34.970> alright<00:04:35.970> so<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.450> first<00:04:36.510> one

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
or something alright so the first one

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.960 
or something alright so the first one
we're<00:04:36.990> gonna<00:04:37.050> do<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.290> 1/2<00:04:37.680> pound<00:04:38.040> per<00:04:38.550> thousand

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
we're gonna do is 1/2 pound per thousand

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.230 
we're gonna do is 1/2 pound per thousand
gallons<00:04:39.390> of<00:04:39.680> pppp<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:41.850> that's<00:04:42.060> gonna

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
gallons of pppp and that's gonna

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.000 
gallons of pppp and that's gonna
translate<00:04:42.540> to<00:04:43.670> my<00:04:44.670> chart<00:04:45.150> here<00:04:45.560> it's<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.620> 5%

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
translate to my chart here it's a 5%

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.700 
translate to my chart here it's a 5%
solution<00:04:47.430> it's<00:04:48.150> gonna<00:04:48.300> translate<00:04:48.710> 2.3

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
solution it's gonna translate 2.3

00:04:49.710 --> 00:05:12.020 
solution it's gonna translate 2.3
milliliters<00:04:50.570> in<00:04:51.570> this<00:04:51.890> 250<00:04:52.890> milliliter<00:04:53.220> flask

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.940 

the<00:05:12.240> next<00:05:12.510> one<00:05:12.660> is<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.810> 2-pound<00:05:13.320> without<00:05:13.680> and

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
the next one is a 2-pound without and

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:44.760 
the next one is a 2-pound without and
this<00:05:14.040> is<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.250> bigger<00:05:14.460> addition

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.760 

and<00:05:45.699> now<00:05:45.910> we're<00:05:46.090> adding<00:05:46.449> this<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.259> the<00:05:47.380> Caston

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
and now we're adding this is the Caston

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:56.249 
and now we're adding this is the Caston
a<00:05:49.800> low<00:05:50.800> dose<00:05:52.289> and<00:05:53.289> you<00:05:53.560> can<00:05:53.680> see<00:05:54.780> how<00:05:55.780> it<00:05:55.930> reacts

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
a low dose and you can see how it reacts

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:04.269 
a low dose and you can see how it reacts
different<00:05:56.710> than<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.039> PvP<00:05:57.910> did<00:05:59.759> see<00:06:00.759> how<00:06:00.849> its

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.489 

mm-hmm<00:06:05.239> got<00:06:05.359> those<00:06:05.569> little<00:06:05.779> strands<00:06:06.079> in<00:06:06.349> there

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:06.499 
mm-hmm got those little strands in there

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.039 
mm-hmm got those little strands in there
yeah<00:06:06.829> definitely<00:06:07.579> so<00:06:08.299> that's<00:06:08.449> what<00:06:08.569> I<00:06:08.599> mean<00:06:08.869> by

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:09.049 
yeah definitely so that's what I mean by

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:10.779 
yeah definitely so that's what I mean by
when<00:06:09.229> it<00:06:09.259> hits<00:06:09.499> the<00:06:09.649> line<00:06:09.859> that<00:06:10.549> actually

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
when it hits the line that actually

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.119 
when it hits the line that actually
doesn't<00:06:10.939> go<00:06:11.089> into<00:06:11.299> solution<00:06:11.809> it<00:06:11.959> binds<00:06:12.469> up<00:06:12.559> and

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:13.129 
doesn't go into solution it binds up and

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:15.519 
doesn't go into solution it binds up and
falls<00:06:13.369> to<00:06:13.459> the<00:06:13.549> bottom<00:06:14.199> McKesson<00:06:15.199> it's<00:06:15.349> there

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:15.529 
falls to the bottom McKesson it's there

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:18.669 
falls to the bottom McKesson it's there
usually<00:06:15.769> the<00:06:15.889> best<00:06:15.919> example<00:06:16.579> of<00:06:16.639> that<00:06:17.679> and

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:18.679 
usually the best example of that and

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:20.109 
usually the best example of that and
then<00:06:18.949> the<00:06:19.039> filter<00:06:19.279> catches<00:06:19.729> it<00:06:19.849> is<00:06:19.969> that

00:06:20.109 --> 00:06:20.119 
then the filter catches it is that

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:22.359 
then the filter catches it is that
correct<00:06:20.299> and<00:06:20.839> will<00:06:21.019> filter<00:06:21.229> all<00:06:21.409> that<00:06:21.619> out<00:06:21.769> go

00:06:22.359 --> 00:06:22.369 
correct and will filter all that out go

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:28.590 
correct and will filter all that out go
through<00:06:22.399> a<00:06:22.579> final<00:06:22.819> filtration

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.300 

now<00:06:29.170> when<00:06:29.320> I'm<00:06:29.410> setting<00:06:29.680> these<00:06:29.740> trials<00:06:30.190> up

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
now when I'm setting these trials up

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.370 
now when I'm setting these trials up
like<00:06:30.550> I<00:06:30.640> said<00:06:30.820> this<00:06:30.940> one<00:06:31.090> here<00:06:31.270> is<00:06:31.360> a<00:06:31.390> pretty

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
like I said this one here is a pretty

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:39.510 
like I said this one here is a pretty
generic<00:06:36.930> trial<00:06:37.930> but<00:06:38.140> I<00:06:38.350> you<00:06:38.860> know<00:06:38.980> like<00:06:39.280> like

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
generic trial but I you know like like

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.610 
generic trial but I you know like like
you<00:06:39.610> said<00:06:39.640> I<00:06:39.820> have<00:06:40.170> spent<00:06:41.170> some<00:06:41.290> time<00:06:41.500> with

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
you said I have spent some time with

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.650 
you said I have spent some time with
these<00:06:41.800> wines<00:06:42.010> already<00:06:42.550> so<00:06:43.030> if<00:06:43.150> I<00:06:43.240> have<00:06:43.420> one

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
these wines already so if I have one

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.530 
these wines already so if I have one
that's<00:06:43.840> particularly<00:06:44.380> harsh<00:06:44.770> and<00:06:45.100> phenolics

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
that's particularly harsh and phenolics

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.700 
that's particularly harsh and phenolics
then<00:06:46.540> I<00:06:46.570> will<00:06:46.900> dip<00:06:47.110> that<00:06:47.230> will<00:06:47.380> change<00:06:47.620> my

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
then I will dip that will change my

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.030 
then I will dip that will change my
doses<00:06:48.250> based<00:06:48.490> on<00:06:48.670> that<00:06:49.320> you<00:06:50.320> kind<00:06:50.590> of<00:06:50.710> know<00:06:50.890> the

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
doses based on that you kind of know the

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.070 
doses based on that you kind of know the
wines<00:06:51.250> personalities<00:06:52.180> by<00:06:52.450> now<00:06:52.630> don't<00:06:52.960> you

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
wines personalities by now don't you

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.660 
wines personalities by now don't you
yeah<00:06:53.530> and<00:06:53.680> that's<00:06:53.770> what<00:06:53.980> we're<00:06:54.100> this<00:06:54.340> is<00:06:54.400> the

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.670 
yeah and that's what we're this is the

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.980
