at<00:03:16.610> least<00:03:16.970> on<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.180> part-time<00:03:17.690> basis<00:03:18.170> if<00:03:18.320> not

full-time and I think the CA B program
is<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:22.940> one<00:03:23.420> thing<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.930> helps<00:03:24.260> ensure<00:03:24.590> that

is is one thing that helps ensure that

is is one thing that helps ensure that
that<00:03:24.950> might<00:03:25.190> come<00:03:25.370> about<00:03:25.640> by<00:03:26.140> by<00:03:28.150> providing

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
that might come about by by providing

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.810 
that might come about by by providing
the<00:03:29.330> consumer<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.140> good<00:03:31.070> product<00:03:31.370> they're
