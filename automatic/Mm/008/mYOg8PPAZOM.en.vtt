00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 three girls then weekend you know 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.529
 what it means that I can make a 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.950
 new video 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.920
 back to series I wanted to do this to you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.049
 trick that I did practically kept 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.180
 up in the video where I showed myself the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.619
 naked basics I'm waiting for that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.449
 come back from sephora 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.109
 who knows why I'm waiting for you to come back 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.300
 from sephora that follows me and will know 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.769
 surely soon the reason why 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 I'm waiting for you to come back from there 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.969
 anyway, I wanted to do this 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.450
 trick because some of you had less 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.149
 requested then gradually as I do 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.190
 the tutorial will surely satisfy all of them 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.379
 our requests do not fear I am here 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.399
 searched I wanted to tell you then you 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.320
 you can do this trick 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.270
 absolutely with any pair of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.730
 color that you like in this case 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.289
 I did it with brown and black 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.570
 because what I really do 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.870
 more usually, however, more cuts are made there 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.489
 maybe you can do with with gray and blue 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.969
 rather than with the violet with the rose 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.189
 rather than with green and brown 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.229
 I don't know you can pick you because 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.750
 it really is spring now 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.400
 arrived and then between a corner and then 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 let's really enjoy the colors 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.619
 so much so that I did this trick 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.990
 however on the natural tones on the eyes and 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.360
 then I put this color lipstick 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.070
 cherry to really light the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.600
 all no girl and so I do 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.040
 leave the total indeed I really hope to 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.140
 always receive lots of your messages 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.119
 that makes me but always very very pleased 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.009
 whatever you want to write really 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.500
 I am delighted years of 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.280
 read them and I send back fortissimo fortune and there 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.939
 let's see to the next 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.700
 hi leo what girls we start is 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.090
 practically already applied the trainer on 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.500
 the whole eyelid first when I did 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.350
 the other eye so I'm going to get it 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.450
 directly from milk and the basics 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.540
 this dabliu post eye shadow is this 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.409
 very delicate opaque rosÃ© I apply 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.409
 over the entire eyelid 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.520
 don't forget to put me a little too 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.869
 in the center of the eye 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.450
 after that I'm going to get this 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.300
 milky white shimmer called venus 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.550
 and obligatory only on the mobile eyelid 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.550
 so as to illuminate it 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.920
 then I take this brownish a lot 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.330
 delicate after very very clear that yes 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.090
 called naked 2 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.099
 if I go to give a little definition 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.860
 practically to the eyelid then I create 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.080
 this bezel that follows a little we say 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.380
 so the shape of the eyebrow goes a little 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.569
 to help you in the form after 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.610
 depth and even more definition 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.980
 they acquire net to appease even a little 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.540
 of fight that this little brown one 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:02.760
 a little bit darker than what we have 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:05.540
 just applied and then with a brush 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.560
 from nuance I go practically to fade 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.709
 practically a new one 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.959
 intercalate but I'm going to blend this 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.140
 bezel that we did so to give 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.030
 a much more natural effect and then with 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.790
 the same little brown ones I go practically 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.910
 draw a path to eye care 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.430
 so that in practice we can give one 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.430
 sort of continuity to the nuance 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.680
 now the time of the lines and re-use 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.920
 this here is if I am very well 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.569
 I have to say and I'm going to apply it only 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.459
 in the second half of the eye for not 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.670
 weigh down the lash line 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.670
 superior 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.560
 after fixed kg what I believe this 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.560
 black of naked latics 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.169
 then he takes nemi's pastel pencil 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.410
 cosmetics of this short brownish more 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.599
 I'm going to apply in the second half 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.669
 of the lower rhyme then I take the 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.560
 52 pupa pencil that fail to 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.630
 understand from the act opens immediately to 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.169
 first shot however that this color 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.430
 butter cream and very natural color 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.900
 I apply both in the internal rhyme 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.150
 of the eye is just outside 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.030
 let's say in the central part of the eye 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:58.400
 in the middle of course then I go to 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:03.280
 blend both the clear part with venus si 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.280
 then it has the dark part with paint 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.900
 and the turn of the mascara is taken care of 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:24.110
 apply 21 of essen si both above and 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:33.620
 below then then we go to give a little 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:36.110
 decisions acquires eyebrows and these 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.700
 I'm full eyes I really hope 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.470
 that you enjoyed having it 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.870
 found it simple for anything 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.910
 understand that you can ask anyway 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.570
 I'm going to get the bach e blush 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.450
 I take harmony that this catches a lot 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.990
 bright also a possible that I like 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.990
 lot 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.240
 then it goes from illuminating the center a little 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.940
 of the forehead to the center of the nose to give 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.970
 much brightness to the face with this 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:18.229
 illuminating fin combined let's say 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:21.500

 really very very nice besides 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.699
