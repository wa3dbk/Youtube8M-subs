00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
fruit juice so this is the automatic

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
fruit juice so this is the automatic
juicers<00:00:14.880> model<00:00:15.389> number<00:00:15.960> m47<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.310> it's<00:00:18.029> their

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
juicers model number m47 and it's their

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.090 
juicers model number m47 and it's their
biggest<00:00:18.390> model<00:00:18.779> they<00:00:18.840> sell<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.260> will<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.500> 25

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
biggest model they sell it will do 25

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.730 
biggest model they sell it will do 25
fruit<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.550> minute<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.380> that<00:00:22.380> comes<00:00:22.500> out<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
fruit a minute and that comes out to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.679 
fruit a minute and that comes out to
about<00:00:22.920> basically<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> gallon<00:00:24.210> every<00:00:24.480> two

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
about basically a gallon every two

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.779

that you picked and you load it in the
topper<00:00:29.789> up<00:00:29.970> here<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.539> then<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> gravity

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
topper up here and then it's a gravity

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.970 
topper up here and then it's a gravity
fed<00:00:31.920> through<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> machine<00:00:33.090> that's<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.980> wire

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
fed through the machine that's a wire

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.150 
fed through the machine that's a wire
cage<00:00:35.309> down<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.590> one<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.770> time<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
cage down in and one of the time the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.639 
cage down in and one of the time the
fruit<00:00:38.430> drops<00:00:38.730> down<00:00:39.030> onto<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> blade<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.140> then

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
fruit drops down onto the blade and then

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.959 
fruit drops down onto the blade and then
this<00:00:40.800> plunger<00:00:41.250> pushes<00:00:41.700> plush<00:00:42.690> pushes<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
this plunger pushes plush pushes the

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.190 
this plunger pushes plush pushes the
pushes<00:00:44.969> each<00:00:45.180> fruit<00:00:45.450> across<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> blade

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
pushes each fruit across the blade

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.790 
pushes each fruit across the blade
cutting<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.800> half<00:00:46.829> after<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:49.020> each

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
cutting it in half after that the each

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.889 
cutting it in half after that the each
section<00:00:50.340> called<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> rubber<00:00:51.510> drain

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
section called on to the rubber drain

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.619 
section called on to the rubber drain
pad<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> pressure<00:00:53.879> cups<00:00:54.239> come<00:00:54.480> down

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
pad and then the pressure cups come down

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.889 
pad and then the pressure cups come down
and<00:00:54.840> squish<00:00:55.230> each<00:00:55.469> section<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.899> another

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and squish each section the another

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
and squish each section the another
lever<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.770> kicks<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> spin

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
lever in there that kicks the spin

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.740 
lever in there that kicks the spin
trines<00:00:59.609> out<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> back<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> Druse

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
trines out the back and then the Druse

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.349 
trines out the back and then the Druse
juice<00:01:01.379> comes<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.770> onto<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.370> drip<00:01:02.910> head<00:01:03.120> and
