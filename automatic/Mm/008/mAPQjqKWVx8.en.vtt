here at saskatoon tech works and this is
some<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> stuff<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.500> we've<00:00:16.740> been

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
some of the stuff that we've been

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.410 
some of the stuff that we've been
working<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.310> recently<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.880> try<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.180> make<00:00:18.270> our

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
working on recently to try and make our

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.420 
working on recently to try and make our
printer<00:00:18.720> better<00:00:18.900> we've<00:00:19.859> been<00:00:19.949> working<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
printer better we've been working on the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.150 
printer better we've been working on the
last<00:00:20.580> week<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.650> what<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.680> first<00:00:22.980> did<00:00:23.100> our

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
last week here is what we first did our

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.609 
last week here is what we first did our
prints<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.730> found<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.330> some<00:00:25.230> things<00:00:25.410> worse

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
prints we found that some things worse

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.120 
prints we found that some things worse
queue<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.430> warped<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.949> weren't<00:00:28.949> really

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
queue and warped and weren't really

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.890 
queue and warped and weren't really
square<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.060> would<00:00:30.150> want<00:00:30.330> them<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
square like we would want them to be and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.319 
square like we would want them to be and
the<00:00:31.679> other<00:00:31.800> thing<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:32.070> found<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:33.149> we

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the other thing we found was that if we

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.700 
the other thing we found was that if we
move<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.570> laser<00:00:33.840> too<00:00:34.079> fast<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.530> would<00:00:34.649> get

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
move the laser too fast we would get

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.380 
move the laser too fast we would get
this<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:35.040> noticeable<00:00:35.520> ringing<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
this really noticeable ringing in the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.209 
this really noticeable ringing in the
output<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.020> that's<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.620> very<00:00:37.680> good<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
output and that's not very good for the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.459 
output and that's not very good for the
your<00:00:38.460> prints<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:38.879> we're<00:00:39.030> doing<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.930> there

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
your prints as we're doing it so there

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.590 
your prints as we're doing it so there
was<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.890> couple<00:00:41.129> those<00:00:41.700> two<00:00:41.850> major<00:00:42.030> issues<00:00:42.420> that

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
was a couple those two major issues that

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.110 
was a couple those two major issues that
we<00:00:42.690> were<00:00:42.780> trying<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.110> fix<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.910> for<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> first

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
we were trying to fix and for the first

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940 
we were trying to fix and for the first
one<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.600> did<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.960> I've<00:00:46.469> got<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> couple

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
one what we did is I've got a couple

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.369 
one what we did is I've got a couple
different<00:00:47.100> patterns<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.789> see<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.149> of

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
different patterns you see there of

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.439 
different patterns you see there of
drawing<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.530> circle<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.160> square<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
drawing a circle and a square and you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.670 
drawing a circle and a square and you
can<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.750> originally<00:00:52.260> when<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.469> drew

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
can see that originally when we drew

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.110 
can see that originally when we drew
them<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:52.949> were<00:00:53.010> quite<00:00:53.309> tilted<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:53.969> side

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
them they were quite tilted to one side

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.569 
them they were quite tilted to one side
and<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.440> round<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.250> Square

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and not really round not really Square

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.680 
and not really round not really Square
and<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.050> added<00:00:58.460> calibration<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
and so we added calibration and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.560 
and so we added calibration and
translation<00:01:00.800> set<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.129> our<00:01:02.550> output<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
translation set up to our output so that

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.390 
translation set up to our output so that
we<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.989> figure<00:01:04.110> out<00:01:04.260> exactly<00:01:04.830> where<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
we can figure out exactly where the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
we can figure out exactly where the
laser<00:01:05.549> would<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:06.030> when<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.450> gave<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.810> certain

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
laser would go when we gave it a certain

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.649 
laser would go when we gave it a certain
output<00:01:07.380> from<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> audio<00:01:08.280> jack<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.820> make<00:01:09.510> sure

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
output from the audio jack and make sure

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.330 
output from the audio jack and make sure
that<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.960> maps<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> position<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.220> we

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that that maps to the position that we

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.149 
that that maps to the position that we
want<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.700> go<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:13.350> other<00:01:13.500> one<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
want it to go to the other one for the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.700 
want it to go to the other one for the
ringing<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.729> ran<00:01:14.880> into<00:01:15.290> was<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
ringing that we ran into was that the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.800 
ringing that we ran into was that the
mirrors<00:01:17.189> themselves<00:01:17.729> naturally<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
mirrors themselves naturally have a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.719 
mirrors themselves naturally have a
resonant<00:01:19.560> frequency<00:01:20.009> where<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.400> you're<00:01:20.520> below

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
resonant frequency where if you're below

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.850 
resonant frequency where if you're below
that<00:01:21.090> they<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.450> move<00:01:21.600> around<00:01:21.750> slowly<00:01:22.140> above

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
that they just move around slowly above

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.370 
that they just move around slowly above
that<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:23.159> can't<00:01:23.400> keep<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:25.200> very

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that they can't keep up but at that very

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.210 
that they can't keep up but at that very
point<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:26.840> oscillate<00:01:27.840> quite<00:01:28.500> wildly<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
point it will oscillate quite wildly and

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.090 
point it will oscillate quite wildly and
screw<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.119> your<00:01:30.240> print<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.079> what<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.799> did<00:01:31.950> for

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
screw up your print so what we did for

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.490 
screw up your print so what we did for
that<00:01:32.250> was<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.360> I'm<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.380> of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that was you can see I'm the one of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.550 
that was you can see I'm the one of
these<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.890> sweeping<00:01:35.640> across<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.570> changing

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
these I'm sweeping across and changing

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859 
these I'm sweeping across and changing
the<00:01:37.710> frequency<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:38.729> output<00:01:39.150> over<00:01:39.390> time<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the frequency of my output over time and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.990 
the frequency of my output over time and
when<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> reach<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.220> point<00:01:41.490> where<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.759> starts

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
when I reach that point where it starts

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.310 
when I reach that point where it starts
to<00:01:42.060> resonate<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.659> whole<00:01:42.810> thing<00:01:43.020> starts

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
to resonate the whole thing starts

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.810 
to resonate the whole thing starts
moving<00:01:43.619> very<00:01:43.770> wildly<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:44.790> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
moving very wildly and you can see that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.960 
moving very wildly and you can see that
it<00:01:45.000> gets<00:01:45.090> very<00:01:45.210> large<00:01:46.040> our<00:01:47.040> first<00:01:47.369> approach<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it gets very large our first approach to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
it gets very large our first approach to
dealing<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.380> use<00:01:49.649> what's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
dealing with that is to use what's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
dealing with that is to use what's
called<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.159> low-pass<00:01:50.490> filter<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.869> basically

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
called a low-pass filter and basically

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.929 
called a low-pass filter and basically
what<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.530> means<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.640> any<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
what that means is that for any of the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.639 
what that means is that for any of the
frequencies<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.509> are<00:01:54.750> higher<00:01:55.079> than<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.530> we

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
frequencies that are higher than what we

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.980 
frequencies that are higher than what we
want<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.430> filter<00:01:56.969> those<00:01:57.180> out<00:01:57.360> leave<00:01:57.780> them

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
want we filter those out leave them

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.660 
want we filter those out leave them
aside<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.590> only<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> slower<00:01:59.219> ones<00:01:59.340> are

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
aside so that only the slower ones are

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.819 
aside so that only the slower ones are
there<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.899> see<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.380> step

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
there now you can see in the step

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.590 
there now you can see in the step
response<00:02:02.009> where<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:02.610> come<00:02:02.759> up<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.270> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
response where we come up like this and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.569 
response where we come up like this and
there's<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> ringing<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.560> when<00:02:05.430> we

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
there's the ringing on that when we

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.670 
there's the ringing on that when we
apply<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:05.939> filter<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.409> ringing

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
apply this filter to it the ringing

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.400 
apply this filter to it the ringing
portion<00:02:08.220> goes<00:02:08.489> away<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:09.959> get<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.110> little

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
portion goes away but we do get a little

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.350 
portion goes away but we do get a little
bit<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.739> time<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.700> get<00:02:11.819> from<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> bottom<00:02:12.300> at

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
bit of a time to get from the bottom at

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.250 
bit of a time to get from the bottom at
the<00:02:12.420> top<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.959> is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the top and it is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.500 
the top and it is
rounded<00:02:13.769> and<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.879> one<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.299> things

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
rounded and that is one of the things

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.000 
rounded and that is one of the things
that<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.810> can't<00:02:16.230> help<00:02:16.409> but<00:02:16.530> get<00:02:16.709> when<00:02:16.890> you

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
that you can't help but get when you

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.819 
that you can't help but get when you
filter<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.840> next<00:02:18.989> approaches<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:19.650> plan

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
filter it so the next approaches we plan

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.000 
filter it so the next approaches we plan
to<00:02:19.980> take<00:02:20.159> is<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:21.049> add<00:02:22.049> dampening<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.920> our

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
to take is to add dampening to our

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.319 
to take is to add dampening to our
system<00:02:23.370> by<00:02:23.670> adding<00:02:23.939> a<00:02:24.000> little<00:02:24.120> bit<00:02:24.299> of

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
system by adding a little bit of

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.670 
system by adding a little bit of
friction<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.500> doesn't

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
friction in there so that it doesn't

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.399 
friction in there so that it doesn't
resonate<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.250> its<00:02:26.519> own<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.140> there<00:02:28.140> are<00:02:28.260> also

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
resonate on its own and there are also

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.800 
resonate on its own and there are also
other<00:02:28.970> digital<00:02:29.970> signal<00:02:30.360> processing

more for that and and allow us to make

so as part of this one of the things
this<00:02:46.250> filtering<00:02:46.730> enables<00:02:47.180> us<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.360> do<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.380> be

this filtering enables us to do is to be

the laser off and when we come back we

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
don't want it ringing all over the place

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.590 
don't want it ringing all over the place
and<00:03:10.520> making<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.880> mess<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.210> print<00:03:11.510> and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
and making a mess of the print and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.210 
and making a mess of the print and
that's<00:03:12.200> exactly<00:03:12.350> what<00:03:12.680> was<00:03:12.800> happening<00:03:13.130> in<00:03:13.190> the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
that's exactly what was happening in the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.670 
that's exactly what was happening in the
past<00:03:13.460> so<00:03:13.820> as<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.540> result<00:03:14.780> we<00:03:15.110> should<00:03:15.290> be<00:03:15.380> able<00:03:15.500> to

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
past so as a result we should be able to

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.560 
past so as a result we should be able to
make<00:03:15.830> much<00:03:16.070> more<00:03:16.340> complex<00:03:16.790> objects<00:03:17.300> that<00:03:17.420> take

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
make much more complex objects that take

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.050 
make much more complex objects that take
a<00:03:17.600> much<00:03:17.810> longer<00:03:18.020> time<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.710> get<00:03:19.520> a<00:03:19.550> very<00:03:19.730> clean

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
a much longer time and get a very clean

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.080 
a much longer time and get a very clean

changes we've made just in the last week
are<00:03:46.880> really<00:03:47.150> just<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.420> tip<00:03:47.570> of<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.720> iceberg

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
are really just the tip of the iceberg

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.290 
are really just the tip of the iceberg
we've<00:03:48.950> come<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.280> long<00:03:49.340> way<00:03:49.670> already<00:03:49.820> from

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
we've come a long way already from

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.090 
we've come a long way already from
having<00:03:50.630> prints<00:03:51.170> that<00:03:51.290> don't<00:03:51.530> really<00:03:51.680> work<00:03:51.920> all

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
having prints that don't really work all

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.500 
having prints that don't really work all
that<00:03:52.250> well<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.640> something<00:03:52.940> that<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.269> already

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
that well to something that is already

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.390 
that well to something that is already
quite<00:03:53.780> usable<00:03:54.019> at<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.440> moment<00:03:54.769> but<00:03:55.160> there's<00:03:55.340> a

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
quite usable at the moment but there's a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.680 
quite usable at the moment but there's a
lot<00:03:55.580> more<00:03:55.610> improvement<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.330> we<00:03:56.390> want<00:03:56.630> to

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
lot more improvement that we want to

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.910 
lot more improvement that we want to
make<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.050> that's<00:03:57.170> exactly<00:03:57.320> why<00:03:57.769> we

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
make and that's exactly why we

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.740 
make and that's exactly why we
appreciate<00:03:58.400> your<00:03:58.519> support<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.090> helping<00:03:59.600> us

appreciate your support and helping us
to<00:03:59.870> do<00:03:59.989> this<00:04:00.110> additional<00:04:00.590> development<00:04:01.040> over

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
to do this additional development over

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.000 
to do this additional development over
the<00:04:01.250> coming<00:04:01.489> months<00:04:02.380> I'd<00:04:03.380> like<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.709> talk<00:04:03.860> about

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
the coming months I'd like to talk about

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.610 
the coming months I'd like to talk about
just<00:04:04.280> how<00:04:04.459> young<00:04:04.790> this<00:04:05.000> printer<00:04:05.420> is<00:04:05.600> there<00:04:06.290> are

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
just how young this printer is there are

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.759 
just how young this printer is there are
so<00:04:07.100> many<00:04:07.250> improvements<00:04:07.610> to<00:04:07.970> come<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.870> get<00:04:09.650> this

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
so many improvements to come to get this

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.710 
so many improvements to come to get this
printer<00:04:10.100> what<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.340> can<00:04:10.489> truly<00:04:10.940> potentially<00:04:11.510> do

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
printer what it can truly potentially do

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.500 
printer what it can truly potentially do
and<00:04:12.040> it's<00:04:13.040> basically<00:04:13.310> just<00:04:13.610> it's<00:04:14.180> amazing

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
and it's basically just it's amazing

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.560 
and it's basically just it's amazing
that<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.080> printer<00:04:15.380> was<00:04:15.560> even<00:04:15.830> able<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.570> print

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
that the printer was even able to print

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.440 
that the printer was even able to print
the<00:04:17.900> small<00:04:18.290> cube<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.980> the<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.609> small<00:04:19.970> Trinity

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
the small cube and the the small Trinity

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.849 
the small cube and the the small Trinity
little<00:04:20.720> objects<00:04:21.080> that<00:04:21.230> we've<00:04:21.380> done<00:04:21.560> with<00:04:21.709> it

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
little objects that we've done with it

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.250 
little objects that we've done with it
so<00:04:22.040> far<00:04:22.070> without<00:04:23.000> having<00:04:23.660> done<00:04:24.200> any

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
so far without having done any

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.370 
so far without having done any
calibration<00:04:24.830> or<00:04:25.660> making<00:04:26.660> up<00:04:26.900> for<00:04:27.080> any<00:04:27.200> of<00:04:27.320> the

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
calibration or making up for any of the

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.950 
calibration or making up for any of the
errors<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:27.770> are<00:04:28.040> our<00:04:28.600> inherited<00:04:29.600> in<00:04:29.810> the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
errors that are our inherited in the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.280 
errors that are our inherited in the
design<00:04:30.290> right<00:04:30.500> now<00:04:30.680> so<00:04:31.780> I'm<00:04:32.780> really<00:04:33.140> excited

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
design right now so I'm really excited

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.990 
design right now so I'm really excited
about<00:04:33.770> what<00:04:34.040> this<00:04:34.160> printer<00:04:34.490> is<00:04:34.520> going<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.910> be

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
about what this printer is going to be

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.420 
about what this printer is going to be
able<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.240> do<00:04:35.360> after<00:04:36.260> we've<00:04:36.440> improved<00:04:37.040> it<00:04:37.250> and

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
able to do after we've improved it and

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.990 
able to do after we've improved it and
we've<00:04:37.729> had<00:04:37.910> engineers<00:04:38.840> thinking<00:04:39.260> about<00:04:40.000> how

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
we've had engineers thinking about how

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.790 
we've had engineers thinking about how
