 There are people who have gasoline in their blood when they feel most comfortable 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.769
 Engines howl after tire rubber and exhaust fumes smells of these motorsport fans 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.420

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.279
 the breaks 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.769
 again the hill climb city the race track is not the easiest 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.529
 not the speed alone secures one of the front seats but that 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.499
 driving style is paramount and the right strategy is Michel

 namely Pölten's piece is short for the drivers also green is short so 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.320
 particularly demanding 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.640
 Pröll could very big help questions could passersby 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.240
 Start this whole story skill from scratch 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.680
 because slowing down between acceleration so it was very much required 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.090
 Engines whine on tires squeal Levi Leipheimer France passes through 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.870
 the curves 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.280
 around 20 000 spectators are expected without the support of the citizens of 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 with house and surroundings the spectacle would be unthinkable 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.680
 the whole place and are often alone 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.900
 everyone 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.050

 Vehicles to offer 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.310
 Strom zu Jung is fitting for the Michel 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.570
 the Taliban would use them with and should be instant and so is 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450
 the kids are very big bank

 of the 1 5 million euros we can do with it is not possible 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.400

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.260
 want or through canvases 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.870
