00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
I noticed when I was grinding it for the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.399 
I noticed when I was grinding it for the
first<00:01:08.100> time<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.640> beat<00:01:08.790> those<00:01:08.970> beans<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
first time the beat those beans that it

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.460 
first time the beat those beans that it
had<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> very<00:01:11.159> berry

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
had a very berry

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.039 
had a very berry
fragrance<00:01:13.470> coming<00:01:13.770> off<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.940> I<00:01:15.659> don't

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
fragrance coming off of it and I don't

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.140 
fragrance coming off of it and I don't
have<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> ask<00:01:16.380> Felton<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.549> went<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
have to ask Felton about that I went to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.640 
have to ask Felton about that I went to
underdose<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> little<00:01:19.259> bit<00:01:19.500> because

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
underdose that just a little bit because

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
underdose that just a little bit because
I<00:01:19.950> noticed<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.610> putting<00:01:21.180> too<00:01:21.300> much<00:01:21.420> in

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
I noticed I was putting too much in

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.180 
I noticed I was putting too much in
earlier<00:01:25.700> all<00:01:26.700> right

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
earlier all right

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:39.139 
earlier all right
ready<00:01:37.280> got<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.399> machine<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.880> pit

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
ready got the machine with the pit

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.570 
ready got the machine with the pit
obviously<00:01:39.929> you<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.830> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.100> change<00:01:41.340> all

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
obviously you know you can change all

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.910 
obviously you know you can change all
the<00:01:41.670> parameters<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.409> doesn't<00:01:43.649> taste

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the parameters so if this doesn't taste

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
the parameters so if this doesn't taste
perfect<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.640> me<00:01:44.789> I<00:01:44.820> would<00:01:45.270> start<00:01:45.479> messing<00:01:45.810> with

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
perfect to me I would start messing with

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.930 
perfect to me I would start messing with
the<00:01:46.140> temperature<00:01:46.679> the<00:01:47.009> timing<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.640> all<00:01:47.759> that

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
the temperature the timing and all that

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.719 
the temperature the timing and all that
stuff<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:49.520> come<00:01:50.520> on

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
stuff on this come on

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:01.180 
stuff on this come on
let's<00:01:50.970> come<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.330> both<00:01:51.450> sides<00:01:52.039> thank<00:01:53.039> you

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.160 

I<00:02:01.310> know<00:02:01.790> it's<00:02:02.090> not<00:02:02.240> gonna<00:02:02.390> be<00:02:02.450> nearly<00:02:02.750> as<00:02:03.020> good

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
I know it's not gonna be nearly as good

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.020 
I know it's not gonna be nearly as good
as<00:02:03.320> Felton's<00:02:03.770> when<00:02:03.980> he<00:02:04.130> does<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.870> but<00:02:05.870> hey

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
as Felton's when he does it but hey

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.010 
as Felton's when he does it but hey
that's<00:02:08.030> why<00:02:08.240> I'm<00:02:08.360> not<00:02:08.510> a<00:02:08.540> roaster<00:02:10.540> so<00:02:11.540> that's<00:02:11.810> a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
that's why I'm not a roaster so that's a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.620 
that's why I'm not a roaster so that's a
little<00:02:12.320> bit<00:02:12.920> under<00:02:13.280> extractive<00:02:14.120> came<00:02:14.390> out<00:02:14.510> of

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
little bit under extractive came out of

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.630 
little bit under extractive came out of
one<00:02:14.750> side<00:02:14.960> more<00:02:15.170> than<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.410> other<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:15.800> hey<00:02:16.370> I'm

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
one side more than the other but hey I'm

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:28.920 
one side more than the other but hey I'm
gonna<00:02:16.790> go<00:02:16.970> for<00:02:17.210> it<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:22.900> heard<00:02:23.900> your<00:02:24.080> slurp

bright bronze is bright very berry ish
you<00:02:36.340> know<00:02:36.459> what<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:36.909> our<00:02:36.939> first<00:02:37.239> attempt<00:02:37.659> at

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
you know what for our first attempt at

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.819 
you know what for our first attempt at
roasting<00:02:39.489> not<00:02:40.299> bad<00:02:40.599> I'd<00:02:41.349> say<00:02:41.590> not<00:02:41.920> bad<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:43.829> would

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
roasting not bad I'd say not bad I would

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.380 
roasting not bad I'd say not bad I would
play<00:02:45.010> with<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:45.189> parameters<00:02:45.730> on<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:45.970> roaster

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
play with the parameters on the roaster

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.449 
play with the parameters on the roaster
a<00:02:46.569> little<00:02:46.870> bit<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.260> would<00:02:48.010> play<00:02:48.220> with<00:02:48.340> the

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
a little bit I would play with the

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.130 
a little bit I would play with the
parameters<00:02:48.939> on<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.239> machine<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.930> little

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
parameters on the machine just a little

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.750 
parameters on the machine just a little
bit<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.709> think<00:02:50.859> for<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.340> first<00:02:51.489> time
