00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.040
 in this way the two are read 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.230
 mapping sport touring the gas must 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.639
 be closed the bike in motion in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.679
 gear you can go but the gas must 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.380
 be close change by a band 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:19.070
 the other as super ténéré while instead 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.070
 the on- board task is the windshield 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.250
 a function is activated with the menu key 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.929
 suspension function changes is behind 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:34.590
 make me believe me standard shining 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.920
 software in or hard for 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.600
 everyone then pushes the menu button and then 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.950
 in addition 1 t 2 peuterey minus one minus 203 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.510
 hard means daring hand dumping and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.110
 the load that changes however with death 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:58.699
 ok the knobs always with the same 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.260
 keys can be respected at least at 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.140
 recognize and then how many students 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.030
 active on here are the various menus of the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.869
 twente also in these submenus then 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.090
 decide what to display for everything 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:19.140
 then the museum of what to see if there 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:21.689
 trip temperature average consumption is 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.970
 usual stuff that there is temperature 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.880
 engine at outside temperature 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.869
 the time trip the time the phone fell 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.720
 moto ok then to adjust instead 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.370
 suspensions are always for the church 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.950
 to adjust also ok it lights up side 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.770
 came 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.670
 each other must be the bike in neutral 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.580
 steady on 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.060
 and then decide if you're alone by just 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.770
 new entry in two 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.770
 in two with luggage 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.540
 two wagons 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.930
 alone 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.860
 if luggage 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.860
 see video messages 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:30.230
 I return it to standard 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:34.010
 this represents and crushing this 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.470
 or of what if then as not confirm e 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.900
 the other one that does not mean now must be added 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.250
 not flashing then it changes as then there 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.739
 are additional functions tents 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.189
 crushed menu for a certain amount of time 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:51.319
 so nothing can decide the grip 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:53.269
 adjust the order nesi memories are 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.790
 three knobs there is the three measures what 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.790
 he wants three measures that heat so much 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.480
 that you can customize yourself you know that a 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.919
 level 1 is very low is already high e 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.739
 then then decide the other two three 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:12.290
 levels of maneuvers also engage in 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.909
 how much is missing the desire or then these two 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.340
 books the model deliver the tires 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.859
 rather than a certain type and decide 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.829
 something nice this what to do 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:28.579
 penn trip the travel time for i 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:33.519
 which then to reset the unit of measurement 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:36.889
 the display to decide which one is there 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.019
 36 submenus decide which to put 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.299
 what of charges then odometer 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.940
 together with the outside temperature together 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.590
 to the tribune as the garmin who tells us 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.290
 this but what does it mean for you? 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.620
 cigarette bottom which is aluminum 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:58.140
 digital clock reset 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.959
 ok then there is the traction control this 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.379
 I do n't remember 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:06.030
 ok so it doesn't turn off in this too 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.430
 In this case the bike must always be off 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.010
 because it is pretending to always be firm and 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.209
 turn it off fashion master instead 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.590
 always in fashion 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:21.030
 this is the scaled side of the scaled car 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.350
 just when the low customer turns are 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.710
 scale and then of course the cruise that you hear it 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.240
 at this moment, decrease ok must 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.300
 be in third 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.630
 over 50 kilometers per hour crush 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.699
 this gas is constant and when 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.620
 press this button 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.720
 this is inserted then I read naples 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.449
 mind of like how to increase or 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.210
 always decrease with these rates here 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:52.560
 unplug it or crush brakes today in 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:57.990
 ahead there is the gas of these woods 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.060
 who is just a matter of playing with it a little 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.810
 strange a bit of love a grip here and 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.680
 locked up 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.599
 the drawer when its playing 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.900
 when it is closed, one is not mistaken 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.900
 own 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.860
 12 series socket then there is the adjustment 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:20.710
 I didn't hear any headlights here then 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.710
 regulation from dallas l Teramo height
