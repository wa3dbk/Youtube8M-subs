00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
I'm going to show you this shaft as you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
I'm going to show you this shaft as you
can<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.410> almost<00:00:40.680> worn<00:00:41.129> completely

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
can see it's almost worn completely

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.910 
can see it's almost worn completely
through<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.840> about<00:00:43.079> ready<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.350> snap<00:00:43.680> off

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
through and it's about ready to snap off

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.240 
through and it's about ready to snap off
and<00:00:44.480> better<00:00:45.480> cable<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and better cable here and this is the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.170 
and better cable here and this is the
way<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.579> cable<00:00:48.120> fits<00:00:48.989> onto<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:50.700> shaft<00:00:51.000> this

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
way the cable fits onto the shaft this

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.500 
way the cable fits onto the shaft this
is<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> old<00:00:51.600> design<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:54.000> fits<00:00:54.270> over<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
is the old design and it fits over the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
is the old design and it fits over the
hook<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.199> loop<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.770> every<00:00:56.340> time<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.730> press

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
hook this loop and every time you press

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.060 
hook this loop and every time you press
the<00:00:57.239> clutch<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.469> this

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the clutch in you can see that this

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.860 
the clutch in you can see that this
cable<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.760> wearing<00:01:00.120> against<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.600> shaft

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
cable is wearing against that shaft

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.860 
cable is wearing against that shaft
eventually<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:02.100> gonna<00:01:02.309> break<00:01:02.520> off<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
eventually that's gonna break off now a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.450 
eventually that's gonna break off now a
new<00:01:04.110> design<00:01:04.530> we're<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.010> putting<00:01:05.309> in

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
new design we're going to be putting in

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.600 
new design we're going to be putting in
works<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.970> bearing<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:08.010> I'll<00:01:08.430> show

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
works like a bearing so and I'll show

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.200 
works like a bearing so and I'll show
how<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.970> works<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.750> remove<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:11.150> nut<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
how that works we just remove this nut a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.990 
how that works we just remove this nut a
washer<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.560> cable<00:01:14.010> slides<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.700> over

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
washer and the cable slides right over

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.770 
washer and the cable slides right over
the<00:01:15.090> top<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.619> sleeve<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:18.060> put<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> washer

the top of that sleeve we put the washer
back<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.790> nut<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.450> tighten<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.869> down

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
