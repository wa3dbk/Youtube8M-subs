00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700

weather a lot
but<00:00:48.950> I<00:00:48.980> figured<00:00:49.400> out<00:00:49.489> why<00:00:49.700> I<00:00:49.730> did<00:00:50.620> when<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:51.739> get

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
but I figured out why I did when you get

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.080

to<00:00:52.010> be<00:00:52.040> as<00:00:52.280> old<00:00:52.430> as<00:00:52.640> me<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:53.480> just<00:00:53.870> gets<00:00:54.080> tiresome

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
to be as old as me it just gets tiresome

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.520

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
other people and so you just tend to

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.960 
other people and so you just tend to
talk<00:01:00.530> about<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.010> weather<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.340> whole<00:01:01.550> lot<00:01:01.760> more
