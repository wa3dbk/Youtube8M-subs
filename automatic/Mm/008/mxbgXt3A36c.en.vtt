think that it's not working this time

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.510 
think that it's not working this time
because<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.690> too<00:01:12.930> many<00:01:13.140> people<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.130> last

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
because we have too many people and last

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.510 
because we have too many people and last
time<00:01:14.790> there<00:01:15.030> wasn't<00:01:15.330> much<00:01:15.450> people<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:15.900> all

the<00:01:19.410> ghost<00:01:19.650> which<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.280> probably<00:01:20.580> can't<00:01:21.090> do

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
the ghost which we probably can't do

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.280 
the ghost which we probably can't do
because<00:01:22.440> I<00:01:22.470> don't<00:01:22.800> have<00:01:23.040> any<00:01:23.280> guns<00:01:23.550> or<00:01:24.290> use

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
because I don't have any guns or use

00:01:25.290 --> 00:02:17.380 
because I don't have any guns or use
someone<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:25.860> high<00:01:26.040> energy<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.360> us<00:01:27.479> out
