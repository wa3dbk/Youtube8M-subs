take<00:02:08.970> up<00:02:09.119> 30<00:02:09.390> housing<00:02:09.810> spaces<00:02:10.050> Giants<00:02:10.890> take<00:02:11.009> up

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
take up 30 housing spaces Giants take up

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.230 
take up 30 housing spaces Giants take up
5<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.030> you

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
5 so you

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.830 
5 so you
get<00:02:12.480> six<00:02:13.020> Giants<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:14.460> every<00:02:14.730> one<00:02:14.940> golem<00:02:15.390> now

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
get six Giants for every one golem now

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.310 
get six Giants for every one golem now
six<00:02:16.290> level<00:02:16.800> seven<00:02:17.130> Giants<00:02:17.310> will<00:02:17.640> give<00:02:17.880> you

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
six level seven Giants will give you

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.250 
six level seven Giants will give you
6600<00:02:19.320> hit<00:02:19.470> points<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.030> one<00:02:21.030> level<00:02:21.600> five<00:02:21.810> golem

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
6600 hit points and one level five golem

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.830 
6600 hit points and one level five golem
will<00:02:22.410> give<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> 6300<00:02:23.670> hit<00:02:23.790> points<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.300> you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
will give you 6300 hit points so you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.560 
will give you 6300 hit points so you
start<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.320> think<00:02:25.500> well<00:02:26.060> isn't<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> giant

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
start to think well isn't the giant

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.940 
start to think well isn't the giant
better<00:02:27.950> well<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.910> my<00:02:30.180> opinion<00:02:30.330> no<00:02:31.020> because<00:02:31.860> you

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
better well in my opinion no because you

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.800 
better well in my opinion no because you
have<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.280> look<00:02:32.490> at<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> special<00:02:33.030> ability<00:02:33.780> of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
have to look at the special ability of

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.890 
have to look at the special ability of
the<00:02:34.290> golem<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.730> must<00:02:35.970> factor<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.540> into

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the golem and you must factor that into

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.900 
the golem and you must factor that into
the<00:02:36.990> equation<00:02:37.290> because<00:02:38.070> once<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.430> golem

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the equation because once the golem

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.660 
the equation because once the golem
actually<00:02:39.090> dies<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.230> splits<00:02:40.980> apart<00:02:41.160> into<00:02:41.550> two

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
actually dies it splits apart into two

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.560 
actually dies it splits apart into two
golem<00:02:42.300> mites<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.750> each<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.470> 1/5<00:02:44.250> or<00:02:44.460> 20%<00:02:45.120> of

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
golem mites that each have 1/5 or 20% of

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.090 
golem mites that each have 1/5 or 20% of
the<00:02:45.750> damage<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.290> hit<00:02:46.530> points<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the damage and hit points of the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.990 
the damage and hit points of the
standard<00:02:47.490> golem

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
standard golem

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.690 
standard golem
so<00:02:48.450> even<00:02:48.690> though<00:02:48.990> you're<00:02:49.260> getting<00:02:49.490> 300<00:02:50.490> less

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
so even though you're getting 300 less

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.440 
so even though you're getting 300 less
hit<00:02:50.940> points<00:02:51.300> with<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.380> golem<00:02:52.830> opposed<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.460> 6

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
hit points with one golem opposed to 6

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.320 
hit points with one golem opposed to 6
level<00:02:55.080> 7<00:02:55.440> Giants<00:02:55.890> when<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.580> golem<00:02:56.940> splits

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
level 7 Giants when the golem splits

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.600 
level 7 Giants when the golem splits
apart<00:02:57.480> you're<00:02:58.140> getting<00:02:58.440> two<00:02:58.680> more<00:02:58.950> miniature

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
apart you're getting two more miniature

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.280 
apart you're getting two more miniature
golems<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.420> are<00:03:00.540> going<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.720> go<00:03:00.870> ahead<00:03:01.080> and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
golems that are going to go ahead and

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.430 
golems that are going to go ahead and
deal<00:03:01.640> 11<00:03:02.640> damage<00:03:03.150> per<00:03:03.360> second<00:03:03.750> each<00:03:03.900> end

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
deal 11 damage per second each end

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.660 
deal 11 damage per second each end
they're<00:03:05.370> gonna<00:03:05.490> have<00:03:05.790> about<00:03:07.010> 1260<00:03:08.010> hit<00:03:08.280> points

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
they're gonna have about 1260 hit points

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.720 
they're gonna have about 1260 hit points
each<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.150> theoretically<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:11.070> means<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.460> level

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
each so theoretically that means a level

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.390 
each so theoretically that means a level
5<00:03:11.940> golem<00:03:12.540> will<00:03:13.170> have<00:03:13.320> seven<00:03:13.740> thousand<00:03:14.190> five

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
5 golem will have seven thousand five

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.580 
5 golem will have seven thousand five
hundred<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.910> sixty<00:03:15.300> hit<00:03:15.450> points<00:03:15.810> opposed<00:03:16.380> to

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
hundred and sixty hit points opposed to

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.680 
hundred and sixty hit points opposed to
six<00:03:16.860> level<00:03:17.220> seven<00:03:17.520> Giants<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:18.000> give<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.240> 60

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
six level seven Giants that give you 60

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.980 
six level seven Giants that give you 60
600<00:03:19.350> hit<00:03:19.500> points<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:21.510> also<00:03:21.660> have<00:03:21.870> to

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
600 hit points and you also have to

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.300 
600 hit points and you also have to
realize<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.380> when<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.740> use<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:22.920> whole<00:03:23.130> bunch

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
realize that when you use a whole bunch

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.190 
realize that when you use a whole bunch
of<00:03:23.400> giants<00:03:23.880> instead<00:03:24.210> of<00:03:24.300> golems<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.840> Giants

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
of giants instead of golems the Giants

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.840 
of giants instead of golems the Giants
are<00:03:25.290> gonna<00:03:25.410> die<00:03:25.650> out<00:03:25.830> faster<00:03:26.370> which<00:03:26.820> means

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
are gonna die out faster which means

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.640 
are gonna die out faster which means
that<00:03:27.240> the<00:03:27.300> enemy<00:03:27.660> defenses<00:03:28.260> could<00:03:28.410> actually

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
that the enemy defenses could actually

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.100 
that the enemy defenses could actually
after<00:03:29.280> they<00:03:29.400> target<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.090> kill<00:03:30.240> one<00:03:30.600> giant

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
after they target and kill one giant

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.930 
after they target and kill one giant
instead<00:03:31.710> of<00:03:31.830> targeting<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> entire<00:03:32.610> pack

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
instead of targeting the entire pack

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.880 
instead of targeting the entire pack
they<00:03:33.420> could<00:03:33.570> switch<00:03:33.840> from<00:03:33.870> one<00:03:34.320> giant<00:03:34.590> to

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
they could switch from one giant to

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.380 
they could switch from one giant to
another<00:03:35.190> giant<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:35.730> then<00:03:35.850> start<00:03:36.180> targeting

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
another giant and then start targeting

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.810 
another giant and then start targeting
your<00:03:36.720> wizards<00:03:37.170> or<00:03:37.380> your<00:03:37.590> witches<00:03:37.980> what<00:03:38.670> you

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
your wizards or your witches what you

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.280 
your wizards or your witches what you
don't<00:03:39.030> want<00:03:39.210> to<00:03:39.330> happen<00:03:39.510> or<00:03:39.870> your<00:03:40.050> pekka's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
don't want to happen or your pekka's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.590 
don't want to happen or your pekka's
while<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.190> know<00:03:41.340> your<00:03:41.520> golem<00:03:41.880> can<00:03:41.910> last<00:03:42.300> way

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
while you know your golem can last way

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.470 
while you know your golem can last way
longer<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:43.200> will<00:03:43.320> only<00:03:43.500> be<00:03:43.740> targeted<00:03:44.310> by<00:03:44.850> that

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
longer and will only be targeted by that

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.010 
longer and will only be targeted by that
one<00:03:46.080> defense<00:03:46.770> so<00:03:47.370> all<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:47.820> all<00:03:47.940> even<00:03:48.540> though

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
one defense so all in all even though

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.290 
one defense so all in all even though
the<00:03:49.230> Giants<00:03:49.410> are<00:03:49.680> still<00:03:49.890> at<00:03:50.010> level<00:03:50.160> 7<00:03:50.670> or<00:03:50.850> have

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
the Giants are still at level 7 or have

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.360 
the Giants are still at level 7 or have
gone<00:03:51.510> up<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.810> level<00:03:52.080> 7<00:03:52.380> there's<00:03:52.800> still<00:03:53.130> not

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
gone up to level 7 there's still not

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.210 
gone up to level 7 there's still not
nowhere<00:03:53.610> near<00:03:54.060> as<00:03:54.300> good<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.810> tanks<00:03:55.290> as<00:03:55.440> the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
nowhere near as good of tanks as the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.760 
nowhere near as good of tanks as the
level<00:03:56.550> 5<00:03:56.790> golems<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:57.870> hopefully<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.440> could<00:03:58.560> put

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
level 5 golems so hopefully I could put

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.040 
level 5 golems so hopefully I could put
all<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.280> rest<00:03:59.550> by<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.120> hit<00:04:00.450> points<00:04:00.840> by

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
all that to rest by the hit points by

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.320
