00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
video um this is the footage they just

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.220 
video um this is the footage they just
showed<00:00:23.640> at<00:00:24.090> e3<00:00:24.840> um<00:00:26.510> just<00:00:27.510> keep<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.900> mind<00:00:28.109> this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
showed at e3 um just keep in mind this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.500 
showed at e3 um just keep in mind this
is<00:00:28.289> alpha<00:00:28.859> footage<00:00:29.100> a<00:00:29.519> lot<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.300> is

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
is alpha footage a lot of this is

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.910 
is alpha footage a lot of this is
probably<00:00:30.779> gonna<00:00:31.019> change<00:00:31.439> there<00:00:31.710> could<00:00:31.890> be

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
probably gonna change there could be

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.520 
probably gonna change there could be
different<00:00:32.279> skill<00:00:32.640> trees<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.180> could<00:00:33.360> be

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
different skill trees there could be

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.150 
different skill trees there could be
different<00:00:34.530> weapons<00:00:35.129> different<00:00:35.580> enemies<00:00:35.940> um

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
different weapons different enemies um

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.319 
different weapons different enemies um
the<00:00:38.160> mechanics<00:00:38.640> i'm<00:00:38.760> guessing<00:00:39.059> are<00:00:39.180> gonna

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the mechanics i'm guessing are gonna

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.690 
the mechanics i'm guessing are gonna
stay<00:00:39.690> around<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.260> same<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:41.250> probably<00:00:41.430> gonna

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
stay around the same it's probably gonna

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
stay around the same it's probably gonna
play<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.630> the<00:00:42.719> zero<00:00:42.960> gravity<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
play like this with the zero gravity and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.290 
play like this with the zero gravity and
whatnot<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:44.700> kind<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.090> cool

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
whatnot so it was actually kind of cool

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.810 
whatnot so it was actually kind of cool
to<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.829> action<00:00:47.040> I<00:00:47.370> really<00:00:47.640> like

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
to see that in action I really like

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
to see that in action I really like
seeing<00:00:48.149> them<00:00:48.899> jump<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.980> hundred<00:00:50.250> feet<00:00:50.840> at

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
seeing them jump like a hundred feet at

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.389 
seeing them jump like a hundred feet at
one<00:00:52.020> time<00:00:52.200> like<00:00:52.379> look<00:00:52.590> at<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.710> that's<00:00:53.070> gonna

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
one time like look at that that's gonna

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.799 
one time like look at that that's gonna
be<00:00:53.640> amazing<00:00:55.520> i'm<00:00:56.520> not<00:00:56.700> gonna<00:00:56.820> get<00:00:57.030> my<00:00:57.090> titties

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
brought some back from Borderlands one

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.859 
brought some back from Borderlands one
in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> borderlands<00:01:11.430> 2<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.479> did<00:01:12.659> change

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
in the borderlands 2 but they did change

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.520 
in the borderlands 2 but they did change
them<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.520> they<00:01:14.520> didn't<00:01:14.790> play<00:01:15.630> quite<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.200> same

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
them and they didn't play quite the same

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
them and they didn't play quite the same
like<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.159> Hellfire<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.880> Borderlands<00:01:18.390> one

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
like the Hellfire in Borderlands one

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.510 
like the Hellfire in Borderlands one
kicked<00:01:18.810> ass<00:01:18.960> house<00:01:19.260> fire<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.500> Borderlands<00:01:20.220> 2

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
kicked ass house fire in Borderlands 2

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.940 
kicked ass house fire in Borderlands 2
did<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.930> maybe<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.320> unkempt<00:01:22.710> Harold

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
did not so maybe this unkempt Harold

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.630 
did not so maybe this unkempt Harold
sucks<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:24.030> maybe<00:01:24.720> they're<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.619> using<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.369> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
sucks or maybe they're just using it to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
sucks or maybe they're just using it to
use<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.180> they<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> bunch

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
use it and they don't have like a bunch

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
use it and they don't have like a bunch
of<00:01:29.009> guns<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.670> game<00:01:29.880> yet<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.509> it's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
of guns in the game yet you know it's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.350 
of guns in the game yet you know it's
it's<00:01:31.470> hard<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> say<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.520> still<00:01:32.850> very<00:01:33.180> very

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
it's hard to say it's still very very

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
it's hard to say it's still very very
early<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.380> us<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.650> make<00:01:34.799> any<00:01:35.009> assumptions<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
early for us to make any assumptions and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.710 
early for us to make any assumptions and
predictions<00:01:37.380> about<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:38.009> any<00:01:38.909> accurate<00:01:39.509> ones

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
predictions about this any accurate ones

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.080 
predictions about this any accurate ones
at<00:01:40.049> least<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.500> guess<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.009> speculate<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.820> we

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
at least I guess we can speculate all we

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.080 
at least I guess we can speculate all we
want<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.560> nice<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.130> some<00:01:44.579> gameplay

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
want it was nice to see some gameplay

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.819 
want it was nice to see some gameplay
footage<00:01:45.450> though<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:46.049> bit<00:01:46.320> different

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
footage though a little bit different

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.460 
footage though a little bit different
from<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> pax<00:01:47.939> demo

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
from the pax demo

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.490 
from the pax demo
I<00:01:50.060> feel<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.150> this<00:01:51.300> was<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:51.690> like<00:01:52.020> actual

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
I feel like this was more like actual

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.760 
I feel like this was more like actual
gameplay<00:01:52.860> not<00:01:53.540> two<00:01:54.540> guys<00:01:54.720> walking<00:01:55.080> around<00:01:55.260> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
gameplay not two guys walking around and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.730 
gameplay not two guys walking around and
narrating<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:56.520> hope<00:01:56.720> this<00:01:57.720> is<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
narrating and hope this is a this is a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.780 
narrating and hope this is a this is a
moon<00:01:59.040> crater<00:01:59.840> we're<00:02:00.840> gonna<00:02:00.990> jump<00:02:01.380> over<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.790> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
moon crater we're gonna jump over it and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.560 
moon crater we're gonna jump over it and
use<00:02:03.000> her<00:02:03.180> oz<00:02:03.360> kit<00:02:04.160> no<00:02:05.160> like<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.150> was<00:02:06.360> actually

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
use her oz kit no like this was actually

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.510 
use her oz kit no like this was actually
them<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.230> going<00:02:07.620> through<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.890> game<00:02:08.100> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
them like going through the game and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.850
