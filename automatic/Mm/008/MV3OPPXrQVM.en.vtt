00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.570
 hi friends, I want to make you a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.059
 comparison on two filter brands 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 Power filter high flow rate 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.779
 recognized prestige within the market 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.100
 There are many brands to see about the 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.109
 we work on motorcycles, others do not 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.839
 we work but mainly to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.249
 we like mind street is worth it 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.769
 English brand of recognized prestige 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.779
 perhaps of the pioneers in this world 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.900
 of the power air filters and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.130
 another the dna that a Greek filter is worth 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.280
 the few Greeks are working 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.440
 right now unfortunately and with much 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.990
 quality also important things to have 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 into account in a filter filter that has 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.800
 good rubbers so that the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.090
 then assemble the filter housing is 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.720
 good street voucher also incorporates 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 an assembly grease is worth for 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.090
 facilitate what is what is assembly 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.360
 the things the director has is for 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.240
 example in the fat chain grease 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.190
 of assembly that has to have fallen 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.540
 or we miss it for the finite and we 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.490
 help not to facilitate the time of 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.470
 disassemble the filter mainly 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.810
 because there are filters that do not have are not 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.060
 filters with covers for example the r 1200 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.090
 gs from 2004 to 2000 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.009
 12 if I remember correctly the filter as 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.630
 We carry on one side and the filter has 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.909
 to roll through some guides 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.770
 then in these filters is a 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.899
 wonder because this fat also makes 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.789
 of lubricant to be able to put it well and 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.920
 that joined and then we do not have shots 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.710
 of air at the time of riding it 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.140
 I already commented on high flow filters 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.549
 as much of enea as street of quite 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.420
 quality there is another brand that we work 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.340
 what is bmc but good 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.080
 there are many brands of centers and really 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.509
 they do not have why the good ones 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.390
 we always sell to observe that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.700
 the profiles are not too hard for the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.700
 good assembly and then the filter then 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.930
 have a suitable cotton and a mesh 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.429
 ideal filters of very high quality 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.950
 filters where it comes to guarantee filters 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.209
 for life and what's in the guarantee 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.239
 for a million miles 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.920
 so that I could really do the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.000
 kilometers that you want the filter is 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.150
 supposed to last for as long as 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.150
 five motorcycles ok see you later
