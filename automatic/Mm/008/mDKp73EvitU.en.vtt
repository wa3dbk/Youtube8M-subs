can you can hop in the crucible as a
party<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.710> six<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:23.640> wreck<00:02:23.940> people

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
party of six and you know wreck people

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.750 
party of six and you know wreck people
do<00:02:24.450> stuff<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.460> know<00:02:26.550> there's

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
do stuff like that but you know there's

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.940 
do stuff like that but you know there's
not<00:02:26.910> really<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> dedicated<00:02:27.750> playlist<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.710> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
not really a dedicated playlist to the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.100 
not really a dedicated playlist to the
clan<00:02:29.190> system<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.820> obviously<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.600> think<00:02:30.660> bungee

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
clan system and obviously I think bungee

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.180 
clan system and obviously I think bungee
is<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:32.150> studio<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.210> understands<00:02:34.110> at<00:02:34.950> least

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
is a studio that understands at least

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.190 
is a studio that understands at least
from<00:02:35.310> Halo<00:02:35.610> 2<00:02:35.670> what<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.600> means<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.050> with

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
from Halo 2 what that means so with

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.300 
from Halo 2 what that means so with
gears<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.680> war<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:40.080> know<00:02:40.170> it's<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.830> system

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
gears of war you know it's it's a system

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.400 
gears of war you know it's it's a system
where<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:43.190> am<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.460> surprised<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.780> there's

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
where I am so surprised that there's

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.610 
where I am so surprised that there's
never<00:02:46.800> been<00:02:47.240> really<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.380> something<00:02:49.380> to

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
never been really a something to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.410 
never been really a something to
identify<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:51.000> clan<00:02:51.870> or<00:02:52.260> team<00:02:52.950> at<00:02:53.460> all<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.270> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
game based on the team work that's

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.440 
game based on the team work that's
involved<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.670> know<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.820> can<00:02:57.060> look<00:02:57.180> at<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.330> lot

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450

of other games all the ones that I've
mentioned<00:02:59.520> and<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:01.320> don't<00:03:01.800> really<00:03:01.980> feel<00:03:02.100> like

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the stories on them really focus on

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.750 
the stories on them really focus on
teamwork<00:03:06.380> as<00:03:07.380> much<00:03:07.710> as<00:03:07.740> Gears<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.220> War<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.640> it's

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
teamwork as much as Gears of War so it's

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.070 
teamwork as much as Gears of War so it's
really<00:03:08.880> surprising<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.630> me<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.780> there

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
really surprising to me that there

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.530 
really surprising to me that there
hasn't<00:03:10.260> been<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.590> clan<00:03:10.950> system<00:03:11.540> integrated

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
hasn't been a clan system integrated

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.710 
hasn't been a clan system integrated
into<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.080> game<00:03:13.730> at<00:03:14.730> some<00:03:15.240> point<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.690> time

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
into the game at some point in time

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.890 
into the game at some point in time
whether<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.860> be<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.310> for<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:18.060> know<00:03:18.180> tagging

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
stats or something like that at the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.610 
stats or something like that at the
gears<00:03:27.540> were<00:03:27.660> three<00:03:27.959> what<00:03:28.140> would<00:03:28.320> have<00:03:28.440> been

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
gears were three what would have been

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.130 
gears were three what would have been
the<00:03:28.680> one<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.010> have<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.340> opportunity<00:03:29.990> to<00:03:30.990> do

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the one to have that opportunity to do

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.280 
the one to have that opportunity to do
that<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:31.670> it's<00:03:32.670> uh<00:03:32.850> it's<00:03:33.360> really<00:03:34.020> interesting

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
that but it's uh it's really interesting

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.170 
that but it's uh it's really interesting
that<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:34.770> hasn't<00:03:34.980> been<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.340> focus<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:35.970> that

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
that there hasn't been a focus on that

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.750 
that there hasn't been a focus on that
considering<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.470> level<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.520> teamwork

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
considering the level of teamwork

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.570 
considering the level of teamwork
involved<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.570> game<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.530> for<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.430> new

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
involved in the game so for the new

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.770 
involved in the game so for the new
gears<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:41.970> war<00:03:42.120> i<00:03:42.150> would<00:03:42.330> definitely

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
gears of war i would definitely

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.030 
gears of war i would definitely
definitely<00:03:44.030> think<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.360> would<00:03:45.510> be<00:03:45.570> a

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
definitely think that that would be a

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.449 
definitely think that that would be a
thing<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.190> they're<00:03:47.340> thinking<00:03:47.700> about<00:03:47.760> and

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
thing that they're thinking about and

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.990 
thing that they're thinking about and
you<00:03:50.459> know<00:03:50.550> i<00:03:50.580> mentioned<00:03:51.440> bungee<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.760> halo<00:03:53.760> as

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
you know i mentioned bungee and halo as

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.100 
you know i mentioned bungee and halo as
something<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:55.400> utilized<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.670> system<00:03:57.110> and

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
something that utilized the system and

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.500 
something that utilized the system and
you<00:03:58.830> know<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:58.950> think<00:03:59.070> 343<00:03:59.760> is<00:03:59.850> also<00:04:00.180> thinking

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
you know I think 343 is also thinking

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.790 
you know I think 343 is also thinking
about<00:04:00.570> that<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.170> reason<00:04:01.320> i<00:04:01.470> bring<00:04:01.650> them

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
about that and the reason i bring them

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.040 
about that and the reason i bring them
up<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:02.130> because<00:04:02.330> black<00:04:03.330> tough<00:04:03.570> studio<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:03.989> a

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
up is because black tough studio is a

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.070 
up is because black tough studio is a
microsoft<00:04:04.440> own<00:04:05.030> studio<00:04:06.030> at<00:04:06.120> this<00:04:06.270> point<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.750> i

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
microsoft own studio at this point and i

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.290

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
and it has a clan system in it I

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.250 
and it has a clan system in it I
wouldn't<00:04:25.830> be<00:04:25.980> surprised<00:04:26.490> if<00:04:26.970> we<00:04:27.810> see<00:04:28.050> some

overlap<00:04:28.710> with<00:04:29.490> some<00:04:29.820> of<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.000> features<00:04:30.180> that

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
overlap with some of the features that

overlap with some of the features that
we<00:04:30.660> see<00:04:30.810> in<00:04:30.840> Halo<00:04:31.080> 5<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.460> new<00:04:32.610> gears<00:04:32.910> of

war I think there's going to be a lot of

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.879 
war I think there's going to be a lot of
harmonious<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:36.750> know<00:04:36.840> feature<00:04:37.110> sets<00:04:37.530> that
