00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
trying to compare you I can't even think

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.069 
trying to compare you I can't even think
of<00:02:44.010> anything<00:02:44.219> if<00:02:44.549> there's<00:02:44.730> two<00:02:44.849> no<00:02:45.000> no<00:02:45.599> the

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
of anything if there's two no no the

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.830 
of anything if there's two no no the
iPhone<00:02:46.530> 6<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.099> not<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.609> same<00:02:47.819> level<00:02:47.879> as<00:02:48.389> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
iPhone 6 is not on the same level as the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.530 
iPhone 6 is not on the same level as the
Xbox<00:02:49.139> one<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.769> ps4<00:02:49.950> like<00:02:50.579> why<00:02:50.819> are<00:02:50.879> you<00:02:51.030> even

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
Xbox one and ps4 like why are you even

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.780 
Xbox one and ps4 like why are you even
say<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.810> can't<00:02:52.200> even<00:02:52.290> think<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:53.250> logical

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
say I can't even think of a logical

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.849 
say I can't even think of a logical
reason<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.659> even<00:02:54.900> say<00:02:55.109> that<00:02:55.139> like<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.739> it

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
reason to even say that like is it

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.649 
reason to even say that like is it
because<00:02:56.159> you<00:02:56.280> really<00:02:56.639> want<00:02:56.669> cell<00:02:57.180> phones<00:02:57.450> to

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
because you really want cell phones to

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.929 
because you really want cell phones to
take<00:02:57.870> over<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.200> quickly<00:02:58.829> that's<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.760> only

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
take over that quickly that's the only

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.179 
take over that quickly that's the only
thing<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.209> could<00:03:00.329> think<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.720> because<00:03:01.189> anyone

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
thing I could think of because anyone

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.979 
thing I could think of because anyone
with<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> brain<00:03:02.760> ik<00:03:02.909> look<00:03:03.120> ok<00:03:03.419> I<00:03:03.450> haven't<00:03:03.689> seen

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
with a brain ik look ok I haven't seen

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.710 
with a brain ik look ok I haven't seen

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
plus but even if they're impressive

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.569 
plus but even if they're impressive
benchmarks<00:03:10.319> they're<00:03:10.680> not<00:03:11.040> going<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.340> come

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
benchmarks they're not going to come

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.909 
benchmarks they're not going to come

close to a gaming console that's plugged
into<00:03:14.129> a<00:03:14.250> wall<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.819> when<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.359> plug<00:03:15.629> a<00:03:15.659> cut

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
into a wall that when you plug a cut

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.449 
into a wall that when you plug a cut
when<00:03:16.139> you<00:03:16.230> plug<00:03:16.439> a<00:03:16.470> piece<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.859> hardware<00:03:17.159> into<00:03:17.430> a

when you plug a piece of hardware into a
wall<00:03:17.790> 2<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.659> have<00:03:18.870> more<00:03:19.109> power<00:03:19.379> draw<00:03:19.919> which

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
wall 2 you have more power draw which

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.740 
wall 2 you have more power draw which
means<00:03:20.729> the<00:03:20.879> hardware<00:03:21.299> could<00:03:21.419> be<00:03:21.569> more

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
means the hardware could be more

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.899 
means the hardware could be more
powerful<00:03:21.959> though<00:03:22.889> cell<00:03:23.250> phones<00:03:23.519> are<00:03:23.699> running

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
they're always going to be running off

they're always going to be running off

right<00:03:29.459> now<00:03:29.729> there<00:03:30.479> is<00:03:30.629> no<00:03:30.840> phone<00:03:31.139> out<00:03:31.379> there

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
right now there is no phone out there

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.069 
right now there is no phone out there
that<00:03:32.159> comes<00:03:32.430> even<00:03:32.639> close<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:33.510> power<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.870> a
