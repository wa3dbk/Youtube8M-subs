00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.349
 a new feature within the retiree of Cinema 4d version with eleven points 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.229
 are the margins instances 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:12.690
 if instances allow them 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.720
 CR memory-saving complex to be able to race seven races 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.860
 Rene Instanzen Siri does not work like the ones in the previous version 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.199
 existing instances 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.289
 but also have some more limitations 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.669
 For example, edge instances can not be edited with Aton's 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.559
 they may not be around there from HyperWorks or we can be too 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.489
 not Vienna different animation stages are located 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.490
 on the other hand 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
 Randa instances also offer them a very big advantage 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.310
 Let's take a look at a very simple example 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.830
 I have a scene here with a skyscraper and if I'm here with me 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.010
 apple or control 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.700
 in May the ten of Zion leave any ads so they look like we currently 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.550
 only 826 have a political scientist 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.360
 next to the now make a simple copy Rothrist skyscraper 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.550
 and Noonan invoke our scene inflation so of course we have exactly 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.940
 the double number of political scientists our scene 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.390
 to prevent that 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.190
 you would in the previous version of 11 point 5 a normal in ten draw 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.830
 use 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.540
 the just to go out the object in their object the manager 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.400
 and profes about objects 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.520
 Morsleben 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.040
 here an instance object 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.320
 This Instance object now instantiates the France objects registered with it 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.310
 high and we can now use this instance here will be the Deka 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.580
 Let's now look at our politicians and call kaut to see them 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.030
 has this one 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.080
 not changed 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.850
 this kind of recent draw 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.950
 is natural 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.310
 accessible by several routes they have the option 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.259
 once the ones just did it 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.450
 namely to create an instance object but you also have the option 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.220
 here in an Erie objects 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.620
 leave the whole instance to theirs and they have the opportunity 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.569
 also 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.449
 at cup 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:16.499
 So select high and publish function here 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.259
 that we want to have instances instead of copies 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.519
 in all these functions shown start were noticed 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.500
 that you now also have a new entry with the names ren of the instances 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:32.509
 have 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.909
 that means that when duplicating I could instead of normal instance nine cattle 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.459
 Instance mink has been 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.459
 Instance her over the excited 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.609
 I now have the opportunity here in the properties of the Aris 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.130
 to create normal instances 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.130
 Krenner to create instances 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.439
 Of course we also have the normal one 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.299
 Linz quite objectively also the possibility 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.489
 to create no borders instance 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.039
 Let's have a look at the short program 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.739
 we can see here the buildings and skyscrapers and here we can 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:09.299
 now 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.719
 the whole 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.169
 to be photographed as a hands instance 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.009
 really around the differences 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:17.430
 with husband Fender wrestling 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.749
 to see between normal instances rendering instance 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:24.669
 we need a scene in which many took place in ten drawings 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.019
 or by being instanced by her political stig objects have been said 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:33.929
 about to fill this scene very quickly with instances that do not fill that 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:37.749
 additional module Mowbray bandages they can of course weeks 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.879
 duplicate function or the like on points 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.769
 I find out skyscraper and 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.929
 Now add No component objects to the tool object 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.399
 with an over object of a skyscraper and we can now 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.429
 the Knoblich still home strong 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:04:00.559
 here we go the mode of a witness Dieter von Klonen and we only need 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:06.079
 a clone is growing on Hirzel so we get here along the Great 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.539
 skyscrapers 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:12.109
 Does he come up with scenes, well, maybe just come down with witnesses 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.249
 10 skyscrapers the facilities move skyscrapers in the other direction 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:20.569
 and expand and Zachrich year on a thousand meters on this boat 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:26.319
 But now we have already created a hundred skyscrapers 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.389
 Now that the greens could look, they see us through the normal 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.779
 Instance her and the owner of a cool objects still takes 826 crown 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.150
 still have 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.040
 this is us 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.050
 this scene now just briefly in the image managers 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.639
 they see this scene is generated very quickly and we have within two 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.669
 Seconds a result 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.069
 Now we do not want to increase the number and the clou just her 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.929
 for that we enlarge ourselves I want some nla-game 5000 to 5000 meters here 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.999
 and put on these surfaces now just 50 times 50 Ploner 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:06.250
 so one already 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.250
 much much larger number of objects 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.080
 here too 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.740
 of course the sound antennas of the tuner helps us create instance 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.270
 Let's just leave that 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.350
 They see that now an end needs a lot of preparation time before coming 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.039
 the race begins 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.039
 we're done after about seven seconds 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.349
 Now we switch 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.949
 Animals of the instance are increasing 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.949
 Paston allows the rendering 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:41.900
 they see the rendering starts almost like this 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.960
 and we're done in five seconds 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.380
 another advantage in that of the instances 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.449
 is the work in the video portal 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.879
 we see that with the help of the barking authorities, we are very fast in her 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.710
 Video portals can move 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.639
 so what is not a problem 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.490
 King of the instance now disable here and try the same 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.319
 once again 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.500
 SOK means Jung Port and a lot of porters and they see that mine 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.119
 Graphics card now has to switch 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.300
 as well as here 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.300
 are tendency to dance a real workload 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.700
 around yourself 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.879
 the real one 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:18.879
 make the instance impressive again 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.380
 to look at because I now here the number 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.380
 Minor the whole just a little bit of mountain huts are now included 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.990
 ten thousand Groener 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.550
 and min 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.550
 this will be simply because the margins will add instances 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.509
 and just let it spoil you 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.860
 we see the rendering starts almost as fast and also this image 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.910
 is dancing 90 within a few seconds of finished render 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:48.639
 could 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.550
 in the classic way they are in Cinema 4d 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.610
 Had visions 11 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.520
 can we 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.889
 and of course, watch the whole thing 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:58.000
 and they see 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.780
 that lasts and much much longer and would be on a weaker equipped 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.119
 calculator 

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:05.159
 no longer changeable
