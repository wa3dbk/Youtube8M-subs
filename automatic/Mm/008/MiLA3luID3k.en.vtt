this is actually the test that John has

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.989 
this is actually the test that John has
to<00:05:14.559> carry<00:05:14.799> out<00:05:15.009> to<00:05:15.429> ensure<00:05:15.729> two<00:05:15.969> things

to carry out to ensure two things
firstly<00:05:16.779> that<00:05:17.739> the<00:05:17.829> air-conditioning<00:05:18.459> into

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
firstly that the air-conditioning into

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.859 
firstly that the air-conditioning into

and<00:05:20.289> be<00:05:20.559> to<00:05:21.339> make<00:05:21.489> sure<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.759> cooling<00:05:22.089> system

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
and be to make sure the cooling system

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.759 
and be to make sure the cooling system
of<00:05:22.449> the<00:05:22.509> engines<00:05:22.869> perform<00:05:23.319> another<00:05:23.499> these

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:23.769 
of the engines perform another these
