00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:09.769
 yes 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:11.120
 hello because you spend x 4 and love be 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.429
 Good thing, he's going to tell me 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.870
 for a few millennia of that 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.170
 the level of the walrus when at the level of 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.730
 the walrus when then already have kilos more 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.189
 or less I have an order and inside of me 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.890
 order or disorder I have an order from mom 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.019
 or less to keep in mind that I 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.410
 I'm still a walfre that I saw in his 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.000
 moment and I keep strictly to the 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.590
 Today I have followed more or less 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.460
 all right 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.500
 well here remember that there is a 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.760
 container of life and have here perfect 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.890
 is that the attack of fires that 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.020
 it's just perfect to annihilate 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.980
 the little yetis and having here nothing else 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.450
 start there perfect there is perfect 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.250
 today because here was your do not want is a 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.440
 little bit more of life and percent before 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.640
 to do good while I'm going to continue 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.990
 playing obviously because that does not 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.570
 we can bore go the reverse in short in 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.060
 the previous level you already told me that 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.869
 the bulging eyes could be killed with 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:08.810
 the attack the rotating attack with the 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.149
 double hop something I did not know and 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.610
 What you can do well because I good 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:18.020
 I share just in case and do not want the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.520
 I will play again at some time from and 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.880
 Well, that information always comes 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.610
 very well 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.520
 thank you very much and see here the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.630
 watertight 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.549
 no no I can not even joke is double 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.439
 I jump though you are going is that it is a bit 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.259
 complicated it's worth it because I 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.170
 directly sudo to try and now 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.469
 I do not know if there were exactly 10 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.289
 no I'm not now I'm not me now 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.459
 crazy because because I'm from the 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.799
 times that I have the memory of 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.329
 chichinabo and good then when when 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.950
 wants works works and when can 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.679
 be it then you as usual 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.170
 It's perfect when we arrive if at 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.270
 Deputy Chief we cut the pro that surpassed it 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.610
 they just notice with good fire is acting 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.310
 the level of the owl remember that 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.470
 it's a special milestone and it says well I think that 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.349
 you defeat me with ice that is not very 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.360
 difficult but today one that had to 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.739
 to contradict you know for this the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.930
 truth is that it gives me absolutely the same 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.100
 that totally blows me to the end and to the dessert 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.550
 let's go let's move on to the second phase 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.070
 hehe is this that you catch me take are from 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.290
 gift for you and yours 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.480
 ah perfect as you see it and we passed 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.940
 the second and here more of the same 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.280
 we have to have a little hand 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.690
 Care more than not because this tank 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.910
 we will come especially good 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.470
 when we want to defeat the owl more 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.910
 expensive because if you remember at the level 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.040
 previous we got a skill that 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.530
 is now what you see there is constantly 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.420
 equipped that we have like 4 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.430
 and then it's basically like a 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.380
 pop in is full of energy that 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.930
 It is very toxic to clean certain 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.720
 said dangers and llos but above all 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.850
 is the weapon that affects the owl and with the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.220
 pota we are going to get at this level 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.290
 Well, it will be quite good for us 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.480
 kill everything with the skill and 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.920
 take away a little bit of weight from us 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.739
 happening but the good one more by culero 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.239
 because megaman is not for small guy 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.280
 is that I really always have 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.050
 I always say the same but then 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.840
 I do not think one analyzes a little bit and it's 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.310
 as I think they are all for cules not 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.540
 there is none that is in the plan of good 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.489
 this one lets himself kill this also mother 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.739
 mine gave is that I 'm going to clean it over 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.480
 all the planes then the others already 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.910
 look, it does not matter a shit but about 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.730
 all the little planes mavericks out there 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.379
 we have as always the pota 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.430
 And I also want her to be the whore of 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.840
 skill if I'm not confused that I do not 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.490
 but I get it backwards 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.840
 well , nothing happens, it's killing 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.490
 oh my god because something else does not but it's 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.230
 what is it for freezes the damn 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.420
 Little bird the stage is the most 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.530
 disgusting that seen in my life more with 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.400
 how easy it is to catch him with the 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.959
 attack with male fire attack 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.879
 and it is that everything has a synergy 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.349
 kids that cool a lot no need to 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.180
 be has changed skills or anything 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.610
 just memorize with you what 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.710
 fucking hell is is thrown let's go to 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.590
 less for me is thrown away 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.870
 cautious 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.310
 to fry asparagus to me does not bother me 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.769
 but although that is clear 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.750
 there we are with gentlemen style is like 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.820
 material said there good dude does not pass 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.229
 nothing we have arrives the gp scenario 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.910
 here 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.490
 Well worth it basically walrus 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.800
 same is defeated with a passing firearm 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.020
 that zero is a little bit special milestone 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.370
 and wants to get attention and you know 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.860
 that when he makes the fire attack you 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.449
 as well as a combo cojonudo up 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.870
 as you can see on the level he has 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.610
 helped a lot to clean but here 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.470
 I hope not I just finished killing 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.180
 which is that the most disgusting 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.950
 that ended up killing me just against the 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.170
 walrus you see is that he threw me against him 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.480
 it's a bit difficult but good that's going to 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.240
 do wait and the das in the air that 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.680
 happens for tomorrow for today and I'm not like 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.810
 you say but it has worked 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.449
 so I do not know why the balls slide 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.360
 this way uncle figured worth there 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.910
 yes I risk a little or hit two 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.770
 Sometimes, that's new, the kid 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.770
 is that the attack has to admit that 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:24.949
 cool a lot but macho come 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:26.220
 very little for casting but sometimes it's 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.680
 reverse 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:33.449
 coming out is safer what 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.000
 what happened is that I did not hit him as there 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.949
 to get a little under him and a 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.280
 you give him because you want or do not want to be 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:44.340
 it has enough range the one network attack 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.200
 your fan and basically now we have the 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.230
 ice attack 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.030
 How good is more good than 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.550
 same as x is not more like a 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.300
 broadsword down ice something 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.819
 perfect that will not come against him 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.300
 Colonel , you'll see that it's going to be 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:05.949
 If I am right now and yes Colonel 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.949
 once I remember my mother 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.569
 for all 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.479
 so they go there 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.170
 we continue like this today 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.270
 I do not want to send anyone 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.650
 I just love the Juarez 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:30.710
 Japanese people who are so fucking fucking 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.060
