00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.780
 the kitchen is becoming the most intelligent and sophisticated area of 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.370
 the house this induction stove by Chinese in the program shows us a 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.489
 new technology called 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:20.679
 induction uses magnetic energy that directly heats the pan 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:21.539
 magnetic 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.780
 what is the most efficient water level 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.760
 I will see and the ice does not say 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.750
 another advantage is good that is at peace powerful 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.780
 and that cooks faster I do not know what bad food is then cleaned with a 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.270
 cloth an ong 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.020
 good cooling golden coast this new smart technology the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.039
 refrigerators 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.799
 that helps us preserve more energy this convertible saenz refrigerator 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.240
 they have called 4 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.789
 is the only winning reef with two plugs notice 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.120
 on the bottom 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.350
 that can be used as a refrigerator or freezer at the touch of a button 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.489
 in all these compartments the bridge will be used 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.160
 of these two forms when one wants it are available 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.979
 the ons for 2 thousand 700 dollars 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.090
 good another advice to preserve energy 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.200
 most Americans heat the water all day long even 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.790
 when they are not using, notice how much money is spent and there are human resources 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.509
 now they can shower as often as they want 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.729
 wash clothes and use the dishwasher 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.619
 If you have missing the hot water with a new smart technology 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.520
 of winne internal pacenses understand the gas burners below 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.020
 heat the water they need the federal government will give you a credit 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.259
 fiscal 300 dollars in energy savings to install them experts 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.020
 they do not say how good they can save 25 40% on their heating costs 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.460
 talking about heating based on solar energy that's what the government 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.929
 wants us to achieve and to promote this idea university students 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.540
 from all over the world they are building 20 houses with solar energy in the mode 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.970
 more in old intendis and in a patrician contest nothing for the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.530
 department of energy but its been its nests for now we are seeing what 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.290
 Percent years of business can get a 30% tax increase if 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.440
 they use solar energy but the credit is going to end in December of the year 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.390
 2000 8-k saw good part of the future many smart technologies 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.499
 that they believed and how good they are going to take our 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:47.689
 homes and our lives finally got 21 in new york you see that here not 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:47.749
 we have
