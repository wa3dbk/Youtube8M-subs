00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
okay Here I am in a know seven f-150 5.4

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.330 
okay Here I am in a know seven f-150 5.4
Triton<00:00:04.890> v8<00:00:05.359> got<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.470> entrance<00:00:07.470> ramp<00:00:07.710> here<00:00:07.980> going

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
Triton v8 got a entrance ramp here going

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.419 
Triton v8 got a entrance ramp here going
uphill<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.179> have<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> 26<00:00:09.990> foot<00:00:10.080> box<00:00:11.010> trailer

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
uphill and I have a 26 foot box trailer

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.580 
uphill and I have a 26 foot box trailer
behind<00:00:11.790> me<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.059> weighs<00:00:12.210> about<00:00:12.480> 3,500<00:00:13.259> pounds

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
behind me it weighs about 3,500 pounds

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.790 
behind me it weighs about 3,500 pounds
it's<00:00:13.769> empty<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.389> definitely<00:00:15.630> adds<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.650> lot

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
it's empty but it definitely adds a lot

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.099 
it's empty but it definitely adds a lot
of<00:00:16.920> wind<00:00:17.130> resistance<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.359> takes<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.930> bit<00:00:19.080> of

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
of wind resistance and it takes a bit of

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.990 
of wind resistance and it takes a bit of
power<00:00:19.350> getting<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.800> up<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> hill

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
power getting it up the hill

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.090 
power getting it up the hill
I<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.630> put<00:00:21.869> brand<00:00:22.109> new<00:00:22.260> spark<00:00:22.529> plugs<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.949> this

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
I just put brand new spark plugs in this

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.429 
I just put brand new spark plugs in this
air<00:00:23.310> filter<00:00:23.550> fuel<00:00:24.090> filter<00:00:24.570> change<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.109> engine

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439

oil and filter and put upper ball joints
on<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.170> let's<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.320> how<00:00:31.439> fast<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.859> get<00:00:32.009> going

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
on it so let's see how fast we get going

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.220 
on it so let's see how fast we get going

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.790 

all<00:00:44.120> right<00:00:44.330> here<00:00:44.630> we<00:00:44.750> go

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:01:19.280 

wide<00:00:50.800> open<00:00:50.829> throttle

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:31.800 

still<00:01:20.010> wide<00:01:20.250> open

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.800 

got<00:01:32.290> my<00:01:32.470> foot<00:01:32.740> braced<00:01:33.130> on<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.520> accelerator

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:49.070 

this<00:01:38.409> is<00:01:38.560> all<00:01:38.770> uphill

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.990 

all<00:01:49.440> right<00:01:49.680> backed<00:01:50.040> off

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.730 

oh<00:01:57.250> it's<00:01:58.250> kind<00:01:59.150> of<00:01:59.270> kind<00:02:00.050> of<00:02:00.200> slow<00:02:00.410> in<00:02:00.590> my

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
oh it's kind of kind of slow in my

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.430 
oh it's kind of kind of slow in my
opinion<00:02:01.190> I<00:02:01.370> think<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.600> 5-4<00:02:03.110> would<00:02:03.290> have<00:02:03.410> a

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
opinion I think a 5-4 would have a

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.510 
opinion I think a 5-4 would have a
little<00:02:03.680> bit<00:02:03.860> more<00:02:04.040> power<00:02:04.280> than<00:02:04.550> that<00:02:04.580> but<00:02:06.520> it

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
little bit more power than that but it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.010 
little bit more power than that but it
gets<00:02:07.670> up<00:02:07.910> there<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.270> speed<00:02:10.150> got<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> young<00:02:11.540> if

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
gets up there to speed got a young if

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.800 
gets up there to speed got a young if
you<00:02:12.080> follow<00:02:12.410> me<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.620> my<00:02:12.890> videos

you follow me on my videos
73<00:02:14.810> power<00:02:15.320> stroke<00:02:15.680> would<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:16.070> blow<00:02:16.250> this

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
73 power stroke would just blow this

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.250 
73 power stroke would just blow this
thing<00:02:16.730> away<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.530> got<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.650> say<00:02:18.800> even<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:20.260> even

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
thing away and I got to say even a even

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.540 
thing away and I got to say even a even
a<00:02:22.240> 5-3<00:02:23.240> Vortech<00:02:23.900> or<00:02:24.110> 5-7<00:02:24.950> for<00:02:25.130> tech<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.520> a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
a 5-3 Vortech or 5-7 for tech and a

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.580 
a 5-3 Vortech or 5-7 for tech and a
Silverado<00:02:25.910> would<00:02:26.330> probably<00:02:26.840> blow<00:02:26.930> Singh<00:02:27.380> away

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
Silverado would probably blow Singh away

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.960 
Silverado would probably blow Singh away
-<00:02:28.300> so<00:02:29.300> is<00:02:29.600> that<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.860> normal<00:02:31.250> guys<00:02:31.459> are<00:02:31.820> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
- so is that is that normal guys are the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.270 
- so is that is that normal guys are the
five<00:02:32.420> fours<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.080> little<00:02:33.320> low<00:02:33.470> on<00:02:33.500> power<00:02:33.920> I

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
five fours just a little low on power I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.060 
five fours just a little low on power I
know<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:35.090> read<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.990> Popular<00:02:36.470> Mechanics<00:02:36.500> magazine
