really cool kind of like weirdo chests
that<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.780> random<00:01:55.380> items<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.860> them<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that have random items in them so if I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.149 
that have random items in them so if I
can<00:01:56.579> find<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.969> door<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.860> little

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
can find the door to this to this little

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.709 
can find the door to this to this little
Hut<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.460> here<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.790> go<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
Hut right here if we go in the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.690 
Hut right here if we go in the
barbarians<00:02:01.469> usually<00:02:01.770> spawn<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.369> here<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
barbarians usually spawn in here this is

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.730 
barbarians usually spawn in here this is
like<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.060> spawner<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.600> well<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> chest

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
like this spawner as well as the chest

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.690 
like this spawner as well as the chest
you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.100> we've<00:02:05.219> got<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> little

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
you can see we've got like the little

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.150 
you can see we've got like the little
icon<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> barbarians<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.380> top<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.099> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
icon of the barbarians on top of the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.380 
icon of the barbarians on top of the
chest<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.879> spawns<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
chest so I think it spawns the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.200 
chest so I think it spawns the
barbarians<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.020> well<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.470> has

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
barbarians as well as has

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.360 
barbarians as well as has

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
Lieut so um it's random loot so right

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.490 
Lieut so um it's random loot so right

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
hostile I don't know why that is but um

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.930 
hostile I don't know why that is but um
it's<00:02:23.900> only<00:02:24.140> like<00:02:24.410> not<00:02:25.280> even<00:02:25.400> when<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.610> attack

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
it's only like not even when I attack

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.640 
it's only like not even when I attack
them<00:02:26.150> do<00:02:26.270> they<00:02:26.450> do<00:02:26.780> they<00:02:26.870> attack<00:02:27.110> me<00:02:27.260> back<00:02:27.470> and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
them do they do they attack me back and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.920 
them do they do they attack me back and
maybe<00:02:27.800> I'm<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.130> hard<00:02:28.700> yeah<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.330> don't<00:02:29.660> know<00:02:29.840> why

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
maybe I'm in hard yeah I don't know why

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.810 
maybe I'm in hard yeah I don't know why
that's<00:02:30.020> happening<00:02:30.470> but<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:31.430> still<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.610> mini

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
that's happening but it's still a mini

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.430 
that's happening but it's still a mini
mod<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.210> I<00:02:32.240> think<00:02:32.450> they're<00:02:32.600> still<00:02:32.840> updates<00:02:33.260> to

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
mod and I think they're still updates to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.200 
mod and I think they're still updates to
it<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.680> there<00:02:33.830> still<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> work<00:02:34.340> in<00:02:34.490> progress

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
it so there still is a work in progress

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.730 
it so there still is a work in progress
but<00:02:35.480> nevertheless<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.900> guys<00:02:36.200> can<00:02:36.350> find<00:02:36.590> these

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
other jobs as well but they're a little

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.000 
other jobs as well but they're a little
bit<00:03:15.950> more<00:03:16.160> rare<00:03:16.900> that's<00:03:17.900> pretty<00:03:18.290> much<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.710> the
