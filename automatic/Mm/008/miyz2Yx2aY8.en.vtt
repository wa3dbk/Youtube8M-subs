poly<00:00:24.600> tube<00:00:24.869> all<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.859> good<00:00:26.810> they're<00:00:27.810> all<00:00:27.930> good

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
poly tube all are good they're all good

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.569 
poly tube all are good they're all good
for<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.289> same<00:00:28.500> reason<00:00:29.269> this<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> poly<00:00:30.750> tube

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
for the same reason this is a poly tube

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.860 
for the same reason this is a poly tube
designed<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.730> underground<00:00:33.120> water<00:00:33.420> service

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
designed for underground water service

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.389 
designed for underground water service
it's<00:00:35.210> it's<00:00:36.210> plastic<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.200> very<00:00:37.559> good<00:00:37.950> product

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
it's it's plastic it's very good product

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.799 
it's it's plastic it's very good product
it's<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.899> better<00:00:41.000> water<00:00:42.000> flow<00:00:42.300> than<00:00:42.870> copper

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
it's a better water flow than copper

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.100 
it's a better water flow than copper
same<00:00:45.809> kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> idea<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:47.329> better<00:00:48.329> water<00:00:48.600> flow

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
same kind of idea but better water flow

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.549 
same kind of idea but better water flow
in<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.440> product<00:00:50.270> with<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> copper<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.440> is

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
in this product with the copper this is

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.600 
in this product with the copper this is
a<00:00:52.590> tray<00:00:52.890> quarter

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
a tray quarter

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.279 
a tray quarter
the<00:00:55.610> benefits<00:00:56.090> of<00:00:56.270> getting<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.840> copper<00:00:57.140> is

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
the benefits of getting the copper is

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.720 
the benefits of getting the copper is
it's<00:00:58.120> super<00:00:59.120> strong<00:00:59.480> like<00:00:59.750> basically<00:01:00.079> they

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
it's super strong like basically they

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.530 
it's super strong like basically they
won't<00:01:01.730> be<00:01:01.820> able<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.030> bend<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.360> but

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
won't be able to bend it but

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.510 
won't be able to bend it but
occasionally<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.290> will<00:01:03.500> bend<00:01:06.280> has<00:01:07.280> good

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
occasionally you will bend has good

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.510 
occasionally you will bend has good
water<00:01:07.700> pressure<00:01:07.820> could<00:01:08.360> water<00:01:08.600> flow<00:01:09.340> for<00:01:10.340> some

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
water pressure could water flow for some

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.760 
water pressure could water flow for some
in<00:01:10.850> some<00:01:11.000> cases<00:01:11.450> when<00:01:11.600> it<00:01:11.720> will<00:01:11.960> bend<00:01:12.200> the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
in some cases when it will bend the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.370 
in some cases when it will bend the
actual<00:01:13.100> diameter<00:01:13.580> will<00:01:14.090> change<00:01:14.420> which<00:01:15.170> will

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
actual diameter will change which will

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.160 
actual diameter will change which will
then<00:01:15.530> affect<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.850> water<00:01:17.060> flow<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.690> possibly

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
then affect the water flow and possibly

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.660 
then affect the water flow and possibly
the<00:01:18.610> water<00:01:19.610> pressure<00:01:20.380> with<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.590> poly<00:01:23.049> this<00:01:24.049> is

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
the water pressure with the poly this is

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.180 
the water pressure with the poly this is
just<00:01:25.670> as<00:01:25.790> strong<00:01:26.149> as<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.780> copper<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.590> little

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
just as strong as the copper a little

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.779 
just as strong as the copper a little
bit<00:01:28.310> cheaper<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:28.729> think<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.410> with<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:30.700> it's<00:01:31.700> a

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
bit cheaper I think and with the it's a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.880 
bit cheaper I think and with the it's a
lot<00:01:31.910> more<00:01:32.090> durable<00:01:32.539> so<00:01:32.600> if<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.929> bend<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.350> the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
lot more durable so if you bend it the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.779 
lot more durable so if you bend it the
actual<00:01:34.280> diameter<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:36.190> of<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.399> part<00:01:37.610> will

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
actual diameter of the of the part will

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.609 
actual diameter of the of the part will
never<00:01:37.970> change<00:01:38.210> you'll<00:01:38.840> always<00:01:39.080> have<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.409> good

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
never change you'll always have a good

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.480 
never change you'll always have a good
water<00:01:39.920> flow<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.369> good<00:01:40.610> water<00:01:40.819> pressure<00:01:42.490> we

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
water flow and good water pressure we

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.160 
water flow and good water pressure we
are<00:01:43.610> installing<00:01:43.909> a<00:01:44.060> water<00:01:44.300> service<00:01:44.840> to
