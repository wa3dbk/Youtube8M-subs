 cat licks 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:12.109
 cursed dwarf 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.020
 for you with me a life without ideals 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.609
 it is not what it means to be lived 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.499
 dragombol meeting 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.569
 that love characters then in the theory of the double 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:24.609
 what a fatigue recipe 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.399
 that I dubbed many years ago and paradoxically gave me then 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:30.999
 it's a bit of samoa 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.359
 compatibly with the fame that power a voice actor to the general public 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.940
 why 1w also 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.050
 michael madsen 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.090
 for many wolf alberto val kilmer characters so many things are 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.350
 I have all the relatives of Turin 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.560
 to start with my dad 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.270
 salute seems to live here in turin also is now Milanese habit 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.289
 these these sudden deaths this wonderful team taken away 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.140
 from history to time 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.180
 it was a drama from which it is entirely 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.320
 all my family members had difficulty recovering 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.259
 and then I grew up with all the others 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.780
 I saw my whole family cheering on cairo 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.700
 year after year is investing try to put on more and more tiles for 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.720
 build a big one 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.590
 if we were ever to make up for it, I would abhor a lot who would serve, there would be a deus ex 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.460
 machine that could solve everything here is one thing that it actually is 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.070
 common also to accumulation and that some important characters give a little type 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.010
 or even junior 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.360

 The Boston Soruccio Defense Uses Midfield Is Attack Is 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.570
 what is lacking in self-confidence 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.710
 because it is a team that still carries itself better behind its back 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.390
 the legacy of past defeats and therefore must free to finally go out a 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 throw the past behind you don't see the one in front 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.929
 and proceed with greater self-confidence 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.929
 a prediction for the derby 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:21.679

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.589
 as a junior 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.929
