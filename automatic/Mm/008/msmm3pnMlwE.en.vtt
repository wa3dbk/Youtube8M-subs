fold this one in half and again you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.160 
fold this one in half and again you
would<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:47.329> flatten<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.420> out<00:01:48.540> really<00:01:48.899> nice

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
would just flatten it out really nice

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.690 
would just flatten it out really nice
and<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:49.649> go<00:01:49.799> ahead<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.070> cut<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.549> as

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.990 
and then go ahead and cut that out as
well<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> you'll<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.799> piece<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
well so you'll have a piece that is the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.980 
well so you'll have a piece that is the
size<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:55.040> lay<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.570> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
size you lay this so that it is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
long-wave vertical and we're going to go

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.620 
long-wave vertical and we're going to go
ahead<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.960> stamp<00:02:01.229> our<00:02:01.500> image

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.349 
I'm gonna tape this down so I'm going to
line<00:04:10.660> this<00:04:10.840> up<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:15.850> can<00:04:16.000> see<00:04:16.180> now<00:04:16.330> that

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
line this up and you can see now that

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.060 
line this up and you can see now that
I've<00:04:16.720> tied<00:04:17.109> one<00:04:17.560> end

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
I've tied one end

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.800 
I've tied one end
I<00:04:18.160> know<00:04:18.250> where<00:04:18.549> my<00:04:18.670> toilet<00:04:18.970> paper<00:04:19.150> roll<00:04:19.390> starts

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
I know where my toilet paper roll starts

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:28.740 
I know where my toilet paper roll starts
so<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.500> can<00:04:20.859> line<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:21.549> up<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:27.370> roll<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:28.060> over

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
so I can line this up and roll this over

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.490 
so I can line this up and roll this over
as<00:04:28.870> well

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
as well

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.850

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
and just tape it down now I tried using

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.830 
and just tape it down now I tried using
my<00:04:33.040> double<00:04:33.430> sided<00:04:33.670> tape<00:04:33.850> but<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.390> found<00:04:34.690> that

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
my double sided tape but I found that

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.540 
my double sided tape but I found that
because<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.290> construction<00:04:35.860> paper<00:04:36.010> is<00:04:36.370> so

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
because the construction paper is so

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.260 
because the construction paper is so
heavy<00:04:36.850> it<00:04:37.690> didn't<00:04:38.110> work<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:39.070> well<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.850> I'm

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
heavy it didn't work that well so I'm

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.540 
heavy it didn't work that well so I'm
just<00:04:40.450> going<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.780> tape<00:04:41.050> this<00:04:41.260> down<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:42.310> want<00:04:42.490> to

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
just going to tape this down you want to

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.730

tape holds okay

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.090 
tape holds okay
