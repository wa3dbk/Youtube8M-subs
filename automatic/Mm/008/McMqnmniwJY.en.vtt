starts thickening yes a mixture has
already<00:02:59.410> started<00:02:59.650> thickening<00:03:00.160> we'll<00:03:00.760> switch

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
already started thickening we'll switch

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.820 
already started thickening we'll switch
off<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.239> flame<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.660> keep<00:03:02.020> it<00:03:02.170> aside<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.739> I've

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
off the flame and keep it aside so I've

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.410

taken the hot dog rolls over here I've

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.509 
taken the hot dog rolls over here I've
cut<00:03:04.660> them<00:03:04.810> horizontally<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:06.010> what<00:03:06.190> we<00:03:06.340> have<00:03:06.430> to

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
cut them horizontally so what we have to

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.160 
cut them horizontally so what we have to
do<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.850> I'll<00:03:07.090> start<00:03:07.420> scooping<00:03:07.870> out<00:03:08.110> the
