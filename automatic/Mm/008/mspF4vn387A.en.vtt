00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:15.109
 DO YOU WANT AGAIN, SLUTTY? 

00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:21.570
 AGAIN IN YOUR EARS! 

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:24.488
 WE CAN GO FORWARD ALL YEAR ROUND! 

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.901
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.436
 I told you in the first song, I'll tell you in another! 

00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:33.222
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:00:33.302 --> 00:00:35.792
 I don't have a girlfriend, my only lover is my hand 

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:38.828
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:41.032
 My mom likes to cook soup once a week 

00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:43.699
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:45.995
 And the one with Michael Keaton is my favorite Batman 

00:00:46.268 --> 00:00:48.776
 I was walking down the street just the other day 

00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:51.467
 And I saw 2 pretty sluts walking towards me: 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.177
 "Yo, girls, what are you doing tonight?" that's what I wanted to say 

00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:56.843
 But suddenly panic rose, and my voice began to tremble 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.585
 I looked down and left 

00:00:59.669 --> 00:01:02.240
 I had a bus to take, and it worked great anyway 

00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:04.883
 I get on the bus, put on my headphones and press play: 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.798
 Sheryl Crow, James Blunt and the fucking Ace of Base! 

00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:10.232
 Yo, what can I say? It's just a day of my life 

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:12.792
 I get up early and go to bed early 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.064
 To be productive at work I must be well rested 

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.606
 Yes, you piece of shit, did you understand what I said? 

00:01:18.652 --> 00:01:21.098
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.613
 I don't like margarine, I prefer butter 

00:01:23.698 --> 00:01:26.321
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:01:26.388 --> 00:01:29.114
 As a child my favorite films were Superman and Ghostbusters 

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:31.617
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:34.235
 I can't open my eyes underwater 

00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:37.075
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.358
 And I'm not a big fan of Nicholas Cage 

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:42.138
 I come from a lower middle class family 

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:44.820
 I used to play hide and seek with my brothers and sisters 

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:47.457
 I have a good memory of my childhood, bitch! 

00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:50.380
 My favorite toy was my fucking fire truck, bitch! 

00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:52.900
 I played with that dick all day 

00:01:52.998 --> 00:01:55.605
 Until I met sex thanks to Postalmarket 

00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:58.107
 So I played with my big cock all day 

00:01:58.255 --> 00:02:00.933
 Type 10 times a day, man, all year 

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:03.550
 I don't like to admit it, dickhead, but my favorite song 

00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:06.389
 is that of Celine Dion in the movie Titanic ... 

00:02:11.738 --> 00:02:14.368
 Every time I hear that shit I get a tear: 

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:17.010
 Why the fuck did they die Leonardo DiCaprio? 

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:19.467
 No, I'm not ashamed of being a sensitive boy 

00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:22.280
 Stones and clubs break my bones, but words make me cry 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.446
 Like when in a third grade a girl called me "stupid face" 

00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:27.962
 It really hurt me ... why did you call me "stupid face"? 

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:30.506
 Is my face stupid? How is it possible? 

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:33.356
 A person can be stupid, but a face is impossible! 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.021
 Shit always happens, and you learn to live with it: 

00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.739
 Normal regular shit everyday! 

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.037
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:43.962
 When I get into a fight, I go out on a stretcher 

00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:46.356
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.052
 When I don't know what to say I talk about the weather 

00:02:49.058 --> 00:02:51.612
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:02:51.653 --> 00:02:54.453
 I like the first Return to the Future, but the second is better 

00:02:54.544 --> 00:02:57.232
 I'm just a normal everyday son of a bitch 

00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:59.554
 I prefer red peppers to green ones 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.312
 Oooh, I put the money aside to buy a new dishwasher 

00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:09.867
 Mine broke 6 months ago ... 

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:11.383
 Son of a bitch! 

00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:18.088
 Go, Shorty, it's your birthday 

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:20.424
 We will revel as if it were your birthday 

00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:23.424
 I wasn't invited ... but it's ok 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.289
 I will stay at home playing video games! 

00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:41.166
 DO YOU WANT SOME OF THESE? COME AND TAKE THEM!
