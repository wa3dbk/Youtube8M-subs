00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
which is identical and basically what

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.899 
which is identical and basically what
happens<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.579> that<00:01:52.639> this<00:01:53.600> stand<00:01:54.700> will<00:01:55.700> just

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
happens is that this stand will just

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.590 
happens is that this stand will just

got the stand path and we have the
collar<00:02:16.519> part<00:02:16.849> okay<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.230> what<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.620> need<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.920> do

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
collar part okay so what you need to do

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.710 
collar part okay so what you need to do
is<00:02:19.280> first<00:02:20.239> of<00:02:20.480> all

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
is first of all

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.760 
is first of all
or<00:02:21.070> cut<00:02:22.070> holes<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:23.150> size<00:02:23.420> now<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.470> stunned

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
or cut holes to size now the stunned

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.830 
or cut holes to size now the stunned
part<00:02:25.450> what<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:28.370> fusing<00:02:29.210> is<00:02:29.390> going

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
part what it is is the fusing is going

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.370 
part what it is is the fusing is going
to<00:02:29.930> be<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.380> exact<00:02:31.010> size<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:32.120> what<00:02:32.840> you're<00:02:33.080> left

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
to be the exact size of what you're left

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.520 
to be the exact size of what you're left
with<00:02:33.620> when<00:02:34.520> you've<00:02:34.820> sawn<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.600> color<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.500> for

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
with when you've sawn the color so for

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.400 
with when you've sawn the color so for
instance<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:38.000> piece<00:02:38.540> here<00:02:38.810> before<00:02:39.290> you

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
instance this piece here before you

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.200 
instance this piece here before you
actually<00:02:39.560> start<00:02:39.770> sawing<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.460> has<00:02:40.970> all<00:02:41.180> your

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
actually start sawing it has all your

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.540 
actually start sawing it has all your
seam<00:02:41.540> allowances<00:02:42.140> on<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.130> lot<00:02:43.280> bigger

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
seam allowances on and it's a lot bigger

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.850 
seam allowances on and it's a lot bigger
than<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.180> finished<00:02:44.480> part<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.590> finished

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
than the finished part so the finished

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.860 
than the finished part so the finished
part<00:02:46.130> as<00:02:46.460> you<00:02:46.640> can<00:02:46.790> see<00:02:46.970> it's<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.270> lot<00:02:47.450> smaller

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
part as you can see it's a lot smaller

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.360 
part as you can see it's a lot smaller
than<00:02:48.800> this<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:50.540> that's<00:02:50.840> what<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.560> cut<00:02:51.860> this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
than this so that's what you cut this

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.320 
than this so that's what you cut this
fusing<00:02:53.000> piece<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.170> cut<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.830> size

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
fusing piece to you cut it to this size

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.630 
fusing piece to you cut it to this size
so<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.600> need<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.990> get<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.800> put<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.490> right

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
so you need to get that and put it right

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.080 
so you need to get that and put it right
in<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.240> center<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:00.920> can<00:03:01.040> see<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.550> like<00:03:01.790> as

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
in the center so you can see it like as

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.680 
in the center so you can see it like as
if<00:03:02.330> you've<00:03:02.480> got<00:03:02.630> your<00:03:02.750> seam<00:03:02.959> allowances<00:03:03.530> here

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
if you've got your seam allowances here

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:26.030 
if you've got your seam allowances here
