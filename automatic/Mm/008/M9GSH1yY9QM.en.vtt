refinement when it comes to its

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.180 
refinement when it comes to its
interiors<00:02:17.390> but<00:02:18.390> recently<00:02:18.990> that's<00:02:19.470> changing

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
interiors but recently that's changing

interiors but recently that's changing
and<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.610> Silverado<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> perfect<00:02:22.050> example

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
and this Silverado is a perfect example

here it's slightly warped that's not a

here it's slightly warped that's not a
good<00:03:30.030> build<00:03:30.269> job<00:03:30.540> right<00:03:30.780> there<00:03:31.400> maybe<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.670> a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
good build job right there maybe it's a

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.550 
good build job right there maybe it's a
minor<00:03:33.030> point<00:03:33.390> just<00:03:33.870> keep<00:03:34.050> your<00:03:34.200> eye<00:03:34.260> out<00:03:34.530> for

minor point just keep your eye out for

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.550 
minor point just keep your eye out for
it<00:03:34.830> overall<00:03:35.489> though<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.570> significant

in<00:03:55.579> the<00:03:55.640> back<00:03:55.849> so<00:03:56.209> as<00:03:56.569> to<00:03:56.900> be<00:03:57.049> expect<00:03:57.590> them<00:03:57.769> a

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
in the back so as to be expect them a

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.680 
in the back so as to be expect them a
little<00:03:58.069> bit<00:03:58.280> not<00:03:58.700> much<00:03:58.730> we<00:03:59.060> can<00:03:59.090> do<00:03:59.420> and<00:03:59.599> I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
little bit not much we can do and I

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.330 
little bit not much we can do and I
think<00:03:59.720> actually<00:04:00.110> that<00:04:00.349> this<00:04:00.650> truck<00:04:01.010> is

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
think actually that this truck is

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.619 
think actually that this truck is
handling<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.090> better<00:04:02.239> than<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.599> other

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
be so the question remains is the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.640 
be so the question remains is the
Silverado<00:05:19.310> good<00:05:19.970> enough<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.570> be<00:05:20.810> your<00:05:21.289> truck

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
well we think so despite some minor

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.560 
well we think so despite some minor

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
complaints we found the ride to be

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.570 
complaints we found the ride to be
user-friendly<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.650> interior<00:05:28.220> could<00:05:28.400> be

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580
