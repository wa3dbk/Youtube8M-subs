00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:12.920
 [music] 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:16.109
 hello everyone I sang with you and this 43 seems 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.220
 44 part of mycroft mechanisms in this 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.449
 parts will show you there is none this is hirna 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.460
 experiments so to speak like this moan 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.109
 translated just thought to find a new one 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.689
 the way so far nothing happened 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.609
 Although the show will show how to build 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.890
 automatic fireplace which I myself 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.540
 invented 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.230
 maybe it was somewhere and I was actually 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.559
 I donâ€™t know how to build communication 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.809
 systems not by the schemes myself therefore in 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.510
 so by the way I have been building for a long time therefore 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.280
 I myself really did not understand there to build well in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.100
 overall let's get started in general how is he 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.699
 it works though I'll show it like this 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:03.899
 This is how the system works here in 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:07.290
 general is very interesting because it means 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.840
 we are building this wall in 3 blocks from 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.840
 She set March 3, and the block and put here 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.840
 d-trigger 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.770
 this reader 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.150
 damn, I have something here this bridge 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.150
 which i can ever get you 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.439
 in short and then I will build another 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:41.909
 side of it here we think that's ok 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:45.720
 so in 3 skewers so old and make a goal 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.740
 trigger like i said here we are 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.810
 change custom 21 block here torch and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.100
 everything was enough here for everything 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.380
 great we spend in general here here 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.549
 such a thing of our button 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:07.560
 that is, she will be here and now 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:12.959
 we put below put labels piston and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:19.130
 set owns and here is nozorrog 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.130
 that is, hell stone so slightly forgot 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.540
 butter is bad 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.319
 So 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:43.049
 generally closed on the world means stop more 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:45.030
 as a matter of fact, it means that this block 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.480
 we lead here is here 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.010
 I lift so that everything clearly means 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.620
 right here we will lead redstone down to 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.440
 this here in the piston in this way 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.720
 let's still here 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.129
 we will activate it like this 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.780
 but on this side, well, that is, you see 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.840
 we all have now plow the piston 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.030
 activated under from the river 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:21.269
 now we put blocks like this here 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.209
 so it was so easy and learn 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:28.260
 about rub let's put a distributor here 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.810
 you yourself know what with not many 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.750
 beloved with these balls 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.840
 which can be used stupidly by many 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.109
 how some common schemes so here 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.230
 close the block everything is ready means if 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.209
 who didn't understand how the tracks work 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.359
 here I show you the tracker it works 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.910
 from the button it turns on once when one 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.669
 once pressing it activates the piston and 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.400
 the piston pushed the bridge and leaves in 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.560
 overall this stone when we push 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.829
 another time this system shuts down 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.510
 the piston moves in and out 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:09.950
 dispenser with the blocks themselves which 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.950
 get sick here this entrance chamber so stop 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:25.480
 I feed now I like that 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:28.060
 like this are like in general set here error 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.000
 was because he was here and he 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.150
 automatically it goes automatically 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.170
 powered by a button and so be not 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:42.070
 must therefore we do so in general all 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.290
 Now our fireplace works like this 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.210
 small in the house i build easy there 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.960
 only advice do not use wood 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.120
 blocks even here right here even blocks or 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.430
 roofs do not use this last 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.830
 versions for some reason very quickly 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.380
 light up all of these systems in general all I 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.240
 everyone did everything thanks for watching with 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.240
 you were bill put likes like 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.110
 commenting add to favorites 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.110
 in general, bye everyone
