think<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.440> it's<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.590> really<00:01:45.770> nice<00:01:45.890> texture

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
think that it's a really nice texture

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.950 
think that it's a really nice texture
I'm<00:01:46.610> really<00:01:46.850> not<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.030> fan<00:01:47.120> of<00:01:47.479> lip<00:01:47.600> balms<00:01:47.810> that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
I'm really not a fan of lip balms that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.020 
I'm really not a fan of lip balms that
have<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.530> really<00:01:48.710> slippery<00:01:49.100> texture<00:01:49.580> because<00:01:49.909> I

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
have a really slippery texture because I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.640 
have a really slippery texture because I
feel<00:01:50.180> like<00:01:50.210> they<00:01:50.510> migrate<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.110> they<00:01:51.260> fade

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
feel like they migrate and they fade

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.460 
feel like they migrate and they fade
faster<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:52.490> do<00:01:52.880> like<00:01:53.330> a<00:01:53.360> thicker<00:01:53.750> lip<00:01:54.020> balm<00:01:54.229> but

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
faster I do like a thicker lip balm but

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.200 
faster I do like a thicker lip balm but
this<00:01:54.620> one<00:01:54.799> is<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.950> really<00:01:55.159> nice<00:01:55.370> texture<00:01:55.820> but<00:01:56.180> I

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
this one is a really nice texture but I

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.480 
this one is a really nice texture but I
haven't<00:01:56.540> used<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.170> other<00:01:57.380> than<00:01:57.620> swatching<00:01:58.250> to

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
haven't used it other than swatching to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.460 
haven't used it other than swatching to
know<00:01:58.760> how<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.360> hydrates<00:01:59.780> my<00:01:59.840> lips<00:02:00.110> or<00:02:00.290> if<00:02:00.409> it

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
know how it hydrates my lips or if it

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.230 
know how it hydrates my lips or if it
keeps<00:02:00.650> it<00:02:00.770> moisturized<00:02:01.190> or<00:02:01.430> if<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.880> texture

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
keeps it moisturized or if the texture

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.000 
keeps it moisturized or if the texture
is<00:02:02.420> nice<00:02:02.630> or<00:02:02.870> anything<00:02:03.110> like<00:02:03.320> that<00:02:03.380> but

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
is nice or anything like that but

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.500 
is nice or anything like that but
overall<00:02:04.310> from<00:02:04.610> swatching<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:05.210> do<00:02:05.390> think

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
overall from swatching it I do think

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.120 
overall from swatching it I do think
that<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.900> texture<00:02:06.229> will<00:02:06.350> be<00:02:06.470> nice<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:06.680> I<00:02:07.070> do

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
that the texture will be nice and I do

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.830 
that the texture will be nice and I do
really<00:02:07.400> like<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.670> peach<00:02:08.000> scent<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.720> lip

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
really like the peach scent of the lip

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.210 
really like the peach scent of the lip
balm<00:02:09.019> these<00:02:09.259> lipsticks<00:02:09.649> are<00:02:09.799> very<00:02:10.009> similar

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
balm these lipsticks are very similar

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.100 
balm these lipsticks are very similar

glassy<00:02:26.250> texture<00:02:26.580> without<00:02:26.730> being<00:02:27.180> too<00:02:27.420> shiny

this<00:02:49.830> one<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.460> lightest<00:02:50.790> out<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.030> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
this one is the lightest out of the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.050 
this one is the lightest out of the
afore<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.710> is<00:02:52.980> almost<00:02:53.580> like<00:02:53.850> a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
afore that I have it is almost like a

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.110 
afore that I have it is almost like a
really<00:02:54.510> pale<00:02:54.870> almost<00:02:55.530> concealer<00:02:56.310> lips<00:02:56.640> nude

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
really pale almost concealer lips nude

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.420 
really pale almost concealer lips nude
it<00:02:57.540> leans<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.410> little<00:02:58.440> bit<00:02:58.890> more<00:02:59.190> on<00:02:59.400> that

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
it leans a little bit more on that

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.670 
it leans a little bit more on that
peachy<00:03:00.300> or<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.660> little<00:03:01.020> bit<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.410> brown

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
peachy or a little bit of a brown

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.350 
peachy or a little bit of a brown
undertone<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.670> feel<00:03:02.880> like<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.090> would<00:03:03.180> be

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
undertone I feel like this would be

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.790 
undertone I feel like this would be
really<00:03:03.540> pretty<00:03:03.630> on<00:03:03.900> someone<00:03:04.260> who<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.530> fair

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
really pretty on someone who is fair

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.070 
really pretty on someone who is fair
skin<00:03:05.070> tone<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.880> quite<00:03:06.120> light<00:03:06.450> but

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
skin tone because it is quite light but

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.780 
skin tone because it is quite light but
I<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.530> like<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:07.950> color<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.340> think<00:03:08.670> it's

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
I really like this color I think it's

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.280 
I really like this color I think it's
probably<00:03:09.000> one<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.360> my<00:03:09.570> favourite<00:03:09.900> ones<00:03:09.930> out<00:03:10.260> of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
probably one of my favourite ones out of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.020 
probably one of my favourite ones out of
the<00:03:10.380> entire<00:03:10.440> collection<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.400> quite<00:03:11.700> light

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
the entire collection it is quite light

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.640 
the entire collection it is quite light
which<00:03:12.360> are<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.630> actually<00:03:12.780> really<00:03:13.200> like<00:03:13.410> and

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
which are you actually really like and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.080 
which are you actually really like and
you<00:03:13.680> don't<00:03:13.800> see<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.130> lot<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.430> colors<00:03:14.850> at<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
you don't see a lot of colors at the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.880 
you don't see a lot of colors at the
drugstore<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.540> are<00:03:15.720> as<00:03:16.080> light<00:03:16.500> as<00:03:16.680> this

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
drugstore that are as light as this

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.500 
drugstore that are as light as this
shade<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.459> think<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.850> nice<00:03:18.030> addition<00:03:18.480> to

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
shade so I think it's a nice addition to

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.170 
shade so I think it's a nice addition to
the<00:03:18.930> drugstores<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.830> next<00:03:20.130> one<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.490> number<00:03:20.670> 42

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the drugstores the next one is number 42

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.140 
the drugstores the next one is number 42
this<00:03:21.959> one<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.500> like<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:22.770> darker<00:03:23.459> sister<00:03:23.940> of

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
this one is like the darker sister of

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.470 
this one is like the darker sister of
number<00:03:24.480> 40<00:03:24.990> this<00:03:25.290> one<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.860> more<00:03:26.400> pink<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.000> more

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
number 40 this one is more pink and more

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.380 
number 40 this one is more pink and more
dark<00:03:27.900> than<00:03:28.170> number<00:03:28.560> 40<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:29.550> one<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.000> less

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
dark than number 40 this one is less

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.090 
dark than number 40 this one is less
concealer<00:03:30.720> lips<00:03:31.110> than<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> other<00:03:31.590> one<00:03:31.800> so<00:03:31.830> I

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
concealer lips than the other one so I

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.440 
concealer lips than the other one so I
think<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.519> more<00:03:32.700> skin<00:03:33.000> tones<00:03:33.209> could

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
think that more skin tones could

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.990 
think that more skin tones could
probably<00:03:33.630> pull<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.200> off<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.709> not<00:03:35.610> have<00:03:35.640> to

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
probably pull it off and not have to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.790 
probably pull it off and not have to
worry<00:03:36.180> about<00:03:36.300> them<00:03:36.600> looking<00:03:36.780> sort<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.500> dead

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
worry about them looking sort of dead

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.199 
worry about them looking sort of dead
sometimes<00:03:38.370> when<00:03:38.550> you<00:03:38.640> wear<00:03:38.790> something<00:03:39.180> that

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
sometimes when you wear something that

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.060 
sometimes when you wear something that
is<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> really<00:03:39.959> pale<00:03:40.200> some<00:03:40.530> people<00:03:40.800> can<00:03:41.040> feel

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
is a really pale some people can feel

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.220 
is a really pale some people can feel
like<00:03:41.250> they<00:03:41.550> look<00:03:41.730> dead<00:03:42.000> although<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.660> love<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
like they look dead although I love the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.710 
like they look dead although I love the
consumer<00:03:43.800> lip<00:03:44.070> look<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.820> mean<00:03:45.269> if<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.420> want

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
consumer lip look so I mean if you want

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.300 
consumer lip look so I mean if you want
to<00:03:45.810> go<00:03:45.900> for<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.230> go<00:03:46.410> for<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.800> but<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.100> is

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
to go for it go for it but this is

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.430 
to go for it go for it but this is
definitely<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.790> little<00:03:48.120> bit<00:03:48.300> more<00:03:48.450> warmer<00:03:49.230> a

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
definitely a little bit more warmer a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.080 
definitely a little bit more warmer a
little<00:03:49.769> bit<00:03:49.890> more<00:03:50.070> pink<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.580> a<00:03:50.730> little<00:03:50.970> bit

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
little bit more pink and a little bit

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.449 
little bit more pink and a little bit
less<00:03:51.300> nude<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.840> next<00:03:52.050> one<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.350> number<00:03:52.620> 43<00:03:53.190> and

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
less nude the next one is number 43 and

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.420 
less nude the next one is number 43 and
this<00:03:53.610> one<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.180> lot<00:03:54.630> more<00:03:54.930> Brown<00:03:55.500> tone<00:03:55.950> than

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
this one is a lot more Brown tone than

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.060 
this one is a lot more Brown tone than
the<00:03:56.459> first<00:03:57.180> two<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:57.959> one<00:03:58.170> has<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.440> really

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
the first two this one has a really

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.460 
the first two this one has a really
strong<00:03:59.370> brown<00:03:59.970> undertone<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:00.840> if<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.230> have

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
strong brown undertone so if you have

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.650 
strong brown undertone so if you have
more<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.860> like<00:04:02.040> an<00:04:02.190> olive<00:04:02.459> undertone<00:04:03.330> or<00:04:03.570> a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
more of like an olive undertone or a

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.270 
more of like an olive undertone or a
little<00:04:04.290> bit<00:04:04.440> more<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.739> like<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.950> brown

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
little bit more of like a brown

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.770 
little bit more of like a brown
undertone<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:06.120> feel<00:04:06.269> like<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.510> could<00:04:06.540> be<00:04:06.750> a

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
undertone I feel like this could be a

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.780 
undertone I feel like this could be a
really<00:04:07.050> good<00:04:07.170> nude<00:04:07.440> for<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:08.370> one<00:04:08.610> is

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
really good nude for you this one is

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.610 
really good nude for you this one is
probably<00:04:09.000> one<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.660> more<00:04:09.900> darker<00:04:10.260> ones<00:04:10.440> out

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
probably one of the more darker ones out

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.170 
probably one of the more darker ones out
of<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.830> collection<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.550> think<00:04:11.760> because<00:04:11.880> it

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
of the collection and I think because it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.940 
of the collection and I think because it
is<00:04:12.300> more<00:04:12.540> Brown<00:04:12.840> tone<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.380> definitely<00:04:13.739> looks

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
is more Brown tone it definitely looks

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.440 
is more Brown tone it definitely looks
darker<00:04:14.280> than<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.550> other<00:04:14.700> ones<00:04:14.940> but<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.209> is

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
darker than the other ones but it is

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.000 
darker than the other ones but it is
still<00:04:15.690> quite<00:04:15.989> light<00:04:16.290> if<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.590> like<00:04:16.739> if<00:04:16.859> you

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
still quite light if you like if you

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.830 
still quite light if you like if you
have<00:04:17.190> really<00:04:17.430> dark<00:04:17.580> skin<00:04:17.910> tones<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.570> are

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
have really dark skin tones and you are

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.900 
have really dark skin tones and you are
wearing<00:04:19.799> this<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.160> could<00:04:20.280> definitely<00:04:20.459> still

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
wearing this it could definitely still

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.940 
wearing this it could definitely still
look<00:04:21.150> really<00:04:21.510> nude<00:04:21.720> on<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.140> because<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.800> is
