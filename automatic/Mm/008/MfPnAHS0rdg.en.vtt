 receiving is still quite preview 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.250
 even in the videos and I thought a new 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.980
 server and I decided to show here 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.260
 You well and server here he is too. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 Brazilian as 'la' craft combat that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.399
 I showed in the last video where 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.890
 will train pvp but this server here 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.570
 is not kraft combat is this server 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.149
 here is the game thing for those who do not 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.950
 knows games and I have on skype 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.010
 to the phoenix 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.199
 but that does not come to the case now type 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.870
 server is the same thing you put there 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.230
 that pvp kit for you to get the kit 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.199
 basic where the iron armor 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.570
 enchanted sword and the soups and you go 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.760
 leave the pt what I like about this brain 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.900
 is that he is not flooded cast he is 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:18.990
 practically as good as the good 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.820
 how combative and expensive kraft is very 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 very cool but I do not like it 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.869
 so let's go here you come down here 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.259
 He leaves the Hispanic and can even kill 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.509
 dude problem is what's wrong now 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:36.810
 111 event king of the table I just will not go there 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.610
 because I'm not what the video proposes not 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.430
 I do not want to show the events you have 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.869
 one more server has then type is this 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.460
 type of server I'm designing for 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.020
 Do you wonder if you're asking me? 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.600
 always skype a lot of people 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.729
 wondering what sweet craft is like 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.520
 going to be going to be practically this from here 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.070
 staff is a pvp server where you have 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 several kits you can kill the guys there 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.080
 Picking up kits is pps and also maybe 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.440
 let's have some kits to id 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.500
 the call these guys 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.210
 Look here look who Luis is Luis 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.070
 You're a server, it's very kind, man. 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.610
 I like him very much, man. 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.080
 just so why would you help you 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.880
 trainings or pt 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.110
 he does not have leg personnel who are also 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.310
 quite known 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.520
 I think I'm going to die if these guys 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.110
 started to continue debating beauty goes 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.340
 touch the face, water too bad to lose 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.490
 seriously, I died 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.260
 It's beauty in the event and a server 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.910
 it's not very crowded either so you do not 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.090

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.680
 said and guy is just about the same as 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.720
 same thing as graphite as art but 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.910
 I decided to bring it to you because 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.650
 staff asked me for more followers than 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.110

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.690

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.600

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.000

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.310
