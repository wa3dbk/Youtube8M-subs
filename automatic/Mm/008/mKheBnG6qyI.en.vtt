guys can see we have this new 3d model

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.459 
guys can see we have this new 3d model
effect<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.370> actual<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.020> Minecraft

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
effect on the actual in the Minecraft

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.290 
effect on the actual in the Minecraft
itself<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.190> when<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.430> actually<00:00:44.579> drop<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
itself and when you actually drop it you

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.930 
itself and when you actually drop it you
can<00:00:45.510> see<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.710> looks<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.370> free<00:00:47.760> d

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
can see that it looks like a free d

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.450 
can see that it looks like a free d
pickaxe<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.350> don't<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.980> 3d

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
pickaxe and you don't have the 3d

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.900 
pickaxe and you don't have the 3d
rotation<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.260> think<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:53.250> terms<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.699> an

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
rotation and I just think in terms of an

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.810 
rotation and I just think in terms of an
aesthetic<00:00:54.870> feel<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.980> mind<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.489> actually

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
aesthetic feel this mind is actually

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.410 
aesthetic feel this mind is actually
really<00:00:57.059> good<00:00:57.620> now<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:59.039> believe<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.270> they

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
really good now I believe that they

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
really good now I believe that they
haven't<00:01:00.629> actually<00:01:00.870> done<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.800> items<00:01:02.219> so

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
haven't actually done all the items so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.490 
haven't actually done all the items so
thus<00:01:02.879> far<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.570> believe<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.290> done

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
thus far but I believe they have done

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
thus far but I believe they have done
most<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.920> them<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> guys<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:05.909> in

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
most of them so as you guys can see in

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.320 
most of them so as you guys can see in

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
as you guys can see right there the only

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.020 
as you guys can see right there the only
problem<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.939> when<00:01:35.939> you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
problem with this is that when you

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.190 
problem with this is that when you
actually<00:01:36.180> hold<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> diamond<00:01:36.900> sword<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.170> your

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
actually hold the diamond sword in your

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.010 
actually hold the diamond sword in your
hand<00:01:37.520> when<00:01:38.520> you're<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.210> mode<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.750> kind<00:01:39.960> of

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
hand when you're in this mode it kind of

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.080 
hand when you're in this mode it kind of
looks<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.860> diamond<00:01:41.369> dick<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
looks like a bit of a diamond dick I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.359 
looks like a bit of a diamond dick I
guess<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.509> could<00:01:42.540> say<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.220> do

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
guess you could say but if you do

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.830 
guess you could say but if you do
actually<00:01:44.520> looks<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.030> from<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.299> angle<00:01:45.360> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
actually looks it from this angle you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.469 
actually looks it from this angle you
can<00:01:46.020> see<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.979> 3d<00:01:47.460> model<00:01:47.640> itself<00:01:48.149> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
can see that the 3d model itself is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.380 
can see that the 3d model itself is
really<00:01:48.750> quite<00:01:49.079> cool<00:01:49.380> i<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.000> this
