in<00:00:00.060> one<00:00:00.420> of<00:00:00.510> my<00:00:00.599> earlier<00:00:00.989> keyboard<00:00:01.530> hacks<00:00:01.770> I

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
in one of my earlier keyboard hacks I

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.160 
in one of my earlier keyboard hacks I
made<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.310> funky<00:00:02.790> little<00:00:03.000> LED<00:00:03.810> light-up

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
made a funky little LED light-up

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.110 
made a funky little LED light-up
keyboard<00:00:04.770> well<00:00:05.100> now<00:00:05.190> it's<00:00:05.339> time<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.549> go<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:06.029> a

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
keyboard well now it's time to go in a

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.849 
keyboard well now it's time to go in a
little<00:00:06.270> bit<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.720> different<00:00:07.140> direction<00:00:07.440> with

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
little bit of a different direction with

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:16.460 
little bit of a different direction with
another<00:00:08.160> keyboard<00:00:14.870> this<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> little<00:00:16.320> bit

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
another keyboard this is a little bit

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.010 
another keyboard this is a little bit
more<00:00:16.650> modern<00:00:17.130> keyboard<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:18.090> not<00:00:18.510> by<00:00:18.750> much

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
more modern keyboard but not by much

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.200 
more modern keyboard but not by much
that's<00:00:19.500> for<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.920> my<00:00:20.010> backup<00:00:20.250> computers<00:00:20.939> so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
that's for one of my backup computers so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.359 
that's for one of my backup computers so
let's<00:00:21.449> dig<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.930> flip<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.710> over<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:22.949> start

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
let's dig in flip it over and start

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.490 
let's dig in flip it over and start
taking<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.180> screws<00:00:24.510> there's<00:00:25.019> gonna<00:00:25.260> be

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
taking out the screws there's gonna be

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.529 
taking out the screws there's gonna be
quite<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> few<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.369> my<00:00:26.670> case<00:00:26.910> there's<00:00:27.210> close<00:00:27.510> to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
quite a few in my case there's close to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.480 
quite a few in my case there's close to
a<00:00:27.720> dozen<00:00:27.990> no<00:00:28.500> hang<00:00:28.800> onto<00:00:28.949> them<00:00:29.189> because<00:00:29.340> we're

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
a dozen no hang onto them because we're

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.740 
a dozen no hang onto them because we're
gonna<00:00:29.580> need<00:00:29.820> them<00:00:29.970> once<00:00:30.390> you've<00:00:30.539> got<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
gonna need them once you've got the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.990 
gonna need them once you've got the
keyboard<00:00:30.929> apart<00:00:31.470> separate<00:00:32.250> them<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.579> let's

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
keyboard apart separate them and let's

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.790 
keyboard apart separate them and let's
get<00:00:33.149> close<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> keyboard<00:00:34.050> side<00:00:34.320> now<00:00:34.649> this

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
get close to the keyboard side now this

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.470 
get close to the keyboard side now this
one<00:00:34.980> also<00:00:35.160> had<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> little<00:00:35.610> metal<00:00:35.940> shield<00:00:36.270> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
one also had a little metal shield that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
one also had a little metal shield that
had<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> few<00:00:36.840> screws<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.320> had<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.559> come<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:37.860> so

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
had a few screws that had to come out so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.770 
had a few screws that had to come out so
I<00:00:38.100> could<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> keys<00:00:38.910> you'll<00:00:39.420> find<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
I could get to the keys you'll find a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.240 
I could get to the keys you'll find a
flexible<00:00:40.200> plastic<00:00:40.440> piece<00:00:40.860> which<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
flexible plastic piece which is the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.920 
flexible plastic piece which is the
circuit<00:00:41.670> board<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> keyboard<00:00:42.270> will<00:00:42.690> pull

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
circuit board for the keyboard will pull

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.540 
circuit board for the keyboard will pull
that<00:00:43.079> aside<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:43.860> we'll<00:00:44.010> peel<00:00:44.160> back<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that aside then we'll peel back the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.279 
that aside then we'll peel back the
little<00:00:44.670> rubber<00:00:44.969> button<00:00:45.360> sheet<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.809> comes<00:00:46.110> in

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
little rubber button sheet that comes in

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.470 
little rubber button sheet that comes in
contact<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> keys<00:00:47.129> exposing<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
contact with the keys exposing just the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.690 
contact with the keys exposing just the
numeric<00:00:48.960> keypad<00:00:49.260> now<00:00:49.950> most<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> buttons

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
numeric keypad now most of the buttons

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.279 
numeric keypad now most of the buttons
other<00:00:50.879> than<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> numeric<00:00:51.660> lock<00:00:51.960> are

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
other than the numeric lock are

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.930 
other than the numeric lock are
everywhere<00:00:52.829> else<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> keyboard<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.820> we

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
everywhere else on the keyboard so we

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
everywhere else on the keyboard so we
can<00:00:54.059> afford<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.989> project

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
can afford to do this for the project

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
can afford to do this for the project
now<00:00:55.590> make<00:00:55.739> sure<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> keys<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.640> pushed

now make sure all the keys are pushed

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.240 
now make sure all the keys are pushed
down<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.649> are<00:00:58.680> looking<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
down or up if you are looking at the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.860 
down or up if you are looking at the
keyboard<00:00:59.609> from<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> top<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.629> we're<00:01:00.750> going

Dremel<00:01:33.240> attachment<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.049> smooth<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
Dremel attachment just to smooth out the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.499 
Dremel attachment just to smooth out the
corners<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.369> keypad<00:01:35.759> now<00:01:36.240> we're<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
corners of the keypad now we're going to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.600 
corners of the keypad now we're going to
need<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.720> base<00:01:37.020> inside<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.829> keyboard<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.490> I'm

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
need a base inside the keyboard so I'm

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.940 
need a base inside the keyboard so I'm
using<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.970> piece<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> cardstock<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:40.740> fit

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
using a piece of cardstock that will fit

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
using a piece of cardstock that will fit
over<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.490> hole<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.240> cut<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
over the hole we just cut out in the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350 
over the hole we just cut out in the
keyboard<00:01:43.380> base<00:01:43.649> I'll<00:01:43.950> securely<00:01:44.610> tape<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.210> in

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
keyboard base I'll securely tape that in

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.700 
keyboard base I'll securely tape that in
place<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> doesn't<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.380> anywhere

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
place so it doesn't go anywhere

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
place so it doesn't go anywhere
then<00:01:46.979> using<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.340> razor<00:01:47.490> blade<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.850> cut<00:01:48.210> two<00:01:48.450> small

squares for the little notches that the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.609 
squares for the little notches that the
keypad<00:01:51.119> will<00:01:51.329> fit<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.380> lay<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
keypad will fit in then we can lay the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.710 
keypad will fit in then we can lay the
