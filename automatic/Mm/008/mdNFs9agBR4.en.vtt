many<00:00:43.980> times<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.520> find<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.180> vet<00:00:45.329> has

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
many times we find that the vet has

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.840 
many times we find that the vet has
merely<00:00:45.780> taken<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> advice<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.520> kibble
