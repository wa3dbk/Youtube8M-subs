00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
button and it illuminates more and then

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.810 
button and it illuminates more and then
if<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.500> keep<00:03:09.680> on<00:03:09.799> holding<00:03:09.950> on<00:03:10.190> you'll<00:03:10.910> go<00:03:11.260> back

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
if you keep on holding on you'll go back

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:20.530 
if you keep on holding on you'll go back
to<00:03:15.579> a<00:03:16.579> lower<00:03:17.209> setting<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:19.209> like<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.359> on<00:03:20.420> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
to a lower setting I like it on the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.630 
to a lower setting I like it on the
highest<00:03:20.720> setting<00:03:21.109> and<00:03:21.260> right<00:03:21.980> now<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.400> have<00:03:22.609> my

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
highest setting and right now I have my

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.940 
highest setting and right now I have my
windows<00:03:23.060> open<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.510> it's<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:24.350> middle<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:24.890> the

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
windows open and it's the middle of the

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.150 
windows open and it's the middle of the
day<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:25.549> at<00:03:25.790> night<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:27.200> does<00:03:27.470> shine<00:03:27.769> very

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
day so at night this does shine very

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.819 
day so at night this does shine very
very<00:03:28.430> bright<00:03:30.010> just<00:03:31.010> as<00:03:31.220> good<00:03:31.400> as<00:03:31.489> a<00:03:31.519> torch<00:03:31.819> and

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
very bright just as good as a torch and

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.590 
very bright just as good as a torch and
you<00:03:33.829> just<00:03:33.920> need<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.160> flick<00:03:34.340> it<00:03:34.459> again<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:34.850> it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
you just need to flick it again and it

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.550 
you just need to flick it again and it
turns<00:03:35.780> off<00:03:36.489> simple<00:03:37.489> as<00:03:37.579> that

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
turns off simple as that

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.009 
turns off simple as that
sometimes<00:03:39.560> if<00:03:39.829> you<00:03:39.980> just<00:03:40.970> accidentally<00:03:41.720> tap

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
sometimes if you just accidentally tap

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.949 
sometimes if you just accidentally tap
it<00:03:42.200> or<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:42.829> put<00:03:43.700> set<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.090> on<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.269> table<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.780> does

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
it or it put set it on the table it does

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.789 
it or it put set it on the table it does
turn<00:03:45.260> on<00:03:45.290> by<00:03:45.620> itself<00:03:45.650> that's<00:03:46.459> why<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:47.650> like<00:03:48.650> to

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
turn on by itself that's why I like to

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.470 
turn on by itself that's why I like to
when<00:03:48.980> I'm<00:03:49.100> not<00:03:49.250> using<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.730> wand<00:03:49.910> itself<00:03:50.299> I

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
when I'm not using the wand itself I

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.520 
when I'm not using the wand itself I
like<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.900> use<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:52.130> key<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.639> just<00:03:53.600> loosen<00:03:53.900> the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
like to use the key and just loosen the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.090 
like to use the key and just loosen the
batteries<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:54.980> bit<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:57.730> then<00:03:58.810> see<00:03:59.920> that's<00:04:00.920> off

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
batteries a bit and then see that's off

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:10.580 
batteries a bit and then see that's off
