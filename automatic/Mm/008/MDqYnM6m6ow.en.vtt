00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.310
 hello friends how is that good I hope that 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.420
 you are fine in this video we are going to try 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:15.240
 to briefly explain a problem that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.919
 could come up in different types of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.829
 boilers in this correctly in the 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:24.619
 waterproof fabric because it made us a noise 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.999
 the extractor or the extractor turbine 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.460
 when the condensates were made 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.130
 like a scab inside it 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.380
 extractor how do we solve that problem 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.110
 very easy, let's go step by step 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 how the removing then the whole casing 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.940
 disassemble the extractor and how to remove that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.250
 problem, however, as always 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.400
 we want to make a warning of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.220
 security this video is directed 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.230
 only exclusively to professionals if 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.480
 you are not professional because this video 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.970
 it is not directed towards you we are going to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.050
 try to also make agile videos 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.030
 so that we do not get too long 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.080
 trying to explain step by step to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.640
 what 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.230
 very clear maybe we have 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.390
 extended a little but not very 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.200
 important in excess, what I want is 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.509
 let's see how to do the whole process 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.700
 as always, we are going to have 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.890
 precaution to disconnect the boiler 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.679
 before doing any work and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.899
 close disconnect the network I prefer 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.729
 clearly and closing keys 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.460
 fuel said this then let's see 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.009
 how to eliminate the noise that possibly 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.380
 this boiler or the extractor could we 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.740
 do we also see if the extractor 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.890
 It is therefore replace malfunctioned as is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:46.830
 we open it here we remember matter 23 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.770
 we have here two screws that give half 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:55.640
 we turn around and now it's going 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.640
 vascular the complete control box 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.000
 here we have the different components 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.860
 and then then here we have two 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.320
 keys and you're in the turn and throw 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.660
 her 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.250
 remembering also that it is a boiler 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.920
 tight and then take here you are pumitas 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.690
 if you see that it is already very deteriorated 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.650
 we care because then it could be that 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.990
 He gives us problems if not done right the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.030
 tightness with the flame and others 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:33.450
 that said we put the half there and here 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.069
 we have the victim the good extractor 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.430
 we disconnected 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.329
 current 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.329
 as earth 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.420
 after we have disconnected 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.500
 Well, well, here we have two 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.720
 screws 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.160
 because these two screws are loosened and 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.160
 we will get the complete extractor 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.760
 i 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.620
 there are times that you can not hear far 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.860
 the buzzing or whistling that he does when 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.860
 It is very dirty inside smoke 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.480
 remember also that when 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.280
 when we went in to see the extractor 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.620
 we do not always know why is this 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.959
 boiler 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.080
 the extractor is always running 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.480
 although low it will lower revolutions but 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.459
 do not panic if we have it plugged in 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.950
 let's see what the 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.769
 extractor is that's how the manufacturer is 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.840
 so he did 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.099
 we will notice that it is spinning though not 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.579
 have the tap open or the 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.620
 heating put on but that's why the 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:54.190
 security measures that we said before 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.850
 always disconnect from the time 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.770
 although we already removed this other screw and 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.980
 you are going to see this comes out as simple towards 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.980
 behind 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.560
 the day 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.660
 and here we have it 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.660
 but it is already used 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.570
 If you look because this is the interior is 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.260
 times it becomes scabby and when 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.600
 tour 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.310
 it does not whistle as we solve 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.380
 We put this in here well 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.530
 degreaser without problem do not have 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.580
 you stick a degreasing spray 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.210
 the chamos well and take effect 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:39.169
 then good with careful not to get wet 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.849
 a little engine the armature, we're going 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.039
 to a hot water tap 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.189
 obviously clear with this boiler 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.300
 we are going to have hot water and cold water 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.389
 is already 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.099
 we catch and we take good spritz headquarters 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.559
 embed well everything that all 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.469
 scabs that it has inside is a bit 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:00.719
 similar to this white thing this of the 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.240
 condensed and others inside also what 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.990
 has simply to catch it 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.319
 wash it well 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.699
 Be careful not to get wet and you are now 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.179
 we do little what we're going to put the 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.179
 extractor 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.940
 grip 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.039
 and there 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.610
 like the two screws 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.880
 without opposing this other side that is still going 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.880
 best 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.089
 and the truth that what we said before 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.759
 for saying something is because you are 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:48.100
 boilers have given an excellent result 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:51.100
 the heat exchanger 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:56.040
 terrific does not go away nor wanting 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.040
 that together is an exchanger billet 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.120
 have it well cleaned always 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.820
 what is it about 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.810
 and good to do the annual reviews and 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:11.840
 that's the life of the boiler 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.840
 now we catch you remember we are 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:27.150
 there is a land 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:27.150
 and then then current in its place 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:36.740
 we try true let's aim 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.050
 and you are going to see how that noise disappears 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.990
 so unpleasant chÃ¡varro cases 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:45.990
 different is of course I did 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.990
 let say 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.250
 to the vascular and put the box back 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.200
 on your site with careful not to catch 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:03.590
 no cable 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:06.110
 do not force the return and there it is 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.790
 good friends, I say goodbye to you 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.770
 I hope you have been edifying this 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.120
 video that you liked and good 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.690
 you have seen that when we have a 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.330
 sound problem what are you going to see 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.830
 what is that as soon as it starts when it goes to 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.770
 low revolutions not but when you have 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.960
 the tap is not there yet, you saw how 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.120
 solve it is worth replacing a 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.840
 extractor in this plan that you have 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.990
 good friends 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.990
 bye
