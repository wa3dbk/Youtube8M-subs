00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.480
 thank you, I was lucky to be touched 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.640
 ballet is what dominated the most 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.230
 but I'm a little scared because vania 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.570
 Masías has been an excellent dancer 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.099
 classic in true ballet is a bit 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.750
 complicated because it's very technical very 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.160
 square and that's what I 'm afraid not 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.970
 that the teacher goes to a dancer 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.890
 incredible track record qualify it I'll 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.039
 give everything equal all of me and prove 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.430
 what I what I have in mind night 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.719
 of many nerves or is afraid 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.920
 is afraid the jury has a 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:39.859
 expert teacher in that category dominates 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.829
 the ballet and certainly has Jorge Ávila 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:45.109
 that show your talent the challenge of this 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 everything for tonight is okay let's go 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.219
 with Jorge Ávila ladies 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.620
 moment to present the red challenge and this 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.879
 once Jorge to life is presented thus was the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.879
 scenario of red fame contrafama 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.579
 and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:02.330
 Jorge Ávila on the stage of reds 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.330
 international lord 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.570
 I have been asked 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.640
 a while ago product by the both 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.709
 I would encourage you if you lose with you 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.709
 let's dance ballet please 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.720
 hear if this is not the genre that 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.640
 dominate what you have defended in a way 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.680
 extraordinary in my opinion I love him or 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.060
 part of the premise of this 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.680
 program is to choose the best 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.470
 singers in the marines forums but 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.480
 also have versatility and Jorge 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.480
 today it has shown empty damage 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.069
 well I am super happy with your 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.380
 performance I think you've done it 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.390
 very well I think technically 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.250
 until a very correct state in music 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.230
 I think you've put the rod 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.300
 pretty high at the voucher level for the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.170
 rest of your classmates and it seems to me that 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.880
 you should not lose it classic ale and you're 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.239
 worthy of any classic company like that 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.340
 that very well very well and then I do not know 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.819
 how much fear was that they would go 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.819
 means 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:18.790
 You do not know the terror that had terror 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.409

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.750
 we put the mesh and we made era of the 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.640
 signs say I do not know what I want to say is 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.910
 that you've been running away yesterday 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.740
 challenge that we have this is all that 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.360
 I had to say 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.070

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.780
 I'm going to sing, I'm going to tell you 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.930
 that when I was very young I went to see 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.550

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.320
 I'm not going to ask why I did not go to 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.320

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.850

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.400

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.540

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.620
