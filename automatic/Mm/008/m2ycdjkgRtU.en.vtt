know why I did this

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.960 
know why I did this
yeah<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.980> was<00:03:25.190> because<00:03:25.459> they<00:03:25.580> had<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.730> light

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
yeah it was because they had a light

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.090 
yeah it was because they had a light
cavalry<00:03:26.239> get<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.750> look<00:03:27.290> at<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.530> he

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100

going to really be doing much so you can
see<00:04:07.500> here<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:07.980> quality<00:04:08.430> advantage<00:04:08.910> that

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
see here that the quality advantage that

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.550 
see here that the quality advantage that
I<00:04:09.120> thought<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.390> had<00:04:09.690> initially<00:04:10.140> it's<00:04:10.349> slowly

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
I thought I had initially it's slowly

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.130 
I thought I had initially it's slowly
fading<00:04:10.950> away<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.190> all<00:04:11.459> view<00:04:11.790> -<00:04:12.060> all<00:04:12.209> due<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.900> all

fading away to all view - all due to all

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.020 
fading away to all view - all due to all
these<00:04:13.260> veteran<00:04:13.650> units<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:15.019> they're<00:04:16.019> standing

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.629 
involved I'm trying to send my general
around<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:31.470> he<00:04:31.710> targeted<00:04:32.130> my<00:04:32.250> general<00:04:32.550> with

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
around and he targeted my general with

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.920 
around and he targeted my general with
his<00:04:32.669> both<00:04:32.910> samurai<00:04:33.210> which<00:04:33.360> was<00:04:33.479> an<00:04:33.570> excellent

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
his both samurai which was an excellent

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.990 
his both samurai which was an excellent
move<00:04:34.080> but<00:04:34.860> his<00:04:35.040> general<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.460> pretty<00:04:35.669> much<00:04:35.790> in

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
move but his general is pretty much in

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.409 
move but his general is pretty much in
the<00:04:36.030> battle<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:37.700> you<00:04:38.700> can<00:04:38.850> see<00:04:38.970> here<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.270> my

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
the battle and you can see here that my

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.060 
the battle and you can see here that my
middle<00:04:39.720> pretty<00:04:39.930> much<00:04:40.110> crumbled<00:04:40.650> my<00:04:40.800> right

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
middle pretty much crumbled my right

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.950 
middle pretty much crumbled my right
crumbled<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:41.729> now<00:04:41.850> my<00:04:42.030> left<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.479> soon<00:04:42.720> going

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
crumbled and now my left is soon going

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.700 
crumbled and now my left is soon going
to<00:04:43.139> crumble

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
to crumble

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.980 
to crumble
my<00:04:44.580> Calvary<00:04:45.090> didn't<00:04:45.360> really<00:04:45.540> do<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:45.840> much

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
my Calvary didn't really do that much

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.710 
my Calvary didn't really do that much
and<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.130> this<00:04:47.310> was<00:04:47.520> an<00:04:47.729> example<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.419> why

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
and so this was an example of why

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.360 
and so this was an example of why
veteran<00:04:49.169> units<00:04:49.410> can<00:04:49.560> be<00:04:49.650> so<00:04:49.919> deadly

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
veteran units can be so deadly

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.969 
veteran units can be so deadly
they<00:04:51.210> hate<00:04:51.450> he<00:04:51.690> just<00:04:51.930> overwhelmed<00:04:52.620> me<00:04:52.680> on<00:04:52.800> all

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
they hate he just overwhelmed me on all

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.670 
they hate he just overwhelmed me on all
fronts<00:04:53.280> numerically<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:55.139> think

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
fronts numerically and I think

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.820 
fronts numerically and I think
statistically<00:04:56.160> in<00:04:56.370> some<00:04:56.580> locations<00:04:57.830> without

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
statistically in some locations without

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.210 
statistically in some locations without
you<00:04:59.160> samurai<00:04:59.580> well<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.860> probably<00:05:01.860> should<00:05:02.130> have

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
you samurai well I probably should have

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.190 
you samurai well I probably should have
put<00:05:02.370> them<00:05:02.490> in<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.700> center<00:05:02.880> in<00:05:03.630> retrospect

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
put them in the center in retrospect

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.409 
put them in the center in retrospect
seeing<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:04.950> I<00:05:05.010> needed<00:05:05.580> this<00:05:05.850> plant<00:05:06.150> to<00:05:06.240> be

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
seeing that I needed this plant to be

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.129 
seeing that I needed this plant to be
even<00:05:06.720> more<00:05:06.930> defensive<00:05:07.470> than<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.830> one<00:05:09.139> it

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
even more defensive than this one it

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.510 
even more defensive than this one it
would<00:05:10.289> have<00:05:10.380> been<00:05:10.470> more<00:05:10.650> effective<00:05:10.889> if<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.310> had

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
would have been more effective if I had

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.850 
would have been more effective if I had
had<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.570> attacking<00:05:13.050> field<00:05:13.289> here<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:13.680> then

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
had the attacking field here and then

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.469 
had the attacking field here and then
brought<00:05:14.130> in<00:05:14.280> cavalry<00:05:14.789> that<00:05:15.000> would<00:05:15.389> have

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
brought in cavalry that would have

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.629 
brought in cavalry that would have
routed<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.020> left<00:05:16.229> completely<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:17.370> then<00:05:17.610> I

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
routed the left completely and then I

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.050 
routed the left completely and then I
could<00:05:17.910> have<00:05:18.000> swept<00:05:18.380> but<00:05:19.380> now<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:19.970> live<00:05:20.970> to

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
could have swept but now you live to

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.240 
could have swept but now you live to
learn<00:05:21.270> right<00:05:21.450> so<00:05:21.960> that's<00:05:22.169> that's<00:05:22.800> a<00:05:22.950> mistake

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
learn right so that's that's a mistake

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.190 
learn right so that's that's a mistake
on<00:05:23.370> my<00:05:23.430> part<00:05:23.550> so<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.060> can<00:05:24.570> pretty<00:05:24.750> much<00:05:24.840> guess

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
on my part so you can pretty much guess

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.830 
on my part so you can pretty much guess
that<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.740> battle<00:05:26.070> isn't<00:05:26.220> going<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.729> be<00:05:26.850> done

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
that the battle isn't going to be done

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.690 
that the battle isn't going to be done
for<00:05:28.050> me<00:05:28.080> you<00:05:28.650> can<00:05:28.800> see<00:05:28.950> that<00:05:28.979> all<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:29.250> have<00:05:29.490> left

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
for me you can see that all I have left

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.520 
for me you can see that all I have left
here<00:05:29.970> are<00:05:30.150> two<00:05:30.330> units<00:05:30.599> of<00:05:30.720> your<00:05:30.870> calves<00:05:31.200> and

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
here are two units of your calves and

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.020 
here are two units of your calves and
they're<00:05:31.919> going<00:05:32.130> to<00:05:32.280> be<00:05:32.370> attacked<00:05:32.729> soon

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
they're going to be attacked soon

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.890 
they're going to be attacked soon
