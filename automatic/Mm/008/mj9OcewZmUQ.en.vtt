00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.420 
very extensive comprehensive study on
who<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.020> got<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.380> be<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.680> domain<00:02:13.920> but

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
who that got you to be the domain but

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.200 
who that got you to be the domain but
has<00:02:15.330> everybody<00:02:15.599> knows<00:02:15.870> obviously

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.840 

you

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.290 

instead<00:02:24.410> first<00:02:25.410> time<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.830> got<00:02:26.010> two<00:02:27.650> more<00:02:28.650> today

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
instead first time I got two more today

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.700 
instead first time I got two more today
so<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.330> was<00:02:30.750> going<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.960> turn<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.350> brush<00:02:31.500> no

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
so I was going to turn the brush no

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.820 
so I was going to turn the brush no
doubt<00:02:31.980> but<00:02:32.390> today<00:02:33.390> really<00:02:34.170> wasn't<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:34.800> a

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
doubt but today really wasn't like a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.710 
doubt but today really wasn't like a
practice<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.060> really<00:02:36.300> could<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.480> bad

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
practice that you really could have bad

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.230 
practice that you really could have bad
but<00:02:36.960> he's<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.290> some<00:02:37.470> get<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.730> harbor<00:02:39.030> fan

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
but he's just some get the harbor fan

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:48.050 
but he's just some get the harbor fan
surprise

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.480 

my<00:02:51.450> perspective<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:53.260> was<00:02:53.530> no<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.310> first

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
my perspective that it was no the first

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.680 
my perspective that it was no the first
one<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:57.340> could<00:02:57.550> have<00:02:57.640> made<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.790> throw<00:02:58.150> you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
one I could have made that throw you

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.670 
one I could have made that throw you
know<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:01.300> second<00:03:01.660> time<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:02.290> got<00:03:02.620> away

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
know the second time it just got away

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:20.100 
know the second time it just got away
from<00:03:02.970> bathroom

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.350 

if<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.290> was<00:03:21.380> up<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.590> me<00:03:21.730> I'll<00:03:22.730> sit<00:03:23.030> back<00:03:23.210> down

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
if it was up to me I'll sit back down

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.880 
if it was up to me I'll sit back down
the<00:03:23.510> pocket
