of<00:00:03.899> course<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.350> think<00:00:04.830> we<00:00:04.950> showed<00:00:05.430> some<00:00:05.640> real

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
of course I think we showed some real

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.880 
of course I think we showed some real
resilience<00:00:06.330> tonight<00:00:06.690> in<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.410> first<00:00:07.620> half

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
resilience tonight in the first half

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.860 
resilience tonight in the first half
come<00:00:08.280> under<00:00:08.460> some<00:00:08.580> real<00:00:08.760> pressure<00:00:09.030> because<00:00:09.480> in

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
come under some real pressure because in

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.089 
come under some real pressure because in
the<00:00:09.990> Liverpool<00:00:10.380> know<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.710> we're<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> new<00:00:11.070> team

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
the Liverpool know that we're a new team

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.850 
the Liverpool know that we're a new team
and<00:00:11.670> they<00:00:12.120> know<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:13.320> can<00:00:13.349> almost<00:00:13.559> try<00:00:13.769> and

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
and they know that it can almost try and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.440 
and they know that it can almost try and
derail<00:00:13.980> us<00:00:14.160> early<00:00:14.670> because<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.210> know<00:00:15.330> they

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
derail us early because you know they

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.760 
derail us early because you know they
collectively<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.049> been<00:00:16.260> together<00:00:16.410> longer

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
collectively have been together longer

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.439 
collectively have been together longer
and<00:00:17.039> they<00:00:17.100> understand<00:00:17.520> their<00:00:17.699> style<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.240> play

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
and they understand their style of play

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.570 
and they understand their style of play
in<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.600> way<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.960> plugging<00:00:19.430> yeah<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.460> think

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
in the way of plugging yeah I think

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.950 
in the way of plugging yeah I think
second<00:00:21.000> half<00:00:21.090> there<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.359> only<00:00:21.480> one<00:00:21.720> team

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
second half there was only one team

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.720 
second half there was only one team
really<00:00:22.320> pushing<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> win<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> game<00:00:23.070> after<00:00:23.640> we

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
really pushing to win the game after we

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.220 
really pushing to win the game after we
want<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:23.970> more<00:00:24.090> down<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.600> thought<00:00:25.050> we're

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
want one more down I thought we're

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.439 
want one more down I thought we're
really<00:00:25.380> unlucky<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:26.640> mentioned<00:00:27.029> there<00:00:27.119> about

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
really unlucky we mentioned there about

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.150 
really unlucky we mentioned there about
being<00:00:27.930> new<00:00:28.170> team<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.650> course<00:00:28.859> some<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
being new team of course some of the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.500 
being new team of course some of the
girls<00:00:29.279> were<00:00:29.519> coming<00:00:29.760> off<00:00:29.910> them<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.300> their

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
girls were coming off them with their

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.540 
girls were coming off them with their
heads<00:00:31.199> down<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.189> put<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.369> into

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
heads down but to put it into

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
heads down but to put it into
perspective<00:00:33.050> Liverpool<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.260> had<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> whole

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
perspective Liverpool have had a whole

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.770 
perspective Liverpool have had a whole
season<00:00:34.860> playing<00:00:35.700> together<00:00:35.880> we've<00:00:36.390> had<00:00:36.540> three

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
season playing together we've had three

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.930 
season playing together we've had three
games<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.770> course<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.129> know<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.550> spoke<00:00:38.760> about

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
games of course you know we spoke about

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.389 
games of course you know we spoke about
before<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.809> game<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.620> half<00:00:40.649> time<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> then

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
before the game and a half time and then

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.479 
before the game and a half time and then
again<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.480> game<00:00:42.690> doesn't<00:00:42.899> define<00:00:43.320> us<00:00:43.530> if<00:00:44.309> we

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
again this game doesn't define us if we

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.650 
again this game doesn't define us if we
do<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.730> today<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.239> wouldn't<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.600> been

do one today it wouldn't have been

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
do one today it wouldn't have been
perfection<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:46.920> wouldn't<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.190> singing

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
perfection and we wouldn't be singing
