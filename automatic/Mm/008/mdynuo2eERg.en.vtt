left move it all the way to the left

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.280 
left move it all the way to the left
which<00:01:11.159> means<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.640> setting<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.330> zero<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
which means I'm setting it to zero the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.490

far left is zero and the far right is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.530 
far left is zero and the far right is
whatever<00:01:17.280> how<00:01:17.700> many<00:01:17.909> sets<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.390> they

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
whatever how many sets that they

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.030 
whatever how many sets that they
actually<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.229> there<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> change<00:01:19.799> how
