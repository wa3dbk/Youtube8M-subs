Hello, my name is Laila del Monte
I started understanding animals when I was a child 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.980
 My family lived in Paris during my childhood, but we spent long summer months on the Balearic island of Formentera on a farm

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.649
. There I was surrounded by animals, the goats whose milk we drank, the sheep that the farmer's wife spun into wool, the donkey that carried us on its back

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:35.649
There were just a few horses on the island and later one cow and one bull were introduced on one of the farms

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.820
While I was in that farm I could feel the thoughts, emotions and the feelings of the animals and this seemed natural to me

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.820
To me it was natural; I never thought that it could be  considered"different To me it was normal and it was part of "my world".

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.850
Later on I developed a technique

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.900
 that allowed me to transmit this ability to other people.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.500
 that allowed me to transmit this ability to other people.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.610
Most people already have intuition and perceptions that can be developed further

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.380
Most people already have intuition and perceptions that can be developed further

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.850
 and this technique allows other people to feel right 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.860
into the depth of their cells 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.390
 the emotions and thoughts of animals

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.390
And when people feel this really deeply inside of themselves, that's when they realize that animals have consciousness.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.330
Most people love animals

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.580
 People come to the seminars and the lectures or read my books because they love animals

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.920
But it is only when you feel in depth 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.320
But it is only when you feel in depth their thought as if it were your own thought,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.020
 their emotion as if it were in your own heart, and 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.240
their feeling as if it were in your own body,  

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.720
  that you completely understand the animal

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.350
And when we really understand the animal

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.330
, we really understand that he has consciousness, that he is a living sentient being with

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.600
 thoughts and emotions exactly like our own.
And in understanding an animal,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.799
 we are also able to understand other sentient beings, other human beings.
