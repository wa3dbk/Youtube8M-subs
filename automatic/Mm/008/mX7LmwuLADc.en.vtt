00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
another killer planes video the killer

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:28.540 
another killer planes video the killer
planes<00:00:06.450> how<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.870> series

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.410 

oh<00:00:28.960> wow<00:00:29.960> just<00:00:30.289> made<00:00:30.560> it<00:00:33.850> see<00:00:34.850> that<00:00:35.000> wobbling

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
oh wow just made it see that wobbling

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.660 
oh wow just made it see that wobbling
yeah<00:00:35.960> see<00:00:36.739> when<00:00:36.890> I<00:00:36.920> crash<00:00:37.190> into<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.550> nose

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
yeah see when I crash into the nose

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.970 
yeah see when I crash into the nose
before<00:00:37.879> it<00:00:38.210> bent<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.510> shaft<00:00:38.870> I<00:00:39.199> crash<00:00:39.739> pretty

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
before it bent the shaft I crash pretty

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.630 
before it bent the shaft I crash pretty
hard<00:00:40.220> I<00:00:40.340> guess

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
hard I guess

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.710 
hard I guess
and<00:00:42.220> sometimes<00:00:43.220> you<00:00:43.910> can<00:00:44.059> just<00:00:44.090> loosen<00:00:44.420> these

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
and sometimes you can just loosen these

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.990 
and sometimes you can just loosen these
shaft<00:00:45.440> adapters<00:00:45.980> up<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.400> spin<00:00:46.699> them<00:00:46.850> around

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
shaft adapters up and spin them around

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.759 
shaft adapters up and spin them around
the<00:00:47.150> opposite<00:00:47.480> direction<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:48.199> that'll<00:00:48.530> fix

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
the opposite direction and that'll fix

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.920 
the opposite direction and that'll fix
it<00:00:48.980> for<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.699> time<00:00:49.970> being<00:00:50.510> let's<00:00:51.350> try<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:51.680> out

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
it for the time being let's try that out

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.450 
it for the time being let's try that out
loosen<00:00:53.930> it

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.049 

spin<00:00:59.270> in<00:01:00.070> spinning<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.190> motor<00:01:01.399> with<00:01:01.640> my<00:01:01.790> thumb

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
spin in spinning the motor with my thumb

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:14.420 
spin in spinning the motor with my thumb
and<00:01:02.920> then<00:01:03.920> Tartan<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:04.699> again

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.910 

it's<00:01:15.430> actually<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:15.760> little<00:01:15.850> better<00:01:16.800> what<00:01:17.800> did

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
it's actually a little better what did

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.230 
it's actually a little better what did
you<00:01:18.010> move<00:01:18.160> around<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.550> a<00:01:18.580> different<00:01:18.820> locations

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
you move around to a different locations

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.340 
you move around to a different locations
pickup<00:01:19.870> motor<00:01:20.230> in<00:01:20.650> in<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:22.890> adapter<00:01:25.260> look<00:01:26.260> at

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
pickup motor in in the adapter look at

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.720 
pickup motor in in the adapter look at
that<00:01:27.690> okay<00:01:28.690> so<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.740> adapter<00:01:30.160> is<00:01:30.220> bent<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:30.610> the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
that okay so the adapter is bent and the

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.700 
that okay so the adapter is bent and the
motor<00:01:30.910> shaft<00:01:31.120> is<00:01:31.390> bent<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:31.840> I'm<00:01:31.990> spinning<00:01:32.560> them

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
motor shaft is bent so I'm spinning them

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.340 
motor shaft is bent so I'm spinning them
around<00:01:32.890> on<00:01:33.100> each<00:01:33.250> other<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:33.730> found<00:01:33.970> a<00:01:34.090> place

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
around on each other and I found a place

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.530 
around on each other and I found a place
that's<00:01:35.350> pretty<00:01:35.670> relatively<00:01:36.670> vibration<00:01:37.300> free

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
that's pretty relatively vibration free

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.390 
that's pretty relatively vibration free
so<00:01:38.410> I'll<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.800> tighten<00:01:39.790> it<00:01:39.970> down<00:01:40.000> there<00:01:41.400> let's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
so I'll just tighten it down there let's

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:51.290 
so I'll just tighten it down there let's
see<00:01:42.700> what<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.180> feels<00:01:43.600> like<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:48.000> lot<00:01:49.000> smoother

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
see what it feels like a lot smoother

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.820 
see what it feels like a lot smoother
whoa<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.630> we'll<00:01:53.530> be<00:01:53.680> able<00:01:53.980> to<00:01:55.020> balance<00:01:56.020> more

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
whoa and we'll be able to balance more

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.010 
whoa and we'll be able to balance more
of<00:01:57.010> it<00:01:57.190> using<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.610> piece<00:01:57.790> of<00:01:57.820> tape<00:01:58.090> let's<00:01:58.660> try<00:01:58.930> it

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
of it using a piece of tape let's try it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.510 
of it using a piece of tape let's try it
on<00:01:59.110> this<00:01:59.290> blade<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:02.080> it<00:02:02.320> that<00:02:02.530> one<00:02:02.800> or<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.340> it

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
on this blade is it that one or is it

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:13.110 
on this blade is it that one or is it
the<00:02:03.670> other

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.950 

it's<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.540> one

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.510 

alrighty<00:02:17.960> so<00:02:18.410> we'll<00:02:18.590> clean<00:02:18.800> off<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.220> blade

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
alrighty so we'll clean off this blade

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.670 
alrighty so we'll clean off this blade
and<00:02:19.790> put<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> piece<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.390> tape<00:02:20.630> on<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.990> about<00:02:21.260> that

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
and put a piece of tape on it about that

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.370 
and put a piece of tape on it about that
big<00:02:21.950> right<00:02:22.400> out<00:02:22.610> here<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:24.200> will

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
big right out here and that will

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.530 
big right out here and that will
rebalance<00:02:24.680> our<00:02:25.010> prop<00:02:25.310> isn't<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:25.970> great

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
rebalance our prop isn't this great

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.610 
rebalance our prop isn't this great
I<00:02:26.570> couldn't<00:02:27.020> tell<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.230> difference<00:02:27.260> between

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
I couldn't tell the difference between

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.370 
I couldn't tell the difference between
the<00:02:28.430> other<00:02:28.580> well<00:02:29.300> yeah<00:02:29.420> when<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.840> hold<00:02:30.050> it

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
the other well yeah when you hold it

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.640 
the other well yeah when you hold it
yeah<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.980> look<00:02:31.130> vibration<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:33.200> run<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
yeah you look vibration so you run the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.950 
yeah you look vibration so you run the
motor<00:02:33.860> up<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.190> hold<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.580> plane<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.210> when<00:02:35.840> it

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
motor up and hold the plane and when it

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.660 
motor up and hold the plane and when it
vibrates<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.680> can<00:02:36.800> feel<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.400> when<00:02:37.580> it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
vibrates you can feel it and when it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.640 
vibrates you can feel it and when it
runs<00:02:37.940> smoothly<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.990> way<00:02:39.080> it's<00:02:39.230> supposed<00:02:39.530> to

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
runs smoothly the way it's supposed to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.910 
runs smoothly the way it's supposed to
there<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.640> if<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:41.300> properly<00:02:42.110> balanced<00:02:42.650> there

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
there is if it's properly balanced there

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.610 
there is if it's properly balanced there
is<00:02:43.130> no<00:02:43.490> vibration<00:02:44.240> at<00:02:44.480> all<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:44.930> properly

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
is no vibration at all it just properly

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.890 
is no vibration at all it just properly
oh<00:02:46.270> you're<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:47.450> funny<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:50.420> just<00:02:50.450> cleaned<00:02:50.810> it

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
oh you're so funny you just cleaned it

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.440 
oh you're so funny you just cleaned it
off<00:02:54.400> now<00:02:55.400> you're<00:02:55.580> gonna<00:02:55.670> apply<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.060> one<00:02:56.270> that

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
off now you're gonna apply the one that

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.200 
off now you're gonna apply the one that
you're<00:02:56.570> hoping<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.990> stick<00:02:57.610> now<00:02:58.610> I'm<00:02:58.820> going<00:02:59.060> to

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
you're hoping to stick now I'm going to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.740 
you're hoping to stick now I'm going to
cut<00:02:59.480> myself<00:02:59.660> a<00:03:00.200> nice<00:03:00.500> even<00:03:01.430> on<00:03:01.790> ragged<00:03:02.210> piece

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
cut myself a nice even on ragged piece

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.010 
cut myself a nice even on ragged piece
of<00:03:02.960> tape<00:03:03.170> because<00:03:04.300> if<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.510> doesn't<00:03:05.840> have

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
of tape because if it doesn't have

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.280 
of tape because if it doesn't have
ragged<00:03:06.620> edges<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:07.700> tends<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.270> stay<00:03:08.720> on<00:03:08.960> better

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
ragged edges it tends to stay on better

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.970 
ragged edges it tends to stay on better
because<00:03:10.040> there's<00:03:11.000> nothing<00:03:11.270> for<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.080> air<00:03:12.560> to

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
because there's nothing for the air to
