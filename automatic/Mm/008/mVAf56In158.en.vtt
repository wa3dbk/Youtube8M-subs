advanced<00:02:08.550> supply<00:02:08.910> drop<00:02:09.270> packs<00:02:09.629> which<00:02:09.959> I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
advanced supply drop packs which I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.350 
advanced supply drop packs which I
really<00:02:10.590> don't<00:02:10.830> want<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.270> hopefully

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
really don't want to do on so hopefully

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.580 
really don't want to do on so hopefully
they<00:02:12.750> do

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
they do

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.670 
they do
your<00:02:13.739> way<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.040> unlocking<00:02:14.220> these<00:02:14.790> weapons<00:02:15.239> or

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
your way of unlocking these weapons or

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.050 
your way of unlocking these weapons or
just<00:02:16.680> earning<00:02:16.860> them<00:02:17.129> through<00:02:17.340> regular<00:02:17.700> supply

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
just earning them through regular supply

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.509 
just earning them through regular supply
drops<00:02:18.360> would<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.660> cool<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:19.769> me<00:02:19.920> as<00:02:20.040> well<00:02:20.220> I

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519

just<00:02:20.910> hope<00:02:21.209> they<00:02:21.390> avoid<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.720> advanced<00:02:22.349> supply

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
just hope they avoid the advanced supply

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.460 
just hope they avoid the advanced supply
drop<00:02:23.269> for<00:02:24.269> these<00:02:24.390> new<00:02:24.599> weapons<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:25.170> because

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
drop for these new weapons just because

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.040 
drop for these new weapons just because
that's<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:25.950> really<00:02:26.730> sucky<00:02:27.540> for<00:02:27.870> me

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
