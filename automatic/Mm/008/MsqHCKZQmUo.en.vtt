00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.260 
the maps yet because the game still um
pretty<00:02:37.090> new<00:02:37.330> but<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.980> comparison<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.970> modern

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
pretty new but in comparison to modern

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.190 
pretty new but in comparison to modern
warfare<00:02:40.450> 2<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:42.540> obviously<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.660> lot<00:02:43.930> better

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
warfare 2 it's obviously a lot better

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.140 
warfare 2 it's obviously a lot better
and<00:02:44.590> I'm<00:02:44.800> not<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.010> only<00:02:45.190> person<00:02:45.520> who<00:02:46.090> thinks

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and I'm not the only person who thinks

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.210 
and I'm not the only person who thinks
this<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:48.130> seems<00:02:48.580> like<00:02:48.700> everyone<00:02:49.690> who<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.770> in

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
this it seems like everyone who is in

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.390 
this it seems like everyone who is in
the<00:02:51.340> YouTube<00:02:51.760> community<00:02:52.950> has<00:02:53.950> an<00:02:54.160> opinion

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
the YouTube community has an opinion

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.430 
the YouTube community has an opinion
about<00:02:54.670> which<00:02:55.120> one's<00:02:55.420> better<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.020> I<00:02:56.080> haven't

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
about which one's better and I haven't

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.620 
about which one's better and I haven't
heard<00:02:56.650> like<00:02:57.520> an<00:02:58.420> opinion<00:02:58.960> that<00:02:59.170> says<00:03:00.630> that

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
heard like an opinion that says that

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.930 
heard like an opinion that says that
modern<00:03:02.110> warfare<00:03:02.260> cheese<00:03:02.470> better<00:03:03.010> which<00:03:03.730> is

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
modern warfare cheese better which is

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.260 
modern warfare cheese better which is
good<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:05.100> definitely<00:03:06.100> does<00:03:06.430> seem<00:03:06.760> like<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:07.000> good

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
good it definitely does seem like a good

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.350 
good it definitely does seem like a good
game<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.160> there's<00:03:09.160> no<00:03:09.400> flaws<00:03:09.700> as<00:03:10.330> of<00:03:10.630> yet<00:03:10.870> but

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
game and there's no flaws as of yet but

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.050 
game and there's no flaws as of yet but
no<00:03:13.360> one<00:03:13.570> has<00:03:13.720> really<00:03:13.900> come<00:03:14.230> up<00:03:14.290> with<00:03:14.620> like<00:03:14.800> a

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
no one has really come up with like a

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.340 
no one has really come up with like a
lamb<00:03:16.060> Danger<00:03:16.780> Close<00:03:16.810> new<00:03:17.320> tube<00:03:18.330> set<00:03:19.330> up<00:03:19.480> well

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
lamb Danger Close new tube set up well

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.540 
lamb Danger Close new tube set up well
at<00:03:20.440> least<00:03:20.500> no<00:03:20.680> one's<00:03:20.860> found<00:03:21.040> wing<00:03:21.310> and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
at least no one's found wing and

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.410 
at least no one's found wing and
hopefully<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.720> stays<00:03:23.020> like<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.970> for

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
hopefully it stays like that but for

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.660 
hopefully it stays like that but for
this<00:03:25.540> game<00:03:25.840> I'm<00:03:26.590> using<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.430> 389<00:03:28.209> setup<00:03:29.140> which

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
this game I'm using a 389 setup which

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.430 
this game I'm using a 389 setup which
consists<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.330> spy<00:03:31.570> plane<00:03:32.520> Blackbird<00:03:33.520> and

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
consists of the spy plane Blackbird and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.990 
consists of the spy plane Blackbird and
chopper<00:03:35.440> gunner<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:38.530> don't<00:03:38.950> get<00:03:39.130> too<00:03:39.790> many

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
chopper gunner and I don't get too many

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.949 
chopper gunner and I don't get too many
kills<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:40.690> game<00:03:40.930> but<00:03:41.769> i<00:03:41.830> think<00:03:42.130> it's

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
kills this game but i think it's

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.110 
kills this game but i think it's
relatively<00:03:43.959> entertaining<00:03:44.430> gameplay<00:03:45.430> well<00:03:46.090> I

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
relatively entertaining gameplay well I

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.810 
relatively entertaining gameplay well I
guess<00:03:46.300> I<00:03:46.420> i<00:03:46.660> do<00:03:46.959> get<00:03:47.350> enough<00:03:47.950> kills<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:48.640> not

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
guess I i do get enough kills it's not

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.540 
guess I i do get enough kills it's not

but um I wouldn't really want to see I
carried<00:06:28.550> my<00:06:28.729> team<00:06:28.840> here<00:06:29.840> but<00:06:30.530> if<00:06:30.650> you<00:06:30.800> look<00:06:30.979> at

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 
carried my team here but if you look at

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:36.480 
carried my team here but if you look at
the<00:06:32.259> like<00:06:33.259> how<00:06:33.439> closely<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:34.159> score<00:06:34.460> is<00:06:34.639> and<00:06:35.080> um

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
the like how closely the score is and um

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.939 
the like how closely the score is and um
how<00:06:37.490> well<00:06:37.849> I<00:06:37.879> do<00:06:38.180> like<00:06:38.689> for<00:06:39.139> kill<00:06:39.349> spread<00:06:39.710> I

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949 
how well I do like for kill spread I

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.309 
how well I do like for kill spread I
think<00:06:40.729> you<00:06:40.819> can<00:06:40.969> draw<00:06:41.270> your<00:06:41.300> own<00:06:41.539> conclusions

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
think you can draw your own conclusions

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.050 
think you can draw your own conclusions
again<00:06:42.620> that<00:06:42.889> sounds<00:06:43.189> like<00:06:43.310> kind<00:06:43.520> of<00:06:43.669> douchey

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
again that sounds like kind of douchey

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.890 
again that sounds like kind of douchey
but<00:06:44.919> that<00:06:45.919> it<00:06:46.219> really<00:06:46.639> is<00:06:46.849> just<00:06:47.240> kind<00:06:47.509> of<00:06:47.659> true

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
but that it really is just kind of true

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.709 
but that it really is just kind of true
but<00:06:48.680> it<00:06:48.889> happens<00:06:49.280> I<00:06:49.400> have<00:06:49.430> my<00:06:49.669> off<00:06:49.849> games<00:06:50.150> my

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
but it happens I have my off games my

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:54.149 
but it happens I have my off games my
katie<00:06:50.990> is<00:06:51.110> only<00:06:51.319> like<00:06:51.530> one<00:06:51.770> point<00:06:52.099> seven<00:06:52.909> ish

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:54.159 
katie is only like one point seven ish

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:57.670 
katie is only like one point seven ish
so<00:06:55.159> I<00:06:55.189> don't<00:06:55.400> go<00:06:55.550> negative<00:06:56.479> too<00:06:56.930> often<00:06:57.409> but

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
so I don't go negative too often but

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.450 
so I don't go negative too often but
when<00:06:57.740> I<00:06:57.889> do<00:06:58.009> it's<00:06:58.569> bad<00:06:59.590> like<00:07:00.590> I<00:07:00.830> remember<00:07:01.310> one
