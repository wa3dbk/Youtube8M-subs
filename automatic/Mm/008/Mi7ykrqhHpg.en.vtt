00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
I'm thinking I'm hoping that they'll fix

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.129 
I'm thinking I'm hoping that they'll fix
it<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:18.220> know<00:04:18.310> what<00:04:18.400> I'm<00:04:18.459> saying<00:04:18.669> like<00:04:19.139> because

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
it you know what I'm saying like because

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.010 
it you know what I'm saying like because
there's<00:04:20.919> so<00:04:21.130> many<00:04:21.250> sunset<00:04:21.790> ballers<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.360> like

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
there's so many sunset ballers that like

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.230 
there's so many sunset ballers that like
I<00:04:23.200> mean<00:04:23.500> I've<00:04:23.740> lost<00:04:23.770> two<00:04:24.310> games<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.820> sunset

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
I mean I've lost two games and sunset

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.090 
I mean I've lost two games and sunset
ballers<00:04:25.630> but<00:04:25.810> besides<00:04:26.169> that<00:04:26.290> we<00:04:26.620> played<00:04:26.919> them

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
ballers but besides that we played them

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.190 
ballers but besides that we played them
like<00:04:27.250> 30<00:04:27.490> times<00:04:27.790> and<00:04:28.000> only<00:04:28.060> lost<00:04:28.360> two<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:29.080> the

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
like 30 times and only lost two so the

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.140 
like 30 times and only lost two so the
winning<00:04:29.380> percentage<00:04:29.889> is<00:04:30.040> ridiculous<00:04:30.669> against

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
winning percentage is ridiculous against

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.850 
winning percentage is ridiculous against
them<00:04:31.240> but<00:04:31.419> they<00:04:31.780> probably<00:04:32.080> have<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:32.680> many

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
them but they probably have so many

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.700 
them but they probably have so many
games<00:04:33.190> going<00:04:33.640> that<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:34.240> know<00:04:34.419> like<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.590> know

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
games going that you know like you know

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.260 
games going that you know like you know
they<00:04:35.800> probably<00:04:35.950> had<00:04:36.280> three<00:04:36.550> times<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:37.030> games

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
they probably had three times the games

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.230 
they probably had three times the games
going<00:04:37.960> so<00:04:38.320> every<00:04:38.710> for<00:04:39.070> every<00:04:39.100> loss<00:04:39.610> is<00:04:40.000> right

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
going so every for every loss is right

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.640 
going so every for every loss is right
you<00:04:40.450> know<00:04:40.510> three<00:04:40.810> wins<00:04:41.050> or<00:04:41.320> something<00:04:41.590> you

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
you know three wins or something you

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.770 
you know three wins or something you
know<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:42.490> they<00:04:42.580> need<00:04:42.729> to<00:04:42.760> definitely<00:04:43.120> fix<00:04:43.450> that

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
know so they need to definitely fix that

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.180 
know so they need to definitely fix that
and<00:04:43.810> when<00:04:44.050> they<00:04:44.140> fix<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.650> think<00:04:44.979> we'll

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
and when they fix that I think we'll

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.650 
and when they fix that I think we'll
have<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.400> chance<00:04:45.669> that<00:04:45.910> when<00:04:46.030> in<00:04:46.150> championship

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
have a chance that when in championship

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.360 
have a chance that when in championship
and<00:04:46.780> look<00:04:46.900> at<00:04:46.990> this<00:04:47.080> they<00:04:47.440> couldn't<00:04:47.919> already

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
and look at this they couldn't already

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.520 
and look at this they couldn't already
it's<00:04:48.550> like<00:04:48.669> I<00:04:48.850> mean<00:04:49.090> not<00:04:49.450> already<00:04:49.750> but<00:04:50.020> it's<00:04:50.140> 11

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
it's like I mean not already but it's 11

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.830
