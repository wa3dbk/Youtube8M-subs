most<00:00:32.430> people<00:00:32.730> would<00:00:32.880> just<00:00:33.030> take<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> stake

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
most people would just take the stake

most people would just take the stake
and<00:00:33.809> place<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.350> hole<00:00:34.530> when<00:00:34.739> planting<00:00:35.160> a
