00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
up this weekend it's just a really

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.220 
up this weekend it's just a really
defined<00:00:27.589> course<00:00:28.009> that<00:00:28.400> will<00:00:29.060> show<00:00:29.869> when<00:00:30.140> you

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
defined course that will show when you

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.929 
defined course that will show when you
have<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.829> right<00:00:31.039> line<00:00:31.310> through<00:00:31.609> the<00:00:31.699> course

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
have the right line through the course

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.120 
have the right line through the course
or<00:00:32.119> not<00:00:32.270> it's<00:00:32.509> not<00:00:32.660> like<00:00:32.720> a<00:00:32.930> open<00:00:33.620> track<00:00:33.860> March

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
or not it's not like a open track March

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.460 
or not it's not like a open track March
off<00:00:34.310> with<00:00:34.430> some<00:00:34.579> cones<00:00:34.820> it's<00:00:35.120> really<00:00:35.480> marked

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
off with some cones it's really marked

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.920 
off with some cones it's really marked
out<00:00:36.590> with<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.770> rumble<00:00:37.039> strips<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:37.670> it<00:00:38.600> just

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
out with the rumble strips and it just

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.920 
out with the rumble strips and it just
helps<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.800> define<00:00:40.190> like<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.699> good<00:00:40.969> line<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.600> good

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
helps to define like a good line a good

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.750 
helps to define like a good line a good
car<00:00:42.170> control<00:00:42.469> through<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:42.859> course<00:00:43.100> I<00:00:43.370> think

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
car control through the course I think

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.029 
car control through the course I think
that's<00:00:43.879> where<00:00:44.000> we<00:00:44.149> kind<00:00:44.270> of<00:00:44.359> excel<00:00:45.039> especially

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
that's where we kind of excel especially

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.819 
that's where we kind of excel especially
in<00:00:46.250> tandem<00:00:47.120> we<00:00:47.719> can<00:00:47.899> put<00:00:48.079> down<00:00:48.199> a<00:00:48.260> nice<00:00:48.530> lead

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
in tandem we can put down a nice lead

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.380 
in tandem we can put down a nice lead
run<00:00:49.070> putting<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:49.640> tire<00:00:49.789> on<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.030> edges<00:00:50.239> of<00:00:50.329> the

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
run putting the tire on the edges of the

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.660 
run putting the tire on the edges of the
track<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.930> it's<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.469> much<00:00:51.769> more<00:00:51.800> noticeable<00:00:52.219> to

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
track and it's a much more noticeable to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:14.640 
track and it's a much more noticeable to
check<00:00:52.879> with<00:00:53.030> this

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650
