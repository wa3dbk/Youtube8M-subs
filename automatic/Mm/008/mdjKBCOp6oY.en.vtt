00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.129
 this 

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:13.150
 this guy didn't linger cute one 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.119
 Workout for more weeks tried 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.520
 football volleyball fight and here's the modern 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.770
 break I will tighten inside and the homeland on four 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.529
 years today we will give Dima task 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.300
 more difficult to see if breaker 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.739
 dance russian dances 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.200
 I've seen it on TV many times and it's not 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.180
 I don't know what I like more 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.170
 modern dance seems to me that break 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.969
 his dance is harder 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.280
 but today I tried Russian folk 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.800
 let's see what happens and this 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.739
 Our choreographer Olga Davydenko two years 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.940
 danced in the song and dance ensemble 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.749
 Pacific Fleet of Russia is not 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.269
 huhry-mukhry 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:51.820
 she will explain to broker Dmitry 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.440
 such a herringbone was picking at points trash and 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.659
 crouching down with taking away legs 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.390
 bottom break but usually 100 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.329
 strength exercise on the floor 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.300
 in this case, that is, the arms and legs are used 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.490
 well here's a headstand there yes yes then 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.490
 same as folk dance very much 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:15.040
 many elements are taken from folk dance 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.650
 and brought to the bottom break picking points 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.230
 triple the influx of up to 8 simple but 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.540
 with herringbone had trouble this 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.970
 called herringbone is one of the most 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.760
 simple elements that are also for tea 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.420
 children first grade is the simplest 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.830
 further more like you Dima 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.340
 truly male stunts in Russian 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.740
 dancing 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.740
 but there is no stretch and balance 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.280
 Russian dance is 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.560
 energetic dance after 20 minutes 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.230
 Dmitri was no doubt in this we are changing 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:13.600
 the rhythm turned out to be two 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:15.940
 prtopa it's not that time 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.610
 sum up the weak points of modern 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.060
 dancers of people not all have one 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.260
 problem no definite statement in 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.210
 the body is not the right hands 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.900
 they have a big problem twisting hands 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.240
 with the body and from that flows further 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.200
 and with stretched legs because it 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.570
 constantly limbs which 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.760
 pulled to themselves they gave us 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.340
 male dance line in 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.650
 russian ends of breakdance breaks though 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.440
 after today's training is not so 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.020
 It is clear which party choose dmitry me 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.820
 many understandable yes many develop I 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.520
 thought that these dances are boring and 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.090
 uninteresting but today tried and 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.209
 Well, it would be interesting to do 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.600
 this can need nothing wrong with that 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.600
 no 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.120
 Yes 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.959
