00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
drill we were just letting loose and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.039 
drill we were just letting loose and
letting<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.159> fly<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.729> making<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> ball<00:01:24.600> spin

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
letting it fly and making the ball spin

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.020 
letting it fly and making the ball spin
using<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> front<00:01:25.770> edge<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.159> forward<00:01:26.729> like

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
using the front edge going forward like

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.969 
using the front edge going forward like
this

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.399 

and<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.790> we've<00:01:33.120> raised<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.020> heighth<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and as we've raised up the heighth of

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.920 
and as we've raised up the heighth of
the<00:01:34.560> ball<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.130> becomes<00:01:35.460> more<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.940> slicer

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the ball it becomes more like a slicer

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.980 
the ball it becomes more like a slicer
so<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.740> our<00:01:37.770> side<00:01:38.190> spin<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.330> as<00:01:39.780> we

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
so we have our side spin here and as we

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.030 
so we have our side spin here and as we
get<00:01:40.170> higher<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.770> higher

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
get higher and higher

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.950 
get higher and higher
it<00:01:41.580> becomes<00:01:42.650> slicer<00:01:43.850> right<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.750> same

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it becomes slicer right all the same

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.270 
it becomes slicer right all the same
action<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.170> I've<00:01:49.350> done<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:50.009> I've

I'm<00:02:35.940> about<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.420> middle<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> service

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
I'm about in the middle of the service

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.500 
I'm about in the middle of the service

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.569 
box and I'm going to hit my my slicer
and<00:02:39.810> I'm<00:02:40.440> going<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.650> let<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:40.799> ball<00:02:41.070> travel

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
and I'm going to let that ball travel

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:49.280 
and I'm going to let that ball travel

did<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.370> miss<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.900> that's<00:02:52.680> really<00:02:53.129> what<00:02:53.519> the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
did I miss so that's really what the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.100 
did I miss so that's really what the
ball<00:02:53.790> should<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.269> if<00:02:54.540> we're<00:02:54.750> holding<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
ball should do if we're holding the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.039 
ball should do if we're holding the
correct<00:02:55.379> grip<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.220> let<00:02:56.400> them<00:02:56.549> spin<00:02:57.390> naked

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
correct grip and we let them spin naked

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.509 
correct grip and we let them spin naked
travel<00:02:58.439> it's<00:02:58.620> gonna<00:02:58.739> curve<00:02:59.010> from<00:02:59.250> right<00:02:59.489> to

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
travel it's gonna curve from right to

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.449 
travel it's gonna curve from right to
left<00:02:59.640> if<00:02:59.970> you're<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.150> righty<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:01.250> if<00:03:02.250> you're

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
left if you're a righty and if you're

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.580 
left if you're a righty and if you're
Pete<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.209> ball<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.480> gonna<00:03:03.569> curve<00:03:03.900> from<00:03:04.319> left

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
Pete the ball is gonna curve from left

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.259 
Pete the ball is gonna curve from left
to<00:03:04.709> right<00:03:04.950> because<00:03:05.129> he's<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.610> lefty

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
to right because he's a lefty

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.300 
to right because he's a lefty
so<00:03:06.690> we're<00:03:07.200> gonna<00:03:07.319> practice<00:03:07.590> doing<00:03:08.129> that<00:03:08.280> a

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
so we're gonna practice doing that a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.710 
so we're gonna practice doing that a
bunch<00:03:08.549> of<00:03:08.670> times<00:03:08.909> and<00:03:09.060> if<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.239> notice<00:03:09.510> I

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
bunch of times and if you notice I

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.899 
bunch of times and if you notice I
started<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.260> abbreviated<00:03:10.560> motion<00:03:11.280> kind<00:03:11.760> of

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
started in abbreviated motion kind of

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.580 
started in abbreviated motion kind of
like<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.239> started<00:03:12.720> with<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.989> skip<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.409> rock

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
like you started with the skip the rock

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.830 
like you started with the skip the rock
we<00:03:13.829> started<00:03:14.220> down<00:03:14.400> here<00:03:14.430> right<00:03:15.359> now<00:03:15.420> I'm<00:03:15.659> just

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
we started down here right now I'm just

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.619 
we started down here right now I'm just
gonna<00:03:15.959> start<00:03:16.230> who<00:03:16.970> prevail<00:03:17.970> up<00:03:18.180> where<00:03:18.450> my

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
gonna start who prevail up where my

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.869 
gonna start who prevail up where my
racket<00:03:19.019> face<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.319> going<00:03:19.680> I'm<00:03:20.250> gonna<00:03:20.400> move<00:03:20.640> back

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
racket face is going I'm gonna move back

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.770 
racket face is going I'm gonna move back
to<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.359> service<00:03:21.599> line<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:22.049> my<00:03:22.170> second<00:03:22.530> marker

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.509 

and<00:03:27.780> go<00:03:27.959> through<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.290> same<00:03:28.470> drill<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:29.310> should

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
and go through the same drill you should

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.180 
and go through the same drill you should
be<00:03:29.609> repeating<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.269> probably<00:03:31.109> 50<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.769> 100

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
be repeating this probably 50 to 100

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.360 
be repeating this probably 50 to 100
times<00:03:32.459> up<00:03:32.790> close<00:03:32.840> move<00:03:33.840> back<00:03:34.109> move<00:03:34.470> back<00:03:34.680> move

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
times up close move back move back move

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.879 
times up close move back move back move
back<00:03:35.430> now<00:03:36.000> we're<00:03:36.150> gonna<00:03:36.239> do<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.629> from<00:03:36.840> here<00:03:39.889> do

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
back now we're gonna do it from here do

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.149 
back now we're gonna do it from here do
it<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.069> bunch<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.459> lines<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.959> finally<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:44.010> move

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
it a bunch of lines and finally we move

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.180 
it a bunch of lines and finally we move
to<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.400> baseline<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:45.620> from<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.709> baseline

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
to the baseline and from the baseline

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.759 
to the baseline and from the baseline
here<00:03:50.750> now<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.780> need<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.170> get<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.379> ball<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.709> the
