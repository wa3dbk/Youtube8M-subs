Bazaar<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:24.210> wanted<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> fashion<00:00:25.619> designer

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
Bazaar I wanted to be a fashion designer

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.089 
Bazaar I wanted to be a fashion designer
and<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.970> discovered<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.720> had<00:00:27.990> absolutely<00:00:28.769> no

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and I discovered I had absolutely no

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.550 
and I discovered I had absolutely no
talent<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.660> very<00:00:30.840> disappointing

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
talent and that was very disappointing

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.310 
talent and that was very disappointing
for<00:00:31.800> me<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.360> occurred<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> me<00:00:33.930> because

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
for me and so it occurred to me because

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.380 
for me and so it occurred to me because
I<00:00:34.350> loved<00:00:34.680> magazines<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.430> much<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.210> that

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
I loved magazines so much that that

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.530 
I loved magazines so much that that
could<00:00:36.630> lead<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.110> career<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.149> 25<00:00:39.149> years

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
could lead to a career and 25 years

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.990 
could lead to a career and 25 years
later<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:40.320> being<00:00:40.559> an<00:00:40.680> editor-in-chief<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
later of being an editor-in-chief and I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.479 
later of being an editor-in-chief and I
guess<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> good<00:00:42.780> decision<00:00:43.460> well<00:00:44.460> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
guess it was a good decision well I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
guess it was a good decision well I
think<00:00:44.730> fashion<00:00:45.329> always<00:00:45.480> reflects<00:00:45.989> what's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
