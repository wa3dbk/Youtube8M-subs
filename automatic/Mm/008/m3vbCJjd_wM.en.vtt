they're<00:02:02.670> now<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.119> be<00:02:03.210> uuid<00:02:03.719> based<00:02:04.110> so

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
they're now going to be uuid based so

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.889 
they're now going to be uuid based so
every<00:02:04.890> player<00:02:05.159> has<00:02:05.250> their<00:02:05.399> own<00:02:05.549> unique

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
identifier so that when name painting

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.010 
identifier so that when name painting
comes<00:02:08.670> around<00:02:08.940> they<00:02:09.209> don't<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:09.629> based

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
comes around they don't have to be based

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.700 
comes around they don't have to be based
on<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
on the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.350 
on the
on<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.950> names<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> players<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.270> then

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
on the names of the players and then

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.970 
on the names of the players and then
they<00:02:12.480> would<00:02:12.600> have<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.840> change<00:02:12.870> every<00:02:13.710> place

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
they would have to change every place

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.920 
they would have to change every place
that<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.370> there's<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.120> reference<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.630> that

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
that the there's a reference to that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.480 
that the there's a reference to that
player's<00:02:16.650> name<00:02:16.860> it's<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> little<00:02:17.220> complicated

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
player's name it's a little complicated

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.160 
player's name it's a little complicated
to<00:02:17.730> grasp<00:02:17.970> but<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.780> don't<00:02:18.960> that's<00:02:19.050> okay

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
to grasp but if you don't that's okay

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.600 
to grasp but if you don't that's okay
it's<00:02:19.470> really<00:02:19.680> not<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:19.800> important<00:02:20.310> for<00:02:20.460> you

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
it's really not that important for you

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.270 
it's really not that important for you
to<00:02:20.820> understand<00:02:21.600> it's<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.320> when<00:02:23.040> named

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
to understand it's just that when named

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.800 
to understand it's just that when named
named<00:02:23.700> named<00:02:24.060> tanjung<00:02:24.420> will<00:02:24.570> come<00:02:24.720> around

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
named named tanjung will come around

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.330 
named named tanjung will come around
soon<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.560> that's<00:02:25.710> all<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.980> really<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.220> to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
soon and that's all you really have to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.620 
soon and that's all you really have to
worry<00:02:26.520> about<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.210> pretty<00:02:27.360> much<00:02:27.510> over

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
worry about so it's pretty much over

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.660 
worry about so it's pretty much over
this<00:02:27.810> snapshot<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:29.130> can<00:02:29.280> download<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
this snapshot you can download the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.970 
this snapshot you can download the
snapshot<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.720> your<00:02:31.050> launcher<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.770> actually

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
snapshot in your launcher so I actually

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.070 
snapshot in your launcher so I actually
asked<00:02:32.340> them<00:02:32.460> in<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.610> comment<00:02:32.820> in<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.360> video<00:02:33.810> about

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
asked them in a comment in a video about

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.570 
asked them in a comment in a video about
how<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.410> install<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.740> snapshot<00:02:35.130> basically

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
how to install the snapshot basically

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.890 
how to install the snapshot basically
it's<00:02:35.700> very<00:02:35.880> simple<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.270> create<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> new

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
it's very simple you create a new

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.350 
it's very simple you create a new
profile<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:38.010> set<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> version<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
profile you set the version to the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.030 
profile you set the version to the
snapshot<00:02:39.960> you<00:02:40.170> enable<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.680> severe<00:02:40.860> mental

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
snapshot you enable the severe mental

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.350 
snapshot you enable the severe mental
versions<00:02:41.430> first<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.910> set<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> veldt

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
versions first and you set the veldt

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.880 
versions first and you set the veldt
version<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:42.960> snapshot<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.710> make

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
version to the snapshot but you make

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.280 
version to the snapshot but you make
sure<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.640> either<00:02:44.910> set<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.690> new<00:02:45.840> directory

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
sure to either set it in a new directory

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.380
