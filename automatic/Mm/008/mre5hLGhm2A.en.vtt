00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.690
 hello how are they going to super fire it 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.300
 find today I hope that it 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.730
 find great not only your friend and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.330
 this time we're going to start with the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.130
 tutorial of equal voice and well before that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.150
 I gave nothing to the task of investigating 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.750
 there a little 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.760
 on this subject that is the sensitivity and 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.040
 explain what each one of them serves 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 them and good since afterwards there is no 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.440
 information about that almost I gave myself to 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.950
 the task of doing it is a step 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.710
 important to explain this and 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.420
 well let's start here I have them 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.130
 I will teach the options 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.310
 this is the default control that 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.740
 it comes initially when you see your profile 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.480
 or your account as you want to call or 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.100
 when you enter the game for the first time 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.440
 is the control so predetermined not of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.000
 start not and we're going to explain a 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.550
 little bit about what each 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.490
 sensitivity, visual sensitivity and in 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.060
 what aspect and all that sensitivity 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.060
 visual is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.810
 how I know 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.840
 move your doll at what speed and how 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.930
 can check here when I want to pull or 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.440
 I want to move faster a really 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.690
 it's slow not the visual sensitivity let's 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.080
 to upload it I repeat it decade when 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.729
 you start then it is at level 10 we go to 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.979
 upload it to level 30 so that you 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.780
 can check the difference is the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.710
 sensitivity with which you can move 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.710
 so fast see 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.700
 how can you check is a difference 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.689
 quite drastic with this 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.670
 I can not move this serves too much 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.039
 this is the first step for the word the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.430
 sensitivity and how can they check well goes 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.670
 to move too fast if I turn it on 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.670
 go down 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.810
 Well, my doll, we're going to write down that 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.810
 that will be slow do not see 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.490
 that is, it is very very slow, quite slow 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.350
 Then the first step, I repeat, 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.640
 is sensitivity sensitivity 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.850
 visual is the speed at which you 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.530
 character is going to move not here as 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.440
 you can check out this is my character 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.480
 is going to move very fast we are not going to 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.370
 explain what is coming second 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.520
 sensitivity is the sensitivity of 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.460
 objective not the objective web sensitivity 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.230
 which is when you press lp that 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.690
 is the fact to point this is the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.210
 sensitivity that as you can notice is 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.930
 slow what we have given then 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.690
 will go up 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.420
 in the same way to 30 so that you 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:11.790
 You can check the difference and 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.790
 that is, it is very fast 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.470
 pointing again I repeat this sensitivity 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.210
 this was all pretty fast pretty 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.610
 easy to understand 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.920
 the sensitivity say that is the 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.880
 Southern sensitivity 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.950
 when you sign up and you put the psuv I do not know 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.110
 what can you do with the 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.900
 pistol with the return with the hummer 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.860
 with the sniper no and we're going to grab the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.990
 the ideal sniper 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.930
 this sensitivity is slow as they can 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.900
 check below we're going to put it on 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.290
 what is the maximum 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:00.140
 sensitivity that is being 30 and we're going 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.750
 let's see and we will notice the difference 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.520
 although today we are going to make a small 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 summary about each sensitivity that 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.500
 treat visual sensitivity 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.400
 it's how your doll moves for which side 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.100
 with what speed 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.150
 this is pretty good for what's coming 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.729
 being the eggs and having them in a 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.270
 high sensitivity that is being 22 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.370
 up to 30 and with any of those with the 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.039
 what else they can do they can make an egg 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.930
 it's pretty good and here we are going to 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.660
 go up a bit so they notice again 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.750
 the difference that is being so 2 to 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.009
 30 and what has been my character my 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.680
 doll moves fast does not dare to turn 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.169
 quite 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.080
 fast at a speed is very good and 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.210
 this is too much for the bathrobe what 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.850
 what is the sensitivity of the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.610
 objective remember this sensitivity the 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.870
 fact of aiming with a weapon with the 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.350
 shotgun like this 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.360
 it comes quite slow but the fact 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.080
 to upload them because they are going to increase 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.529
 very very very good very remarkable difference 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.799
 see 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:20.979
 we go with the following sensitivity and 

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:24.639
 sensitivity of your is not with the fact 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:28.359
 of the weapon could be with the hummer boost 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:31.299
 with the sniper or with the pistol 

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:33.819
 when you press the psuv she does not know 

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:36.579
 that the psuv is this pressing the stick 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:40.959
 right you can check here is the 

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:44.309
 south of the snip was pretty slow here what 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:44.309
 let's go up next 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.860
 and good 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.860
 It goes very fast is not recommendation 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.730
 deactivates vibration or deactivates 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.249
 in that really that hinders 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.609
 it's not nothing 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:05.189
 with what you can get along well for the 

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:08.009
 made of wall bones 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:10.199
 because this has been everything is a tutorial 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.299
 pretty easy pretty simple but 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.619
 Well, if we are going to do things, we are going to 

00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:17.879
 do them well 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:19.619
 I do not have them all stimulate in 30 and if 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:23.389
 many wondering what is my 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:27.119
 sensitivity my sensitivity is this 30 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:28.649
 24 18 not this is insensitivity this 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:32.339
 is with which I am accommodated with the one 

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:35.719
 I feel comfortable living there, I did not give 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:35.719
 I'm really bad with the skateboarder 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.550
 they will follow the tutorials this is for 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.919
 that they are a little bit clear for what 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.810
 serves each sensitivity and well then the 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:47.930
 next place will come more complete 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.880
 about the movements that are made 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.039
 to have a good endorsement bots 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.319
 and well this has been all this 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.539
 dismissal remember your friends the 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.699
 tutorials of the same let's do it from 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.979
 the best way the best explained 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.520
 possible so that you have the 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:07.220
 best result they can have 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.099
 enough skill or enough ways to 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.669
 how to practice something something good we are 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:16.340
 remember like comments favorites I know 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:18.289
 that many already know what I know for what 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.500
 It serves every sensitivity but good I think 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:23.840
 that you have to start from right or from 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.970
 the clear points of the base points and 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.240
 good see you until the next other 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.240
 lifetime
