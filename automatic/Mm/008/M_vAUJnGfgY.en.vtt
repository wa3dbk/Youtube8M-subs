 Hi guys, I'm going to show you now. 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.030
 an issue that I also think is not 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.680
 well- known and can help 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.040
 enough 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.369
 For example, I want to transform this photo. 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.380
 And here's a panoramic picture. 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:29.039
 usually this is how we do it 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:32.930
 people fill sensitive content and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.930
 often does not work right 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.670
 It's what I said, now it works the way it is. 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.269
 What is good, huh? 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:50.039
 but if you realize that these 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:52.829
 mainly spotting a photo a photo 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.190
 of which there is much detail 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.929
 information 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.269
 we are here as an example will stay 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:07.980
 It's best to populate this content 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:09.660
 I can see that she is quite 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.320
 always works right then we 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:18.120
 How can we make use of it? 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.900
 lace tool selects a coat that 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.490
 you want to preserve a little button 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.540
 right law 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.540
 we came back in right save the selection 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:41.330
 ready saved the selection found of 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.330
 shoot and select photo the pope 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.800
 you reissue the sensitive scale to 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.340
 content and that up here will 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.900
 appear so protect you choose 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.550
 that selection is not the couple 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.640
 then it's only ready now you have a 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.960
 panoramic photo which is the same thing 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.960

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:17.090

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.970

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.890
