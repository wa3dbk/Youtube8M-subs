00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
so with the the advent of all these next

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.249 
so with the the advent of all these next
string<00:00:04.799> graphic<00:00:05.220> cards<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.640> thought<00:00:05.819> we'd<00:00:05.940> uh

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
string graphic cards I thought we'd uh

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.839 
string graphic cards I thought we'd uh
we<00:00:07.259> take<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> look<00:00:07.710> at<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.950> processing<00:00:08.670> power

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
we take a look at the processing power

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.499 
we take a look at the processing power
of<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.780> Nvidia's<00:00:10.320> newest<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:12.000> Deltron

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509

of this is Nvidia's newest the Deltron
core<00:00:12.929> 750<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.009> we're<00:00:14.130> going<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> look<00:00:14.370> at<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
core 750 and we're going to look at it a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.519 
core 750 and we're going to look at it a
few<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.210> graphic<00:00:15.630> demos<00:00:15.960> would<00:00:16.109> start

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
few of you graphic demos would start

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.840 
few of you graphic demos would start
number<00:00:16.800> one<00:00:16.980> here<00:00:17.279> graphics<00:00:18.240> demo<00:00:19.520> is<00:00:20.520> version

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
number one here graphics demo is version

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.090 
number one here graphics demo is version
one<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.449> know<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:21.840> still<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> little<00:00:22.800> beta

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
one you know it's still a little beta

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.279 
one you know it's still a little beta
testing<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:23.670> let's<00:00:24.510> let's<00:00:24.750> continue<00:00:24.990> for

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
testing but let's let's continue for

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.580 
testing but let's let's continue for
let's<00:00:25.410> check<00:00:25.560> out<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.769> next<00:00:25.949> generator<00:00:26.460> here

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
let's check out this next generator here

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.310 
let's check out this next generator here
do<00:00:28.590> look<00:00:28.890> at<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.210> we<00:00:30.210> can<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.779> print<00:00:31.050> high

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
do look at that we can we can print high

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.130 
do look at that we can we can print high
res<00:00:31.590> text<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.189> screen<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.630> we'll<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:33.809> use<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
res text on screen so we'll just use a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.110 
res text on screen so we'll just use a
little<00:00:34.230> risk<00:00:34.559> colors<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.070> graphics<00:00:35.489> only<00:00:35.850> I

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
little risk colors for graphics only I

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
little risk colors for graphics only I
mean<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:37.050> all<00:00:37.170> these<00:00:37.290> colors

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
mean right like all these colors

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.240 
mean right like all these colors
combining<00:00:39.020> it's<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.800> vortex

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
combining it's just it's just a vortex

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.060 
combining it's just it's just a vortex

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
a window and it's not even say it's a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.979 
a window and it's not even say it's a
black<00:00:53.879> window<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.629> white<00:00:56.510> one<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.840> those

technicians<00:00:59.239> look<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:01.020> could<00:01:01.170> be

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
technicians look at that they could be

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.500 
technicians look at that they could be
anywhere<00:01:01.340> it<00:01:02.340> doesn't<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
anywhere it doesn't have to be on the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.850 
anywhere it doesn't have to be on the
left<00:01:03.690> side<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> right<00:01:04.500> side

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
America right there does that that was a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.380 
America right there does that that was a
50-state<00:01:16.350> scrolling<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.280> old<00:01:17.790> pride<00:01:18.240> and

glory there you know just just to show
off<00:01:22.320> here's<00:01:23.009> another<00:01:23.189> text<00:01:23.549> box<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:25.619> look<00:01:25.950> at

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
off here's another text box so look at

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.980 
off here's another text box so look at
the<00:01:26.100> advanced<00:01:26.490> calculations<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.689> only

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the advanced calculations not only

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.289 
the advanced calculations not only
graphics<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.740> got<00:01:28.860> calculations<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.270> have

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
graphics we got calculations we have

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.660 
graphics we got calculations we have
three<00:01:30.780> ways<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.290> display<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.740> high<00:01:32.040> res<00:01:32.280> screen

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
three ways to display a high res screen

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.390 
three ways to display a high res screen
you<00:01:33.000> know<00:01:33.110> here's<00:01:34.110> some<00:01:34.350> H<00:01:34.500> plotting<00:01:35.159> right

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you know here's some H plotting right

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.940 
you know here's some H plotting right
now<00:01:35.610> look<00:01:36.090> at<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.360> look<00:01:36.960> at<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.140> math

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
now look at that look at that math

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.030 
now look at that look at that math
variables<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.880> gotta<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.659> your<00:01:40.040> seven

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
variables you gotta go get your seven

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.300 
variables you gotta go get your seven
see<00:01:41.280> y<00:01:41.520> 9<00:01:41.790> squared<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.009> put<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
see y 9 squared you can like put a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.370 
see y 9 squared you can like put a
little<00:01:44.430> oh<00:01:45.350> my<00:01:46.350> god<00:01:46.590> wait<00:01:46.770> even<00:01:47.040> tracks<00:01:48.380> you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
little oh my god wait even tracks you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.620 
little oh my god wait even tracks you
know<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> mean<00:01:49.860> gaming<00:01:50.579> can't<00:01:50.850> even<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.149> proper

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
know I mean gaming can't even get proper

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.010 
know I mean gaming can't even get proper
proper<00:01:52.320> tracking<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:54.420> arrow<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.930> know

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
proper tracking it this arrow you know

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109 
proper tracking it this arrow you know
it<00:01:55.170> knows<00:01:55.350> where<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.670> smells

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
it knows where it's going it just smells

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.569 
it knows where it's going it just smells
line<00:01:59.360> smells<00:02:00.360> along<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:01.159> quite<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> few<00:02:02.399> times

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
line smells along a quite a few times

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.740 
line smells along a quite a few times
apparently<00:02:03.920> but<00:02:04.920> yeah<00:02:05.100> here's<00:02:06.030> some<00:02:06.270> here's

apparently but yeah here's some here's
some<00:02:06.990> basic<00:02:07.469> programs<00:02:07.979> i<00:02:08.280> mean<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:09.660> can

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
some basic programs i mean you can

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.570 
some basic programs i mean you can
program<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.560> these<00:02:10.679> new<00:02:10.860> graphic<00:02:11.250> cards<00:02:11.520> you

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
program on these new graphic cards you
