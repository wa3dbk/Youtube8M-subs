make<00:03:16.370> contact<00:03:16.850> with<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.959> two<00:03:18.170> leads<00:03:18.410> on<00:03:18.650> the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
make contact with the two leads on the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.440 
make contact with the two leads on the
circuit<00:03:19.250> board<00:03:19.430> here<00:03:19.670> all<00:03:20.090> right<00:03:20.209> I'm<00:03:20.300> going

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
circuit board here all right I'm going

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.320 
circuit board here all right I'm going
to<00:03:20.510> attempt<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.810> remove<00:03:21.080> this<00:03:21.230> little<00:03:21.440> camp<00:03:22.330> by

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
to attempt to remove this little camp by

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.550 
to attempt to remove this little camp by
prying<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.840> out<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.840> that's<00:03:27.080> what<00:03:27.230> we've<00:03:27.350> got

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
prying it out and that's what we've got

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.820 
prying it out and that's what we've got
the<00:03:27.739> shaft<00:03:28.180> as<00:03:29.180> well<00:03:29.450> as<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.810> little<00:03:29.959> cam

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
the shaft as well as the little cam

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.610 
the shaft as well as the little cam
wheel<00:03:31.070> that<00:03:31.280> activates<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.290> sensor<00:03:33.290> so<00:03:33.470> this

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
wheel that activates the sensor so this

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.410 
wheel that activates the sensor so this
is<00:03:33.739> how<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.920> little<00:03:34.220> cam<00:03:34.430> wheel<00:03:34.670> will<00:03:34.940> engage

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
is how the little cam wheel will engage

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.990 
is how the little cam wheel will engage
the<00:03:36.140> two<00:03:36.260> terminals<00:03:36.739> completing<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.640> circuit

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
the two terminals completing the circuit

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.550 
the two terminals completing the circuit
and<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.450> pretty<00:03:38.660> much<00:03:38.810> sums<00:03:39.110> up<00:03:39.290> what's

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
and that pretty much sums up what's

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.229 
and that pretty much sums up what's
inside<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.010> mechanism<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.700> deploys<00:03:41.030> your

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
inside the mechanism that deploys your

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.230 
inside the mechanism that deploys your
airbags<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:41.989> collision
