i would edit out all the deaths in this

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.109 
i would edit out all the deaths in this
but<00:01:04.860> i'm<00:01:04.949> dead<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.489> majority<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
but i'm dead for the majority of this

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.500 
but i'm dead for the majority of this
gameplay<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:09.060> about<00:01:09.240> two

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
gameplay so it but just be about two

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
gameplay so it but just be about two
minutes<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.020> me<00:01:10.200> being<00:01:10.439> alive<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.979> not

it's<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.380> primary<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.460> sum<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.600> now

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
it's a primary just to sum up so now

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.830 
it's a primary just to sum up so now
i'll<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.020> try<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> remember<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:38.159> put<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
i'll just try and remember to put the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.230 
i'll just try and remember to put the
statistics<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.020> screen<00:01:40.350> now<00:01:41.060> but<00:01:42.060> basically

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
statistics on screen now but basically

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.719 
statistics on screen now but basically
the<00:01:42.540> babyfaces<00:01:42.960> blaster<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.649> forty<00:01:44.399> percent

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the babyfaces blaster is forty percent

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.600 
the babyfaces blaster is forty percent
more<00:01:45.119> accurate<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.810> hit<00:01:46.560> builds<00:01:47.040> boost<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
more accurate on hit builds boost and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.969 
more accurate on hit builds boost and
run<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.450> double<00:01:48.810> speed<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.200> maximum<00:01:49.770> boost

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
run up to double speed a maximum boost

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.460 
run up to double speed a maximum boost
so<00:01:50.640> basically<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.479> more<00:01:51.689> damage<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.229> deal

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so basically the more damage you deal

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.950 
so basically the more damage you deal
the<00:01:52.770> faster<00:01:53.159> i'll<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.399> running<00:01:53.549> however<00:01:54.420> you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the faster i'll be running however you

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.899 
the faster i'll be running however you
do<00:01:55.170> thirty<00:01:55.500> percent<00:01:55.950> less<00:01:56.310> damage<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
do thirty percent less damage and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.569 
do thirty percent less damage and
thirty-five<00:01:57.719> percent<00:01:57.869> slower<00:01:58.469> move<00:01:58.950> speed<00:01:59.340> on

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
thirty-five percent slower move speed on

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.270 
thirty-five percent slower move speed on
wearer<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.840> jump<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> boost<00:02:01.680> reset

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
wearer and if you jump the boost reset

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.550 
wearer and if you jump the boost reset
so<00:02:02.549> basically<00:02:03.000> you're<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.079> doing<00:02:04.229> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
so basically you're going to be doing a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.289 
so basically you're going to be doing a
lot<00:02:04.740> less<00:02:05.280> damage<00:02:05.670> you're<00:02:05.909> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.240> be

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
lot less damage you're going to be

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.960 
lot less damage you're going to be
running<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.780> lot<00:02:07.049> slower<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.459> jump<00:02:08.819> at

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
running a lot slower and if you jump at

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.940 
running a lot slower and if you jump at
all<00:02:09.119> then<00:02:09.810> year's<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.349> be<00:02:10.440> resetting

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
all then year's going to be resetting

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.910 
all then year's going to be resetting
and<00:02:11.310> it's<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:12.180> annoying<00:02:12.450> i<00:02:12.810> know<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.590> does

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and it's just annoying i know it does

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.710 
and it's just annoying i know it does
said<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.280> more<00:02:14.520> accurate<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.270> really

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
said that is more accurate but I really

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.180 
said that is more accurate but I really
haven't<00:02:15.930> seen<00:02:16.230> any<00:02:16.440> difference<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.099> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
haven't seen any difference in the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.000 
haven't seen any difference in the
accuracy<00:02:17.849> of<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.060> I've<00:02:19.020> realized<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:19.890> been

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
accuracy of it I've realized I just been

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.250 
accuracy of it I've realized I just been
missing<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:20.730> much<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.599> really<00:02:22.140> don't

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
missing just as much so I really don't

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.839 
missing just as much so I really don't
think<00:02:22.380> there<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:23.190> much<00:02:23.310> difference

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
think there is that much difference

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.580 
think there is that much difference
basically<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.660> accuracy<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.410> means

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
basically the accuracy just means

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.860 
basically the accuracy just means
there's<00:02:25.800> less<00:02:25.860> spread<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.209> from<00:02:27.450> medium

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
there's less spread so that from medium

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.870 
there's less spread so that from medium
to<00:02:27.900> long<00:02:28.440> range<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:29.010> does<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> bit<00:02:29.400> more<00:02:29.489> damage

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
to long range it does a bit more damage

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.760 
to long range it does a bit more damage
which<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.239> still<00:02:30.450> really<00:02:30.720> pointless<00:02:31.200> because

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
which is still really pointless because

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.740 
which is still really pointless because
if<00:02:32.160> you're<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> scalp<00:02:32.760> then<00:02:33.270> you'll<00:02:33.480> want<00:02:33.690> to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
if you're a scalp then you'll want to

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.449 
if you're a scalp then you'll want to
then<00:02:34.140> you're<00:02:34.290> going<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> be<00:02:34.709> want<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.950> be<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.310> in

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
then you're going to be want to be up in

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.970 
then you're going to be want to be up in
people's<00:02:36.060> faces<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.020> their<00:02:37.290> grill<00:02:37.739> as

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
people's faces and in their grill as

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.780 
people's faces and in their grill as
other<00:02:38.760> people<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> ghetto<00:02:39.450> sir<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:41.519> do

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
other people in the ghetto sir but I do

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.400 
other people in the ghetto sir but I do
have<00:02:41.940> all<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.300> statistics<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:43.140> about<00:02:43.380> all

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
have all the statistics here about all

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.589 
have all the statistics here about all
the<00:02:43.590> damage<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.160> does<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.880> does<00:02:45.209> just

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
the damage that it does it does just

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.449 
the damage that it does it does just
less<00:02:45.959> damage<00:02:46.380> than<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.709> default<00:02:46.860> scale<00:02:47.280> go<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
less damage than the default scale go a

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.160 
less damage than the default scale go a
nice<00:02:47.640> pretty<00:02:47.880> much<00:02:48.060> all<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.300> need<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
nice pretty much all you need to know a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.800 
nice pretty much all you need to know a
lot<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.830> people<00:02:49.920> do<00:02:50.280> say<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.239> boost<00:02:51.540> is

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
lot of people do say that the boost is

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.020 
lot of people do say that the boost is
very<00:02:52.110> useful<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:53.220> because<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.700> run<00:02:53.910> at

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
very useful just because you run at

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.520 
very useful just because you run at
double<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.330> speed<00:02:54.450> if<00:02:54.870> you're<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.110> maximum

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
double the speed if you're on maximum

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.400 
double the speed if you're on maximum
boost<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.360> then<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.630> don't<00:02:57.810> really<00:02:57.900> need<00:02:58.200> to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
boost and then you don't really need to

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.020 
boost and then you don't really need to
jump<00:02:58.680> because<00:02:59.010> in<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.610> majority<00:02:59.850> of

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
jump because in the majority of

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.640 
jump because in the majority of
situations<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.840> can<00:03:00.870> just<00:03:01.170> sort<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.350> run

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
situations you can just sort of run

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.680 
situations you can just sort of run
there<00:03:01.920> faster<00:03:02.819> than<00:03:02.970> if<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.209> were<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.360> going

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
there faster than if you were just going

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.660 
there faster than if you were just going
to<00:03:03.840> jump<00:03:03.989> up<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.470> primary<00:03:05.190> example<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.549> this

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
to jump up to it primary example of this

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.820 
to jump up to it primary example of this
is<00:03:05.880> on<00:03:06.000> upward<00:03:06.180> near<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.780> final<00:03:07.140> point<00:03:07.380> you

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
is on upward near the final point you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.470 
is on upward near the final point you
can<00:03:07.950> just<00:03:08.040> run<00:03:08.280> around<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.670> lot<00:03:08.819> faster<00:03:09.030> rather

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
can just run around a lot faster rather

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.690 
can just run around a lot faster rather
than<00:03:09.690> jumping<00:03:09.959> but<00:03:10.680> there<00:03:10.830> are<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.040> few<00:03:11.400> maps

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
than jumping but there are a few maps

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.449 
than jumping but there are a few maps
such<00:03:12.690> as<00:03:12.930> Lake<00:03:13.560> size<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.100> do<00:03:14.310> actually

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
such as Lake size that you do actually

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.370 
such as Lake size that you do actually
need<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.880> jump<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.420> get<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.720> some<00:03:15.930> health<00:03:16.140> packs

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
need to jump to get to some health packs

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.680 
need to jump to get to some health packs
so<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> massive<00:03:17.760> disadvantage<00:03:18.030> they're

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
so is a massive disadvantage they're

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.560 
so is a massive disadvantage they're
also<00:03:19.200> not<00:03:19.859> always<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.850> run<00:03:21.060> speed<00:03:21.299> going

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
also not always is the run speed going

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.780 
also not always is the run speed going
to<00:03:21.750> be<00:03:21.870> useful<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.560> found<00:03:23.070> that<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.519> this<00:03:23.670> game

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
to be useful I found that in this game

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.569 
to be useful I found that in this game
play<00:03:24.209> then<00:03:24.720> they'll<00:03:25.320> be<00:03:25.470> like<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.769> heavy<00:03:26.190> moving

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
play then they'll be like a heavy moving

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.699 
play then they'll be like a heavy moving
ridiculously<00:03:27.329> slowly<00:03:27.720> I'll<00:03:28.230> be<00:03:28.440> trying<00:03:28.590> to

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
ridiculously slowly I'll be trying to

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.170 
ridiculously slowly I'll be trying to
strip<00:03:29.040> out<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.220> way<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:29.640> even<00:03:29.730> saw<00:03:29.970> there

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
strip out the way and you even saw there

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.670 
strip out the way and you even saw there
that<00:03:30.329> you<00:03:30.420> CN<00:03:30.690> stock<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:31.049> also<00:03:31.350> using<00:03:31.500> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that you CN stock is also using the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680 
that you CN stock is also using the
weapon<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.190> he<00:03:32.609> was<00:03:32.760> speeding<00:03:32.970> up<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:33.510> much

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
weapon and he was speeding up so much

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.229 
weapon and he was speeding up so much
they<00:03:33.930> couldn't<00:03:34.230> keep<00:03:34.290> focused<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.220> am<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
they couldn't keep focused and am on the

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.630 
they couldn't keep focused and am on the
pyro<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.810> he<00:03:37.410> died<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.010> really<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.519> a

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
pyro and he died and it really is just a

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.759 
pyro and he died and it really is just a
massive<00:03:38.880> downside<00:03:39.420> even<00:03:40.170> though<00:03:40.320> is<00:03:40.470> marked

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
massive downside even though is marked

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.490 
massive downside even though is marked
as<00:03:40.859> an<00:03:41.700> upside<00:03:42.269> i<00:03:42.299> guess<00:03:42.660> or<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> plot<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
as an upside i guess or a plot of the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.830 
as an upside i guess or a plot of the
weapon<00:03:43.829> you're<00:03:44.760> moving<00:03:45.090> way<00:03:45.239> too<00:03:45.269> fast<00:03:45.450> at

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
weapon you're moving way too fast at

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.530 
weapon you're moving way too fast at
some<00:03:46.019> points<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.890> just<00:03:47.160> cannot<00:03:47.489> get<00:03:48.060> to

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
some points and you just cannot get to

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.050 
some points and you just cannot get to
the<00:03:49.230> place<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.500> want<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:49.920> be<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.790> don't

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
the place you want to be and you don't

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.120 
the place you want to be and you don't
aim<00:03:51.329> as<00:03:51.750> accurately<00:03:52.440> even<00:03:52.890> though<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.070> are

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
aim as accurately even though you are

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.380 
aim as accurately even though you are
more<00:03:53.340> accurate<00:03:53.519> but<00:03:53.910> you're<00:03:54.030> still<00:03:54.239> doing

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
more accurate but you're still doing

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.140 
more accurate but you're still doing
less<00:03:54.660> damage<00:03:55.109> so<00:03:55.650> basically<00:03:56.130> all<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.609> upsides

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
less damage so basically all the upsides

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.690 
less damage so basically all the upsides
of<00:03:57.359> this<00:03:57.600> weapon<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:58.140> balanced<00:03:59.010> out<00:03:59.130> by<00:03:59.400> the

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
of this weapon a balanced out by the

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.569 
of this weapon a balanced out by the
downside<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:00.750> this<00:04:01.410> is<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.590> direct<00:04:01.799> downgrade

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
downside so this is a direct downgrade

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.819 
downside so this is a direct downgrade
in<00:04:02.760> my<00:04:03.000> opinion<00:04:03.359> I<00:04:03.660> do<00:04:03.989> enjoy<00:04:04.260> using<00:04:04.590> this

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
in my opinion I do enjoy using this

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.590 
in my opinion I do enjoy using this
weapon<00:04:05.010> sometimes<00:04:05.549> if<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.209> have<00:04:06.329> a<00:04:06.359> decent

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
weapon sometimes if you have a decent

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.360 
weapon sometimes if you have a decent
team<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.319> can<00:04:07.470> actually<00:04:07.620> am<00:04:08.040> quite

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
team and you can actually am quite

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.460 
team and you can actually am quite
accurately<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.569> you<00:04:09.690> know<00:04:09.870> how<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.109> use<00:04:10.230> this

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
accurately and you know how to use this

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.020 
accurately and you know how to use this
properly<00:04:10.829> then<00:04:11.160> sure<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.609> can<00:04:11.760> be<00:04:11.880> quite

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
properly then sure it can be quite

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.690 
properly then sure it can be quite
useful<00:04:12.290> but<00:04:13.290> for<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.650> average<00:04:13.829> player<00:04:14.400> it

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
useful but for the average player it

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.090 
useful but for the average player it
really<00:04:15.239> isn't<00:04:15.540> going<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.109> be<00:04:16.229> helpful<00:04:16.799> all

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
really isn't going to be helpful all

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.370 
really isn't going to be helpful all
also<00:04:18.090> you'll<00:04:18.419> need<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.750> spend<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.079> lot<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.289> time

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
also you'll need to spend a lot of time

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.170 
also you'll need to spend a lot of time
practicing<00:04:19.889> with<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.729> make<00:04:20.850> sure<00:04:20.910> you're

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
practicing with it to make sure you're

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.630 
practicing with it to make sure you're
good<00:04:21.389> with<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.860> basically<00:04:22.860> you're<00:04:23.370> running

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
good with it basically you're running

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.490 
good with it basically you're running
super<00:04:23.820> fast<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.570> need<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.840> learn<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.020> end<00:04:25.320> with

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
super fast you need to learn to end with

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.570 
super fast you need to learn to end with
this<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.890> then<00:04:26.430> going<00:04:26.849> from<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.240> bed

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
this and then going from the bed

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.460 
this and then going from the bed
bases<00:04:27.789> blaster<00:04:28.210> back<00:04:28.449> to<00:04:28.599> the<00:04:28.689> scattergun<00:04:29.259> is

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
bases blaster back to the scattergun is

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.189 
bases blaster back to the scattergun is
pretty<00:04:30.159> much<00:04:30.430> impossible<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.810> that's<00:04:32.020> pretty

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
pretty much impossible and that's pretty

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.290 
pretty much impossible and that's pretty
much<00:04:32.319> why<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.590> just<00:04:33.159> thought<00:04:33.370> I'd<00:04:33.580> say<00:04:33.879> why<00:04:34.270> I

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
much why I just thought I'd say why I

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.540 
much why I just thought I'd say why I
hit<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.990> babyfaces<00:04:35.379> blaster<00:04:35.889> why<00:04:36.490> the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
hit the babyfaces blaster why the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.550 
hit the babyfaces blaster why the
babyfaces<00:04:37.300> fastest<00:04:37.840> sucks<00:04:38.139> and<00:04:38.409> it's<00:04:38.530> a

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
babyfaces fastest sucks and it's a

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.010 
babyfaces fastest sucks and it's a
horrible<00:04:38.919> weapon<00:04:39.219> in<00:04:39.520> my<00:04:39.729> opinion<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.629> can<00:04:40.870> be

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
horrible weapon in my opinion it can be

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.809 
horrible weapon in my opinion it can be
useful<00:04:41.289> at<00:04:41.379> some<00:04:41.560> points<00:04:41.889> but<00:04:41.949> really<00:04:42.639> not

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
useful at some points but really not

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:46.980 
useful at some points but really not
often<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.960> guess<00:04:44.560> I'll<00:04:44.710> read<00:04:44.889> out<00:04:45.039> the<00:04:45.990> damages

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
often I guess I'll read out the damages

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.709 
often I guess I'll read out the damages
I<00:04:47.139> guess<00:04:47.439> so<00:04:48.099> if<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.610> use<00:04:48.879> the<00:04:48.909> scattergun

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:49.719 
I guess so if you use the scattergun

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:53.040 
I guess so if you use the scattergun
often<00:04:50.580> you'll<00:04:51.580> realize<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.240> does<00:04:52.360> about<00:04:52.449> 100

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
often you'll realize it does about 100

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.320 
often you'll realize it does about 100
to<00:04:53.169> 120<00:04:53.800> damage<00:04:54.129> at<00:04:54.250> point-blank<00:04:54.610> range<00:04:54.759> i

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
to 120 damage at point-blank range i

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.179 
to 120 damage at point-blank range i
believe<00:04:55.599> this<00:04:56.259> is<00:04:56.409> only<00:04:56.590> going<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:56.949> be<00:04:57.039> doing

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:57.189 
believe this is only going to be doing

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.890 
believe this is only going to be doing
63<00:04:57.909> to<00:04:58.439> 73.5<00:04:59.439> medium<00:05:00.430> range<00:05:00.669> is<00:05:00.909> 7<00:05:01.389> damage<00:05:01.719> to

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
63 to 73.5 medium range is 7 damage to

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.820 
63 to 73.5 medium range is 7 damage to
28<00:05:02.409> on<00:05:02.590> long<00:05:03.099> range<00:05:03.280> is<00:05:03.580> 2.1<00:05:04.360> 27<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.469> basically

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
28 on long range is 2.1 27 so basically

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.399 
28 on long range is 2.1 27 so basically
if<00:05:06.099> you<00:05:06.370> are<00:05:06.490> not<00:05:06.639> right<00:05:07.000> up<00:05:07.240> next<00:05:07.719> to<00:05:07.930> them<00:05:08.139> and

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
if you are not right up next to them and

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.409 
if you are not right up next to them and
if<00:05:09.009> you're<00:05:09.159> trying<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.580> kill<00:05:09.759> someone<00:05:10.030> such<00:05:10.389> as

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
if you're trying to kill someone such as

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.390 
if you're trying to kill someone such as
a<00:05:10.569> heavy<00:05:10.870> then<00:05:11.469> it's<00:05:11.590> going<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:11.889> be<00:05:12.009> taking<00:05:12.340> a

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
a heavy then it's going to be taking a

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.689 
a heavy then it's going to be taking a
while<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:13.259> you<00:05:14.259> need<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:14.530> do<00:05:14.650> 99<00:05:15.039> damage<00:05:15.550> to

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
while and you need to do 99 damage to

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.140 
while and you need to do 99 damage to
get<00:05:15.819> the<00:05:15.940> fully<00:05:16.180> charged<00:05:16.949> boost<00:05:17.949> type<00:05:18.370> meter

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
get the fully charged boost type meter

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.140 
get the fully charged boost type meter
thing<00:05:19.569> so<00:05:20.110> I<00:05:20.139> mean<00:05:20.319> that<00:05:20.469> is<00:05:20.590> nice<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:21.789> doesn't

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
thing so I mean that is nice it doesn't

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.550 
thing so I mean that is nice it doesn't
take<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.330> lot<00:05:22.539> of<00:05:22.599> damage<00:05:22.840> so<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.199> can<00:05:23.319> quickly

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
take a lot of damage so you can quickly

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.649 
take a lot of damage so you can quickly
rebuild<00:05:24.129> that<00:05:24.340> but<00:05:25.000> you're<00:05:25.150> moving<00:05:25.509> really

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
rebuild that but you're moving really

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.959 
rebuild that but you're moving really
fast<00:05:25.810> as<00:05:26.139> well<00:05:26.289> so<00:05:26.500> it<00:05:26.560> really<00:05:26.740> isn't<00:05:27.159> that

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
fast as well so it really isn't that

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.959 
fast as well so it really isn't that
useful<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.599> guess<00:05:29.129> just<00:05:30.129> because<00:05:30.340> you're

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
useful I guess just because you're

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.610 
useful I guess just because you're
moving<00:05:31.270> way<00:05:31.419> too<00:05:31.449> fast<00:05:31.629> and<00:05:32.169> I've<00:05:32.379> said<00:05:32.590> this

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
moving way too fast and I've said this

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.010 
moving way too fast and I've said this
enough<00:05:32.979> times<00:05:33.159> in<00:05:33.400> this<00:05:33.789> video<00:05:34.090> already<00:05:34.419> but

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
enough times in this video already but

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.110 
enough times in this video already but
you<00:05:35.110> are<00:05:35.229> moving<00:05:35.409> ridiculously<00:05:36.190> fast<00:05:36.550> so

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
you are moving ridiculously fast so

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.149 
you are moving ridiculously fast so
anything<00:05:37.539> you<00:05:37.569> do<00:05:37.870> try<00:05:38.169> to<00:05:38.199> get<00:05:38.560> done<00:05:38.800> just

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
anything you do try to get done just

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.950 
anything you do try to get done just
doesn't<00:05:39.550> work<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.090> it<00:05:40.180> is<00:05:40.300> quite<00:05:40.599> annoying

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
doesn't work and it is quite annoying

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.399 
doesn't work and it is quite annoying
when<00:05:41.969> trying<00:05:42.969> to<00:05:43.089> aim<00:05:43.210> at<00:05:43.479> one<00:05:43.659> target<00:05:44.229> and

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
when trying to aim at one target and

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.499 
when trying to aim at one target and
you're<00:05:45.159> just<00:05:45.310> moving<00:05:45.460> too<00:05:45.669> fast<00:05:46.000> so<00:05:46.360> you're

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509 
you're just moving too fast so you're

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:48.510 
you're just moving too fast so you're
trying<00:05:46.659> to<00:05:46.750> dodge<00:05:47.020> them<00:05:47.589> attacking<00:05:47.979> you<00:05:48.279> but

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
trying to dodge them attacking you but

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.490 
trying to dodge them attacking you but
you<00:05:48.669> can't<00:05:48.879> actually<00:05:49.120> am<00:05:49.509> so<00:05:50.229> you're<00:05:50.379> pretty

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
you can't actually am so you're pretty

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.200 
you can't actually am so you're pretty
much<00:05:50.589> gonna<00:05:50.830> die<00:05:51.099> the<00:05:51.460> majority<00:05:51.729> of<00:05:51.879> the<00:05:52.000> time

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
much gonna die the majority of the time

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.689 
much gonna die the majority of the time
with<00:05:52.719> this<00:05:53.020> weapon<00:05:53.259> the<00:05:53.830> only<00:05:53.860> useful<00:05:54.219> thing<00:05:54.460> I

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
with this weapon the only useful thing I

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.579 
with this weapon the only useful thing I
found<00:05:55.000> with<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.330> boost<00:05:55.629> is<00:05:55.839> I<00:05:55.960> can<00:05:56.169> run<00:05:56.379> away

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:56.589 
found with the boost is I can run away

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.680 
found with the boost is I can run away
from<00:05:56.650> enemies<00:05:57.129> really<00:05:57.460> quickly<00:05:57.849> if<00:05:58.000> I<00:05:58.479> get

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
from enemies really quickly if I get

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.240 
from enemies really quickly if I get
full<00:05:58.870> boost<00:05:59.110> and<00:05:59.379> i<00:05:59.440> can<00:05:59.589> run<00:05:59.740> and<00:05:59.770> grab<00:05:59.919> health

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
full boost and i can run and grab health

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.459 
full boost and i can run and grab health
and<00:06:00.550> in<00:06:01.120> situations<00:06:01.810> like<00:06:01.870> this<00:06:02.110> where<00:06:02.169> i

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469 
and in situations like this where i

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:03.779 
and in situations like this where i
pushed<00:06:02.770> all<00:06:02.979> the<00:06:03.009> way<00:06:03.129> back<00:06:03.339> at<00:06:03.520> our<00:06:03.550> last

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
pushed all the way back at our last

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.430 
pushed all the way back at our last
point<00:06:04.089> honestly<00:06:04.509> I<00:06:04.930> don't<00:06:04.990> know<00:06:05.199> how<00:06:05.379> we

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
point honestly I don't know how we

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.379 
point honestly I don't know how we
defended<00:06:05.889> the<00:06:05.979> point<00:06:06.190> for<00:06:06.339> this<00:06:06.490> long<00:06:06.699> but<00:06:07.270> if

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
defended the point for this long but if

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.209 
defended the point for this long but if
you<00:06:07.479> are<00:06:07.569> pushed<00:06:07.779> it<00:06:07.930> your<00:06:08.110> last<00:06:08.349> point<00:06:08.560> using

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
you are pushed it your last point using

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.189 
you are pushed it your last point using
this<00:06:09.460> weapon<00:06:09.669> there's<00:06:10.120> nothing<00:06:10.330> you<00:06:10.629> can<00:06:10.810> do<00:06:10.990> I

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
this weapon there's nothing you can do I

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.019 
this weapon there's nothing you can do I
go<00:06:11.589> down<00:06:11.740> to<00:06:11.770> one<00:06:11.979> health<00:06:12.279> the<00:06:12.520> boost<00:06:12.759> I'm

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:13.029 
go down to one health the boost I'm

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:15.779 
go down to one health the boost I'm
moving<00:06:13.599> the<00:06:13.719> normal<00:06:14.139> speed<00:06:14.979> of<00:06:15.190> a<00:06:15.250> scout<00:06:15.550> and

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
moving the normal speed of a scout and

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.779 
moving the normal speed of a scout and
that<00:06:16.240> helped<00:06:16.479> me<00:06:16.539> run<00:06:16.719> back<00:06:16.900> to<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.789> health

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
that helped me run back to the health

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.499 
that helped me run back to the health
pack<00:06:19.180> regeneration<00:06:19.990> create<00:06:20.589> thingy<00:06:21.240> and<00:06:22.240> that

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
pack regeneration create thingy and that

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:23.790 
pack regeneration create thingy and that
was<00:06:22.659> helpful<00:06:22.900> there<00:06:23.259> and<00:06:23.440> that's<00:06:23.560> pretty<00:06:23.710> much

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
was helpful there and that's pretty much

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.829 
was helpful there and that's pretty much
it<00:06:24.009> I<00:06:24.159> try<00:06:24.460> to<00:06:24.490> kill<00:06:24.669> this<00:06:24.789> heavy<00:06:25.120> but<00:06:25.599> since

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:25.839 
it I try to kill this heavy but since

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.719 
it I try to kill this heavy but since
I'm<00:06:25.990> moving<00:06:26.379> too<00:06:26.560> fast<00:06:26.770> with<00:06:27.009> full<00:06:27.219> boost<00:06:27.430> I

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
I'm moving too fast with full boost I

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.659 
I'm moving too fast with full boost I
just<00:06:28.210> cannot<00:06:28.690> land<00:06:29.020> any<00:06:29.319> shots<00:06:29.680> on<00:06:29.919> him<00:06:30.190> and

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
just cannot land any shots on him and

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.790 
just cannot land any shots on him and
that's<00:06:30.789> pretty<00:06:30.969> much<00:06:31.120> my<00:06:31.810> opinions<00:06:32.409> on<00:06:32.620> the

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
that's pretty much my opinions on the
