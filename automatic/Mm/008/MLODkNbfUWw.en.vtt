00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.640
 hello to you all over the century again and this 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.530
 the video came out only thanks to you 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.750
 everyone who left their comments to 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.829
 the previous video to everyone who wrote to me in 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.320
 private messages 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.269
 I received a lot of positive and 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.640
 constructive feedback and decided 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.940
 keep filming thanks again everyone 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.579
 ok in this photo blog i will tell about shooting 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.589
 which was half a year ago closer 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.899
 the end of the video I will tell you the story of 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.269
 why is this video did not work back then and 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.640
 what have I been doing all this time like you already 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.199
 probably had time to understand I want you 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.420
 tell about the shooting on which we 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.759
 built a white room in the woods honestly 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.950
 saying don't even know how I came to 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.290
 head this idea but everything happened by 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.110
 standard scheme often before bedtime i 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.880
 starting to think about something 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.470
 analyzes recent events with produce 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.200
 head some polls 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.990
 it is at this moment sharply and unexpectedly 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.880
 the idea comes from this all begins 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.490
 this is the basis 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.799
 which need to rotate the detail is a shot 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.020
 I wanted to touch on the topic of what people 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.650
 often withdraw into themselves standing around 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.540
 myself 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.850
 and live in this own little 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.490
 sometimes do not pay attention to everything in the world 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.130
 fine and what exists around white 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.200
 color is also chosen not by chance because people 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.320
 cook hiding from the outside world 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.780
 believe that here in them all measure 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.510
 perfect and correct and white color 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.300
 perfectly conveys this atmosphere but how 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.730
 known even in the sun there are spots and this 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.740
 I also decided to develop the topic and thought 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.340
 that blood stains may be nice 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.200
 by decision 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.510
 Especially since I really like it. 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.960
 Contrast combination of red and white 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.450
 colors 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.610
 put blood of hope helped me just 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.980
 a wonderful make-up artist is very cute 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.470
 girl Olga Korotkova respectively 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.200
 she did mike with me for shooting I 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.400
 I made 2 liters of red paint 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.010
 all scenery 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.230
 more precisely with this, as always, I was helped by my 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.390
 dad but then in the process of not processing 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.920
 still more like the option without 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.260
 shelter do I tell you a little 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.340
 more about how from what we did 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.040
 this design 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.740
 it took us 25 meters white 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.900
 enough for 19 three-meter format 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.030
 metal pipes we fastened the pipe with 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.190
 using special fasteners and secured 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.650
 a sheet of paper with want then raised 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.870
 construction and phillip land on building 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.090
 this is the scenery we spent about two 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.290
 hours of time as usual at first everything 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.390
 seemed unreal 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.489
 you donâ€™t know it well 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.980
 something or not but that doesn't mean that 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.630
 need to be afraid i blow off it means that 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.670
 you need to do everything possible to 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.030
 similar people looking at your work 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.840
 could say it is really cool 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.580
 also respect i thank 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.980
 watched the autumn great what took 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.170
 involved you just introduce yourself to her 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.879
 the place you wrote a man that wants to wear 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.819
 new straitjacket pour blood 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.700
 Not everyone probably agreed by the way this 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.800
 shirt, too, sewed most often neck 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.500
 through his shootings but basically it 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.080
 there were some skirts and uncomplicated crowds 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.150
 here is the shirt sleeves and I sewed in the first 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.390
 time in my life I am that person who 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.129
 we learn everything we are on our way therefore I 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.319
 never looked for any scheme and 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.900
 The pattern to give never measured by 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.060
 lineup i just do as i want you 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.160
 from the times it also turned out well 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.319
 now briefly about why I am so much 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.630
 time could not cope with the installation 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.849
 This video is all about the fact that I shot 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.290
 this stuff into two different cameras on 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.750
 my working canon on which I 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.879
 I take pictures and on my new nickname which 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.250
 I bought specifically for the way but with 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:01.069
 montage sony vegas constantly embers crowd 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.829
 unknown reasons many months in 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.110
 torment I tried to mount nothing 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.540
 it came to the point that you 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.380
 different versions of the computer became veiled 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.270
 sony by 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.270
 the price of various baseboards was canceled 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.450
 update 4 different wizards try not to 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.970
 received nothing has changed and i did 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.440
 for myself the conclusion is that these two brands are just 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.410
 conflict with each other 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.630
 most recently I found it difficult to 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.880
 real way to become at least some 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.740
 fragments of video and title shot 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.990
 material next time such problems 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.480
 just won't be because i have this 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.670
 beautiful camera and past video 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.710
 was partially shot on her so with 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.780
 montage everything was fine so here I am 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.970
 told everything she wanted hope it 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.430
 the video didn't work too long i 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.160
 really wanted to share all the emotions and 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.960
 the experience that I was due to this 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.060
 taking pictures I want to ask you again 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.890
