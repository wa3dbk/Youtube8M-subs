00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.859
 all right 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.840
 material that we are going to use 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.540
 the thick cardboard tube diameter 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.860
 18 centimeters cut to the measure of a 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:34.020
 metro many large cardboard boxes 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.890
 glue for wood white glue a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.879
 Bulk paints to taste brushes and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.160
 paint a ball of unicel or I have x 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:48.210
 tape measure wide strips of paper 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.059
 newspaper scissors cutter and a marker and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.190
 also masking tape and silicone 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.949
 liquid 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.519
 the houses that we are going to use should 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.469
 measure at least 96 centimeters which is 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.220
 the size that we are going to cut all 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.290
 our loading strips 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.330
 let's start by elaborating the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.300
 template 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.250
 let's trace in this mold paper 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.340
 either newspaper or the one that we have 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:22.730
 chosen a line of 96 centimeters in 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.730
 the fund we are going to give you 5 cents 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.969
 at the top we are going to count 6 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.969
 centimeters 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.210
 and we are going to place a circle that measures 15 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.210
 centimeters 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.050
 as you can see in the image 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.160
 let's join 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.979
 as one has 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.250
 and this will be our template which 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.920
 let's cut out the cardboard 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.320
 let's cut a genil circle to 5 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.570
 centimeters more than the diameter of the tube 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.670
 of cardboard and we will paste it with 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.450
 glue for wood in what will be the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.380
 background of our car 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.950
 after that 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.000
 and I put 20 of these strips around 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.000
 cardboard tube 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.260
 they must be glued with wood glue 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.660
 let's not forget to leave 4 centimeters in the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.490
 upper part 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.660
 already when it is in all the strips 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.840
 stuck we are going to put strips of paper 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.740
 newspaper with silicon this is let's 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.530
 put silicone 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.170
 in one carton and in the other and we're going to 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.960
 put the newspaper over trying to 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.870
 cover the entire surface 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.380
 and we are going to proceed to give three layers of 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.380
 kart maybe 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.200
 for the lid we are going to cut a strip of 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.390
 cardboard that give us a circumference of 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.700
 18 centimeters 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.700
 and will measure all that ideal feeling 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.060
 then we're going to make some openings in 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.370
 the top in the shape of a triangle 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.390
 and we are going to fasten consultation to sew 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.580
 apart let's cut a circle in 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.900
 cardboard that measures 5 centimeters more than 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.560
 diameter 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:31.470
 this is approximately 28 centimeters 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.080
 We are going to stick our cardboard on top of the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.250
 circle and above we are going to paste a 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.960
 ball or a design 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.120
 let's cover the stage with cartapesta 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.240
 then we are going to cut a cardboard strip 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.510
 that measures 4 centimeters long 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.950
 that can enter and exit without difficulty 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.489
 in the cardboard tube 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.180
 We are going to fly it with a letterhead and the 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:05.690
 let's paste down our stage that 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.580
 stay centered 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.650
 that's how our cover is going to be 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.650
 and that's how our boss is 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.180
 Well, the photos where they are put 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:25.300
 arrested I'm painting did not leave the 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.740
 of street are that I put in my two then 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.830
 painted in white I gave him a craquelure 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.370
 white rubber and on top of fudecu step 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.590
 then I was decorating the idea was 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.660
 put some sunflowers in the center but 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.240
 I did not find sunflowers that is not so 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.130
 so I hope it's better that way for now 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.000
 already later when you find a 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.419
 request and here not opinion of a 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.419
 expert 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.810
 what do you think about this gal 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.530
 friendly kisses see you in our 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.530
