00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.150
 Hello everyone, hi-tech mail.ru 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.250
 and I'm up to her head lovers click on 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.469
 button and effortlessly get 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.139
 a cup of fragrant espresso or tender 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.570
 cappuccino is getting bigger for this 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.970
 we decided to arrange an automatic battle 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.400
 coffee machines and find out which one 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.400
 able to brew the most correct coffee 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.570
 we are on trial four automatic 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.910
 coffee machines and in the price range from 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.570
 fifteen to thirty thousand rubles and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.750
 So 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.550
 coffee I will create a krups coffee machine 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.020
 automatic press series costing from 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.840
 15,000 rubles 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.750
 saeco minuto coffee machine cost about 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.850
 21 thousand rubles 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.989
 melitta caffeo coffee machine instead 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.640
 of milk cost from 25 thousand rubles and 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.680
 bosch coffee machine from the vera caffe series 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.379
 latte worth 22 thousand rubles 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.670
 device coffee machines are very similar 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.250
 the main elements of the design are 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.710
 brewing module built-in coffee grinder 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.630
 the fresh water tanks addon 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.939
 used water and container for 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.850
 spent coffee is an obvious difference 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.590
 lies in the design dimensions and cost 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.110
 within the designated price 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.420
 segment of course also pay 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.090
 attention to spumatore device at 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 models of corruption Sayak he classic 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.979
 dipped in milk and whipped it when 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.320
 assistance to steam supplied as 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.380
 showed tests beating milk into foam 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.150
 this way you can easily get burned and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.240
 here 's a bosch coffee machine 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.890
 Emil is a cappuccinator arranged differently 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.990
 milk goes directly to 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.759
 steam channel where it is mixed with 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.040
 vapor pressure 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.799
 further the resulting milk foam 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.979
 falls into the cup this method is much 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.079
 more comfortable and more importantly safer panel 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.920
 controls can be with a display or 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.770
 change 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.680
 bosch coffee machine and emily then fit and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.810
 Whole grain and ground coffee and models 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.600
 Sayak's corruption is not so lucky 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.750
 possibility not provided a move can 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.420
 go only grains all these coupe cars 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.910
 know how to cook with the press and americans 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.010
 fully automatic mode but here 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.590
 special buttons for cappuccino or 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.680
 latte you won't find it here 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.600
 prerogative of more advanced and expensive 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.670
 models but facilitate the process 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.040
 cooking these drinks device 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.470
 still can for this and provided 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.620
 cappuccinator which knocks milk in 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.989
 foam in the process of test drive coffee machines 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.690
 will prepare for us with the press and coffee with 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.120
 milk whipped air foam us 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.130
 Atrid will be the consistency of the fortress and 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.769
 foam density from the press as well 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.989
 check the quality of the milk foam which 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.510
 It turns out that our devices have one more 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.299
 the goal is to find out which coffee machine is more 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.280
 clear and friendly by itself 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.250
 ingredients for all coffee machines we 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.200
 used the same first 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.260
 Cooking classic stress 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.600
 one of the indicators of its quality is good 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.359
 penny u properly prepared from 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.430
 press foam thickness from two to four 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.799
 millimeters it should be flat 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.260
 dense homogeneous beautiful golden 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.049
 pex hoo hue good press 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.750
 the foam lasts more than a minute and leaves 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.570
 rim on the wall of the cup optimal volume 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.489
 coffee 40 60 milliliters so that you can 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.859
 drink two or three sips 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.410
 Of course we also estimate the thickness 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.500
 the viscosity and aroma of the resulting coffee 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.340
 at the same time the simplicity of the cooking process 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.340
 now proceed to cooking 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.650
 milk froth in this case the main 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.989
 indicator is both about consistency and 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.420
 good foam density should be 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.000
 dense but at the same time airless 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.799
 large air bubbles draw 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.019
 note that only in coffee machines 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.079
 big Sayaka can be cooked 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.299
 full caffe latte in a tall glass 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.819
 the rest need to use capacity 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.280
 smaller sizes 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.680
 for the purity of the experiment we created 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.780
 focus group which was member 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.040
 asked to evaluate the quality of espresso 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.150
 milk foam 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.030
 as well as ease of use 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.400
 coffee machines models were hidden behind different 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.760
 rooms which are our impartial 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.560
 volunteers of course they knew the opinion 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.900
 focus group participants in the process 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.599
 definitions of better coffee parted 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.580
 most of the votes scored the car 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.160
 at number one she is express 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.680
 cooked and milk foam quality 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.169
 not pumped up turned tight and quite 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.449
 suitable for cappuccino or latte 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.639
 many of our tasters especially 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.729
 have allocated a coffee machine at number 3 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.830
 she was the easiest and most understandable 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.229
 In general, focus group participants noted 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.660
 which is quite decent with the press perhaps 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.210
 turned out in all four coffee machines 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.060
 But with milk foam and problems 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.740
 for example the quality of the milk foam which 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.490
 turned out at kruds leaves much to be 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.160
 the best 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.800
 she came out loose with large bubbles 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.229
 air did not like the espresso from the machines 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.419
 number one because he is more 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.699
 rich and fragrant turned out plus 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.909
 like my car so that she would 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.289
 easy to manage with one touch 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:12.620
 it turns out already ready immediately delicious coffee 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.220
 I liked the car number 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.610
 three 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.490
 Espresso seemed to me the most 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.009
 saturated in general I liked 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.169
 uhf machine control system number three 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.220
 It seemed to me the most convenient for 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.620
 in their places 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.320
 as for our expert opinion 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.900
 then we tend to allocate bosch coffee machine 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.419
 she liked all of us 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.849
 point cooked quality espresso 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.340
 whipped milk in excellent tight but 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.560
 however air milky foam 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.990
 also we appreciated the intuitiveness and and 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.300
 her management is comfortable and understandable 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.120
 system with text prompts and on 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.919
 display saeco coffee machine emil this too 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.889
 coped well with cooking 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.840
 press and milk foam but seemed to us 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.150
 less convenient to use 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.009
 but in the case of the krups coffee machine we 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.110
 ready to share our opinion 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.849
 volunteer tasters she 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.950
 really does not really 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.290
 quality 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.620
 scurrying foam though express quality 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.350
 we have no claims so the test leaders 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.500
 steel 2 coffee machines focus group gave 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.300
 preference saeco minuto but 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.490
 Our expertise showed that 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.400
 it is simpler to use coffee machines 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.080
 bosch and faith caffe latte she is more comfortable 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.000
 control systems are also more 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.850
 advanced and safe technology 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.040
 cooking milk foam this both 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.460
 models for brewed coffee and whipped 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.930
 milk froth got a great rating 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.540
