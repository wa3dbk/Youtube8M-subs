00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
though so I know it's kind of pointless

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.550 
though so I know it's kind of pointless
because<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.219> play<00:01:26.429> single-player<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.409> some<00:01:28.409> of

you might know I'm not good with the
whole<00:01:30.539> server<00:01:30.899> thing<00:01:31.289> so<00:01:32.130> yeah<00:01:33.319> it's

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
whole server thing so yeah it's

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.910 
whole server thing so yeah it's
pointless

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
pointless

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.029 
pointless
that's<00:01:35.429> my<00:01:35.639> dummy<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.929> cool<00:01:37.770> it's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
good but besides that yeah so I was

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.480 
good but besides that yeah so I was
