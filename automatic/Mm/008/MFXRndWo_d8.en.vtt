00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hi everyone, a question that the little ones 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.000
 always there is that I can use 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.250
 Can I use that? 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.660
 in fact there are a number of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.340
 tricks you can use when it comes to 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.500
 produce for you does not have to be 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.210
 always on top of high heels and are tips 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.890
 that will leave you with the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.890
 more longilineal silhouette 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.759
 talking to a shoe the ideal is you 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.410
 to use a more dug shoe not that one 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.420
 shoe will cut your cinnamon because the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.370
 more duck shoe will give the feeling of 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.629
 that your leg is longer but if you 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.000
 want to wear a boot the most 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.770
 tries to put on a pair of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.570
 color boot or if you had and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.210
 pantyhose put a shoe that is the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.489
 skin color that you can do is also 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.930
 always put monochromatic looks 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.590
 because the monochrome look will have 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.780
 place 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.190
 Now if you really like the picture, I 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.770
 I love this picture, I can live without 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.480
 Choices we're not paying 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.070
 it was too large that the proportion 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.409
 will not favor 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.090
 Another tip is to show the maximum skin 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.729
 that you can then if you are with the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.180
 shirt left open here shows a little 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.610
 fist or always choose the V - neck 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.820
 the marked waist also lengthens your 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.520
 leg up to that height super favors 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.159
 if you like skirt choose the skirt or 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.560
 very short or very long you too 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.850
 can put the jump down or if it is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.409
 the shortest skirt 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.220
 You can put a shoe in the color of the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.570
 skin or the tip of the most dug shoe 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.670
 another thing that people are 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.310
 doubt about hair hair 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.500
 too long will flatten if you're fine 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.329
 Shorty is cool you have hair or 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.220
 shorter or until at shoulder height 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.020
 so you can stretch 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.790
 here in this region and when it comes to choosing 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.070
 the accessory the same thing if you have 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.720
 a very large bag you will look like 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.030
 smaller even then if you are the most 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.770
 Shorty chooses a klamt a purse a 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.399
 little more discreet than this will be 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.399
 very cool 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:05.939
