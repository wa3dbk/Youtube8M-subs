00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.490
 99 and thus a hearty one again 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.470
 Welcome here to a new one 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.460
 server presentation on ochs kreft 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.019
 network so I got me two days 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.250
 or so ever video uploaded and 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.470
 today comes the next one 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.600
 I'm currently in the lobby and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.779
 Today I present the topic before 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.240
 that's back there we're running 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.699
 still directly and does you 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.529
 a bit and sky pvp preferred 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.800
 I feel so kind and clear 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.989
 once more things are doing 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.690
 after all, so sky pvp I've already got that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.770
 once presented but now here without 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.989
 any people that means I have it 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.550
 yes there was presented by jon leyne and 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.329
 it's online now and i'll put it to myself 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.860
 so good little bit ahead 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.079
 So as I said now here 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.700
 different kits but the zombie kit 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.949
 this consists of a diamond armor 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.079
 and your own skeleton sword 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.910
 this consists of a complete chain 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.129
 Armor a bow and a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.570
 infinite arrow the script package 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.070
 consists of a leather armor which 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 dyed green is what but not right now 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.180
 on the lawn and tecdax can see and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.310
 a diamond makes the premium kit difficult 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.380
 includes a diamond armor and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.060
 a diamond sword and shield on the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.299
 Colorful dyed leather armor and one 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.920
 wooden sword with not back 2 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.060
 I will get the premium kit because 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.560
 it is most favorable for me now 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.920
 so that I can do some kills and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.100
 not everything is from like, and yes we 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.060
 talk down here and catch a few 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.619
 kill people 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.810
 Unfortunately I have no sound 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.700
 a little stupid aldi are that extreme 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.619
 many people we simply cut the schnitzel 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.659
 So a little way off here 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.759
 practiced the skype pvp a bit before I did 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.259
 I want the video so bad 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.770
 But I'm just what it looks like 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.360
 I 'm okay bums okay okay okay 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.460
 okay rabbit want the hard 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.149
 tour three times better so starts too 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.979
 fuck everyday 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.119
 I have to I think the sound has tied 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.530
 So you should shit a little 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.649
 because otherwise here without sound is one 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.750
 a bit boring and I'm always 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:01.399
 sound sound hard for me because I have that 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.440
 namely always switched off via a pc 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:09.300
 so music 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:12.120
 hacker actually too louder quieter so 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.950
 I think it works so kripo kit 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.380
 no i want the premium pils and such 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 jump down and now it's on 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.660
 new with sound this time also belonged 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.490
 already in beautiful bow sound her rock 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.610
 their plants even attacked is not 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:49.140
 theme of make or amazon.de you 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:50.490
 I say to that only I am okay we have 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.450
 now also gets a few points here 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.010
 150 so much area manning 5 ok you can 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.750
 we can buy something that you content 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:06.990
 ranked but not so much now where 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:08.100
 you know ill never know and now that 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.410
 just had to celebrate a bit 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.120
 the healing potion of course after after 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.330
 She has chosen the team 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.400
 of you after the buy after we do that 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.290
 so that for the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.590
 action days killed and he will 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.540
 straight from shadow girlie fucked cello 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.680
 geographic location two people go 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.880
 this is good for me 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.410
 still positive are just times 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.510
 skeleton fit that I still a bit 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.140
 flying the arc, we have one now 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.190
 away with it 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:48.260
 all that back down box dc100 500 kills 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.989
 Almost that's young, it's the one 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:57.630
 just like that took a keel judo rom 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:04.550
 good plaster for per euro fins than 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:06.810
 them off the socom easy as 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.460
 so it's so exciting the video though 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.080
 you can just die over it 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.210
 a little time will be missing so well 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.770
 I want the king in the pvp but 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:19.110
 weak ackermann easy double 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:25.070
 that's how you do it and this video serves 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:29.610
 just to cover that every cooler here 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:34.130
 fantastic single 1 comcom cocker 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:45.240
 I German yes that he constantly so after 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:46.890
 chance for a new try and therefore 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.810
 It's just not that easy now 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.560
 we can now find the fact I find 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.560
 I downstairs 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.350
 I have practiced but I have not 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.460
 good thing I here 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.420
 ok I think I'll leave that with me now 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.030
 the video here because I do not want it 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.100
 missing again and only seen that is 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.270
 In any case, the pvp bock it 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.650
 get four points again 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.300
 Loskill us here from the points can 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.130
 you guys then buy things here 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.810
 but a little tip buys you the thing 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.410
 after her child have chosen 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.540
 It's gone and it's often already 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.550
 many people in the pvp like it 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.100
 those who are straight and just said 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.600
 stop by and I'm here 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.770
 You will also find them more often 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.290
 The next few days when I have time 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.300
 have such a real montage here 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.880
 When was I just read the wall 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.800
 but montage upload by skype eva 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.060
 peters somehow make such a few pils 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.340
 But I do that about every ten years 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.750
 times by making me also wants to 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.060
 will do so every ten years kill 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.160
 and if I'm bored too much 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.840
 for the issue evt wallis box already for 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.520
 in between and it will be here 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.880
 of course new things come to mind 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.890
 for example tips tricks wetz am 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.120
 Weekend will be during the week 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.010
 also make guest but not by doing so 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.220
 so much time at the weekend on each 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.030
 case it will give killstreaks he will 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.620
 Also a bit like gun game 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.430
 that means come office 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.169
 kill a few items and even more 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.400
 other things still look like me 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.840
 however, I will insert everything 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.280
 here still in the falklands insert 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.560
 can use it to make their own clans 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.780
 So small mini battles 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.580
 can host skype pvp and me 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.530
 would be the next weeks but 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.560
 new pvp come here on this 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.590
 server that's like if i'm the surf 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.520
 pvp or pve pvp out gonna do that here 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.169
 I do not know that anyway 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.210
 is still on the liveserver on it 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.030
 that maybe i will hardcore pvp 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.490
 definitely do it here, too 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.379
 but that's so ne beta first 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.150
 look how the word arrives so even 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:41.699
 the sky pvp itself comes in any case 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.750
 So here are 18 people in here 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.000
 looks a little bit looks 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.500
 but the others are here just in 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.860
 a course in another lobby 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.360
 in it 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.639
 So give again briefly in the hard 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.990
 crisis , too, many people in it 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.289
 The goalkeeper on the band comes on top of everyone 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.370
 very good, so better than expected 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:59.520
 could see then we stop by 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.710
 the ip swarovski meet de and then 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.969
 have fun and the next days 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.789
 or the day after tomorrow then comes 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:08.300
 a video about the creative or the 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:08.300
 doubt
