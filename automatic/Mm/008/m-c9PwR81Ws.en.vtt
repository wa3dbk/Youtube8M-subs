00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.980 
picking a different character will give
you<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.130> different<00:01:36.400> intro<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.390> an<00:01:37.600> ending<00:01:37.930> for

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
each character so if you're interesting

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.020 
each character so if you're interesting
anime<00:01:41.110> cutscenes<00:01:41.830> you<00:01:42.310> get<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:42.970> the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
anime cutscenes you get that and the

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.820 
anime cutscenes you get that and the
story<00:01:43.300> is<00:01:43.390> decent<00:01:43.929> in<00:01:44.110> terms<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.590> fighting

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
story is decent in terms of a fighting

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.710 
story is decent in terms of a fighting
game<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.280> since<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:45.940> is<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.090> fighter<00:01:46.479> it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
game and since it is a fighter it

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.480 
game and since it is a fighter it
doesn't<00:01:47.020> really<00:01:47.110> emphasize<00:01:47.979> on<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.250> story

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
doesn't really emphasize on the story

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.249 
doesn't really emphasize on the story
much<00:01:48.759> so<00:01:49.179> it's<00:01:49.330> not<00:01:49.420> really<00:01:49.479> fair<00:01:49.869> if<00:01:49.990> i<00:01:50.080> take

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
much so it's not really fair if i take

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.840 
much so it's not really fair if i take
too<00:01:50.320> many<00:01:50.560> points<00:01:50.979> away<00:01:51.160> so<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.520> story<00:01:51.789> is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
too many points away so the story is

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.600 
too many points away so the story is
decent<00:01:52.240> for<00:01:52.270> what<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:52.600> does

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.359 

still<00:01:58.610> no<00:01:58.820> use<00:01:59.770> return<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:00.799> all<00:02:01.130> to

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
still no use return it all to

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.990 
still no use return it all to
nothingness

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.270 

faster<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:11.260> graphics<00:02:11.530> are<00:02:11.830> great<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.130> this

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
faster the graphics are great in this

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.460 
faster the graphics are great in this
game<00:02:12.460> in<00:02:12.640> my<00:02:12.760> opinion<00:02:12.990> everything<00:02:13.990> feels<00:02:14.260> like

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
game in my opinion everything feels like

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.130 
game in my opinion everything feels like
a<00:02:14.590> 2d<00:02:14.980> fighter<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.730> everything<00:02:16.150> looks<00:02:16.180> 3d

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
a 2d fighter but everything looks 3d

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.960 
a 2d fighter but everything looks 3d
including<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.800> backgrounds<00:02:18.460> two<00:02:18.580> fighters

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
including the backgrounds two fighters

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.060 
including the backgrounds two fighters
two<00:02:19.180> finishers<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:19.840> some<00:02:20.320> special<00:02:20.770> moves<00:02:20.920> you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
two finishers and some special moves you

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.620 
two finishers and some special moves you
can<00:02:21.190> pull<00:02:21.400> off<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.790> game<00:02:21.940> so<00:02:22.150> everything

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
can pull off in the game so everything

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.810 
can pull off in the game so everything
looks<00:02:22.660> great<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.530> also<00:02:23.680> have<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.250> anime

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
looks great you also have the anime

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.340 
looks great you also have the anime
cutscenes<00:02:25.060> for<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.600> beginning<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.080> ending
