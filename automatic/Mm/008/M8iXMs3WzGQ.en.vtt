it's the Dell Vostro 35 55 and the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.090 
it's the Dell Vostro 35 55 and the
biggest<00:00:14.610> feature<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.240> laptop<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.859> has

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
biggest feature of this laptop is it has

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.910 
biggest feature of this laptop is it has
the<00:00:17.400> new<00:00:17.550> chip<00:00:17.820> from<00:00:18.119> AMD<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:19.050> called<00:00:19.380> an<00:00:19.529> APU

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the new chip from AMD it's called an APU

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.120 
the new chip from AMD it's called an APU
which<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.060> an<00:00:21.210> accelerated<00:00:21.990> processor<00:00:22.710> unit

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
which is an accelerated processor unit

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.340 
which is an accelerated processor unit
and<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> give<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.840> discreet

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and this is going to give you discreet

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.679 
and this is going to give you discreet
level<00:00:25.680> graphics<00:00:26.250> built<00:00:26.640> into<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> processor

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
level graphics built into the processor

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.589 
level graphics built into the processor
chip<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.710> start<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.550> AMD<00:00:29.939> vision

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
chip so start out with the AMD vision

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.920 
chip so start out with the AMD vision
processor<00:00:31.349> that's<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.769> t2<00:00:32.160> series<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.899> is

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
processor that's a t2 series and that is

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.400 
processor that's a t2 series and that is

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the APU accelerated processor unit and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.250 
the APU accelerated processor unit and
this<00:00:38.040> actually<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:38.760> an<00:00:39.120> equivalent<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> 60

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
this actually has an equivalent of a 60

see but the speakers which are under the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.680 
see but the speakers which are under the
computer<00:04:36.639> there<00:04:37.639> is<00:04:37.669> actually<00:04:38.150> two<00:04:38.180> of<00:04:38.510> them

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
computer there is actually two of them

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.690 
computer there is actually two of them
so<00:04:39.200> a<00:04:39.229> lot<00:04:39.560> of<00:04:39.680> times<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:40.070> boats<00:04:40.250> rows<00:04:40.580> only

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
so a lot of times the boats rows only

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.450 
so a lot of times the boats rows only
came<00:04:41.060> with<00:04:41.270> one<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:42.290> that's<00:04:42.919> a<00:04:43.010> nice<00:04:43.160> feature

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
came with one and that's a nice feature

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.300 
came with one and that's a nice feature
so<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.880> has<00:04:44.030> great<00:04:44.300> sound<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:45.620> on<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.160> very

might require more graphics and

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.240 
might require more graphics and
integrated<00:05:17.990> this<00:05:18.500> is<00:05:18.680> going<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.860> be<00:05:18.950> a<00:05:18.979> great
