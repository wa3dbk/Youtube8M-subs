00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 very good to all handsome and Bogotanos and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.740
 until Xavi diary and is here 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.720
 as you are watching with the machine gun 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.519
 light as you see nothing else to start is a 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.380
 I do not stop, I 've been three in a row 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.030
 here is the room leaves me reddish 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.740
 but the next one I will expose even more 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.330
 still I'm going to try to finish 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.760
 chain of casualties to see if it comes out but at 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.590
 final does not end up leaving just coming out 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.760
 well that a low turbo that is five 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.180
 downs followed as you are seeing in 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.680
 screen 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.689
 Let's see if I'm ever going out 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.090
 with the shrapnel of light is pretty 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.130
 see easy or if not with the shotgun because 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.630
 you have enough ammo or kill of few 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.130
 bullets will you tell me for the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.590
 comments that you prefer for the chain 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 of casualties and demolition or land war 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.239
 what do you have that surely 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.559
 many of you have taken some 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.260
 low chain or something like that 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.989
 you can surely put it to me so that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.550
 I tried to get this clip and good 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.860
 Well, everyone, as you are watching, I am 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 playing ammo in overflow you must 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.739
 know that here he tried to plant the rubber 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.469
 but well I realize that I was 1 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.170
 so pretty pretty good those 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.059
 reflexes are going to see that I'm with the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.800
 shrapnel lightly with the sight of the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.359
 red dot looks at the reflection that is the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.250
 final they give you basically and the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.600
 silencer that goes pretty well the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.130
 I tried without a silencer 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.590
 basically the difference is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.990
 practically null and good I recommend you 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060
 a lot these weapons but you take them 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 with white finder and silencer 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.600
 like a lot of people keeping that always 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.990
 is with that in the corners surely 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.640
 many of us feel 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.710
 identified with these people that we 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.360
 they kill always but you will not see here 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.190
 the fish against which the water is without 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.390
 want is you are going to see that one appears to you 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.710
 I killed him once 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.539
 devised on the chance that good 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.850
 reappear once I had already 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.590
 more you wanted to kill vis not but 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.289
 no it will not be like that he killed him three times 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.170
 followed that is incredible but you see that 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.659
 I'm going to cut this nuclear although 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.759
 come out in just three minutes and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.409
 medium something like this the video was nuclear is 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.119
 rather longer and the problem is that 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.130
 it is always going to end up 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.630
 items arrives because in this case there is no 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.490
 puts assemblies or something like that but 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.740
 because we are always pulling them 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.869
 climbs schatz ipeem and such and just stayed 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.220
 one at the end and then more 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.380
 people and it gets a little more dynamic 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.810
 this game but you saw yesterday the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.850
 video although I did more of mission with 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.869
 about 113 casualties in a game that is 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.090
 pretty good, I recommend that you 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.440
 happen and if you see an audio error or 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.030
 something for style is that I was not 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.830
 on the same site almost always 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.880
 then I failed that but let's not 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.250
 do not worry because the following 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.810
 videos will be everything perfectly and nothing 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.030
 to all who vote you are therefore 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.620
 thank you very much if you vote this video 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.740
 more so because you already know that in 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.630
 youtube there are very few nuclear of good 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.610
 I always have only the nuclear part is 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.990
 in the Spanish community and there is no such 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.090
 many nuclear with wings also in the 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.580
 light or at least that I have seen and 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.990
 Well, I recommend you that I vote and 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.420
 yes, talk to me 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.860
 It has helped me a lot because you know 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.270
 that we are nothing to about 30 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.040
 subscribers or so to reach the 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.450
 20,000 subscribers so many 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.220
 thank you all for doing this 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.130
 possible to see if we are just getting to 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.870
 those 20,000 and yes and good to see how many 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.360
 we got more than six that if you share my 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.800
 channel with your colleagues and that therefore 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.810
 so you do that every one grows a little 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.280
 more and these is that it costs us nothing to vote 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.160
 the video you already know that they are for it 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.780
 follow a second there for me is a 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.280
 surprise that you pull me in the face and 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.020
 good as you are going to see inside nothing is going to 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.280
 get the nuclear of average meter by 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.660
 this little house and I see that they are coming out 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.580
 everyone out there with the whatsapp that 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.380
 we had pull does nothing and I will kill 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.030
 this one and I was to touch one that was 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.500
 willing I do not know if in active waiting for 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.340
 that someone appeared a month to taiana 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.900
 nuclear bully 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.700
 and well I'm going to kill myself to see if I 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.530
 it comes out nuclear but it does not end up coming out 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.970
 inside nothing I will upload another nuclear double 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.970
 let me out if we get to 1000
