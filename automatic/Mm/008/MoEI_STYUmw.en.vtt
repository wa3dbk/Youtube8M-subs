00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.260
 on the phone 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.770
 of course they are going to have to have 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.380

 scÃºtaro 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.460
 and if the application recognized the phone 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.750
 here I will have to see him give a port with 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.750
 the buoy 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:14.250

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:36.160
 the team and granted him the port with 5 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.060
