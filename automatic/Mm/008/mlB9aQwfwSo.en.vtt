00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 about yourself wrong with the size of the scandal 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.430
 Sverdlovsk region there for several years 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.049
 ago mazda 108 cars were built 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.940
 Million state rubles a day 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.920
 it turned out the object is not only to build 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.840
 with violations of the law so also not going anywhere 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.619
 It fits in size Malyutin Ponomarev 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.480
 continue this bridge across the river property 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.490
 until recently, the pride of Sverdlovsk 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.380
 governments and a prime example of the eternal 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.769
 Russian wanted to get better how 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.720
 is always 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.580
 and you built to link the distant 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.410
 villages with large permanent land 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.410
 ferry waiting for many years 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.410
 not bad 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.050
 torn from faith were winter summer winter 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.680
 autumn winter autumn crossing we will wait 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.180
 until the ice passes open in December 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.760
 past year officials reported 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.160
 successfully your at 108 million budget 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.899
 rubles how successful is the controversial issue 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.210
 summed up in the transport prosecutor's office 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.370
 departments filed a claim 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.649
 design rebuild project authors 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.930
 built a bridge too low forgot 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.739
 consider that the river is navigable and about it 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.140
 remember well 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.580
 the builders local gres in the river will not 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.439
 equipment for building new 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.140
 modern narga block possessed 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.770
 I'll figure it out cook are in storage 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.729
 germany 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.140
 so of course if we don't go need 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.420
 will develop a new delivery scheme 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.210
 This equipment is very difficult and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.280
 very expensive, and it will rise in price of about 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.560
 Here stands in the way of a complex scheme 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.899
 carriage of cargo carried by the ocean and the sea as much 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.850
 from dutch rotterdam then network 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.009
 Russian rivers to the village Sosva 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.869
 and that's 30 kilometers to the end brain 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.979
 and he says carriers to them literally 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.020
 across the throat 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.850
 regional officials justify the pier 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.789
 ships in fact no longer go and 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.360
 try to build bridges with merchants 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.880
 road administration 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.329
 considering the possibility of dismantling 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.189
 the bridge at the time of transportation of cargo we know 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.709
 what is required in 1 moment on 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.579
 one-time provoz of this is not some 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.380
 periodic shipping operations but 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.420
 This question is only considered at the moment. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.799
 this condition and cargo carriers agree 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.599
 that's what the old man will do 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.969
 used for trucking more often 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.890
 question open rebuild the bridge and 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.079
 to make it adjustable too expensive 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.150
 the main thing officials say is that people with 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.560
 constant communication with the mainland on 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.180
 how long will it be durable 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.180
 unknown trial for this 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.730
 the case has just begun at once but 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.139
 the bridge is likely to be disassembled like this 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.269
 nobody knows yet 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:26.639
 design right david so on 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.680
 it is clear that this idea seems impossible 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.049
 the locals meanwhile are ready 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.389
 change to forgotten transport for 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.880
 ferries and already telling the ferry to the cheeks 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.590
 dry oars it is too early oxides 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.690
 telling her cabbage trend 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.530
 Sverdlovsk region 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.530
 Russia
