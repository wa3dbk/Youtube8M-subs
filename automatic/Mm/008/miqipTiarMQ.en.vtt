00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.639
 hello everyone hello everyone how are you is 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.710
 a pleasure as always to greet you and in 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.340
 this occasion presents you with a very 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.830
 obviously devoted to dominoes if 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.110
 They want to see how I made this design very 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.990
 simple as always you want to see the 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.960
 video see you soon this is the material 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.600
 that uses everything is from the line signature already 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.460
 They know that I love these glazes and 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.000
 The most important thing is to start with the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.940
 clean nails completely dry and with a 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.739
 transparent enamel base 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.460
 preferably nutritious in this case and 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.699
 use this strengthener with keratin 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.490
 and then apply two layers of 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.920
 this glaze so white so bright 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.940
 next with the black enamel but 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.230
 with a very finite brush 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.620
 I started doing the lines 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.600
 in an approximate half of the nail 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.950
 given the length they have at this time 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.229
 now it is very appropriate and what 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.800
 I took it easy first to mark the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.140
 line and then complete them 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.420
 they did not fit me, but I did 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.009
 the best I could 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.110
 then with a silver-gray enamel 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.680
 represent that it is number 100 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.290
 represents the balls the screws that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.420
 they have dominoes in the center 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.960
 in this way here they can occupy 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.790
 you a brush a pointer something that 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.680
 give them the diameter to do this 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.560
 sphere to the center of the black lines 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.560
 with the same black enamel I'm going to make 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.330
 the dots and here it is optional every 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.300
 who can make them as you prefer 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.220
 I decided to represent the chips that 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.960
 they have the points 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.530
 the 1 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.770
 3 4 and 5 you can represent the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.780
 chips that prefer the domino and the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.000
 truth is that it is very very simple very 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.490
 very easy they can occupy the same pointer 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.440
 and you say give you a tip more or less 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.110
 thick a thick ball for what 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.480
 each one of the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.130
 points of fact I was thinking that if 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.370
 would have been thicker would have been 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.530
 better but hey this is how was this 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.260
 it's the final result I hope that you 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.689
 has been to your liking totally 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.000
 I await your suggestions and your comments 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:42.079
 with pleasure and see you in the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.760
 next video until soon and do not forget 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.520

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.940
