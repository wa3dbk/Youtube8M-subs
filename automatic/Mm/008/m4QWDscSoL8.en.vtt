00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.120
 powerful in the cabin and the 31 where the

 time to spend this this moment

 many for being and has shown a little 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.200
 at other times the story is three 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.689
 years approximately the band is coming 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.939
 real and you come with new ideas see 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.409
 new projects 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.419
 like that the boys also like the 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.699
 following this year, they have already 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.799
 rested by antonio that also a 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:34.590
 place is of the office they are charging 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.269
 invoice scope I do not but already with these 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.310
 vacations that we throw of five or 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.310
 ten not four days and we're always 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.590
 starting work 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.980
 I want to give a very special greeting to 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.050
 for the people I was good at when 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.050
 really for the friend fernando navarro 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.420
 that as long as we always have the 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.410
 opportunity to be with one of the band 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.420
 real whether or not you are on vacation or 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.310
 is changing he did not claim that the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.310
 day of the presentation of the disc 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:35.190
 it's a commitment to see this February the 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:40.669
 Real band thanks to God four years 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.669
 and surely there we go 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:58.290
 I have to do what I have to accommodate 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:04.950
 because in four years it's easy to say 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:08.370
 but I think that when something does not cost you 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.360
 work when something is not enjoyed by the 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.910
 way 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.800
 between the good the bad the richest 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.400
 and right now we are already starting 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.230
 to god this one, if it is valued and 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.240
 feel movements is when louis 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.100
 a friend grows the band has gone 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.130
 developing step by step and little to 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.440
 little and then I tell you just what is it 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.830
 bad which is what the subject should be for 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.540
 consolation 12 issues that we say goodbye in this 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.940
 2014 to give entrance to a new 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.470

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.950
 forward is a little hectic for you 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.080
 I also dance and I know well 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.670

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.650

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.510

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.330

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:19.430
 song that I can tell you the most and apart 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.430
