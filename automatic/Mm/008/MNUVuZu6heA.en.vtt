00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
let's say investors I'll do the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.030 
let's say investors I'll do the
investors<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.600> orange<00:01:04.140> company<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.710> this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
investors in this orange company in this

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.710 
investors in this orange company in this
orange<00:01:05.400> color<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.030> investors<00:01:06.479> are

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
orange color so the investors are

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.990 
orange color so the investors are
lending<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> money<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.400> companies<00:01:08.790> give

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
lending the money the companies give

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.420 
lending the money the companies give
them<00:01:09.210> interest<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.290> investors<00:01:10.890> lending<00:01:11.310> money

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
them interest so investors lending money

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
them interest so investors lending money
giving<00:01:12.060> interest<00:01:12.420> lending<00:01:12.960> money<00:01:13.080> giving

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
giving interest lending money giving

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.039 
giving interest lending money giving
interest<00:01:14.010> lending<00:01:14.970> money<00:01:15.180> giving<00:01:15.659> interest

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
interest lending money giving interest

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.350 
interest lending money giving interest
and<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.740> these<00:01:16.920> investors<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.759> seems<00:01:18.150> pretty

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and then these investors it seems pretty

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.120 
and then these investors it seems pretty
reasonable<00:01:18.600> say<00:01:18.990> hey<00:01:19.140> look<00:01:19.350> there's<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> guy

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
get the bad debt and in exchange they'll

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.520 
get the bad debt and in exchange they'll
make<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.850> other<00:02:39.150> side<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.110> credit

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
make the other side of the credit

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
will pay them make them whole and so

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.660 
will pay them make them whole and so
this<00:02:45.540> could<00:02:45.810> take<00:02:46.200> them<00:02:46.560> out<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.860> business<00:02:47.220> and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
get credit default swaps really as just
