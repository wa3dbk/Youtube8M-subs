 hello kitchens welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.640
 from laura I am Laura and this is my 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.110
 kitchen today we are going to cook liver of 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.039
 breaded veal 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.039
 The ingredients we need are 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.570
 fillets of veal liver a dish 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:28.740
 bread an egg 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.760
 a little garlic and parsley finely chopped 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.760
 and olive oil 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.120
 we beat the egg 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.540
 we have sprinkled all the garlic and parsley 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.910
 on both sides of the fillets and 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.700
 so now we pass them first by 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.100
 the egg 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.100
 and then for the bread crumbs 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.350
 and we reserve it in a separate dish 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.490
 we light the fire and put a fire 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.180
 a little strong and we put a pan that 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.850
 It has about half a centimeter of oil 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.009
 olive and wait for it to warm up 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.070
 when the oil is hot we go 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.320
 putting our breaded fillets and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.320
 we let them be done on both sides 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.040
 We give them back and let it 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.040
 do also on the other side 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.710
 and once they have already been done by the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.570
 two sides put them on a tray 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.080
 some kitchen paper or paper 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.680
 absorbent to release the oil 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.110
 what's left good kitchens well 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.979
