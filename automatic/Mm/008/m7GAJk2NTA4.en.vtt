a<00:00:21.330> game<00:00:21.480> plan<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:22.020> actually<00:00:22.439> no<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.740> didn't

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
a game plan like actually no we didn't

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.490 
a game plan like actually no we didn't
think<00:00:23.100> about<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.550> much<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.140> after<00:00:25.140> pics<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
think about it much but after pics and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.990 
think about it much but after pics and
buys<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.859> had<00:00:26.010> like<00:00:26.130> something<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.609> mind<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
buys we had like something in mind and

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.550 
buys we had like something in mind and
it<00:00:27.119> worked<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.869> knew<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:27.990> physics

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
it worked out like we knew that physics

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.980 
it worked out like we knew that physics
is<00:00:28.650> super<00:00:29.609> weak<00:00:29.789> if<00:00:30.000> he<00:00:30.210> won<00:00:30.390> gets<00:00:30.599> already

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
is super weak if he won gets already

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.659 
is super weak if he won gets already
snowball<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> line<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.430> kind<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
snowball on the line so it just kind of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.880 
snowball on the line so it just kind of
lane<00:00:32.820> swap<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:33.809> played<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.469> they

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
lane swap and they played it like they

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
lane swap and they played it like they
like<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.579> wanted<00:00:35.880> them<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.180> play<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.630> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
like we wanted them to play it and it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.270 
like we wanted them to play it and it

on the car stage was talking about the
lack<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.600> wave<00:00:45.989> clear<00:00:46.320> from<00:00:46.710> origin<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
lack of wave clear from origin is that

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.010 
lack of wave clear from origin is that
something<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.120> guys<00:00:48.149> thought<00:00:48.480> about<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.870> well

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
he didn't really think about it but we

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.360 
he didn't really think about it but we
kind<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.140> had<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.739> wanted<00:00:53.010> pretty<00:00:53.219> much

just was so perfect yeah and you
pinpoint<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> fizz<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.140> course<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.650> your

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
pinpoint the fizz of course you and your

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.039 
pinpoint the fizz of course you and your
Rumble<00:01:14.070> versus<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> fizz<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.900> last

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049

Rumble versus the fizz and in the last
couple<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.350> games<00:01:16.409> you've<00:01:16.740> had<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> hard<00:01:16.979> time

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
couple of games you've had a hard time

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.440 
couple of games you've had a hard time
because<00:01:17.369> people<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.729> been<00:01:17.850> focusing<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
because people have been focusing you a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
better at adapting and fighting yourself

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.539 
better at adapting and fighting yourself
back<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> way<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.560> different<00:01:23.040> ways<00:01:23.250> how<00:01:23.460> do

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
back in the way in different ways how do

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.190 
back in the way in different ways how do
you<00:01:23.640> think<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> did<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.299> game<00:01:24.509> well<00:01:25.080> in
