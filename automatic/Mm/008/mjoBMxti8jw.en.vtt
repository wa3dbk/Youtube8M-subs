00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:19.869
 Four pink one riding a traditional Philippine Bangka fly to the table 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.960
 The fishing circle is a fun 10 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:27.310
 There were so many moonlight points in the Philippines 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.939
 I can see the clear sea all the time, 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.939
 I was in good mood 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.510

 I had never enjoyed before diving in Four fall, then dive 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.079
 I was able to enjoy snorkeling in a decent area though it was not until 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.760
 But if there was a bit of a problem, the water speed was clear, but the coral 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.460
 Other tropical fish were not many. 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.490
 If you want to enjoy marine sports properly 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.490
 It is also recommended to enjoy diving points in Boracay or Palawan 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.350
 Getting into the water, because the middle of the sea rather than a beach snorkeling 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.260
 Travelers also looked scared of some 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.310
 But the local staff who went on the hopping tour 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.460
 You can safely enjoy the hopping tour because you will be watching from side to side throughout the swim. 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.460
 There is

 After the sea fishing and ripening, you will have a meal at the Islamic recreation temple. 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:05.920
 The meal was more enjoyable than the meals I had while enjoying traditional performances that were busy the day before . 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.510
 I have to tip for a show that I do not really care about, and the meals are very satisfying. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.890
 It was 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:16.330
 After dinner we went back to the resort at night. 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.590
