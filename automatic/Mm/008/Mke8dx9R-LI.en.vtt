00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.240 
but the the pin construction is very
loose<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.890> how<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.100> came

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
loose like it this is how it came

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.359 
loose like it this is how it came
originally<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.000> there's<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> lot<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.750> play<00:01:55.369> you

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
originally and there's a lot of play you

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.060 
originally and there's a lot of play you
see<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:56.820> when<00:01:57.000> these<00:01:57.530> these<00:01:58.530> wobble<00:01:58.950> back

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
see here when these these wobble back

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.999 
see here when these these wobble back
and<00:01:59.100> forth<00:01:59.719> so<00:02:00.719> originally<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.500> very<00:02:01.740> loose

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and forth so originally it's very loose

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.069 
and forth so originally it's very loose
but<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.700> hasn't<00:02:03.030> gotten<00:02:03.180> looser<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.960> me

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
but it's it hasn't gotten looser for me

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.170 
but it's it hasn't gotten looser for me
playing<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.969> know<00:02:06.000> it's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180
