00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.140
 weather 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.259

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:08.110
 here we have what it is 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.680
 let's do 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.680

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.850

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.880
 take out we also have this again 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.050
 we have games that I do not know what we do 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.330
 or as a melee style 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:12.230
 we already have a clippers signature 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.230
 of pickman 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.680
 big man 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:26.630

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.870
 zombie 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.010
 spider and spider 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.010
 is that both 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:44.490
 and I love that 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.120
 how 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.120
 as a post 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.420
 we have 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.569
 of this 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.569
 6 there are new flowers and plants 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.500
 and more we have down here 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.410
 to this that I do not know what it is I'm not 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.070
 safe 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.070
 also 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.620
 yes 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:26.150
 then leaves 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.150
 It is a 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.900
 and that's the whole infinite world 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.820
 it leaves a little always 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:05:01.100
 for her then it looks a bit 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.100
 here is a cave here 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.780
 there it seems to me 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.740
 and they were low 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.790
 if we continue to create 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.790
 the same 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.480
 he goes from breeding the world to him 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.950
 and the grass is as darker the 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:42.310
 trees also takes place 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.280
 a day I'm not sure if there's why 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.940
 to the truth of what I have been playing 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.940
 I have not seen any 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.480
 That's all good and hopefully there will 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.480
 liked 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.020
