00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
chicken to that masala later so you have

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.750 
chicken to that masala later so you have
a<00:02:12.370> part<00:02:12.790> here<00:02:13.120> just<00:02:14.310> adding<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> little<00:02:15.490> bit<00:02:15.610> of

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.340 
so you can see that I haven't added too
much<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.550> water<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.480> water's<00:02:26.200> not

almost 3/4 cooked so I'm going to leave

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.990 
almost 3/4 cooked so I'm going to leave
this<00:04:45.470> really<00:04:45.920> clear<00:04:46.100> that's<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.490> stop<00:04:46.760> a

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
this really clear that's the stop a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.550 
this really clear that's the stop a
little<00:04:47.270> bit<00:04:47.390> I've<00:04:47.570> left<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:48.050> retain<00:04:48.380> the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
little bit I've left to retain the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.950 
little bit I've left to retain the
little<00:04:48.860> with<00:04:49.100> tea<00:04:49.340> or<00:04:49.370> masala<00:04:50.030> on<00:04:50.150> it<00:04:50.300> let's

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
little with tea or masala on it let's

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.780 
little with tea or masala on it let's
this<00:04:51.140> gives<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.860> nice<00:04:52.100> punch

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
this gives you a nice punch

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.360 
this gives you a nice punch
so<00:04:53.180> you<00:04:53.240> wouldn't<00:04:53.540> want<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.840> completely<00:04:54.370> dry

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
so you wouldn't want to completely dry

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.990 
so you wouldn't want to completely dry
it<00:04:55.430> up<00:04:55.670> then<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:56.480> might<00:04:56.660> become<00:04:56.900> too<00:04:57.050> dry<00:04:58.000> so

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
it up then it might become too dry so

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.400 
it up then it might become too dry so
now<00:04:59.150> what<00:04:59.480> I'm<00:04:59.570> going<00:04:59.780> to<00:04:59.810> do<00:04:59.930> is<00:05:00.080> I'm<00:05:00.230> going<00:05:00.350> to
