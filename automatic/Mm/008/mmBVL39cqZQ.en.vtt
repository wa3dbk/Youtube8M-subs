00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello friends following with my tutorials how to use the field like this to study 7 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.760
 today I will teach you how to put a very good effect glass cursor something 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.109
 different from what they have already seen 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:15.319
 for which before recording your video are going to otzi euros effects 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:20.119
 in the cursor tab do not pay attention to all these options and mark in this 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.130
 box 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.230
 and well, I will only record part of my screen 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.989
 click on rec to start recording 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.850
 once finished recording as you already know how I taught it in the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 preview you keep the engraving 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.130
 finished this part now we will go to sing cia to see what interests us 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 We click on amount through and look for what we recorded 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.220
 we drag it to the timeline and choose the dimensions of its video 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.149
 now we click on course defects 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.149
 and here you will see different options to add bush 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.930
 for example here you can modify the size of your course 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.270
 make it giant if they want 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.810
 down here you can choose the shadow of the pointer the classic circle 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.620
 yellow 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.340
 or this light effect 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.390
 I will show you better 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 as they see it darkens the whole area and gives a light effect around the cursor 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.450
 very good 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.240
 there is also another type of shadow the magnify gives a zuma effect 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.740
 around the cursor 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.540
 best of all, these effects in the shadow of the cursor can be 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.040
 personalize 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.310
 We can resize the yellow circle 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.750
 also the level of opacity 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
 as well as the level of blurring of the shadow 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.700
 We can also change the color for our greatest taste 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.450
 we click on arrears for more variety 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.610
 and you modify it to your liking 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.580
 now we will see the effects when clicking 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.950
 here we have these red circles that vanish like a radar 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.869
 also this other effect of hit on the screen or sinking that a user 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.879
 out there you asked me 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.389
 very good 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.389
 we also have this water effect on the screen 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.239
 very good too 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.439
 as in the shade these effects can also be customized to 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.899
 our whim 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.379
 in the case of circles 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.359
 the size 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.829
 the duration 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.829
 the color 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.749
 in the case of the hit effect 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:45.639
 the depth size as we see it on the preview screen 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.579
 as well as the duration of the effect 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.170
 there are also the effects when right clicking or secondary 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:01.559
 which are basically the same as the left main click 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.559
 and they can also be customized 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.389
 now we will see the sound effects when clicking 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.819
 it's a different but nice sound 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.909
 and since you already customize aus as you see fit 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.829
 they have very good effects to combine 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.339
 once finished avoiding their video they save it if they do not know how to save it 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.849
 see my tutorial on how to use and edit videos with the field as well
