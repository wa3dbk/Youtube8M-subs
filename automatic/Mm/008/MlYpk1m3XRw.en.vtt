00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
did a good job of setting up other

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.289 
did a good job of setting up other
people<00:03:43.349> on<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.590> on<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:43.889> attack<00:03:44.250> like<00:03:44.849> Landon

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
people on the on the attack like Landon

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.210 
people on the on the attack like Landon
Donovan<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:45.840> basically<00:03:46.229> as<00:03:46.349> we<00:03:46.739> head<00:03:46.889> towards

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
Donovan so basically as we head towards

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.039 
Donovan so basically as we head towards
the<00:03:47.310> end<00:03:47.489> you're<00:03:47.849> getting<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.329> player<00:03:48.810> with

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
the end you're getting a player with

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.170
