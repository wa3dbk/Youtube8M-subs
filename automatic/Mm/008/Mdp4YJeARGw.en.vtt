00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
year in the first four games they were a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.380 
year in the first four games they were a
nine<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.350> 17<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.189> there<00:00:20.400> really<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.760> much<00:00:21.330> of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
nine and 17 is there really that much of

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.050 
nine and 17 is there really that much of
a<00:00:21.660> difference<00:00:21.710> between<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.430> get<00:00:23.730> from<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
a difference between what you get from a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.390 
a difference between what you get from a
middle-of-the-road<00:00:24.800> journeyman<00:00:25.800> guy<00:00:26.010> like

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
middle-of-the-road journeyman guy like

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.150 
middle-of-the-road journeyman guy like
castle<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.539> young<00:00:27.779> guy<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.019> EJ<00:00:28.560> Manuel<00:00:28.890> he

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
castle and a young guy like EJ Manuel he

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.189 
castle and a young guy like EJ Manuel he
clearly<00:00:29.460> has<00:00:29.730> more<00:00:29.970> upside<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:31.019> might

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
clearly has more upside and you might

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.540 
clearly has more upside and you might
end<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.529> winning<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.949> same<00:00:32.130> amount<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.369> games

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
end up winning the same amount of games

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.220 
end up winning the same amount of games
the<00:00:32.759> end<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.969> year<00:00:33.120> anyway<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:34.079> not<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the end of the year anyway it was not a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.810 
the end of the year anyway it was not a
big<00:00:34.440> upside<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.219> having<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.579> house<00:00:35.790> over

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
big upside to having that house over

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.190 
big upside to having that house over
here<00:00:36.030> start<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.420> mean<00:00:36.540> there's<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.780> reason<00:00:37.110> why

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
here start I mean there's a reason why

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.630 
here start I mean there's a reason why

two years ago in you pullin when he's
sitting<00:00:55.980> at<00:00:56.129> 500<00:00:56.640> there's<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.360> lot<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.539> teams<00:00:57.809> in

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
sitting at 500 there's a lot of teams in

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.060 
sitting at 500 there's a lot of teams in
his<00:00:58.050> league<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.800> will<00:00:58.890> take<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
his league right now that will take a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.770 
his league right now that will take a
quarterback<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.550> he<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.030> them<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> 500

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
quarterback that he can get them to 500

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.930 
quarterback that he can get them to 500
he'll<00:01:01.289> try<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> go<00:01:01.649> around<00:01:01.800> them<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.550> find<00:01:02.760> some

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
he'll try to go around them to find some

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.250 
he'll try to go around them to find some
pieces<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.420> him<00:01:03.510> over<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> hump<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.110> I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
pieces to get him over the hump but I

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.410 
pieces to get him over the hump but I
think<00:01:04.769> EJ<00:01:04.890> Manuel<00:01:05.339> was<00:01:05.400> way<00:01:05.700> too<00:01:05.760> premature<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
think EJ Manuel was way too premature to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
think EJ Manuel was way too premature to
talk<00:01:06.570> about<00:01:06.900> him<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.260> being<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.590> starting

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
talk about him not being a starting

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
talk about him not being a starting
quarterback<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.490> yes<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.360> need<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.570> have

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
quarterback there yes they need to have

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.390 
quarterback there yes they need to have
a<00:01:09.720> competition<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:10.650> competition<00:01:11.070> will

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
a competition I think competition will

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.920 
a competition I think competition will
breed<00:01:11.760> excellence<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.390> both<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> those<00:01:12.720> guys

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
breed excellence and both of those guys

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.560 
breed excellence and both of those guys
but<00:01:13.650> we've<00:01:13.830> seen<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.220> Matt<00:01:14.430> Cassel<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.939> we've

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
but we've seen with Matt Cassel is we've

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.550 
but we've seen with Matt Cassel is we've
seen<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:17.000> it's<00:01:18.000> underwhelming<00:01:18.450> EJ<00:01:19.110> Manuel<00:01:19.439> has

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
seen it it's underwhelming EJ Manuel has

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.289 
seen it it's underwhelming EJ Manuel has
them<00:01:19.710> upside<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.340> maybe<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.880> other<00:01:21.000> way<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
them upside but maybe the other way of

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.840 
them upside but maybe the other way of
looking<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.770> worry<00:01:23.130> about<00:01:23.520> EJ

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
looking at it is the the worry about EJ

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.300 
looking at it is the the worry about EJ
Manuel<00:01:24.330> his<00:01:24.509> development<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.229> greater<00:01:25.560> than

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
Manuel his development is greater than
