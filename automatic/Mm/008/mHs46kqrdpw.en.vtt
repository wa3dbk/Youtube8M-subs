00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.729
 ah 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.640
 to fire black the concept of the name 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.920
 born by two terms one to leave 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.570
 clear that this is a space 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.730
 gastronomic for slow fire 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.560
 combined with the passion for music 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.290
 black and many times because of the culture 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.540
 more urban black aesthetics and that 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.890
 think our attention and 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.770
 is in our lives too and there 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.780
 the stove was born a little to europe for 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.270
 create a space like fire black 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.280
 Well, it will be suitable to operate an old part 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.710
 of about five in the finals overflows the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.630
 gastronomic culture we are 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.310
 super lovers of the tascas of the 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.130
 traditional skewer culture 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.189
 bars and we really want to 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.449
 all train that flag no more than a 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:07.280
 restaurant we are a joint and we are a 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.110
 arito where where people come to 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.240
 have fun to relax to enjoy the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.070
 food to enjoy the atmosphere and is 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.360
 another meeting with other people does not 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.390
 what we saw was a lack really 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.070
 as for space of skewer could be 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.270
 make another kind of cuisine in a bar 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.190
 of pinchos could be comfortable 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.950
 listen good music receive good dish 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.380
 use see an exhibition or see certain 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.740
 things that catches my attention and that you 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 contribute 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.340
 and then we try to do it can be a 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.640
 imaginative cuisine a cooler cuisine 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.720
 and sometimes provocative 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.010
 we work with more everyday products 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.810
 that they are not less noble because of it 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.970
 according to our opinion in the case of 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.640
 fish because we work with discards 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.259
 what can they do with crossbows and such with 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.020
 chicharrón or that is a very fish 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.640
 everyday and highly valued but anna simó 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.800
 imagined we got to make a 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.020
 pea taco as if it were bonito 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.790
 your technique one of the products 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.830
 we wanted to work since 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.899
 We open is with the lumagorri chicken in 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.019
 this case we have done countless 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.920
 recipes and lately it goes that we have more 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.870
 sweetie 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.790
 an order is given, what we do is 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.709
 marinate the breast on salt and sugar 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.750
 for 12 hours and from there what 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.670
 we work as if it were a safe one 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.080
 fish the line we go with the milk of 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.820
 tiger with lime juice with coriander 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.800
 with the red onion we add some 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.460
 oranges and we add a little bit of 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.200
 corn powder 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.290
 we see a new vision of our kitchen 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.550
 Basque I obviously do not cook like my 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.650
 grandfather but he did not hear the same 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.900
 Music has seen it just like my grandfather and 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.520
 I do not travel the same as the previous one left 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.290
 my grandfather does not therefore I think that 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.720
 many of these recipes that are 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.850
 based on a traditional recipe like 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.250
 then in a potato in our case what 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.020
 but please make time for 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.710
 influences and for stories that we want 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.180
 on trips but that's why it lets be 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.700
 Basque cuisine and Basque cuisine 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.130
 2015 you are going to a team we are a gang 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.080
 in which obviously everyone I think 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.580
 We bet and we have the one we want 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.960
 we like and we enjoy philosophy 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.820
 black fire and we have fun with what 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.010
 we make is a gastronomy made for 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.410
 all but as long as I'm given a 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.700
 little open minded the greatest 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.520
 advice to open a black fire is 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.010
 let go and enjoy especially me 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.660
 I think that to an audience that apart from the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.980
 passion of gastronomy that apart 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.690
 have other types of concerns or 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.700
 passions such as music can be 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.540
 environment back injury I think that a 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.500
 put your site 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.500
 let's see 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.030
