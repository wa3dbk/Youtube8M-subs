00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
restricter plate race which I'm so

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.469 
restricter plate race which I'm so
nervous<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.939> probably<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
nervous because this is probably the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.210 
nervous because this is probably the
easiest<00:01:18.659> track<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.530> you'll<00:01:19.650> ever<00:01:19.799> run<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
easiest track that you'll ever run as a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.920 
easiest track that you'll ever run as a
race<00:01:20.430> car<00:01:20.580> driver<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.720> chess

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
race car driver but it's like a chess

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.969 
race car driver but it's like a chess
game<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.799> position

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
game so now you have to position

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.950 
game so now you have to position
yourself<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.420> always<00:01:24.570> find<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
yourself so you know you always find the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.390 
yourself so you know you always find the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
struggles everywhere it's a different

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.059 
struggles everywhere it's a different
form<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.730> racing<00:02:12.060> so

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
form of racing so

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.380

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
I have good car control when it gets

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.670 
I have good car control when it gets
sideways<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.930> can<00:02:15.049> get<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.230> back<00:02:15.319> under<00:02:15.590> control

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
sideways I can get it back under control

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.520 
sideways I can get it back under control
usually<00:02:16.310> but<00:02:17.150> it's<00:02:17.719> not<00:02:17.930> fast<00:02:18.079> to<00:02:18.230> be<00:02:18.319> sideways

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
usually but it's not fast to be sideways

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.229 
usually but it's not fast to be sideways
so<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.799> got<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.980> figure<00:02:19.099> how<00:02:19.219> to<00:02:19.280> do<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:19.549> it's

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
so I got to figure how to do this it's

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.300 
so I got to figure how to do this it's
just<00:02:20.389> a<00:02:20.599> little<00:02:20.989> bit<00:02:21.079> of<00:02:21.109> a<00:02:21.200> stopgap<00:02:21.499> or<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.129> is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
just a little bit of a stopgap or you is

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.589 
just a little bit of a stopgap or you is
there<00:02:22.430> tick<00:02:22.579> in<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> box<00:02:22.790> oh<00:02:23.269> have<00:02:23.389> you<00:02:23.420> got

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
there tick in the box oh have you got

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.179 
there tick in the box oh have you got
