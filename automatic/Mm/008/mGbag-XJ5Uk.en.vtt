00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:09.175
(MaryJane Pierce-Norton)
It's our Show and Tell time

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:14.480
from God, where God took very
ordinary elements-the bread,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.284
the juice, the
water-and imbued them

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.553
with deep, deep meaning.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.989
(congregation) Blessed is he who
comes in the name of the Lord.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.359
(MaryJane Pierce-Norton) And
it is very much a communal act.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:29.629
We receive strength from each
other, we gather together,

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.130
we're joined together.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.468
It's the Lord's table
and all are welcome here.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:39.439
So that's a core concept
for us as United Methodists.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.242
We believe that all are welcome
no matter their age, no matter

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:48.314
their intellectual abilities, no
matter their physical abilities,

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.182
we are all welcome at the table.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:58.724
It actually comes from a Latin
term that talked about a vow

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:01.027
that is taken, a promise.

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:08.100
And so in communion, we make a
promise of being united to God,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.304
united to one another, for the
bringing of God's kingdom

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.740
into the world.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.177
In The United Methodist Church,
the statement that most explains

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:23.716
communion for us is called this
Holy Mystery because...it takes

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:29.556
us out of those things we may be
able to explain into the mystery

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:34.961
of God in a way that we may
never be able to explain...

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.396
but we can claim.

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:40.600
There is no rule that says you
can take it too frequently.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.738
In fact, John Wesley, in the
formative years of Methodism,

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:50.443
took it as many as four or
five times a week, and he said

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:53.112
to the people called
Methodists at that time,

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:57.150
take communion as
often as you can.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.654
It is food for the journey.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:05.725
I really like the reason we
started World Communion Sunday.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:08.728
I don't know that many people
are aware but, it started in

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:12.398
1933 by a Presbyterian church.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:17.236
It was a time where people felt
without hope, they felt divided.

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:22.341
And the idea sprang out of this
church was, we need a Sunday

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:26.779
were all who are Christians
gather at a table

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.450
and remember we are one.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.587
I think about that a lot and
how it came out of a time of

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:40.225
hopelessness and fear, and I
wonder if it's that different

00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:44.663
from what we may feel today as
we listen to what's going around

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:51.871
the world and strength that
comes of knowing we are united.
