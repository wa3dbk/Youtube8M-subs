I<00:01:01.489> think<00:01:01.969> having<00:01:02.269> all<00:01:02.449> those<00:01:02.569> you<00:01:03.260> know

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
I think having all those you know

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.380 
I think having all those you know
facilities<00:01:03.890> on<00:01:04.070> hand<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:04.460> just<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.790> really<00:01:05.269> good

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
facilities on hand is just a really good

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.360 
facilities on hand is just a really good
way<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.690> hopefully<00:01:06.440> build<00:01:06.830> up<00:01:06.980> more<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.310> more

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
way to hopefully build up more and more

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.880 
way to hopefully build up more and more
players<00:01:07.670> as<00:01:07.940> we<00:01:08.140> go<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.200> your<00:01:09.320> own<00:01:09.410> Australia

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
players as we go to your own Australia

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.650 
players as we go to your own Australia
and<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.190> think<00:01:10.400> it's<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.700> best<00:01:11.090> way<00:01:11.270> we<00:01:11.390> can<00:01:11.450> do

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
and I think it's the best way we can do

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.230 
and I think it's the best way we can do
it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.030 
it
