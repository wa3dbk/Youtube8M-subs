00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.100 
intensive spawning okay we're going to
take<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.790> look<00:00:55.060> now<00:00:55.090> what<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.690> incubation

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
take a look now what the incubation

our intensive largemouth spawning we

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.700 
our intensive largemouth spawning we
normally<00:01:09.909> average<00:01:10.179> around<00:01:10.420> 5,000<00:01:11.259> eggs<00:01:11.380> for

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
spawn and when they hatch out they hatch

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.950 
spawn and when they hatch out they hatch
out<00:01:14.079> in<00:01:14.229> about<00:01:14.320> two<00:01:14.649> days<00:01:14.829> and<00:01:15.539> at<00:01:16.539> two<00:01:16.749> days

out in about two days and at two days

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.719 
out in about two days and at two days
the<00:01:17.259> they<00:01:17.469> look<00:01:17.679> like<00:01:17.859> little<00:01:18.070> black<00:01:18.399> grains

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
the they look like little black grains

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.599 
the they look like little black grains
of<00:01:19.030> rice<00:01:19.499> they<00:01:20.499> fall<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.979> bottom<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.340> tank

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
of rice they fall to the bottom the tank

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.039 
of rice they fall to the bottom the tank
and<00:01:21.789> they'll<00:01:21.999> stay<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:22.479> tank<00:01:22.749> for<00:01:22.929> about

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
and they'll stay in this tank for about

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.440 
and they'll stay in this tank for about
five<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.560> seven<00:01:23.890> days<00:01:23.939> at<00:01:24.939> which<00:01:25.090> time<00:01:25.299> they'll

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
five to seven days at which time they'll

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.779 
five to seven days at which time they'll

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
begin to swim up we collect them and

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.279 
begin to swim up we collect them and
then<00:01:27.909> they're<00:01:28.060> stocked<00:01:28.359> outside<00:01:28.780> in<00:01:28.929> the<00:01:29.020> pond

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
then they're stocked outside in the pond

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.499 
then they're stocked outside in the pond
at<00:01:29.859> around<00:01:30.039> 80,000<00:01:30.850> per<00:01:30.969> acre
