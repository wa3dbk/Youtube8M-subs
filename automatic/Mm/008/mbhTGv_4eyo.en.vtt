00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.110 

today<00:00:02.400> we're<00:00:02.580> trying<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.820> make<00:00:02.940> some<00:00:03.060> more

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
today we're trying to make some more

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.570 
today we're trying to make some more
progress<00:00:03.510> on<00:00:03.720> our<00:00:03.930> exhaust<00:00:04.319> manifold<00:00:04.830> if<00:00:05.399> you

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
progress on our exhaust manifold if you

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.140 
progress on our exhaust manifold if you
remember<00:00:05.880> this<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> 98<00:00:07.470> 99<00:00:07.830> Camaro<00:00:08.250> exhaust

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
remember this is a 98 99 Camaro exhaust

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.090 
remember this is a 98 99 Camaro exhaust
manifold<00:00:09.600> we<00:00:10.170> chose<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.560> because<00:00:10.890> it's

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
manifold we chose this because it's

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.730 
manifold we chose this because it's
stamped<00:00:11.820> steel<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.840> way<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.140> can<00:00:13.290> make<00:00:13.470> cuts

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
stamped steel that way we can make cuts

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.580 
stamped steel that way we can make cuts
and<00:00:13.950> well<00:00:14.130> things<00:00:14.430> to<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:15.049> a<00:00:16.049> way<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.350> can't

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
and well things to it in a way we can't

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.159 
and well things to it in a way we can't
do<00:00:16.769> with<00:00:17.010> cast-iron<00:00:17.430> manifolds<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.960> rather

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:19.169 
do with cast-iron manifolds so rather

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.269 
do with cast-iron manifolds so rather
than<00:00:19.320> trying<00:00:19.499> to<00:00:19.589> start<00:00:19.800> from<00:00:19.890> scratch<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
than trying to start from scratch and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.370 
than trying to start from scratch and
build<00:00:20.490> some<00:00:20.609> kind<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.849> header<00:00:21.230> custom<00:00:22.230> header

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
build some kind of header custom header

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.589 
build some kind of header custom header
we're<00:00:23.159> gonna<00:00:23.249> see<00:00:23.429> if<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.730> modify<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.119> if

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
we're gonna see if we can modify this if

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.259 
we're gonna see if we can modify this if
you<00:00:24.689> remember<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.470> first<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.579> first<00:00:26.820> cut<00:00:27.029> was

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you remember the first the first cut was

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.029 
you remember the first the first cut was
a<00:00:27.329> pretty<00:00:27.749> crude<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.409> plasma<00:00:28.800> cutter

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
a pretty crude one with a plasma cutter

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.429 
a pretty crude one with a plasma cutter
where<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.519> just<00:00:29.699> simply<00:00:29.970> took<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.439> flange

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
where we just simply took this flange

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.020 
where we just simply took this flange
off<00:00:31.829> to<00:00:32.040> get<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.250> out<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> way<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.880> sure

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
off to get it out of the way and sure

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.060 
off to get it out of the way and sure
enough<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.510> cleared<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.170> steering<00:00:34.680> box<00:00:34.830> which

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
enough we cleared the steering box which

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.740 
enough we cleared the steering box which
is<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.220> main<00:00:35.430> issue<00:00:35.580> but<00:00:36.330> we<00:00:36.420> still<00:00:36.540> had<00:00:36.720> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is a main issue but we still had a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.080 
is a main issue but we still had a
little<00:00:36.930> problem<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.520> with<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> fitting

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
little problem with a with a fitting

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.450 
little problem with a with a fitting
under<00:00:39.720> here<00:00:39.900> so<00:00:40.080> today<00:00:40.440> we're<00:00:40.800> gonna<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:41.190> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
under here so today we're gonna use a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.180 
under here so today we're gonna use a
slightly<00:00:42.240> more<00:00:42.510> precise<00:00:42.990> instrument<00:00:43.620> we're

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
slightly more precise instrument we're

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
slightly more precise instrument we're
gonna<00:00:44.280> take<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> trusty<00:00:45.030> sawzall

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
gonna take the trusty sawzall

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.330 
gonna take the trusty sawzall
we're<00:00:46.260> gonna<00:00:46.380> make<00:00:46.560> some<00:00:46.770> cuts<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:47.310> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
we're gonna make some cuts here and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.830 
we're gonna make some cuts here and
we're<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.880> play<00:00:48.150> around<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.600> maybe

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
we're gonna play around with maybe

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.770 
we're gonna play around with maybe
taking<00:00:49.290> like<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.740> forty<00:00:50.100> five<00:00:50.450> tube<00:00:51.450> like<00:00:51.750> this

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
taking like a forty five tube like this

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.260 
taking like a forty five tube like this
and<00:00:52.380> maybe<00:00:52.950> seeing<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.580> it'll<00:00:53.730> fit<00:00:53.970> in<00:00:54.090> here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
and maybe seeing if it'll fit in here

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.080 
and maybe seeing if it'll fit in here
someplace<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.930> still<00:00:55.140> go<00:00:55.860> provide<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:56.820> down

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
someplace and still go provide a down

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.760 
someplace and still go provide a down
tube<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.630> can<00:00:57.780> stick<00:00:57.990> a<00:00:58.020> flange<00:00:58.290> on<00:00:58.530> later

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
tube that we can stick a flange on later

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.850 
tube that we can stick a flange on later
on<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:59.220> make<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.060> go<00:01:00.210> past<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.780> steering<00:01:01.680> box

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
on and make it go past the steering box

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.910 
on and make it go past the steering box
and<00:01:02.270> down<00:01:03.270> along<00:01:03.510> beside<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:04.049> transmission

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and down along beside the transmission

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.649 
and down along beside the transmission
and<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> back<00:01:05.400> that's<00:01:06.120> the<00:01:06.240> plan<00:01:06.420> anyway

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and out the back that's the plan anyway

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.750 
and out the back that's the plan anyway
let's<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.230> happens<00:01:10.520> well<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.550> made<00:01:11.730> some

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
let's see what happens well I made some

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000 
let's see what happens well I made some
marks<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.870> back<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> car<00:01:13.560> got

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
marks I put this back in the car got

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.399 
marks I put this back in the car got
underneath<00:01:14.310> made<00:01:14.700> some<00:01:14.880> marks<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.270> where<00:01:16.050> this

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
underneath made some marks on where this

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.600 
underneath made some marks on where this
pipe<00:01:16.650> should<00:01:17.420> come<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.900> about<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.950> it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
pipe should come out just about and it

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.210 
pipe should come out just about and it
turns<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:20.940> that<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> 90<00:01:21.570> degree<00:01:21.860> by<00:01:22.860> bending

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
turns out that the 90 degree by bending

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.810 
turns out that the 90 degree by bending
it<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.550> little<00:01:23.760> bit<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.180> putting<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> somewhere

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
it a little bit and putting it somewhere

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.690 
it a little bit and putting it somewhere
about<00:01:26.820> there<00:01:27.240> should<00:01:28.190> be<00:01:29.190> just<00:01:29.310> about<00:01:29.430> right

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
about there should be just about right

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.430 
about there should be just about right
this<00:01:29.850> will<00:01:30.000> probably<00:01:30.120> take<00:01:30.330> another<00:01:30.690> little

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
this will probably take another little

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.390 
this will probably take another little
bend<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.070> end<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:34.040> before<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.130> done<00:01:35.250> so

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
bend on the end here before it's done so

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.520 
bend on the end here before it's done so
I'm<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.580> gonna<00:01:35.670> make<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> tack<00:01:36.180> weld<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:37.409> my

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
I'm just gonna make a tack weld with my

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.680 
I'm just gonna make a tack weld with my
little<00:01:37.680> 1:10<00:01:38.070> welder<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.540> put

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
little 1:10 welder and then we can put

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.270 
little 1:10 welder and then we can put
it<00:01:39.750> back<00:01:39.840> under<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> car<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.710> see<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.070> it's

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it back under the car and see if it's

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.649 
it back under the car and see if it's
indeed<00:01:41.820> about<00:01:42.090> where<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:42.450> want<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.630 

here's<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> stuff<00:01:48.960> those<00:01:49.229> car<00:01:49.950> shows<00:01:50.190> on<00:01:50.430> TV

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
here's the stuff those car shows on TV

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.310 
here's the stuff those car shows on TV
where<00:01:51.030> they're<00:01:51.180> always<00:01:51.360> building<00:01:51.750> stuff<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
where they're always building stuff and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.620 
where they're always building stuff and
they<00:01:52.500> manage<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.190> build<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> whole<00:01:53.670> car<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.090> 30

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
they manage to build a whole car in 30

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.719 
they manage to build a whole car in 30
minutes<00:01:55.020> well<00:01:55.800> that's<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> kind<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.580> stuff

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
minutes well that's the kind of stuff

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.600 
minutes well that's the kind of stuff
they<00:01:56.850> never<00:01:56.970> show<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.460> we're

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
they never show you you know we're

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.240 
they never show you you know we're
trying<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.880> make<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.990> new<00:02:01.560> manifold<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
trying to make a new manifold out of

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.399 
trying to make a new manifold out of
this<00:02:02.369> Camaro<00:02:02.970> stamp<00:02:03.600> steel<00:02:03.840> thing<00:02:04.080> so<00:02:04.290> we've

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
this Camaro stamp steel thing so we've

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.889 
this Camaro stamp steel thing so we've
got<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> down<00:02:04.920> pipe<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.909> I've<00:02:06.690> tested

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
got a down pipe that I've tested

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.990 
got a down pipe that I've tested
underneath<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> car<00:02:07.770> looks<00:02:08.009> pretty<00:02:08.220> good<00:02:08.310> so

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
underneath the car looks pretty good so

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.420 
underneath the car looks pretty good so
now<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> wanted<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.569> connect<00:02:09.899> these<00:02:10.500> two<00:02:10.950> pipes

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
now I wanted to connect these two pipes

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.729 
now I wanted to connect these two pipes
here<00:02:11.850> with<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> needed<00:02:13.230> some<00:02:13.410> sort<00:02:13.650> of

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
here with this so I needed some sort of

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.880 
here with this so I needed some sort of
a<00:02:13.920> little<00:02:14.610> filler<00:02:14.790> piece<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.800> started<00:02:16.800> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
a little filler piece and started to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.470 
a little filler piece and started to
shape<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> end<00:02:17.700> with<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.209> belt

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
shape this on the end with the belt

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.720 
shape this on the end with the belt
sander<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.350> part<00:02:20.040> was<00:02:20.250> looking<00:02:20.550> real

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
sander and that part was looking real

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.530 
sander and that part was looking real
good<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:22.620> forgot<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.370> allow<00:02:23.610> for<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
good but I forgot to allow for the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.120 
good but I forgot to allow for the
amount<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.840> material<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.320> was<00:02:25.410> taking<00:02:25.709> off<00:02:25.890> here

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
amount of material I was taking off here

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.550 
amount of material I was taking off here
and<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.430> now<00:02:26.459> it's<00:02:27.269> too<00:02:27.480> short<00:02:27.660> over<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.500> I

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
and so now it's too short over here so I

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.640 
and so now it's too short over here so I
got<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.769> start<00:02:28.920> over<00:02:29.040> again<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:30.120> anyway<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.720> did

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
got to start over again but anyway I did

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.080 
got to start over again but anyway I did
discover<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.730> probably<00:02:32.970> gonna

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
discover that this is probably gonna

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.660 
discover that this is probably gonna
work<00:02:33.269> pretty<00:02:33.450> well<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:34.860> should<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.459> nice

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
work pretty well it should have a nice

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.630 
work pretty well it should have a nice
flow<00:02:36.000> it'll<00:02:36.510> Y<00:02:37.050> into<00:02:37.500> here<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:38.310> one's<00:02:38.519> gonna

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
flow it'll Y into here this one's gonna

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.400 
flow it'll Y into here this one's gonna
come<00:02:38.820> over<00:02:38.970> from<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.269> side<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:40.230> should

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
come over from this side and we should

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.190 
come over from this side and we should
still<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.680> pretty<00:02:40.980> good<00:02:41.100> flow<00:02:42.050> well<00:02:43.050> here's

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
still have pretty good flow well here's

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.809 
still have pretty good flow well here's
what<00:02:43.380> our<00:02:43.470> manifold<00:02:43.800> looks<00:02:44.010> like<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.370> far

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
what our manifold looks like so far

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
a local muffler shop make the 90 for me

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.750 
a local muffler shop make the 90 for me
I<00:02:57.450> made<00:02:57.989> these<00:02:58.170> two<00:02:58.440> filler<00:02:58.890> pieces<00:02:59.160> here<00:02:59.549> that

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
I made these two filler pieces here that

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.870 
I made these two filler pieces here that
yn<00:03:00.299> made<00:03:00.900> cut<00:03:01.140> out<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.709> we've<00:03:01.829> got<00:03:01.880> pretty

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
yn made cut out so that we've got pretty

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.530 
yn made cut out so that we've got pretty
decent<00:03:03.030> flow<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:05.549> cross<00:03:05.790> section<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.390> is

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
decent flow the cross section of this is

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.640 
decent flow the cross section of this is
actually<00:03:06.690> larger<00:03:07.230> than<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.500> original

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
actually larger than the original

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.550 
actually larger than the original
cast-iron<00:03:08.430> manifold<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:10.230> once<00:03:10.440> again

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
cast-iron manifold so and once again

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.110 
cast-iron manifold so and once again
this<00:03:10.769> is<00:03:10.829> not<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.070> track<00:03:11.370> car<00:03:11.640> this<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:11.940> just

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
this is not a track car this is just

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.640 
this is not a track car this is just
going<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.329> be<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.480> daily<00:03:12.780> driver<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.410> we<00:03:13.440> think

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
going to be a daily driver so we think

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.750 
going to be a daily driver so we think
we'll<00:03:13.829> be<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.010> good<00:03:14.040> shape<00:03:14.190> there

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
we'll be in good shape there

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.789 
we'll be in good shape there
this<00:03:15.239> final<00:03:15.930> down<00:03:16.079> pipe<00:03:16.320> here<00:03:16.530> will<00:03:16.680> probably

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
this final down pipe here will probably

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.430 
this final down pipe here will probably
need<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.130> little<00:03:17.400> bit<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.910> turn<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:19.079> come<00:03:19.260> back

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
need a little bit of a turn to come back

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.350 
need a little bit of a turn to come back
a<00:03:19.739> little<00:03:20.160> closer<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.730> bell<00:03:20.850> housing<00:03:21.000> but

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
a little closer to the bell housing but

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.000 
a little closer to the bell housing but
it<00:03:21.450> does<00:03:21.600> clear<00:03:22.140> everything<00:03:22.440> on<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.860> car

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
it does clear everything on the car

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.039 
it does clear everything on the car
right<00:03:23.280> now<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.700> then<00:03:24.510> we'll<00:03:24.600> decide<00:03:24.840> whether

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
right now and then we'll decide whether

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.069 
right now and then we'll decide whether
we<00:03:25.200> put<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.410> flange<00:03:25.709> on<00:03:26.010> or<00:03:26.420> or<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:27.450> use<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> slip

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
we put a flange on or or just use a slip

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.710 
we put a flange on or or just use a slip

project<00:03:31.140> like<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.470> they're<00:03:31.739> always<00:03:31.890> going

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
project like this they're always going

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.640 
project like this they're always going
to<00:03:32.190> be<00:03:32.310> some<00:03:32.700> compromises<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.320> this<00:03:34.410> case
