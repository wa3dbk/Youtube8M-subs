00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 hi everyone so today 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.750
 the application I'm going to present to you 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.589
 is called video weight so here it's 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.870
 rod and a flip 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.509
 it can rotate videos 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.320
 you are caught going to your iphone so 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.160
 the application is free available 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.550
 on the app store 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.260
 as you can see in the title of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.539
 the application he puts in particular limits 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 about other apps like this 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.240
 allow only a certain amount of time 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.400
 time 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.059
 So as I say it is free 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.180
 it available for ipod ipad and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.879
 the iphone and require the recipes 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.379
 related to the six at least so on the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.460
 decisions got pulled after it works 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.460
 then the application itself 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.420
 when you launch the application you 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.899
 have all your videos that appear 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.980
 you choose the one that interests you 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.140
 and as we could see you have 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.609
 four buttons underneath so the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.870
 first finally you have four buttons 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.359
 as well as bend to come back 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.670
 there it is to be able precisely 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:12.750
 start the video and you can come 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:16.100
 make a symmetry to invert or 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.100
 then simply do a rotation 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.479
 once I made your rotation 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.680
 well above all else what you can 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.189
 have also been verified in the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.320
 parameters above what it is 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.840
 the export so you can export either 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.920
 in mp4 or a move for the iphone it does not 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.350
 will not change much it's rather 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 for you if you use on your 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.229
 computer 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.850
 and I advise to check that it is 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.649
 of course at edg so is the maximum for 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.310
 to have the best quality in everything 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.009
 had limit compatibility put there 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.549
 is 8th that time is good if you have 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:59.100
 a mac or so let you video hall 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.259
 paying you do one when you 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.000
 video or so fits the symmetry is 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.189
 good and the rotation in good day 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.530
 just safe at that moment you have 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.629
 a progression to success that appears 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.489
 is automatically from the end the 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.319
 progression it will warn you as 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.180
 what the new video 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.549
 and in your photos and so there you 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.079
 will suffice to come to delete the old and 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.239
 to leave room for this one is so 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.709
 this is my son of education you me them 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.909
 put in the comments and I 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.909
 answer as quickly as usual
