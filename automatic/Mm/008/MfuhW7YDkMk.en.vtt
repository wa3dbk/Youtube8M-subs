dagger then I won't been all attack and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.389 
dagger then I won't been all attack and
I<00:02:05.200> won't<00:02:05.350> save<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.650> for<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.830> deadly<00:02:06.130> poison

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
I won't save it for the deadly poison

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.109 
I won't save it for the deadly poison
although<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.460> looks<00:02:09.610> like<00:02:09.730> i'm<00:02:09.820> going<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.030> have

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
although it looks like i'm going to have

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.790 
although it looks like i'm going to have
manages<00:02:10.570> to<00:02:10.690> read<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.990> grand<00:02:11.260> deadly<00:02:11.500> if<00:02:11.590> i<00:02:11.650> have

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
manages to read a grand deadly if i have

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.910 
manages to read a grand deadly if i have
to<00:02:11.950> anyways<00:02:12.250> we'll<00:02:12.550> see<00:02:12.670> what<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.820> draw<00:02:16.920> oxalate

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
to anyways we'll see what I draw oxalate

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.260 
to anyways we'll see what I draw oxalate
all<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.190> further<00:02:18.430> if<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.610> could<00:02:18.760> set<00:02:18.970> point

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
all this further if I could set point

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:29.120 
all this further if I could set point
but<00:02:19.450> also<00:02:20.020> happens

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.280 

okay<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:29.910> now<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.150> could<00:02:30.330> consider<00:02:30.690> he<00:02:30.960> doesn't

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
okay so now I could consider he doesn't

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.870 
okay so now I could consider he doesn't
have<00:02:31.410> an<00:02:31.500> earth<00:02:31.680> shock<00:02:31.920> or<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.220> lightning<00:02:32.760> bolt

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
have an earth shock or a lightning bolt

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.940 
have an earth shock or a lightning bolt
or<00:02:33.150> would<00:02:33.600> have<00:02:33.720> used<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.080> believe<00:02:34.380> unless

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
or would have used it I believe unless

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.770 
or would have used it I believe unless
he<00:02:35.130> didn't<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.580> overload<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.510> maybe<00:02:36.690> he

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
he didn't want to overload so maybe he

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.850 
he didn't want to overload so maybe he
has<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> lightning<00:02:37.230> bolt<00:02:37.320> but<00:02:37.530> he<00:02:37.590> didn't<00:02:37.740> want

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
has a lightning bolt but he didn't want

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.020 
has a lightning bolt but he didn't want
over<00:02:38.040> though<00:02:38.100> because<00:02:38.220> he<00:02:38.340> wants<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.610> feral

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
over though because he wants to feral

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.420 
over though because he wants to feral
spirits<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:40.350> either<00:02:40.560> way<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.160> fine

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
spirits but either way this is fine

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.280 
spirits but either way this is fine
restoral<00:02:41.970> spirits<00:02:42.300> because<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.810> can<00:02:42.960> deadly

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
restoral spirits because I can deadly

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.750 
restoral spirits because I can deadly
next<00:02:43.590> turn<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:43.770> just<00:02:44.100> throw<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.400> cold<00:02:44.580> blood

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
next turn and just throw the cold blood

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.320 
next turn and just throw the cold blood
in<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:47.310> we'll<00:02:47.460> actually<00:02:47.640> do<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:50.210> part<00:02:51.210> of<00:02:51.270> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
in so we'll actually do this part of the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.940 
in so we'll actually do this part of the
reason<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.170> most<00:02:52.380> likely<00:02:52.560> time

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
reason is this is the most likely time

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.070 
reason is this is the most likely time
that<00:02:53.610> cold-blooded<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.480> lose<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.840> damage

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
that cold-blooded so I lose to damage

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.600 
that cold-blooded so I lose to damage
that<00:02:55.200> off<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.470> guy<00:02:55.620> essentially<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.370> get

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
that off this guy essentially but I get

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.830 
that off this guy essentially but I get
to<00:02:56.790> one<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.210> board<00:02:57.360> which<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.660> not

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
to one on the board which is not

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.330 
to one on the board which is not
worthless<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.160> murloc<00:02:59.760> writer<00:03:00.230> but

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
worthless this is a murloc writer but

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.440 
worthless this is a murloc writer but
usually<00:03:02.340> cold<00:03:02.580> blood<00:03:02.760> use<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.240> as<00:03:03.300> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
usually cold blood use it as the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.760 
usually cold blood use it as the
finisher<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:03.990> only<00:03:04.110> expect<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.530> get<00:03:04.620> for

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
finisher and you only expect to get for

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.440 
finisher and you only expect to get for
damage<00:03:05.100> out<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.400> but<00:03:05.520> at<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.790> point<00:03:05.970> in

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
damage out of it but at this point in

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.940 
damage out of it but at this point in
the<00:03:06.540> game<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.870> actually<00:03:06.960> might<00:03:07.410> get<00:03:07.620> two<00:03:07.800> hits

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
the game I actually might get two hits

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.550 
the game I actually might get two hits
out<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.370> or<00:03:08.490> at<00:03:08.580> least<00:03:08.810> really<00:03:09.810> make<00:03:10.380> him

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
out of it or at least really make him

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.230 
out of it or at least really make him
play<00:03:10.710> differently<00:03:11.550> than<00:03:11.700> he<00:03:11.790> wanted<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.120> so

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
play differently than he wanted to so

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.560 
play differently than he wanted to so
you<00:03:12.300> didn't<00:03:12.450> want<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.630> do<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.750> last<00:03:13.050> ring

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.810 

this<00:03:18.570> is<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.720> beautiful<00:03:19.550> usually<00:03:20.550> don't<00:03:20.730> get

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
this is a beautiful usually don't get

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.030 
this is a beautiful usually don't get
this<00:03:21.000> lucky<00:03:21.180> with<00:03:21.450> Booker<00:03:21.900> it's<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.590> perfect

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
this lucky with Booker it's a perfect

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.270 
this lucky with Booker it's a perfect
curve<00:03:23.190> for<00:03:23.370> me<00:03:23.490> essentially<00:03:25.250> hopefully<00:03:26.250> I

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
curve for me essentially hopefully I

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.230 
curve for me essentially hopefully I
don't<00:03:26.640> have<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.210> deadly<00:03:28.110> next<00:03:28.380> turn<00:03:29.240> it's

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
don't have to deadly next turn it's

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.670 
don't have to deadly next turn it's
actually<00:03:30.600> got<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.840> damage<00:03:31.170> out<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:31.530> guy

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
actually got the damage out of this guy

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.350 
actually got the damage out of this guy
said<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.950> wasn't<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> full<00:03:32.370> waste<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.850> got<00:03:33.210> four

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.820 
as well but I caused him to lightning
bolt<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.930> turned<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.260> maybe<00:03:40.470> he<00:03:40.650> didn't

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
bolt and I turned that maybe he didn't

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.350 
bolt and I turned that maybe he didn't
want<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.070> that's<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.940> value<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.240> having

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
want to that's the value of having

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.060 
want to that's the value of having
things<00:03:42.660> on<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.870> board<00:03:43.110> so<00:03:45.470> like<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.860> guy<00:03:47.010> is

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
things on the board so like this guy is

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.800 
things on the board so like this guy is
only<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.850> can<00:03:47.940> think<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.270> miss<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.540> damage

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
only you can think of it miss to damage

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.210 
only you can think of it miss to damage
but<00:03:48.960> he<00:03:49.020> also<00:03:49.140> has<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.380> body<00:03:49.560> on<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.770> small<00:03:50.040> body

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
but he also has a body on a small body

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.170 
but he also has a body on a small body
on<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.430> board<00:03:50.610> which<00:03:50.730> does<00:03:50.970> affect<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.330> game

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
on the board which does affect the game

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.150 
on the board which does affect the game
especially<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.510> early<00:03:54.600> stages

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.290 

so<00:04:00.160> maybe<00:04:00.310> he<00:04:00.430> has<00:04:00.520> a<00:04:00.550> lightning<00:04:00.850> storm<00:04:00.970> next

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
so maybe he has a lightning storm next

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.090 
so maybe he has a lightning storm next
round<00:04:01.510> so<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:01.900> can<00:04:02.080> consider<00:04:02.470> throwing<00:04:02.860> both

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
round so I can consider throwing both

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.750 
round so I can consider throwing both
these<00:04:03.220> guys<00:04:03.400> into<00:04:03.610> play<00:04:03.820> around<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:06.610> is

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
these guys into play around it this is

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.240 
these guys into play around it this is
so<00:04:06.970> man<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:07.780> efficient<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.590> just<00:04:08.620> put<00:04:09.160> this

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
so man and efficient to just put this

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.540 
so man and efficient to just put this
guy<00:04:09.400> down<00:04:09.430> but<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:13.710> it<00:04:14.710> does<00:04:15.100> play<00:04:15.280> around<00:04:15.430> the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
guy down but I it does play around the

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.729 
guy down but I it does play around the
lightning<00:04:15.760> storm<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.000> little<00:04:16.180> bit<00:04:19.380> if<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.530> give

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
lightning storm a little bit if I give

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.200 
lightning storm a little bit if I give
him<00:04:20.860> a<00:04:20.890> minute<00:04:21.130> this<00:04:21.460> is<00:04:21.580> so<00:04:21.730> early<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.090> give

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
him a minute this is so early to give

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.590 
him a minute this is so early to give
him<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.360> mana<00:04:22.600> I<00:04:23.970> think<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.060> have<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.300> trade<00:04:25.480> both

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
him a mana I think I have to trade both

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.300 
him a mana I think I have to trade both
of<00:04:25.810> these<00:04:25.930> guys<00:04:26.140> in<00:04:26.320> though<00:04:26.470> either<00:04:26.860> way<00:04:26.950> and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
of these guys in though either way and

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.590 
of these guys in though either way and
then<00:04:27.430> I'd<00:04:27.520> yeah<00:04:28.060> i'm<00:04:28.120> turning<00:04:28.390> both<00:04:28.510> these

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
then I'd yeah i'm turning both these

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.940 
then I'd yeah i'm turning both these
guys<00:04:28.750> into<00:04:28.960> either<00:04:29.110> way<00:04:29.290> unless<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.770> were<00:04:29.860> to

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
guys into either way unless I were to

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.070 
guys into either way unless I were to
deadly<00:04:31.170> ss7<00:04:32.170> a<00:04:32.350> game<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.460> damage<00:04:33.850> I'd<00:04:34.120> lose<00:04:34.870> to

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
deadly ss7 a game to damage I'd lose to

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.220 
deadly ss7 a game to damage I'd lose to
damage<00:04:35.440> at<00:04:35.710> least<00:04:36.540> but<00:04:37.540> probably<00:04:37.840> more<00:04:38.050> than

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
damage at least but probably more than

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.800 
damage at least but probably more than
to<00:04:38.380> damage<00:04:38.680> so<00:04:39.130> I'll<00:04:39.280> wait<00:04:39.730> on<00:04:39.760> that<00:04:39.910> step<00:04:40.720> to

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
to damage so I'll wait on that step to

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.910 
to damage so I'll wait on that step to
decide<00:04:41.080> which<00:04:41.230> one<00:04:41.350> of<00:04:41.380> these<00:04:41.500> want<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.800> play

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
decide which one of these want to play

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.610 
decide which one of these want to play
this<00:04:42.160> guy<00:04:42.310> without<00:04:42.460> combo<00:04:43.320> I'm<00:04:44.320> going<00:04:44.560> to

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
this guy without combo I'm going to

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.060 
this guy without combo I'm going to
assassin's<00:04:45.250> blade<00:04:45.310> next<00:04:45.670> turn<00:04:46.770> I'm<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.920> takes

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
assassin's blade next turn I'm it takes

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.760 
assassin's blade next turn I'm it takes
him<00:04:48.220> up<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.490> 6<00:04:48.730> mana<00:04:48.970> so<00:04:49.540> he<00:04:49.690> can<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.900> fire<00:04:50.290> Elliot

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
him up to 6 mana so he can a fire Elliot

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.650 
him up to 6 mana so he can a fire Elliot
or<00:04:50.920> argent<00:04:51.250> commander<00:04:51.310> this<00:04:51.700> that's<00:04:52.270> not<00:04:52.450> good

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
or argent commander this that's not good

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.540 
or argent commander this that's not good
he's<00:04:53.560> only<00:04:53.710> got<00:04:53.890> a<00:04:53.920> little<00:04:54.070> bit<00:04:54.160> of<00:04:54.250> cards

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
he's only got a little bit of cards

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.490 
he's only got a little bit of cards
though<00:04:57.420> what<00:04:58.420> if<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.600> put<00:04:58.810> this<00:04:58.840> guy<00:04:59.080> down<00:04:59.110> he

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
though what if I put this guy down he

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.800 
though what if I put this guy down he
can't<00:04:59.740> get<00:04:59.890> fire<00:05:00.100> le<00:05:00.390> that's<00:05:01.390> kind<00:05:01.600> of<00:05:01.660> good

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
can't get fire le that's kind of good

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.570 
can't get fire le that's kind of good
see<00:05:02.620> how<00:05:02.740> hold<00:05:02.950> off<00:05:03.040> on<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.250> arcane<00:05:03.490> golem

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
see how hold off on the arcane golem

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.430 
see how hold off on the arcane golem
especially<00:05:04.000> because<00:05:04.150> he's<00:05:04.270> more<00:05:04.450> good<00:05:04.690> he's

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
especially because he's more good he's

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.909 
especially because he's more good he's
worked<00:05:05.710> more<00:05:05.980> with<00:05:06.540> shadow<00:05:07.540> step

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.969 

so<00:05:12.919> basically<00:05:13.190> I'm<00:05:13.340> saving<00:05:13.610> this<00:05:13.669> guy<00:05:13.880> for<00:05:14.120> own

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
so basically I'm saving this guy for own

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.560 
so basically I'm saving this guy for own
because<00:05:15.979> if<00:05:16.160> i<00:05:16.280> play<00:05:16.490> them<00:05:16.639> I<00:05:16.759> there's<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.330> very

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
because if i play them I there's a very

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.760 
because if i play them I there's a very
low<00:05:17.780> chance<00:05:17.810> he's<00:05:18.199> gonna<00:05:18.259> live<00:05:18.470> like<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.710> don't

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
low chance he's gonna live like I don't

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.230 
low chance he's gonna live like I don't
even<00:05:18.860> expect<00:05:19.160> this<00:05:19.310> guy<00:05:19.370> to<00:05:19.460> live<00:05:19.669> but<00:05:20.180> I

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
even expect this guy to live but I

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.150 
even expect this guy to live but I
wouldn't<00:05:20.660> want<00:05:20.810> him<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:20.990> get<00:05:21.259> fire<00:05:21.620> le<00:05:21.830> because

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
wouldn't want him to get fire le because

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.409 
wouldn't want him to get fire le because
that's<00:05:22.310> too<00:05:22.430> big<00:05:22.580> doesn't<00:05:22.759> he<00:05:22.880> gets<00:05:23.060> a<00:05:23.120> minion

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
that's too big doesn't he gets a minion

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.439 
that's too big doesn't he gets a minion
handy<00:05:23.840> yeah<00:05:24.729> okay<00:05:25.729> so<00:05:25.789> that's<00:05:26.060> kind<00:05:26.240> of<00:05:26.270> weird

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
handy yeah okay so that's kind of weird

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.420 
handy yeah okay so that's kind of weird
for<00:05:26.750> my<00:05:26.810> assassin's<00:05:27.350> blade<00:05:27.470> I<00:05:27.560> think<00:05:28.100> I<00:05:28.220> just

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
for my assassin's blade I think I just

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.749 
for my assassin's blade I think I just
ignore<00:05:28.820> it<00:05:29.979> otherwise<00:05:30.979> I<00:05:31.130> could<00:05:31.310> deadly

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
ignore it otherwise I could deadly

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.430 
ignore it otherwise I could deadly
through<00:05:32.000> a<00:05:32.060> South<00:05:32.360> Sea<00:05:32.600> in<00:05:32.720> or<00:05:33.169> I<00:05:33.199> could<00:05:33.320> play

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
through a South Sea in or I could play

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.960 
through a South Sea in or I could play
the<00:05:33.500> arcane<00:05:33.830> golem<00:05:33.949> neither<00:05:34.430> of<00:05:34.460> these<00:05:34.610> i<00:05:34.789> like

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
so i'll just do this ignore for now

so i'll just do this ignore for now
maybe<00:05:37.130> I'll<00:05:37.280> drawn<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.789> am<00:05:39.310> it<00:05:40.310> all<00:05:40.460> drawn<00:05:40.639> to

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
maybe I'll drawn to am it all drawn to

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:41.890 
maybe I'll drawn to am it all drawn to
something<00:05:40.880> later<00:05:41.180> but<00:05:41.360> as<00:05:41.479> it<00:05:41.600> stands<00:05:41.810> it

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
something later but as it stands it

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.219 
something later but as it stands it

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
looks like i have lethal anyways 45 9 10

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.760 
looks like i have lethal anyways 45 9 10
11<00:05:45.460> 45<00:05:46.460> min<00:05:46.910> so<00:05:47.750> i<00:05:47.810> have<00:05:47.900> 11<00:05:48.199> damage<00:05:48.470> with<00:05:48.620> more

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
11 45 min so i have 11 damage with more

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.939 
11 45 min so i have 11 damage with more
mana<00:05:48.889> despair<00:05:50.080> so<00:05:51.080> for<00:05:51.229> one<00:05:51.350> man<00:05:51.500> i<00:05:51.530> can't<00:05:51.830> do

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
mana despair so for one man i can't do

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.680 
mana despair so for one man i can't do
much<00:05:52.100> because<00:05:52.220> this<00:05:52.400> is<00:05:52.520> my<00:05:52.639> second<00:05:53.060> southsea

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
much because this is my second southsea

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.150 
much because this is my second southsea
so<00:05:54.020> if<00:05:54.080> you<00:05:54.169> taunted<00:05:54.590> i<00:05:54.740> wouldn't<00:05:54.949> be<00:05:55.010> able<00:05:55.039> to

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
so if you taunted i wouldn't be able to

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.820 
so if you taunted i wouldn't be able to
get<00:05:55.250> through<00:05:55.460> it<00:05:55.550> but<00:05:56.150> as<00:05:57.020> a<00:05:57.080> SAN<00:05:57.350> see<00:05:57.470> did<00:05:57.620> tom

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
get through it but as a SAN see did tom

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.129 
get through it but as a SAN see did tom
so<00:06:01.030> let's<00:06:02.030> have<00:06:02.180> eight<00:06:02.389> nine<00:06:02.660> ten<00:06:02.810> eleven<00:06:03.050> up

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
so let's have eight nine ten eleven up

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.629 
so let's have eight nine ten eleven up
many<00:06:03.349> ways<00:06:03.500> to<00:06:03.650> do<00:06:03.740> you<00:06:03.889> fly<00:06:04.070> to<00:06:04.099> click<00:06:04.340> on<00:06:04.520> it

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
many ways to do you fly to click on it

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:15.890 
many ways to do you fly to click on it
this<00:06:04.789> way<00:06:04.970> because<00:06:05.090> it's<00:06:05.180> forced

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.110 

it's<00:06:16.900> a<00:06:17.020> service<00:06:17.230> is<00:06:17.380> tied<00:06:17.620> 2-2<00:06:18.580> now<00:06:18.760> so<00:06:19.000> we'll

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
it's a service is tied 2-2 now so we'll

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.650 
it's a service is tied 2-2 now so we'll
go<00:06:19.210> headed<00:06:19.480> to<00:06:19.570> the<00:06:19.660> Halloween<00:06:22.200> so<00:06:23.200> that<00:06:23.380> match

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
go headed to the Halloween so that match

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.970 
go headed to the Halloween so that match
he<00:06:25.660> didn't<00:06:26.020> draw<00:06:26.170> feral<00:06:26.470> Spears<00:06:26.680> I<00:06:26.800> didn't

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
he didn't draw feral Spears I didn't

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.260 
he didn't draw feral Spears I didn't
give<00:06:27.070> him<00:06:27.160> a<00:06:27.190> chance<00:06:27.370> to<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:27.790> with<00:06:27.910> my<00:06:28.030> board

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
give him a chance to that with my board

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.880 
give him a chance to that with my board
the<00:06:28.600> device<00:06:29.020> was<00:06:29.200> really<00:06:29.410> good<00:06:29.560> he<00:06:29.710> didn't

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
the device was really good he didn't

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.470 
the device was really good he didn't
have<00:06:30.010> the<00:06:30.100> squire<00:06:30.370> that<00:06:30.670> was<00:06:30.760> big<00:06:30.910> for<00:06:31.060> him<00:06:31.240> I

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
have the squire that was big for him I

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.030 
have the squire that was big for him I
didn't<00:06:31.990> draw<00:06:32.080> the<00:06:32.140> cold<00:06:32.440> light<00:06:32.620> but<00:06:32.830> I<00:06:32.860> had

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
didn't draw the cold light but I had

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.650 
didn't draw the cold light but I had
just<00:06:33.220> enough<00:06:33.430> damage<00:06:33.820> to<00:06:34.210> kill<00:06:34.390> him<00:06:34.510> right

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
just enough damage to kill him right

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.850 
just enough damage to kill him right
before<00:06:34.810> he<00:06:34.960> could<00:06:35.110> talk<00:06:35.290> tough<00:06:35.470> like<00:06:35.650> he

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
before he could talk tough like he

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.410 
before he could talk tough like he
likely<00:06:36.220> had<00:06:36.460> an<00:06:36.550> artisan<00:06:36.970> hand<00:06:37.150> if<00:06:37.240> you<00:06:37.300> got

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
likely had an artisan hand if you got

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.060 
likely had an artisan hand if you got
the<00:06:37.540> argus<00:06:37.810> down<00:06:37.990> the<00:06:38.500> following<00:06:38.650> turn<00:06:38.890> if<00:06:38.980> he

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 
the argus down the following turn if he

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.070 
the argus down the following turn if he
lived<00:06:39.250> an<00:06:39.340> extra<00:06:39.580> turn<00:06:39.760> then<00:06:40.600> he<00:06:40.900> probably

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
lived an extra turn then he probably

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.890 
lived an extra turn then he probably
would<00:06:41.290> have<00:06:41.350> just<00:06:41.410> beat<00:06:41.770> me<00:06:41.800> unless<00:06:42.370> I<00:06:42.520> drew<00:06:42.670> a

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
would have just beat me unless I drew a

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.050 
would have just beat me unless I drew a
flurry<00:06:43.900> soon<00:06:45.900> so<00:06:46.900> yeah
