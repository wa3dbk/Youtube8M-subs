00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
with the weave because first of all I

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.930 
with the weave because first of all I
didn't<00:02:40.530> even<00:02:40.560> get<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.830> perfect<00:02:41.280> color<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
didn't even get the perfect color the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.730 
didn't even get the perfect color the
color<00:02:42.180> was<00:02:42.360> as<00:02:42.480> close<00:02:42.690> as<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.960> could<00:02:43.020> get<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.710> my

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740

color was as close as I could get to my
true<00:02:44.040> color<00:02:44.280> um<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:47.180> tried<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.300> blend<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
braiding with the lock so it was the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.130

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
then after my lock finished I split the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.570 
then after my lock finished I split the
hair<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.990> three<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.830> again<00:02:59.250> I'll<00:02:59.430> do<00:02:59.550> a
