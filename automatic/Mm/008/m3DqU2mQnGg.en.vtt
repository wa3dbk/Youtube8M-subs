00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550
 where is taxable at all in Germany or in Innsbruck what is coming 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.490
 on full concentration we talk about the cross-border commuter issue 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.689
 the situation 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.779
 that someone living in Germany lives in Germany lives in Germany 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:13.589
 Germany 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.509
 but works for a Luxembourg employer 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.569
 in this situation the reward is too late 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.430
 depending on where the activity is carried out, it is exercised in Luxembourg 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.970
 taxed in Luxembourg 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.420
 if it is exercised in Germany completely or partly is accordingly also 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.060
 revealed 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.099
 is requested 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.159
 or in a third country, the taxation of the third country 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.460
 also falls back on the state of residence so on the state of residence 

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:42.979
 Germany's working life unless and here is only possible the 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.489
 Application of the under 83 rising scheme he would spend more than 183 days in 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.320
 Germany work 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.480
 It means that one imagines this and replace processors in Germany 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.809
 but that is 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.210
 pity and that on 4 because the weather changes everything subordinates this 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.079
 Possibility of subsequent taxation so for us it is each 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.420
 paid work 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.200
 and we naturally assume that a training will be a seminar 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.510
 also counts as working time and also paid by the employer 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.000
 For this reason, the irradiation is also in Germany 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 In case of sickness, being at home is Crytek's adequate time 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.010
 wage 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.780
 because what was broken 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.090
 as long as Dr. paid the sickness benefit from the employer as sick pay 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.740
 becomes 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.549
 l 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.410
 If the Alb also finds an order 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.250
 only when the sickness benefit was from 78 cents 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.640
 from the state side show the punishments Luxembourg 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.990
 the first add-on please to the message 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.990
 he exclaimed he had to wait approx 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.990
 not cancel jobs or how long does Burghof say 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.810
 for the probability quite large that percent that you are wrong 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.760
 black numbers 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.190
 now increased 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.830
 we have to differentiate there as there different cases he already has one 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.220
 Tax return for other reasons in Germany 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.650
 then we go back only four years 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.889
 he has not made any tax return at all 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.399
 then that looks right four years ago +3 so seven years 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:19.309
 Bayer and then you have to go back for this period 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.299
 first a readiness 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.659
 the topic readiness 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.739
 is in a letter from the Federal Ministry of Finance from the year 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.109
 2006 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.959
 a much later addressed and clarified 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.099
 Willingness is there to tax it must be paid off 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.999
 if I am in Germany at home then that puts it 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.419
 Taxation law for this time in fact to Germany 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.419
 even if I subsequently take up the service in Luxembourg 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.349
 real peculiarity 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.249
 Bethesda would have talked 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.859
 because trucks drive it is so there is an additional agreement to 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.689
 Double taxation agreement that should simplify the 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.489
 Simplification is there 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.209
 that you do not have to spend hours exactly on the day then 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.699
 but simply divides by percentage 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:14.069
 So yes example the driver was active in Luxembourg and so hour or 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.059
 two and later in Germany 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:20.709
 then we have two countries so that's the payroll for that day Red to 50 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.609
 Percent in Luxembourg and in German 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.229
 for Dr the three countries VMware Saxony Brokdorf on 30 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:32.079
 then three countries will be killed and one third will be in Luxembourg 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.349
 paid and two thirds of their in Germany because the third that he in 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.809
 France spends 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:41.239
 this right to tax also falls to Germany 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.709
 that is the peculiarity in the field of group drivers
