00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.529 
organized
you<00:01:41.130> need<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.520> realize<00:01:41.819> that<00:01:41.849> even<00:01:42.300> though

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
you need to realize that even though

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.350 
you need to realize that even though
this<00:01:42.660> is<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.869> great<00:01:42.959> pair<00:01:43.349> of<00:01:43.380> shoes<00:01:43.849> do<00:01:44.849> they

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
this is a great pair of shoes do they

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.210 
this is a great pair of shoes do they
really<00:01:45.660> need<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:46.110> taking<00:01:46.470> up<00:01:46.560> real<00:01:46.800> estate

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
really need to be taking up real estate

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.979 
really need to be taking up real estate
if<00:01:47.459> you<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.940> you're<00:01:48.209> not<00:01:48.360> wearing<00:01:48.750> them<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:48.989 
if you know you're not wearing them and

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:50.510 
if you know you're not wearing them and
the<00:01:49.110> proof<00:01:49.349> is<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.679> pudding<00:01:50.039> if<00:01:50.190> you<00:01:50.220> can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the proof is in the pudding if you can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
the proof is in the pudding if you can
wipe<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.819> dust<00:01:51.000> off<00:01:51.209> of<00:01:51.420> them<00:01:51.569> you<00:01:51.720> know

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
wipe the dust off of them you know

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.119 
wipe the dust off of them you know
you're<00:01:52.080> not<00:01:52.200> wearing<00:01:52.379> them<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.679> can't<00:01:52.950> argue

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:53.129 
you're not wearing them you can't argue

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.749 
you're not wearing them you can't argue
with<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
with that

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.639 
with that
so<00:01:54.030> these<00:01:54.539> are<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.050> ones<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.349> we<00:01:55.440> might

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
so these are the ones that we might

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.339 
so these are the ones that we might
donate<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.220> sell<00:01:56.520> or<00:01:56.849> throw<00:01:57.090> away<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.959> again

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
donate or sell or throw away so again

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:59.600 
donate or sell or throw away so again
we're<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.739> to<00:01:58.890> go<00:01:59.009> through<00:01:59.039> we're

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
we're just going to go through we're

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.339 
we're just going to go through we're
trying<00:01:59.879> all<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.270> our<00:02:00.390> shoes<00:02:00.629> on<00:02:00.899> we're

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
trying all of our shoes on we're

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:02.990 
trying all of our shoes on we're
figuring<00:02:01.709> out<00:02:02.099> what<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.429> want<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.879> with

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
figuring out what we want to do with

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.210 
figuring out what we want to do with
them<00:02:03.179> this<00:02:04.050> happens<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.890> women's

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
them this happens to be the women's

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.850 
them this happens to be the women's
version<00:02:05.729> over<00:02:06.090> here<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:06.720> again<00:02:06.869> we're<00:02:07.440> trying

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
version over here so again we're trying

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.089 
version over here so again we're trying
them<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.300> we're<00:02:09.300> making<00:02:09.599> sure<00:02:09.780> -<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.920> this

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
them on we're making sure - so like this

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.760 
them on we're making sure - so like this
is<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> great<00:02:11.640> example<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.770> flip-flop

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
is a great example this is a flip-flop

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.040 
is a great example this is a flip-flop
dress<00:02:14.129> sandal<00:02:14.819> type<00:02:15.060> section<00:02:15.330> over<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:15.870> and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
dress sandal type section over here and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.410 
dress sandal type section over here and
oftentimes<00:02:17.040> we<00:02:17.310> don't<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.730> two<00:02:17.969> shoes<00:02:18.239> that

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
oftentimes we don't have two shoes that

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.380 
oftentimes we don't have two shoes that
go<00:02:18.540> together<00:02:18.689> you<00:02:18.959> may<00:02:19.319> have<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
go together you may have one but not the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.140 
go together you may have one but not the
mate

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
mate

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.640 
mate
if<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.329> can't<00:02:22.629> find<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.019> mate<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.470> shoe

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
if you can't find the mate to the shoe

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.429 
if you can't find the mate to the shoe
it's<00:02:23.950> sort<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.280> hard<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.549> wear<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:26.200> goal

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
it's sort of hard to wear it so the goal

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.289 
it's sort of hard to wear it so the goal
in<00:02:26.620> today's<00:02:26.950> tidy<00:02:27.250> task<00:02:27.549> is<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.939> gather<00:02:28.090> all

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
in today's tidy task is to gather all

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.600 
in today's tidy task is to gather all
the<00:02:28.510> shoes<00:02:28.930> go<00:02:29.290> wherever<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:30.099> think<00:02:30.400> cheese

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the shoes go wherever you think cheese

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.460 
the shoes go wherever you think cheese
might<00:02:30.849> be<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.209> if<00:02:31.329> you<00:02:31.540> can't<00:02:31.810> find<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.230> mate

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
might be and if you can't find the mate

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.589 
might be and if you can't find the mate
chances<00:02:33.010> are<00:02:33.159> it's<00:02:33.430> ready<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.970> time<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.450> get

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
chances are it's ready in time to get

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.280 
chances are it's ready in time to get
rid<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.439> one<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.220> have<00:02:36.430> okay<00:02:36.849> I<00:02:37.290> know

rid of the one that you have okay I know
that's<00:02:38.530> hard<00:02:38.709> times<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.370> think<00:02:39.489> it's<00:02:39.640> gonna

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
that's hard times you think it's gonna

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.309 
that's hard times you think it's gonna
come<00:02:40.000> back<00:02:40.060> or<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.569> really<00:02:40.689> like<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.109> shoe

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
but if you can't find it today then you

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.599 
but if you can't find it today then you
need<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.049> get<00:02:44.170> rid<00:02:44.319> of<00:02:44.349> it<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:45.040> again<00:02:45.189> with<00:02:45.519> the

ones don't work we're also then setting

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.780 
ones don't work we're also then setting
our<00:02:52.090> limits<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:52.900> again<00:02:53.349> as<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.950> did<00:02:54.310> with<00:02:54.489> coats

keep<00:03:09.939> and<00:03:10.150> how<00:03:10.329> many<00:03:10.629> of<00:03:10.780> them<00:03:10.989> because<00:03:11.260> if

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
keep and how many of them because if

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.110 
keep and how many of them because if
you're<00:03:11.470> not<00:03:11.530> setting<00:03:11.980> limits<00:03:12.220> then<00:03:12.939> it's

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
you're not setting limits then it's

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.809 
you're not setting limits then it's
harder<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.480> harder<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.109> figure<00:03:14.290> out<00:03:14.459> when<00:03:15.459> you

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
harder and harder to figure out when you

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.369 
harder and harder to figure out when you
need<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.090> get<00:03:16.209> rid<00:03:16.359> of<00:03:16.389> shoes<00:03:16.689> other<00:03:17.019> than<00:03:17.260> the

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
need to get rid of shoes other than the

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.259 
need to get rid of shoes other than the
fact<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.739> they<00:03:18.099> might<00:03:18.489> not<00:03:18.639> work<00:03:18.819> or<00:03:19.090> they

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
fact that they might not work or they

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.580 
fact that they might not work or they
get<00:03:19.359> a<00:03:19.420> hole<00:03:19.629> in<00:03:19.659> the<00:03:19.900> bottom<00:03:20.170> of<00:03:20.290> them<00:03:20.500> or

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
get a hole in the bottom of them or

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.390 
get a hole in the bottom of them or
something<00:03:20.769> like<00:03:20.920> that

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
something like that

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.300 
something like that
so<00:03:21.599> today's<00:03:22.599> tiny<00:03:22.930> task<00:03:23.200> again<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.950> try<00:03:24.159> out

organizing your t-shirts one of the

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.199 
organizing your t-shirts one of the
organizing<00:03:33.190> tricks<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.549> may<00:03:33.669> have<00:03:33.879> heard<00:03:34.060> of

organizing tricks you may have heard of

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.659 
organizing tricks you may have heard of
is<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.739> hanger<00:03:36.069> is<00:03:36.129> usually<00:03:36.459> kind<00:03:36.639> of

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
is that the hanger is usually kind of

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.089 
is that the hanger is usually kind of
all<00:03:36.819> faced<00:03:37.120> one<00:03:37.389> direction<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:38.349> if<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.680> turn

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
all faced one direction but if you turn

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.610 
all faced one direction but if you turn
the<00:03:39.400> hanger<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.329> opposite<00:03:40.870> direction<00:03:41.139> on<00:03:41.440> the

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.319 
rod so that it's facing away from you

the backwards direction to the proper

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.069 
the backwards direction to the proper

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
shirts but there's still one that's

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.229 
shirts but there's still one that's
hanging<00:04:00.010> backwards<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.639> it's<00:04:00.729> been<00:04:00.940> six

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
hanging backwards and it's been six

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.270 
hanging backwards and it's been six
months<00:04:01.359> so<00:04:02.169> I'm<00:04:02.440> gonna<00:04:02.560> go<00:04:02.739> ahead<00:04:02.859> and<00:04:02.979> toss

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
months so I'm gonna go ahead and toss

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.800 
months so I'm gonna go ahead and toss
that<00:04:03.519> because<00:04:03.699> I<00:04:03.790> know<00:04:03.849> I<00:04:03.970> haven't<00:04:04.269> worn<00:04:04.599> it

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
that because I know I haven't worn it

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.990 
that because I know I haven't worn it
well<00:04:05.739> shoes<00:04:05.979> are<00:04:06.159> sort<00:04:06.370> of<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.579> same<00:04:06.790> way<00:04:06.970> I

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
well shoes are sort of the same way I

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.539 
well shoes are sort of the same way I
think<00:04:07.239> sometimes<00:04:08.169> and<00:04:08.440> maybe<00:04:08.919> women<00:04:09.220> are<00:04:09.459> more

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
think sometimes and maybe women are more

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.729 
think sometimes and maybe women are more
guilty<00:04:09.909> of<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.150> than<00:04:10.389> men<00:04:10.599> we<00:04:10.959> don't<00:04:11.199> wear

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
guilty of this than men we don't wear

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.309 
guilty of this than men we don't wear
our<00:04:11.769> shoes<00:04:12.250> all<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.609> time<00:04:12.849> and<00:04:13.180> we<00:04:13.690> should<00:04:14.109> be

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
our shoes all the time and we should be

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.560 
our shoes all the time and we should be
so<00:04:14.530> if<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:14.799> have<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.370> lot<00:04:15.849> of<00:04:16.000> pairs<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.269> sandals

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
so if you have a lot of pairs of sandals

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.270 
so if you have a lot of pairs of sandals
and<00:04:17.079> you're<00:04:17.409> not<00:04:17.590> wearing<00:04:17.769> them<00:04:18.070> on<00:04:18.220> our

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.099 
and you're not wearing them on our
regular<00:04:18.669> basis<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.269> they're<00:04:19.419> taking<00:04:19.810> up<00:04:19.930> real

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
regular basis and they're taking up real

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.500 
regular basis and they're taking up real
estate<00:04:20.139> for<00:04:20.709> something<00:04:21.039> else<00:04:21.250> or<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:22.360> could

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
estate for something else or you could

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.060 
estate for something else or you could
be<00:04:22.630> selling<00:04:23.080> them<00:04:23.199> and<00:04:23.380> making<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.710> little<00:04:23.949> bit

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
be selling them and making a little bit

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.310 
be selling them and making a little bit
of<00:04:24.190> extra<00:04:24.490> money<00:04:24.639> something<00:04:25.060> like<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:26.050> a

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
of extra money something like that so a

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.810 
of extra money something like that so a
couple<00:04:26.650> of<00:04:26.830> tips<00:04:27.010> that<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.340> could<00:04:27.490> do<00:04:27.639> for

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
couple of tips that you could do for

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.600 
couple of tips that you could do for
this<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:28.389> could<00:04:28.659> if<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.260> usually<00:04:29.770> store<00:04:30.310> your

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 
shoes this way you could turn them

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.270 
shoes this way you could turn them
around<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:33.130> way<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.550> then<00:04:33.909> you<00:04:33.940> would

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.700 
you would store them you know the proper
way<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.840> would<00:04:38.960> know<00:04:39.139> that<00:04:39.170> they've<00:04:39.500> been

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
way and you would know that they've been

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.560 
way and you would know that they've been
worn<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.160> in<00:04:40.610> issues<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.000> we're<00:04:41.300> still

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
worn and in issues that we're still

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.000 
worn and in issues that we're still
facing<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:42.050> way<00:04:42.230> after<00:04:42.350> six<00:04:42.710> months<00:04:42.860> you

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
facing that way after six months you

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.860 
facing that way after six months you
would<00:04:43.160> know<00:04:43.370> you've<00:04:43.550> not<00:04:43.760> worn<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.270> you<00:04:44.690> could

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
would know you've not worn and you could

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.840 
would know you've not worn and you could
go<00:04:44.990> ahead<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.290> donate<00:04:45.710> them<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.310> other<00:04:46.520> tip

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
go ahead and donate them the other tip

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.930 
go ahead and donate them the other tip
that<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.120> might<00:04:47.300> try<00:04:47.570> is<00:04:48.760> tying<00:04:49.760> the

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
that you might try is tying the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.220 
that you might try is tying the
shoelaces<00:04:50.389> together<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:51.200> taking<00:04:51.710> both

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
shoelaces together so taking both

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.570 
shoelaces together so taking both
shoelaces<00:04:54.230> and<00:04:54.590> just<00:04:54.800> tying<00:04:55.010> them<00:04:55.220> in<00:04:55.280> a<00:04:55.400> knot

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
shoelaces and just tying them in a knot

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.240 
shoelaces and just tying them in a knot
so<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.120> they're<00:04:56.360> actually<00:04:56.810> connected

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
so that they're actually connected

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.070 
so that they're actually connected
because<00:04:58.250> chances<00:04:59.150> are<00:04:59.300> you<00:04:59.419> don't<00:04:59.510> store<00:05:00.050> your

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
because chances are you don't store your

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.600 
because chances are you don't store your
shoes<00:05:00.260> like<00:05:00.560> this<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:00.980> if<00:05:01.040> you<00:05:01.160> do<00:05:01.310> then

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
shoes like this and if you do then

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.790 
shoes like this and if you do then
you'll<00:05:02.300> have<00:05:02.389> to<00:05:02.540> try<00:05:02.690> something<00:05:02.900> else<00:05:03.110> so<00:05:03.560> tie

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
you'll have to try something else so tie

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.530 
you'll have to try something else so tie
your<00:05:03.980> shoes<00:05:04.160> together<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.820> store<00:05:05.150> them<00:05:05.330> if

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
your shoes together and store them if

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.390 
your shoes together and store them if
they<00:05:05.690> have<00:05:05.840> laces<00:05:06.260> obviously<00:05:06.800> with<00:05:07.280> the

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
they have laces obviously with the

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.190 
they have laces obviously with the
flip-flops<00:05:07.850> that's<00:05:08.150> not<00:05:08.360> gonna<00:05:08.510> work<00:05:08.720> but<00:05:08.930> tie

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
flip-flops that's not gonna work but tie

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.980 
flip-flops that's not gonna work but tie
them<00:05:09.380> together<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:10.100> then<00:05:10.520> if<00:05:10.970> in<00:05:11.390> six<00:05:11.660> months

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
them together and then if in six months

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.600 
them together and then if in six months
these<00:05:12.200> shoes<00:05:12.470> are<00:05:12.620> still<00:05:12.860> tied<00:05:13.100> together<00:05:13.250> it

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
these shoes are still tied together it

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.800 
these shoes are still tied together it
means<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:13.940> haven't<00:05:14.120> worn<00:05:14.419> them<00:05:14.540> and<00:05:14.720> it's

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
means you haven't worn them and it's

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.390 
means you haven't worn them and it's
probably<00:05:15.200> time<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.440> get<00:05:15.680> rid<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:15.890> them

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
probably time to get rid of them

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.270 
probably time to get rid of them
tidy<00:05:17.180> task<00:05:17.480> for<00:05:17.690> today<00:05:17.720> was<00:05:18.110> shoes<00:05:18.440> so<00:05:19.040> we<00:05:19.100> want

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
tidy task for today was shoes so we want

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.980 
tidy task for today was shoes so we want
to<00:05:19.340> go<00:05:19.400> ahead<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:19.669> try<00:05:19.850> them<00:05:20.030> gather<00:05:20.419> them<00:05:20.870> all

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
to go ahead and try them gather them all

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.750 
to go ahead and try them gather them all
together<00:05:21.169> try<00:05:22.040> them<00:05:22.250> on

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
together try them on

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.460 
together try them on
decide<00:05:23.300> what<00:05:23.540> ones<00:05:23.780> we're<00:05:23.960> going<00:05:24.110> to<00:05:24.230> keep

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
decide what ones we're going to keep

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.960 
decide what ones we're going to keep
which<00:05:24.710> ones<00:05:24.919> we're<00:05:25.100> going<00:05:25.250> to<00:05:25.430> get<00:05:25.550> rid<00:05:25.700> of<00:05:25.729> and

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
which ones we're going to get rid of and

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.780 
which ones we're going to get rid of and
then<00:05:26.450> storing<00:05:26.930> them<00:05:27.229> so<00:05:27.500> storing<00:05:28.130> shoes<00:05:28.160> is

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
then storing them so storing shoes is

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.390 
then storing them so storing shoes is
very<00:05:29.600> unique<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.290> a<00:05:30.500> little<00:05:30.860> bit<00:05:30.979> more<00:05:31.160> tricky

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
very unique and a little bit more tricky

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.610 
very unique and a little bit more tricky
because<00:05:31.640> you<00:05:31.850> have<00:05:31.940> so<00:05:32.210> many<00:05:32.330> choices<00:05:32.660> this<00:05:33.560> is

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
because you have so many choices this is

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.610 
because you have so many choices this is
a<00:05:33.800> shoe<00:05:34.100> rack<00:05:34.250> which<00:05:34.550> is<00:05:34.700> fabulous<00:05:35.229> it<00:05:36.229> gets

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
a shoe rack which is fabulous it gets

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.620 
a shoe rack which is fabulous it gets
the<00:05:36.889> vertical<00:05:37.340> space<00:05:37.639> for<00:05:38.000> you<00:05:38.210> so<00:05:38.479> you're

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
the vertical space for you so you're

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.500 
the vertical space for you so you're
able<00:05:38.780> to<00:05:38.960> have<00:05:39.260> in<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:39.950> small<00:05:40.460> footprint<00:05:41.060> to<00:05:41.300> see

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
able to have in a small footprint to see

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.090 
able to have in a small footprint to see
as<00:05:41.720> you<00:05:41.840> can<00:05:41.990> see<00:05:42.169> here<00:05:42.410> this<00:05:42.560> one<00:05:42.770> has<00:05:42.950> an

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
as you can see here this one has an

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.620 
as you can see here this one has an
extra<00:05:43.190> shelf<00:05:43.700> on<00:05:43.880> it<00:05:44.000> so<00:05:44.150> in<00:05:44.240> a<00:05:44.360> small

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
extra shelf on it so in a small

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.450 
extra shelf on it so in a small
footprint<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.200> can<00:05:45.290> get<00:05:45.560> quite<00:05:45.979> a<00:05:46.010> bit<00:05:46.430> of

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
footprint you can get quite a bit of

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.730 
footprint you can get quite a bit of
storage<00:05:47.090> out<00:05:47.390> of<00:05:47.510> it<00:05:47.630> but<00:05:48.110> there<00:05:48.260> are<00:05:48.410> several

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
storage out of it but there are several

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.140 
storage out of it but there are several
other<00:05:49.010> ways<00:05:49.070> that<00:05:49.430> you<00:05:49.490> can<00:05:49.760> store<00:05:49.970> your<00:05:50.120> shoes

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
other ways that you can store your shoes

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.640 
other ways that you can store your shoes
so<00:05:50.539> we're<00:05:50.690> going<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:50.840> show<00:05:51.020> you<00:05:51.050> just<00:05:51.169> a<00:05:51.440> color

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
so we're going to show you just a color

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.860 
so we're going to show you just a color
a<00:05:51.890> couple<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.550> other<00:05:52.700> quick<00:05:53.060> ways<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.360> do<00:05:53.750> that

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
a couple of other quick ways to do that

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.659 
a couple of other quick ways to do that
so<00:05:54.260> that<00:05:54.440> you<00:05:54.470> can<00:05:54.680> see<00:05:54.800> your<00:05:54.950> options<00:05:55.130> for

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
so that you can see your options for

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.140 
so that you can see your options for
organizing<00:05:55.880> your<00:05:56.360> shoes<00:05:57.700> okay<00:05:58.700> so<00:05:58.760> we<00:05:59.000> were

organizing your shoes okay so we were
looking<00:05:59.330> at<00:05:59.630> shoes<00:05:59.900> that<00:06:00.169> were<00:06:00.229> on<00:06:00.380> a<00:06:00.410> shoe

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
looking at shoes that were on a shoe

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.980 
looking at shoes that were on a shoe
rack<00:06:00.950> and<00:06:01.250> this<00:06:01.430> is<00:06:01.669> a<00:06:01.700> unique<00:06:02.210> idea<00:06:02.600> to<00:06:02.840> be

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
rack and this is a unique idea to be

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.170 
rack and this is a unique idea to be
putting<00:06:03.229> your<00:06:03.320> shoes<00:06:03.620> in<00:06:03.860> drawer<00:06:04.370> organizers
