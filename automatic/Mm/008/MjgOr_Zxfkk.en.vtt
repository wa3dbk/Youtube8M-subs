00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 and at the price inclusion went update 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.510
 android and we see what is happening now 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.640
 application optimization 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.710
 also want to note an important thing if you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 will update your devices then 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.759
 be sure to take care of her 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.009
 was well charged because the process 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.049
 system update takes some 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.729
 certain time if at this moment y 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.560
 you sit down the battery then you just 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.110
 just maybe don't turn on your 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.920
 the device is generally proposed to enter 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:36.090
 pin I immediately see that the interface is already 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.479
 changed here also look into the interface 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.479
 under me 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.150
 This device slows down well and 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.810
 we see our updated android 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.000
 devices 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.730
 I look so what labels were 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.600
 changed the widget too so us here 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.060
 gps search in progress 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.690

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.780
 I now have a version of android 4 2 1 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.380

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.780
 send an application update firing everything 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.640
 upgrade but if you have not had time 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.290
 update your android device then by 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.640
