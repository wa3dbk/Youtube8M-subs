00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.610
 I also brought you something 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.460
 and a photo of me at the public 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.530
 viewing what you also what outside I sew 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.549
 I was not outside but it was 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.100
 a big group 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.820
 oh sometimes I ask to exchange new ones 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.439
 judges together in any case 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.680
 funny how was the mood with you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.990
 great so the were completely out of the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.599
 little houses all know what football 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.170
 yes yes, right or just like that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.350
 dangerous half-knowledge 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.940
 We also have the people to guest and 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.649
 yes, I have to say honestly bailando 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.390
 was one of my favorite songs 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.390
 I heard that up and down 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.370
 that was all there for a long time and so on 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.899
 was great more and there I think I am 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.790
 Having grown up with my girlfriend I 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.159
 have to mini playback show or to 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.619
 done explained but that was why 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.009
 I'm even more disappointed than some 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.200
 time the thing with gina-lisa was there 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.820
 I was really great maybe it was like this 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.100
 one that i thought i would like 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.940
 take her and when she gets up and that 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.460
 you are not you really wanted 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.840
 also be with her 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.350
 dear with now gina-lisa so much 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.810
 is certain 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.880
 was that again in front of gina lisa 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.649
 There was no shit or was gina 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.810
 lisa then still okay not believe she was 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.030
 there was a bit there yet 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.509
 change, I think so rough or so 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.300
 foul 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.490
 if it's foul but why do you do that? 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.979
 It was and such a cry for hello 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.220
 Here I am again we are here 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.440
 Not 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.580
 No, but there were really hear 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.470
 feelings in the game 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.440
 I can now enlightened that that 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.039
 It is not told that they are higher 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.590
 enlightened 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:59.959
 as soon as I have seen ask yes I know 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.420
 that was also intentional she goes 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.920
 There is, of course, because it will 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.200
 still rumored with me though 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.849
 next year a nice report 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.099
 given so i have to micro yes 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:15.170
 moment I have not needed yet 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.720
 I have to listen and then I have to 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.120
 laugh because it is still clear 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.770
 people's blankets so people think what 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.080
 was there though, although last year I was 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.270
 probably gave a nice interview 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.849
 but you are still bisexual or 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.410
 So I mean you had a man and 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.290
 after that you had the test field of power 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.970
 with gina-lisa and how is that now 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.800
 so if you look at football you look 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.990
 look at the player women or the 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.770
 footballer 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:46.540
 So who are you more interested in? 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:49.150
 win madness yes 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.830
 but I am really I want 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.510
 like again to say are 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.370
 slipped in both china and me 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.330
 designed to open when using a 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.340
 a little bit of fun has to be 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.650
 she was given black while 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.240
 camera have run and this black 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.280
 was then a relationship next 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.750
 time oh well there we thought oh so 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.550
 We will pay close attention to it 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.620
 yes, but then as it is then comes 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.910
 you can not get out and that's the way it is 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.730
 then actually a bit 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.200
 so poor is then we have one time 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.670
 interview must have been there 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.080
 not met because he was 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.530
 less and less they are together 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.190
 or not 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.170
 it was real or something 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.510
 always 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.790
 Germany's number one Simone Ballack 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.640
 versys kathi fischer we have 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.720
 checked in and have always asked simon 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.720
 what's going on there 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.130
 hi howdy there's a lot going on 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.710
 just you ne're on the image on the 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:50.160
 first page I've seen but thing 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.910
 but how did this video come about? 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.760
 came the 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.590
 I was actually from such a funny one 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.150
 Round out we have so in my 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.470
 Restaurant sat in Kaiserslautern 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.960
 and now that evening one with one 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.490
 few friends together and you can 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.490
 me already a bit hand 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.290
 now also always visits 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.460
 Then we had the laptop standing 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.210
 and then we are somehow on this 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.590
 Column been clicked on it and 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.630
 so that these videos are viewed and me 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.260
 Of course I can do the same academy 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.820
 also yes and in the channel is andy 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.200
 on it and has just with 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.790
 felt there are such a few videos 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.270
 originated from a network necessarily 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.700
 wanted 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.560
 may cost the command funny and so 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.710
 not of course synonymous clearly funny yes 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.830
 the post is indeed in any case 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.170
 Germany is talking about this video 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.930
 star hate mei what kicked off 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.790
 yes you have to, of course, must now 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.630
 of course also live with the criticism yes 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.070
 Of course that's clear where the sun is too 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.950
 rain is always like this 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.570
 but in principle there are many people who 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.110
 find it funny and me with gary 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.810
 phoned yesterday and all well so 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.980
 that's the most important thing for me 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.310
 huskies new video seen 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.590
 the message to you today I 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.810
 See you tomorrow and you will become you 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.810
 who follow the advice 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.320
 of course a bit, but I think so 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.390
 I prefer that 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.370
 I let it now be simply good times 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.990
 because now is really enough about it 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.970
 I think the boys should now 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.560
 Just play football and rest 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.700
 play football and we have real 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.610
 probably not upset either way 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.440
 a nonsense and yes the idea me 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.630
 think max is synonymous yes is synonymous believe 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.490
 I hurt and I think that is 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.020
 now just more important that now 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.490
 gets back on its feet and has to 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.950
 not with any video 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.950
