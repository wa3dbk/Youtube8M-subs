00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and then there is a magnifying you can

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.520 
and then there is a magnifying you can
kind<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> difference<00:01:40.290> look<00:01:40.409> at<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
you can tell a pretty decent difference

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.770 
you can tell a pretty decent difference
there<00:01:49.759> but<00:01:50.759> anyways<00:01:51.240> that's<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> makeup

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
there but anyways that's the makeup

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.420 
there but anyways that's the makeup
mirror<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.439> said<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> got<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.920> at<00:01:52.979> Sally's<00:01:53.310> I

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
mirror like I said I got it at Sally's I

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.030 
mirror like I said I got it at Sally's I
think<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.700> was<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:53.970> 30<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.570> 40<00:01:54.600> dollars<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.649> it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
think it was like 30 or 40 dollars so it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.980 
think it was like 30 or 40 dollars so it
was<00:01:56.369> still<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.759> cheaper<00:01:57.240> end<00:01:57.270> all<00:01:57.689> things
