 in a final 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.859
 it's a hell of a point 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.469
 We have 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.079
 the privileged technique is the type of home harm on the team of the

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.680
 the court is the first since they did with their multiples 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.889
 wounds 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.179
 the doctor gives me a slap it was his destiny 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.179
 tonight we live older why kicking ourselves 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.299
 t 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.569
 but not for a set of three examples of situations 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.049
 we write 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.049
 we are eight yards 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:28.069
 the dodged as you want 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.069

 confined 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.789
 the ofs 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.819
 the man whose age oscillates 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.959
 starting eleven 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.860
 faure 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.080
 it's in full light 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.080
 it's through this forum in switzerland but i know it's going to be obvious 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.990
 but I quickly gave up 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.639
 we must make this meaning simple 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.639
 no ease things 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.279
 second attempt 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.050
 we are not after three years now 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.050
 to receive every day that can be done 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.339
 Happiness is followed by Europe 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.669
 the files are missing 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.529
 these situations 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.300
 harry 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.879
 in a statement 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.389
 now the first problem of a new life that will put more 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.389
 logical 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.160
 I spend partner at folio five modes solutions stonesoft 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:15.949
 it's a technique 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.550
 maybe every day 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.600
 it happened the body in which the civilians and the neighbors were lost 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.610
 But it feels good 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.520
 before you leave 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.169
 the second stage of piracy 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.479
 it's an end 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.490
 I would like you to avoid 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.789
 it's me who criticizes 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.789
 trichet why 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.839
 is a huge job base 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:47.289
 a big breakdown of google 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:48.589
 Unfortunately no 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:49.659
 if the man 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.809
 was building cowards
