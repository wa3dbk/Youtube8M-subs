that<00:03:05.580> were<00:03:05.730> made<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:08.280> could<00:03:08.489> be<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> hundred

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
that were made this could be a hundred

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.440 
that were made this could be a hundred
years<00:03:08.970> old<00:03:09.270> but<00:03:09.570> it's<00:03:09.989> not<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> good<00:03:10.530> violin<00:03:11.450> but

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
years old but it's not a good violin but

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.960 
years old but it's not a good violin but
it's<00:03:12.570> pretty<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.370> says<00:03:15.350> Antonius

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970

Stradivarius<00:03:18.620> Cremona<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:21.390> think<00:03:21.630> they

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
Stradivarius Cremona and I think they

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.140 
Stradivarius Cremona and I think they
even<00:03:21.900> stamped<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.890> date<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.310> there

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.760 

17:26<00:03:27.150> which<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.870> don't<00:03:28.140> know<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.410> think<00:03:28.680> that

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
17:26 which I don't know I think that

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.170 
17:26 which I don't know I think that
might<00:03:28.920> be<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.070> bit<00:03:29.280> late<00:03:29.459> for<00:03:29.489> Stradivarius

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
might be a bit late for Stradivarius

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.080 
might be a bit late for Stradivarius
anyway<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.530> sawed<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.190> off<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.580> neck<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
anyway so I sawed it off the neck of the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.960 
anyway so I sawed it off the neck of the
violin<00:03:36.800> drilled<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:37.980> hole<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.459> size<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:38.880> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
violin drilled a hole the size of the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.190 
violin drilled a hole the size of the
dowel<00:03:39.530> into<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.620> body<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.070> violin<00:03:42.200> stuck

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
dowel into the body of the violin stuck

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.550 
it on with glue
I<00:03:47.069> took<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.250> bridge<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.319> violin<00:03:50.799> and

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
I took the bridge of the violin and

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.589 
I took the bridge of the violin and
violin<00:03:53.560> bridges<00:03:53.890> are<00:03:54.040> curved<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.849> follow<00:03:55.239> the

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
violin bridges are curved to follow the

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.880 
violin bridges are curved to follow the
the<00:03:56.319> curve<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.720> original<00:03:59.440> neck<00:03:59.620> but<00:03:59.799> I

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
the curve of the original neck but I

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.819 
the curve of the original neck but I
straightened<00:04:00.159> it<00:04:00.400> out<00:04:01.049> still<00:04:02.049> kept<00:04:02.319> it<00:04:02.530> a

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
straightened it out still kept it a

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.619 
straightened it out still kept it a
little<00:04:03.129> bit<00:04:03.310> slanted<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:04.120> kind<00:04:04.299> of<00:04:04.360> give<00:04:04.510> it

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
little bit slanted to kind of give it

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.539 
little bit slanted to kind of give it
that<00:04:04.659> violin<00:04:05.260> feel<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.629> neck<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:09.340> that's

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
that violin feel for the neck so that's

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:15.930
