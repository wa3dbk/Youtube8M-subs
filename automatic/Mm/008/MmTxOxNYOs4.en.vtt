00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the leader of the back for how I see it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.560

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.420 
said you're talking evening goal with
the<00:01:37.290> hair<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.650> courts<00:01:37.920> where<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.130> talk<00:01:38.310> about

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the hair and courts where you talk about

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
the hair and courts where you talk about
fine<00:01:38.729> margins<00:01:39.210> sometimes<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> both

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
fine margins sometimes because the both

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.800 
fine margins sometimes because the both
had<00:01:40.950> brilliant<00:01:41.280> first<00:01:42.150> six<00:01:42.420> months<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
had brilliant first six months of the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.149 
had brilliant first six months of the
season<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.799> sort<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.040> say

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
season so it's not as if we sort of say

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.350 
season so it's not as if we sort of say
we<00:01:44.280> don't<00:01:44.399> rate<00:01:44.670> all<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.820> players<00:01:45.119> when<00:01:45.299> we

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
we don't rate all the players when we

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.120 
we don't rate all the players when we
pick<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.409> put<00:01:46.590> your<00:01:46.710> neck

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
pick one you just have to put your neck

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.620 
pick one you just have to put your neck
on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> line<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.549> think<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.000> kale<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.450> Terry

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
on the line I think that kale and Terry

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
on the line I think that kale and Terry
have<00:01:49.170> been<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> best<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.799> centre<00:01:50.100> backs<00:01:50.280> this

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
have been the best to centre backs this

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.319 
have been the best to centre backs this
season<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> pair

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
season as a pair

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.910 
season as a pair
I<00:01:51.360> suppose<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.960> easy<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.290> me<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> judge<00:01:52.710> them

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I suppose it's easy for me to judge them

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.139 
I suppose it's easy for me to judge them
because<00:01:53.100> we're<00:01:53.220> watching<00:01:53.310> them<00:01:53.549> together<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
because we're watching them together and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.789 
because we're watching them together and
we<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:54.600> how<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.810> play<00:01:54.930> together<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.560> bowls

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
we see how they play together as bowls

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.830 
we see how they play together as bowls
with<00:01:55.950> font<00:01:56.189> he<00:01:56.759> has<00:01:57.030> done<00:01:57.240> really<00:01:57.420> well<00:01:57.630> he's

those stats of the public at the
fàbregas<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.220> think<00:02:45.400> what<00:02:45.790> fàbregas<00:02:46.150> has<00:02:46.299> given

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
fàbregas I think what fàbregas has given

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.050 
fàbregas I think what fàbregas has given
us<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:46.780> what<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:46.959> would<00:02:47.049> have<00:02:47.200> expected<00:02:47.910> for<00:02:48.910> me

us is what I would have expected for me

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.490 
us is what I would have expected for me
Schneiderlin<00:02:49.569> if<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.780> put<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.230> put<00:02:50.319> the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
Schneiderlin if I put if you put the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.650 
Schneiderlin if I put if you put the
team<00:02:50.739> up<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.190> think<00:02:51.670> Jamie's<00:02:52.120> team's<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.450> little

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
team up I think Jamie's team's a little

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.449 
team up I think Jamie's team's a little
bit<00:02:52.750> open<00:02:53.049> in<00:02:53.170> midfield<00:02:53.319> with<00:02:53.680> Sanchez<00:02:54.099> hazard

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
bit open in midfield with Sanchez hazard

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.190 
bit open in midfield with Sanchez hazard
and<00:02:54.670> Fabregas<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.569> I've<00:02:55.660> just<00:02:55.690> gone<00:02:55.930> for<00:02:56.140> the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
and Fabregas so I've just gone for the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.110 
and Fabregas so I've just gone for the
two<00:02:56.349> holding<00:02:56.739> midfield<00:02:57.069> Zadok<00:02:57.370> snidely<00:02:57.879> in

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
two holding midfield Zadok snidely in

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.270 
two holding midfield Zadok snidely in
terms<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.599> impact<00:02:59.110> on<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.410> team<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.739> know<00:02:59.950> you

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280

I<00:03:01.180> think<00:03:01.720> Schneider<00:03:02.079> in<00:03:02.290> there<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:03.280> man<00:03:03.489> at

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
I think Schneider in there is the man at

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.119 
I think Schneider in there is the man at
Southampton<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.780> think<00:03:04.959> he<00:03:05.170> comes<00:03:05.440> out<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.890> could

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
Southampton I think he comes out I could

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.559 
Southampton I think he comes out I could
hold<00:03:06.340> onto<00:03:06.459> him<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.670> generate<00:03:07.060> Rock<00:03:07.360> they're

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
hold onto him and generate Rock they're

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.420 
hold onto him and generate Rock they're
gonna<00:03:07.690> get<00:03:07.870> absolutely<00:03:08.500> bombarded<00:03:09.310> in

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
gonna get absolutely bombarded in

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.890
