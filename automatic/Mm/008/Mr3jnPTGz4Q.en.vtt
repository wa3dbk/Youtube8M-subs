hooked<00:02:02.969> up<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.360> Bluetooth<00:02:03.990> keyboard<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:05.159> our<00:02:05.280> PS

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
hooked up a Bluetooth keyboard to our PS

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.070 
hooked up a Bluetooth keyboard to our PS
Vita<00:02:05.820> TV<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.450> was<00:02:06.719> extremely<00:02:07.560> simple<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:09.080> I

think it's going to be really useful
especially<00:02:11.430> if<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.910> use<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.330> browser<00:02:12.540> or<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
especially if you use the browser or the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.700 
especially if you use the browser or the
email<00:02:13.319> function

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
email function

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.800

on<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.890> PS<00:02:14.160> Vita<00:02:14.190> TV<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:15.120> think<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.570> going<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.750> be

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
on a PS Vita TV I think it's going to be

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.550 
on a PS Vita TV I think it's going to be
infinitely<00:02:16.500> easier<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:18.270> type<00:02:18.540> using<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
infinitely easier to type using the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.890 
infinitely easier to type using the
keyboard<00:02:19.770> then<00:02:20.130> using<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.730> dual<00:02:20.940> shock<00:02:21.210> 3<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.870> I

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
keyboard then using a dual shock 3 so I

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.880 
keyboard then using a dual shock 3 so I
hope<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.200> found<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.500> really<00:02:22.620> useful<00:02:22.880> thanks
