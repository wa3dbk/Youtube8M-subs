00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.210
 the character called his name is chalk house and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.619
 he wins it all for his discoveries 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.609

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:32.070

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.440
 jar of tones and we can now next 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.620
 quest and execute let's see what 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:43.290
 they demand from us something better than a joke 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.920
 bible reading no gotta do 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.629
 this quest it takes 8 hours so what 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 did milhouse cook for us so run 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.030

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.850

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.420

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.210
 want to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.000
 so far so basically we gathered 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.490
 everything from our homes and now it seems to me 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.790
 that we already have such a small town 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.340
 under turned out and soon we will need 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.610
 expand and feel because here 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.700
 a couple more houses and everything is on it 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:35.009
 end our place expand here 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.680
 it seems not difficult so I remind you that we still 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.630
 need to reach 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.990
 11 11 levels 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.149
 but I think it will be in a week 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.470
 maybe because it's not zadrot 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.110
 draw and so I go there to perform 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.689
 some speeds or to do 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.290
 new release 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:02.549

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.310
 reach level 11 faster and this one already 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.680
