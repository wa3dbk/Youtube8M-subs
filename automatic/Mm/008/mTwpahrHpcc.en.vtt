install<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.979> any<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> these<00:01:08.850> parts<00:01:10.040> we

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
install it and any one of these parts we

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.480 
install it and any one of these parts we
get<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> new<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.850> install<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:13.159> any<00:01:14.159> part

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
get a new one you install it in any part

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.539 
get a new one you install it in any part
or<00:01:14.700> does<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.150> matter<00:01:17.360> basically<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:19.340> has<00:01:20.340> to

which<00:05:39.300> is<00:05:39.630> all<00:05:39.870> lined<00:05:40.110> up<00:05:40.320> all<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.710> pins<00:05:40.980> are

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
which is all lined up all the pins are

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.960 
which is all lined up all the pins are
lined<00:05:41.460> up<00:05:42.020> let's<00:05:43.020> find<00:05:43.320> up<00:05:43.590> over<00:05:44.550> here<00:05:44.700> on<00:05:44.850> the

all the clips are in our sepehr it off

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.249 
all the clips are in our sepehr it off
this<00:05:57.850> part<00:05:58.180> is<00:05:58.300> right<00:05:58.930> now<00:06:00.690> but<00:06:01.690> something's

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259
