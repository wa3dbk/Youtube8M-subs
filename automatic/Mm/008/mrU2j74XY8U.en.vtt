than<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.080> previous<00:02:38.500> versions<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.040> my<00:02:39.130> opinion

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
than the previous versions in my opinion

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.540 
than the previous versions in my opinion
GTA<00:02:40.270> was<00:02:40.540> kind<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:40.990> a<00:02:41.080> bad<00:02:41.290> port<00:02:41.740> to<00:02:42.010> begin<00:02:42.310> with

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
GTA was kind of a bad port to begin with

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.760 
GTA was kind of a bad port to begin with
so<00:02:42.760> I'll<00:02:43.090> take<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.570> 30<00:02:43.810> FPS<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.560> get<00:02:44.710> with

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
so I'll take the 30 FPS that I get with

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.800 
so I'll take the 30 FPS that I get with
my<00:02:44.830> setup<00:02:45.220> which<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.850> definitely<00:02:46.360> playable

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
my setup which is definitely playable

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.840 
my setup which is definitely playable
the<00:02:47.470> whole<00:02:47.620> cloud<00:02:47.890> system<00:02:48.280> has<00:02:48.400> been<00:02:48.490> revamped

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
the whole cloud system has been revamped

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.490 
the whole cloud system has been revamped
and<00:02:49.120> that's<00:02:49.600> always<00:02:49.750> been<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:49.990> problem<00:02:50.200> with

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
and that's always been a problem with

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.260 
and that's always been a problem with
people<00:02:50.620> who<00:02:50.740> try<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:51.070> make<00:02:51.190> graphics<00:02:51.730> mods<00:02:52.090> for

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
people who try to make graphics mods for

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.720 
people who try to make graphics mods for
this<00:02:52.360> games<00:02:52.600> but<00:02:53.320> this<00:02:53.470> came<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:53.980> it's<00:02:54.130> nice<00:02:54.610> to

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
this games but this came so it's nice to

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.990 
this games but this came so it's nice to
see<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.000> was<00:02:55.180> properly<00:02:55.770> adjusted

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
see that it was properly adjusted

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.860 
see that it was properly adjusted
obviously<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.120> whole<00:02:58.270> lighting<00:02:58.450> system<00:02:58.840> was

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
obviously the whole lighting system was

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.840 
obviously the whole lighting system was
improved<00:02:59.290> for<00:02:59.650> all<00:02:59.770> times<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.370> day<00:03:00.580> and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
improved for all times of the day and

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.210 
improved for all times of the day and
weather<00:03:01.390> forecasts<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.410> still<00:03:02.830> think<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.040> game

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
weather forecasts I still think the game

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.370 
weather forecasts I still think the game
looks<00:03:03.250> best<00:03:03.670> though<00:03:03.910> at<00:03:04.120> sunrise<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.930> sunset

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
looks best though at sunrise and sunset

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.740 
looks best though at sunrise and sunset
with<00:03:05.920> just<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.190> few<00:03:06.430> clouds<00:03:06.730> you'll<00:03:07.450> notice

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
with just a few clouds you'll notice

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.720 
with just a few clouds you'll notice
many<00:03:08.020> of<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.530> textures<00:03:09.010> will<00:03:09.130> replace<00:03:09.459> as

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
many of the textures will replace as

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.880 
many of the textures will replace as
well<00:03:09.940> including<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.510> vegetation<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.440> the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
well including the vegetation and the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.650 
well including the vegetation and the
roads<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.400> makes<00:03:12.550> look<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.940> whole<00:03:13.209> lot<00:03:13.239> more

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
roads and it makes look a whole lot more

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.750 
roads and it makes look a whole lot more
realistic<00:03:14.070> but<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.160> great<00:03:15.310> thing<00:03:15.459> about<00:03:15.550> this

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
realistic but the great thing about this

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.460 
realistic but the great thing about this
