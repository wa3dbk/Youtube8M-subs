much ran it's a positive and negative

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.660 
much ran it's a positive and negative
and<00:00:21.910> they're<00:00:22.150> really<00:00:22.360> skinny<00:00:22.900> and<00:00:23.140> I<00:00:24.070> put<00:00:24.250> a<00:00:24.280> 16

and they're really skinny and I put a 16
gauge<00:00:24.850> wire<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:26.500> pretty<00:00:26.710> much<00:00:26.890> run<00:00:27.160> the

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
gauge wire you pretty much run the

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.570 
gauge wire you pretty much run the
positive<00:00:27.760> this<00:00:28.090> positive<00:00:28.600> from<00:00:28.990> this<00:00:29.140> led<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
positive this positive from this led to

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.249 
positive this positive from this led to
I<00:00:30.610> throw<00:00:30.760> up<00:00:30.850> to<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.180> other<00:00:31.360> one<00:00:31.420> to<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.079> other

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
I throw up to the other one to the other

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.259 
I throw up to the other one to the other
positive<00:00:33.539> and<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.620> ran<00:00:35.800> them<00:00:35.949> down<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:37.120> hood

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
positive and I ran them down the hood

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:45.450 
positive and I ran them down the hood
liner<00:00:39.839> headin<00:00:40.839> through<00:00:41.019> here<00:00:43.979> and<00:00:44.979> I

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
liner headin through here and I

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.189 
liner headin through here and I
connected<00:00:45.909> it<00:00:45.999> to<00:00:46.059> this<00:00:46.300> toggle<00:00:46.569> switch<00:00:46.719> it's

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
connected it to this toggle switch it's

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.610 
connected it to this toggle switch it's
a<00:00:47.260> 15<00:00:47.620> amp<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.829> other<00:00:51.010> positive<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
a 15 amp and the other positive the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.309 
a 15 amp and the other positive the
other<00:00:53.739> positive<00:00:54.129> I<00:00:54.280> ran<00:00:54.489> it<00:00:54.639> through<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.879> back

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:55.319 
other positive I ran it through the back

00:00:55.319 --> 00:01:00.059 
other positive I ran it through the back
to<00:00:56.319> this<00:00:56.440> inline<00:00:56.859> inline<00:00:57.609> switch<00:00:58.859> inline<00:00:59.859> fuse

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
to this inline inline switch inline fuse

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.890 
to this inline inline switch inline fuse
I<00:01:00.249> mean<00:01:00.600> there's<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.690> 2<00:01:01.899> amp<00:01:02.049> fuse<00:01:02.379> inside<00:01:02.769> and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
I mean there's a 2 amp fuse inside and

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.040 
I mean there's a 2 amp fuse inside and
then<00:01:04.900> I<00:01:04.989> connected<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.600> negative<00:01:07.960> from

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
then I connected the the negative from

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.980 
then I connected the the negative from
this<00:01:08.230> led<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:08.910> this<00:01:09.910> one<00:01:10.090> together<00:01:10.240> write<00:01:10.870> it

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
this led and this one together write it

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.230 
this led and this one together write it
down<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.660> that's<00:01:13.660> gonna<00:01:13.810> go<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.200> battery

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
down and that's gonna go to the battery

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:36.560 
down and that's gonna go to the battery
and<00:01:16.240> this<00:01:16.660> is<00:01:16.780> what<00:01:16.930> it<00:01:17.020> looks<00:01:17.200> like

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.970 

it's<00:01:37.140> kind<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> hard<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:37.860> video

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
it's kind of hard to see in the video

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's kind of hard to see in the video
but<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.430> super<00:01:38.640> bright<00:01:45.830> at<00:01:46.830> first<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.220> try

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
but it's super bright at first I try

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.470 
but it's super bright at first I try
using<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.940> this<00:01:48.600> LED<00:01:49.320> switch<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.270> when<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
using this this LED switch so when you

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.780 
using this this LED switch so when you
turn<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:52.380> turns<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.860> LED<00:01:52.920> indicates

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
turn it on it turns the LED indicates

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.440 
turn it on it turns the LED indicates
that<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.090> on

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that it's on

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.380 
that it's on
I<00:01:54.480> kept<00:01:55.380> blowin<00:01:55.650> fuses<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.370> kept<00:01:56.910> putting<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.210> 2

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I kept blowin fuses I kept putting a 2

kept<00:02:04.080> blowing<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.680> me<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.990> one

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
kept blowing up on me and for this one

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.990 
kept blowing up on me and for this one
you're<00:02:07.260> supposed<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.620> run<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.640> negative

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you're supposed to run the the negative

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.960 
you're supposed to run the the negative
on<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.510> this<00:02:09.690> first<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.400> the<00:02:11.400> inline<00:02:11.730> fuse

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
on on this first one the inline fuse

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
on on this first one the inline fuse
from<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.300> battery<00:02:12.570> in<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.810> one<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
from the battery in this one and the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.380 
from the battery in this one and the
positive<00:02:14.130> from<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> LED<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.000> one<00:02:15.180> I

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
positive from the LED in this one I

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.540 
positive from the LED in this one I
tried<00:02:16.170> multiple<00:02:16.320> times<00:02:16.590> all<00:02:16.980> my<00:02:17.100> connections

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
tried multiple times all my connections

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.400 
tried multiple times all my connections
were<00:02:17.670> tight<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:17.940> they<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.900> kept<00:02:19.020> blowing<00:02:19.140> up

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
were tight and they just kept blowing up

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.190 
were tight and they just kept blowing up
on<00:02:19.560> me<00:02:19.880> so<00:02:20.880> my<00:02:21.030> last<00:02:21.210> resort<00:02:21.600> was<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.870> get<00:02:22.020> this

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
on me so my last resort was to get this

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.820 
on me so my last resort was to get this
one<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.800> two<00:02:22.950> toggle<00:02:23.310> switch<00:02:23.690> on<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.930> off<00:02:24.990> 15

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
one the two toggle switch on and off 15

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.270 
one the two toggle switch on and off 15
amps<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:27.470> still<00:02:28.470> got<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.650> clean<00:02:28.740> up<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.010> wire

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
amps I still got to clean up this wire

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.800 
amps I still got to clean up this wire
must<00:02:30.470> I'm<00:02:31.470> gonna<00:02:31.620> hide<00:02:31.800> them<00:02:31.920> pretty<00:02:32.100> good<00:02:32.810> but

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
must I'm gonna hide them pretty good but

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.620 
must I'm gonna hide them pretty good but
this<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.470> what<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.680> looks<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.240> pretty<00:02:36.240> much<00:02:36.300> 2

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
this is what it looks like pretty much 2

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.040 
this is what it looks like pretty much 2
positives<00:02:37.670> both<00:02:38.670> positives<00:02:39.240> from<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.600> LED<00:02:39.870> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
positives both positives from the LED to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.620 
positives both positives from the LED to
this<00:02:40.200> one<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.850> then<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.000> then<00:02:42.360> with<00:02:42.570> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
other positive from the battery there's

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.620 
other positive from the battery there's
that<00:02:46.380> inline<00:02:46.739> inline<00:02:47.340> fuse<00:02:47.580> with<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.090> 2<00:02:48.450> amp

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
that inline inline fuse with the 2 amp

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.850 
that inline inline fuse with the 2 amp
fuse<00:02:49.620> inside<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:51.510> negative<00:02:51.930> is

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
fuse inside of it and the negative is

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.050 
fuse inside of it and the negative is
connected<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.700> negative<00:02:54.660> terminal<00:02:56.060> and

connected to the negative terminal and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.540 
connected to the negative terminal and
that's<00:02:57.209> how<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.630> your<00:02:57.870> LEDs<00:02:58.650> light<00:02:58.980> up

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.380 

off<00:03:02.550> on

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.720 

so<00:03:09.390> there<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.600> go
