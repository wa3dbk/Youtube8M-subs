cool
now<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.510> generator<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.019> being<00:01:04.290> being<00:01:05.159> called

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
now this generator is being being called

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.210 
now this generator is being being called
the<00:01:05.790> world's<00:01:06.210> quietest<00:01:06.450> generator<00:01:07.050> why<00:01:07.409> why

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the world's quietest generator why why

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.600 
the world's quietest generator why why
is<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:11.869> different<00:01:12.869> than<00:01:13.079> the<00:01:13.229> other<00:01:13.380> ones<00:01:13.610> in

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
is that different than the other ones in

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
is that different than the other ones in
that<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> lid<00:01:17.119> here<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:19.409> bigger

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that you can see the lid here is bigger

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.749 
that you can see the lid here is bigger
than<00:01:20.219> the<00:01:20.310> generator<00:01:20.670> itself<00:01:20.960> this<00:01:21.960> lid<00:01:22.759> what

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
than the generator itself this lid what

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.859 
than the generator itself this lid what
it<00:01:23.880> does<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> exhaust<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:26.659> all<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
it does with the exhaust is it all the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.690 
it does with the exhaust is it all the
noise<00:01:28.049> from<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> exhaust<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.159> engine<00:01:29.549> are

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
noise from the exhaust of the engine are

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.230 
noise from the exhaust of the engine are
bounced<00:01:30.420> off<00:01:30.539> here<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.350> absorbed<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
bounced off here and absorbed and that

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.599 
bounced off here and absorbed and that
way<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.200> makes<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.530> part<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.310> why

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
way that's what makes it part of why

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.520 
way that's what makes it part of why
it's<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.030> world's<00:01:36.479> quietest<00:01:36.750> generator<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
it's the world's quietest generator the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.440 
it's the world's quietest generator the
other<00:01:37.649> part<00:01:37.950> would<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.340> fact<00:01:38.609> that<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
other part would be the fact that the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.280 
other part would be the fact that the
engine<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.930> very<00:01:39.960> quiet<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.649> well

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
engine is very quiet as well

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.530 
engine is very quiet as well
that's<00:01:41.860> awesome<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:43.030> this<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.390> pretty

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
that's awesome so this is a pretty

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.200 
that's awesome so this is a pretty
reliable<00:01:44.080> generator<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:45.060> customer<00:01:46.060> can
