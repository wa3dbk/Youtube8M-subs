the bullet so the same old bullet which
was<00:02:32.489> going<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.879> for<00:02:33.090> 50<00:02:33.420> years<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:34.170> was<00:02:34.319> just

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
was going on for 50 years it was just

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.990 
was going on for 50 years it was just
one<00:02:34.799> single<00:02:35.310> black<00:02:35.519> bullet

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
one single black bullet

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.089 
one single black bullet
we<00:02:36.299> got<00:02:36.480> colored<00:02:36.810> variations<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.769> we<00:02:37.920> got

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
we got colored variations of it we got

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.819 
we got colored variations of it we got
some<00:02:38.970> new<00:02:39.120> technology<00:02:39.150> into<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.959> like<00:02:40.170> you

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
some new technology into it like you

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.390 
some new technology into it like you
know<00:02:40.950> electronic<00:02:41.879> ignition<00:02:42.299> etc<00:02:42.959> etcetera

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
know electronic ignition etc etcetera

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.400 
know electronic ignition etc etcetera
beyond<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.489> we<00:02:45.390> actually<00:02:45.510> took<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.930> we

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
beyond that we actually took the we

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.950 
beyond that we actually took the we
actually<00:02:46.500> started<00:02:46.920> new<00:02:47.040> models

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.320 

but<00:02:50.560> but<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.920> way<00:02:51.340> we've<00:02:51.580> created<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.120> brand

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
but but the way we've created the brand

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.840 
but but the way we've created the brand
is<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:53.110> actually<00:02:53.770> transcends<00:02:54.610> all

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
is that it actually transcends all

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.880 
is that it actually transcends all
socio-economic<00:02:56.850> strata<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.150> and

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
socio-economic strata and and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.540 
socio-economic strata and and
demographics<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.040> all<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.310> because

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
demographics and all of that because

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.370 
demographics and all of that because
it's<00:03:00.700> really<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.240> person<00:03:01.900> who<00:03:02.050> wants<00:03:02.320> a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
it's really a person who wants a

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.080 
it's really a person who wants a
motorcycle<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.070> we<00:03:03.490> don't<00:03:03.640> call<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:03.940> as<00:03:04.060> a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
motorcycle so we don't call it as a

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.550 
motorcycle so we don't call it as a
luxury<00:03:04.450> brand<00:03:04.600> ever<00:03:04.870> because<00:03:05.200> that's<00:03:05.380> not
