00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.320
 for all is the early rise in the heart hello do you have a little 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.389
 how it works 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.519
 just for mounting glasses then you will need you materials 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.789
 once a policewoman 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.990
 so to bring some ground like many others 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.429
 you will need a flat screwdriver 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.909
 a complaint is the people who are taken for the time 'of paca fixed success 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.550
 then bolts are needed 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 but both groups 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 the problem problem is there theophile bokassa leaves to create his 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.620
 burial of the system 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.830
 for you to have uefa on the blog 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.240
 it was a museum 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.860
 dumitras at the microphone 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.720
 on the bolts 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.840
 we celebrate the partners 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260
 that's what will slide the blade 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.430
 and the army 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.270
 but on the bcr you'll see something these little mechanisms 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.870
 remember that m 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.090
 trotting pace 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.890
 you put in for example 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.510
 connected to the system 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.580
 the match will be done and instead of fishing line and for 100 euros tax stone has 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.510
 started so it's much more reliable 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.100
 and soon to be simply nursery it's a hole the punch 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.100
 as for me the cloakroom 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 it's a budget too much you will understand why 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.590
 now I want to say that my long-time father is a dish 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.760
 once already a minimum 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.890
 auxerre if you smoke much more flat look at the beginning of my blog is a 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.890
 little modified 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.070
 now explain to us 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.020
 wakanda the first piece 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.020
 and we will put them 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.540
 balls like that 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.780
 so these clutter flows a little bit of his team with a 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.920
 you have to know knows that gustafsson 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.180
 you can buy them at any store 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.890

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.800
 for which job should rise quickly since good with a mass 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.009
 not easy 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.779
 with a little bit of that 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.859
 for the first piece 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.859

 the dany boon movie 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.810
 a bit like the blade of the knife 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.189
 it's a little 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.669
 a small nest egg 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.669
