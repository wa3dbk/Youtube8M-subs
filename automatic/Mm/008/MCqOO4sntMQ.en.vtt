very<00:01:16.770> good<00:01:16.920> its<00:01:17.610> micro<00:01:17.939> size<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.659> here

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
very good its micro size you see here

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.940 
very good its micro size you see here
fits<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.320> palm<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.619> hand

fits right in the palm of your hand

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.789 
fits right in the palm of your hand
and<00:01:20.759> flies<00:01:20.939> very<00:01:21.240> well<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.600> features<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> 6

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
and flies very well this features a 6

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.429 
and flies very well this features a 6
axis<00:01:23.310> gyro<00:01:23.490> stabilization<00:01:24.180> system<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
axis gyro stabilization system so it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.010 
axis gyro stabilization system so it
actually<00:01:25.770> uses<00:01:26.009> accelerometers<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:27.390> addition

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
actually uses accelerometers in addition

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.420 
actually uses accelerometers in addition
to<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> gyro<00:01:28.500> sensing<00:01:28.890> which<00:01:29.009> makes<00:01:29.220> this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
to the gyro sensing which makes this

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.270 
to the gyro sensing which makes this
super<00:01:30.090> super<00:01:30.450> stable<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:31.470> slides<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:32.009> well

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
super super stable it slides very well

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
super super stable it slides very well
and<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.640> has<00:01:32.790> two<00:01:33.420> modes<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:33.990> actually

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
and it has two modes you can actually

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.749 
and it has two modes you can actually
fly<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> normal<00:01:35.040> flying<00:01:35.340> mode<00:01:35.610> which

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
fly it in the normal flying mode which

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.429 
fly it in the normal flying mode which
is<00:01:35.880> stable<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.390> I'll<00:01:36.509> let<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.079> basic

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
is stable and I'll let you do just basic

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
is stable and I'll let you do just basic
flying<00:01:37.710> there's<00:01:38.280> also<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.729> aerobatic<00:01:39.299> mode

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
flying there's also an aerobatic mode

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.760 
flying there's also an aerobatic mode
which<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.930> control<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> gear

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
which you can control with the gear

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.889 
which you can control with the gear
channel<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.250> your<00:01:41.369> transmitter<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.299> basically

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
