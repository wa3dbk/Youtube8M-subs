00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello today i will show you how 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.740
 can be extended by yourself 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.650
 washing machine drain hose 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.030
 what we need for this but 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:19.580
 Phillips screwdriver need car 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.960
 a simple luger such an adapter 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.480
 You can also buy this adapter. 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.070
 or special adapter for lengthening 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 the side of the washing machines is the same 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.439
 called and in the market someone knows and in 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.649
 plumbing stores it specifically 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.380
 such that now you measure which one 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.100
 what length you need to lengthen here is not 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.410
 touched the hose and how long 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.270
 lengthen and now i will show you how it 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.920
 do see with us here that's when 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.899
 you buy words on the one hand 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.059
 diameter slightly larger to another diameter 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.770
 a bit less 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.980
 it's because this diameter goes to itself 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.120
 so how strange is it if you replace 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.880
 it is necessary here there is a diameter larger than us 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.729
 the release goes the diameter is smaller here these 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.580
 parties here we have early cars here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.220
 out by the elephant we just don't have about 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.460
 such a rezinochki but it is not so important 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.009
 if there is rezinochka or no rezinochki 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.070
 here it is, after all, and it is inserted and a rezinochka 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.530
 here there since we have no rezinochki 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.659
 although even if I don't care 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.200
 advise this side of the moon this 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.409
 the side 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:40.939
 put the yoke what we do we take 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.939
 pull on the adapter sock 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:58.929
 we press it with a clamp, just in case 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:04.280
 pressure of course this must come a 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:08.599
 from this side we take the pump and that 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.099
 wider side too can 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.709
 put who say pressure and no 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:18.829
 here goes to release on the release of water 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.660
 expanded here why is better 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.120
 set because it is narrowing and 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.299
 principle as well, maybe when the water 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.670
 warmed going could warm up when 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.489
 they hull goes hot water splurge 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.310
 and jump off here he won't get bored 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.120
 country though i speak for loyalty masculine 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.510
 put and from this side all the yoke 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.799
 so here 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.799
 tightened now 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.340
 the drain is now that side 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.579
 turn on the sewer that's all good luck 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.579
 you
