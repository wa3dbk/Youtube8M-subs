00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
here I don't have very many lights on in

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.899 
here I don't have very many lights on in
my<00:01:04.619> cab<00:01:06.140> because<00:01:07.140> I'm<00:01:07.290> lazy<00:01:08.270> but<00:01:09.650> it<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:12.619> 9:30

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
my cab because I'm lazy but it is 9:30

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.170 
my cab because I'm lazy but it is 9:30
Eastern<00:01:14.909> Time<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.450> arrived<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.909> pretty<00:01:17.909> close

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
Eastern Time I arrived it pretty close

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.630 
Eastern Time I arrived it pretty close
to<00:01:18.360> my<00:01:18.479> destination<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.380> didn't<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:21.110> I

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
to my destination I didn't have I I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.550 
to my destination I didn't have I I
think<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.729> made<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> couple<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.570> errors<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
think I made a couple of errors and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.660 
think I made a couple of errors and
judgment<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.310> far<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.900> time<00:01:27.900> management<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.640> if

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
judgment as far as time management so if

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.480 
judgment as far as time management so if
I<00:01:30.030> would<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:31.009> done<00:01:32.009> things<00:01:32.220> slightly

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
I would have done things slightly

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.710 
I would have done things slightly
differently<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.390> would<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.600> been

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
differently I think I would have been

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.910 
differently I think I would have been
parking<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.470> cosign<00:01:35.310> II<00:01:35.340> tonight<00:01:36.920> instead

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
parking at the cosign II tonight instead

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.330 
parking at the cosign II tonight instead
of<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> truck<00:01:39.390> stop<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.380> short<00:01:40.770> distance

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
of at a truck stop just a short distance

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.630 
of at a truck stop just a short distance
away<00:01:42.380> so

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.539 

let's<00:01:46.640> see<00:01:47.979> all-in-all<00:01:48.979> everything<00:01:49.369> went

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
let's see all-in-all everything went

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:50.050 
let's see all-in-all everything went
well

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
well

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.800 
well
I'll<00:01:50.840> try<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.110> get<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:51.710> shot<00:01:52.509> of<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.600> load

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
I'll try to get a shot of the load

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.469 
I'll try to get a shot of the load
tomorrow<00:01:54.259> it's<00:01:54.530> just<00:01:54.619> I<00:01:55.250> guess<00:01:56.119> you'd<00:01:56.299> call<00:01:56.329> it

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
tomorrow it's just I guess you'd call it

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.789 
tomorrow it's just I guess you'd call it
stares<00:01:57.159> they're<00:01:58.159> aluminum<00:01:58.850> channel<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.899> it's

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
stares they're aluminum channel and it's

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.660 
stares they're aluminum channel and it's
been<00:02:01.070> perforated<00:02:01.490> with<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:02.710> non-skid<00:02:03.710> steps

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
been perforated with the non-skid steps

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.539 
been perforated with the non-skid steps
and<00:02:05.170> I'm<00:02:06.170> assuming<00:02:06.530> they<00:02:06.649> get<00:02:06.770> cut<00:02:07.009> up<00:02:07.159> in<00:02:07.369> the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
and I'm assuming they get cut up in the

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.969 
and I'm assuming they get cut up in the
shorter<00:02:08.030> steps<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.630> be<00:02:08.750> used<00:02:08.989> for<00:02:09.140> whatever

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
shorter steps to be used for whatever

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.530 
shorter steps to be used for whatever
construction<00:02:10.759> they<00:02:10.880> want<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.209> put<00:02:11.599> them<00:02:11.720> on

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
construction they want to put them on

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:23.150 
construction they want to put them on
let's<00:02:14.540> see<00:02:14.860> it's

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.110 

there's<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.280> little<00:02:24.460> bit<00:02:24.610> brighter<00:02:24.850> in<00:02:25.030> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
there's a little bit brighter in the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.990 
there's a little bit brighter in the
back<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:29.680> kind<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.040> disorganized<00:02:30.460> right

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
back but I'm kind of disorganized right

how<00:02:40.450> tomorrow<00:02:40.630> goes<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:43.260> got<00:02:44.260> kind<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.620> late

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
how tomorrow goes I got kind of a late

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.820 
how tomorrow goes I got kind of a late
start<00:02:44.860> today<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.490> I<00:02:45.970> think<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:47.080> was<00:02:47.320> dispatched

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
start today so I think I was dispatched

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.650 
start today so I think I was dispatched
around<00:02:49.830> 7:30<00:02:50.830> 8<00:02:51.130> o'clock<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:52.090> might<00:02:52.390> have<00:02:52.510> been

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
around 7:30 8 o'clock it might have been

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.590 
around 7:30 8 o'clock it might have been
even<00:02:53.140> been<00:02:53.320> later<00:02:53.590> than<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.180> drew

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
even been later than that so I drew

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.580 
even been later than that so I drew
drove<00:02:56.080> as<00:02:56.260> far<00:02:56.470> as<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.650> could<00:02:57.570> and<00:03:00.570> it's<00:03:01.570> like<00:03:01.780> 45

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
drove as far as I could and it's like 45

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.640 
drove as far as I could and it's like 45
degrees<00:03:03.040> here<00:03:03.690> it's<00:03:04.690> getting<00:03:04.840> warmer<00:03:05.260> as<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.470> go

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
degrees here it's getting warmer as I go

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.130 
degrees here it's getting warmer as I go
further<00:03:05.890> south<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.660> I'm<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.720> cold-weather

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
further south and I'm a cold-weather

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.190 
further south and I'm a cold-weather
kind<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.680> guy<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:10.740> we'll<00:03:11.740> see<00:03:12.010> how<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.400> goes

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
kind of guy so we'll see how this goes

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.020 
kind of guy so we'll see how this goes
anyway<00:03:14.200> end<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.680> day<00:03:14.800> one<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.280> think<00:03:15.490> it's<00:03:15.850> been

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
anyway end of day one I think it's been

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.770 
anyway end of day one I think it's been
a<00:03:16.060> success<00:03:17.880> since<00:03:18.880> this<00:03:19.000> is<00:03:19.180> my<00:03:19.300> first<00:03:19.330> load

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
a success since this is my first load

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.550 
a success since this is my first load
once<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.140> complete<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:22.320> transfer<00:03:23.320> the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
once I complete it and transfer the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.810 
once I complete it and transfer the
paperwork<00:03:23.950> in<00:03:24.930> maverick<00:03:25.930> gives<00:03:26.350> extra<00:03:27.100> $400

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
paperwork in maverick gives extra $400

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.170 
paperwork in maverick gives extra $400
for<00:03:28.780> your<00:03:28.930> first<00:03:29.080> load<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:33.190> even<00:03:33.940> if<00:03:34.060> I'm

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
for your first load and so even if I'm

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.670 
for your first load and so even if I'm
not<00:03:34.209> staying<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.780> night<00:03:34.810> at<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.140> shipper<00:03:35.500> and

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
not staying the night at the shipper and

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.280 
not staying the night at the shipper and
getting<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.280> guess<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:37.120> little<00:03:37.690> bit<00:03:37.810> extra<00:03:38.050> time

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
getting I guess a little bit extra time

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.940 
getting I guess a little bit extra time
for<00:03:38.350> tomorrow's<00:03:39.220> load<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:40.780> think<00:03:41.410> this<00:03:41.769> makes

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
for tomorrow's load I think this makes

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.750 
for tomorrow's load I think this makes
up<00:03:42.130> for<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.400> because<00:03:42.550> basically<00:03:42.790> that's<00:03:44.610> if<00:03:45.610> I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
up for it because basically that's if I

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.610 
up for it because basically that's if I
was<00:03:45.940> making<00:03:46.090> 50<00:03:46.540> cents<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.870> mile<00:03:47.080> that's<00:03:47.350> an

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
was making 50 cents a mile that's an

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.160 
was making 50 cents a mile that's an
800-mile<00:03:48.310> payment<00:03:49.239> basically<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.050> they're

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
800-mile payment basically that they're

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.750 
800-mile payment basically that they're
going<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.320> give<00:03:50.530> me<00:03:50.650> just<00:03:51.010> for<00:03:51.130> my<00:03:51.250> first<00:03:51.519> load

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
kind of get a feel for how at least how

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.680 
kind of get a feel for how at least how
initially<00:04:33.760> how<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.480> new<00:04:34.960> driver<00:04:36.690> Encounters

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
initially how a new driver Encounters

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.469 
initially how a new driver Encounters
encounters<00:04:38.250> of<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.340> new<00:04:39.460> driver<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:39.910> guess<00:04:40.180> in

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
encounters of a new driver I guess in

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.350 
encounters of a new driver I guess in
maverick<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.979> we'll<00:04:42.130> see<00:04:42.310> we'll<00:04:43.060> see<00:04:43.090> what

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
maverick and we'll see we'll see what

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.860 
maverick and we'll see we'll see what
happens<00:04:43.979> so<00:04:44.979> far<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.580> feel<00:04:45.940> I<00:04:46.240> thought<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.780> would

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
happens so far I feel I thought it would

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.350 
happens so far I feel I thought it would
be<00:04:46.990> more<00:04:47.139> stressful<00:04:47.620> but<00:04:48.460> actually<00:04:48.820> today<00:04:49.000> was

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
be more stressful but actually today was

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.659 
be more stressful but actually today was
pretty<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:50.080> felt<00:04:50.410> pretty<00:04:50.590> comfortable<00:04:50.800> midway

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
pretty I felt pretty comfortable midway

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.230 
pretty I felt pretty comfortable midway
through<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:54.070> think<00:04:54.790> that's<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:55.060> positive

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
through and I think that's a positive

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.220 
through and I think that's a positive
sign<00:04:55.750> so<00:04:56.169> we'll<00:04:56.620> see<00:04:56.740> what<00:04:56.889> happens
