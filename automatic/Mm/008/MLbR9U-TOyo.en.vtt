00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.580
 and television showed from its 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.219
 starts an extraordinary capacity 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.740
 to communicate massively and 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.160
 simultaneous 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.840
 however with the emergence of internet 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.150
 the user was developing a 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.490
 interaction with the information he made 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.080
 that television would lose some of its 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.320
 communicative exclusivity 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.290
 in recent years almost by way of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 resistance a technology was developed 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.380
 called interactive television that 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.820
 tries to adapt the environment to a society 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.820
 in constant transformation 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.270
 my name is federico balaguer I have 43 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.980
 years I am a member of Libya 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.990
 laboratory is part of the university 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.580
 national silver doctor of science 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.110
 of computing at my workplace 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.410
 is the book of the television project 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.380
 digital in the year 2009 in Argentina 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.690
 adopted the norm and that should this be that 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.510
 the digital terrestrial television standard 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.510
 that standard is made up of a 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.450
 set of parts that include 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.760
 transmission and reception within what 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.770
 is the exception there is a chapter of 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.869
 interactive digital television that is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.910
 defined under the name jing jing a 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.570
 then it is part of the specification 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.970
 digital terrestrial television 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.700
 describes how they can be done 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.720
 applications for the viewer 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.720
 interact with the TV 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.070
 We are around 20 people 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.170
 working is a group 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.810
 multidisciplinary we have engineers 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.030
 especially software there is also 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.310
 electronic engineers but also 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.440
 we have graphic designers the process 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.870
 of work we do every day 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.140
 here when a new application starts 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.900
 is an idea comes up and the first thing that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.890
 does is make a scheme to see how 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.410
 you can get to do the navigation 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.150
 from the user's side once 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.280
 we have the closed idea every one gets 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.970
 to work on your discipline let's say what 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.000
 first thing I do is design the design 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.530
 the images in parts and those parts 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.820
 Well, he passed them to them so that they 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.820
 the application itself 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.360
 the ginkgo is a software module 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.210
 physically that is within a sector 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.700
 box a set top box or decoder is 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.920
 one of the possible recipients of 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.650
 digital television is not this serves more 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.210
 that nothing when the user does not have a 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.430
 TV that already has all the 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.340
 embedded technology have a 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.370
 set of outputs that allow 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.250
 is this box receives the signal of 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.050
 digital television and transforms it into 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.930
 something that can be seen in any 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.480
 television is an intermediary between a 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.400
 new technology and almost any 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.810
 TV that one has in his house is 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.030
 important the remote control because 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.250
 good has all the typical functionality 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.530
 of a remote control plus the buttons on 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.360
 colors that are usually used in 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.520
 interactive digital television so that 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.930
 the user uses them as a way of 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.930
 select options 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.050
 my name of solitude quiroga I am from here 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.970
 of silver and I'm a systems analyst and 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.240
 designer in communication and sun we made 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.540
 several games among them the hanged a 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.720
 soft cobÃ¡n and a more playful footprint this 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.060
 kinds of games in general are 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.820
 applications that add content to 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.450
 program is another way that people 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:53.410
 is interested in the program and 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.410
 for the contents of the program 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.830
 the applications without gas are programmed 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.200
 with a language called ncl the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.510
 way of writing the program is very 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.090
 similar to html 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.129
 the important thing is that it handles some 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.110
 concepts that are very easily 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.720
 applicable to digital television by 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.930
 example multimedia objects can 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.229
 be pictures text images in general a 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:27.300
 application is defined as the union of 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.300
 those multimedia objects 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.320
 so effectively free software 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.510
 and promotes collaborative construction 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.060
 of knowledge of this knowledge 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.830
 you can make programs that 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.690
 are the computer programs are a 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.010
 very particular form of knowledge 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.320
 but ignorance that is there I 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.210
 is alive we have developed a 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.639
 implementation of zynga called 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.100
 ying pointed out art and that is available 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.750
 to download from the website of 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.730
 our project what can be downloaded 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.380
 is an environment of execution of txinga and 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.990
 of programming in such a way that 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.570
 anyone who knows how to program or 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.580
 makes you write web pages you can try 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.900
 make your own applications one thing 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.520
 important is also the 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.380
 implementation of jingan that 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.380
 we develop is free software 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.080
 my name is gabriel bound 158 years alive 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.630
 in silver I am a professor and researcher 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.250
 Faculty of Informatics 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.850
 silver university I am the director 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:39.440
 of Libya in Libya is a laboratory that 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:41.000
 it was formed in the year 1988 good and today 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.280
 day is a laboratory that makes 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.090
 basic research activities 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.520
 applied research and does a lot 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.280
 technology transfer to companies 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.650
 been to us calls us the 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.720
 planning ministry and those that 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.170
 they entrusted us was to make us 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.370
 charge of the most novel part of the 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.700
 digital television that is the 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.700
 interactivity
