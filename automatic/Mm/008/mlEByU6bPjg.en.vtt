the<00:00:00.269> white<00:00:00.480> crib<00:00:00.840> tip<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.469> variation<00:00:02.370> on<00:00:02.580> the

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
the white crib tip is a variation on the

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.370 
the white crib tip is a variation on the
regular<00:00:03.149> tip<00:00:03.449> that<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.810> probably<00:00:04.080> already

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
regular tip that you probably already

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.660 
regular tip that you probably already
know<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.359> where<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.710> regular<00:00:07.710> dip<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.280> more

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
know and where the regular dip is more

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.930 
know and where the regular dip is more
of<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.330> triceps<00:00:09.990> exercise<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:11.250> white<00:00:11.550> grip

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
of a triceps exercise the white grip

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.770 
of a triceps exercise the white grip
focuses<00:00:12.599> more<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.139> chest<00:00:13.910> so<00:00:14.910> first<00:00:15.570> let

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
focuses more on the chest so first let

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.050 
focuses more on the chest so first let
me<00:00:15.900> show<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.410> regular<00:00:16.590> dip<00:00:17.130> which<00:00:17.760> is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
me show you the regular dip which is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.939 
me show you the regular dip which is
with<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.250> narrow<00:00:20.250> grip<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:22.140> parallel

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
with a narrow grip like this on parallel

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.349 
with a narrow grip like this on parallel
bars<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:24.289> then<00:00:25.289> go<00:00:25.500> down<00:00:25.830> lower<00:00:26.220> than<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.939> 90

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
bars and then go down lower than the 90

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.099 
bars and then go down lower than the 90
degree<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:28.439> your<00:00:28.800> elbows<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.760> if<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.840> are

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
degree in your elbows and if you are

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.470 
degree in your elbows and if you are
bending<00:00:31.859> forward<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.610> little<00:00:32.790> bit<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.300> will

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
bending forward a little bit you will

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.049 
bending forward a little bit you will
put<00:00:33.930> some<00:00:34.200> more<00:00:34.380> focus<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> chest<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:36.030> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
put some more focus on the chest but I

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.600 
put some more focus on the chest but I
believe<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> white<00:00:36.930> Script<00:00:37.530> dip<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
believe that the white Script dip is a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.240 
believe that the white Script dip is a
lot<00:00:38.879> better<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:40.170> puts<00:00:40.710> some<00:00:40.920> less

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
lot better because it puts some less

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.420 
lot better because it puts some less
focus<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.180> triceps<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.079> more<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
focus on the triceps and more on the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.970 
focus on the triceps and more on the
chest<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.059> especially<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.079> lower<00:00:46.260> part<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
chest and especially the lower part and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.459 
chest and especially the lower part and
the<00:00:47.309> side<00:00:47.579> part<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.180> your<00:00:48.390> chest<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.320> can

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the side part of your chest and you can

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.709 
the side part of your chest and you can
see<00:00:49.739> how<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.129> struggling<00:00:50.700> already<00:00:51.270> but

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
see how I'm struggling already but

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.770 
see how I'm struggling already but
that's<00:00:51.899> basically<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.489> did<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.420> chest

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that's basically because I did a chest

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.709 
that's basically because I did a chest
workout<00:00:55.320> before<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.800> filmed<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.489> video<00:00:56.719> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
workout before I filmed this video you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
workout before I filmed this video you
will<00:00:57.809> often<00:00:58.230> hear<00:00:58.410> people<00:00:58.890> talk<00:00:59.100> about<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
will often hear people talk about the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.910 
will often hear people talk about the
lower<00:01:00.359> muscles<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.230> chest<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
lower muscles of your chest and the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.329 
lower muscles of your chest and the
upper<00:01:01.949> muscles<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:02.969> chest<00:01:03.270> which<00:01:03.629> is

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
upper muscles of your chest which is

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.980 
upper muscles of your chest which is
anatomically<00:01:05.339> incorrect<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:06.570> our<00:01:06.840> only

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
anatomically incorrect because our only

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.859 
anatomically incorrect because our only
is<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.560> pectoralis<00:01:08.040> major<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> pectoralis

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
is the pectoralis major and pectoralis

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.859 
is the pectoralis major and pectoralis
minor<00:01:10.409> which<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> two<00:01:11.610> muscles<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.510> your

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
minor which are the two muscles in your

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.200 
minor which are the two muscles in your
chest

chest

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.030 
chest
however<00:01:15.210> by<00:01:15.570> performing<00:01:16.229> different<00:01:16.409> kind<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
however by performing different kind of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.340 
however by performing different kind of
chest<00:01:17.310> exercises<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.509> put<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> weight<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
chest exercises that put a weight on a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.920 
chest exercises that put a weight on a
different<00:01:20.100> place<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> muscle<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.689> will

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
different place of the muscle you will

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.710 
different place of the muscle you will
work<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.409> different<00:01:23.250> areas<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.240> chest

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
work out different areas of the chest

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.080 
work out different areas of the chest
muscle<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.770> quite<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> few<00:01:26.220> people<00:01:26.880> who

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
muscle there are quite a few people who

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.990 
muscle there are quite a few people who
are<00:01:27.590> performing<00:01:28.590> three<00:01:28.979> different<00:01:29.460> kind<00:01:29.790> of

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
are performing three different kind of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.289 
are performing three different kind of
bench<00:01:30.509> presses<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.400> performing

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
bench presses and if you are performing

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.530 
bench presses and if you are performing
bench<00:01:33.720> presses<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.340> maximum<00:01:35.820> amount<00:01:36.299> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
bench presses with the maximum amount of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.870 
bench presses with the maximum amount of
weight<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.350> perform<00:01:37.670> eight<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
weight that you can perform eight to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.359 
weight that you can perform eight to
twelve<00:01:39.210> repetitions<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:41.070> is

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
twelve repetitions with then it is

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.330 
twelve repetitions with then it is
nearly<00:01:41.970> impossible<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.259> three<00:01:44.070> different

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
nearly impossible to do three different

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.569 
nearly impossible to do three different
bench<00:01:44.820> presses<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> usually<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:47.310> is

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
bench presses so what I usually do is

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.910 
bench presses so what I usually do is
start<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.149> three<00:01:48.600> sets<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.170> eight<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.590> twelve

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
start with three sets of eight to twelve

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.480 
start with three sets of eight to twelve
repetitions<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.759> bench<00:01:51.180> pressing<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:52.500> 85%

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
repetitions of bench pressing with 85%

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.469 
repetitions of bench pressing with 85%
of<00:01:54.299> my<00:01:54.659> maximum<00:01:55.229> amount<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.710> weight<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.479> after

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
of my maximum amount of weight and after

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 
of my maximum amount of weight and after
those<00:01:57.659> three<00:01:58.200> sets<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:59.369> some

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
those three sets I will do some

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.359 
those three sets I will do some
different<00:02:00.210> exercises<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.049> target<00:02:01.680> different

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
different exercises to target different

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.959 
different exercises to target different
parts<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.939> my<00:02:03.210> chest<00:02:03.930> area<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.250> dumbbell

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
parts of my chest area like the dumbbell

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.719 
parts of my chest area like the dumbbell
fly<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.659> actually<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.469> incline<00:02:07.950> dumbbell<00:02:08.220> fly

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
fly or actually the incline dumbbell fly

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.869 
fly or actually the incline dumbbell fly
which<00:02:09.030> will<00:02:09.270> target<00:02:10.020> more<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.220> muscle<00:02:11.610> in

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
which will target more of the muscle in

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.740 
which will target more of the muscle in
the<00:02:12.150> upper<00:02:12.750> part<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.260> your

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
the upper part of your
