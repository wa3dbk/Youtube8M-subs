00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.920
 the event on the Italian game card 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.900
 is not yet available in Italy though 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.300
 through obscure means always succeeded in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.520
 activate it and is equal to one hundred percent 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.230

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 trip jeda percent then to the end of the video 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.599
 we will also do a demonstration 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.599
 obviously of its legitimacy 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.559
 and it's ok as usual the gift will be there 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.510
 given by the postwoman of the pokémon center 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.760
 so without wasting too much time 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.590
 let's go immediately to talk to you bye you must 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.250

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.140
 secret to you, here is daredevil receives 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.699
 indeed perfect we received the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 ours to the next 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:56.559
 and what happens now wait a moment 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.660
 says a sorry butler says 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.360
 the meddling but what you have just 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.089
 received and the mysterious pokémon of nay 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.170
 true there were still a lot to discover about 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.060
 this pokémon 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.440
 we know an accidental mutation 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.180
 del pop non carb inc 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.430
 but the frequency is not yet known o 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.650
 the way that anxiety happens a little 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.479
 his body is not synonymous with beauty 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.250
 absorbs light with perfect balance 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.939
 and the glow that I hand to something 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.040
 prodigious 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.960
 our employer for years 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.240
 chase and that beauty looking for a 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.100
 gyan specimen yes and we will do of 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.110
 all to help him make his own 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.330
 dream is with this hope that also 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.430
 we started looking for and indeed 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.530
 we got here so let me 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.660
 to avoid the word rounds and come to the 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.460
 point if he is willing to give us your di 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.110
 anne yes 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.830
 but I just took them they want it 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.460
 see no in the most absolute way 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.659
 no no I said no there is nothing that 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.729
 can make you change your mind 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.520
 maybe a lot of big money expected 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.670
 sir, please forgive them 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.590
 insistence my dear ones I am 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.810
 grateful for looking for a board 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.970
 but for me it is not possible to get what 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.860
 we wish to take away from others 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.959
 indeed it is just conquering it with 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.300
 effort and sometimes a little effort 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.190
 luck that gains value 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.560
 if I have to be honest I envy you a lot 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.790
 but more than anything I am happy for you 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.300
 that you were lucky enough to meet 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.500
 in fact, you can travel with him 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.330
 congratulations it is said that there indeed 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.980
 protect their traveling companions 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.900
 from illness accidents 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.280
 I wish you luck and hope 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.810
 sincerely that your trip 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.790
 continue in the best way 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.890
 and I hope you two will continue to 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.650
 help me in the search for a di indeed 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:45.290
 certainly therefore with this little song 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.330
 very sad greet us ok now 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.660
 through box we are looking at the card 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.209
 complete with hans in pokémon number 719 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.250
 of poker a number after uncles look e 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.680
 let's see the moves of aman storm 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.019
 lunar force the reflection the return of 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.610
 aman storm is his peculiar move 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.420
 that we're going to see very soon in 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.760
 action 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.920
 then ours is of a barbon nature, however 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.709
 obviously we can software reset it 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.239
 until we like clear body skills 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.830
 owns only this is how tool is 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.810
 normal bijoux bg a normal is 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.540
 the only bijoux that can be obtained 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.459
 in the game they give it to us now with indeed 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.620
 however it is a bit useless I would have preferred a 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.290
 flying crossroads would surely have made it 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.230
 very talan flame type stuff very very much 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.480
 better however it goes well it doesn't matter at least 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.480
 you could use the 7 with acrobatics 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.760
 better but okay let's go a little 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.560
 see in more detail then the 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.470
 information of this pokémon a little 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.000
 where it was obtained and where it came from 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.079
 then I don't have to go to burgundy 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.870
 I absolutely have to go to pokémon 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.000
 we open axes and then as you see 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.810
 so naughty nature was therefore more attack 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.880
 less special defense ao is where or where 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.630
 was then distributed in Japan 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.450
 how he would be the original coach and then 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.420
 in nature the okay ok and origin 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.040
 film can not 2014 or from the film by 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:14.220
 pokémon that has just come out of pokémon 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.320
 which has just recently come out of 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.970
 in fact, you could get four 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.300
 days before going to see the movie in 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.330
 japan and then it seems to me somewhere 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.159
 day 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.169
 in the week of 19 in Japan 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.720
 let's say he was released anyway 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.210
 through secret gift to all now 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.599
 let us on the contrary as first pokémon e 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:45.039
 let's see what a thing can do 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:47.229
 can do this robot here is ours 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.689
 in fact, in action, boys against age 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.889
 aman storm's cross is a move 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:56.199
 physical that even 30 percent of 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:00.430
 increase the defense of the pokémon than the 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:04.539
 uses and a baseball wer hundred to a bis 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.979
 power of a hundred and a precision of 95 a 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.740
 90 now I don't remember exactly 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.449
 let's see immediately because before 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.240
 we talked about diaman storm yes 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.219
 in fact power one hundred precision in 95 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.629
 hits the enemies around you with one 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.940
 diamond storm may also increase 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.129
 the defense of those who use it a possibility 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.229
 by 30 percent then to increase the 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.419
 defense when using it we see a little 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.430
 if I can catch some pokémon on 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.400
 to use them a good move for 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.610
 in fact it is a pity that his mousset is 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.159
 practically only special and then gives it 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.259
 a really good excellent move 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.210
 it would be fantastic if they had all 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:43.810
 por not of rock type instead of 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.669
 stone miss however you see this is the 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.419
 its peculiar move shoot all the 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.819
 diamonds 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.930
 we have just destroyed a so-called 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.150
 combi 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.639
 now we know what we do let's go 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.349
 online and see if we can trade 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.060
 this indeed since the false ones do not 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.919
 can be exchanged in any 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.789
 False pokémon can be exchanged or 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:05.860
 in the gts or a friend because why 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.379
 because the game of the systems of 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.370
 security to prevent it such as 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:15.190
 cern and asp revels shiny o o chessò 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.930
 before even before it came out 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.940
 there were some fakes but they are never 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.610
 been exchanged for the simple reason 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.589
 that they were fake will help us for this 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.139
 practical demonstration our friend 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.969
 yoshi then has already sent us the 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.149
 request for exchanges we are going to accept 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:33.159
 and let's see if some venues will pass though 

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:35.480
 this anxiety actually reads 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:38.000
 or if dark 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.880
 wrong we are here on the screen of 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.560
 exchange as you see here is ours of 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.660
 on the contrary, it is a rogue nature to them 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.450
 first statistics then it is 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.330
 impossible for me to have something 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.430
 we propose and expect him to do it 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.650
 propose something to carry out it 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.650
 exchange to see if indeed it passes 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:13.730
 we are now exchanging our buccio 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.800
 indeed for a Peruvian at level 45 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.610
 that everything except puccio and therefore 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.770
 as you see 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.080
 already the fact that in fact now has 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.690
 passed this stage silvia that the di 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.910
 indeed it is actually law boys 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.560
 we saw today how it will look 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.540
 the event of indeed on the card from 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.639
 Italian game we saw his 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.740
 features to his peculiar move 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:35.270
 to say therefore that the video is finished there 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.580
 I still want to clarify that this is 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.500
 only a video for information purposes a 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.880
 let you see how the event actually happens 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.190
 will develop here in Italy is not yet 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.350
 nothing official when it comes 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.150
 made public for all this event ve 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.880
 I'll let you know on the facebook page 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.320
 for now I can only greet you 

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.620
 see you at the next video hello a
