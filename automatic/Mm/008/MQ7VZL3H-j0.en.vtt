00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.929
 in this tutorial I'll fine you like a spectacular little lamp and florit and lime 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.539
 It can be used as an ideal brooch and more 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.230
 an accessory and free time 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.529
 with a very simple technique 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.780
 you can have done 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.319
 track lores 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.290
 in a short time and for very little money 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.450
 let's see what we need 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.450
 to do it 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.060
 we need 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.600
 thread and needle 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.510
 a piece of felt 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 a scissor 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.530
 and the silicone gun 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.070
 first let's take an excel sheet that does not help us in this case 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.460
 I help me make happiness excavations 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.730
 the death of pérez 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.730
 good conduct 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.990
 you come back in half 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.100
 we take this side 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.550
 and we double 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.550
 these dates 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.260
 after the disaster they have another side and all 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
 towards cádiz 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 the obec we return alluded to the fifth 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.800
 we are the scissors 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.940
 we are not going to do 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.400
 Half a nautical circle of fair half eyelashes 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.010
 we bring is for cars 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.010
 continuous 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.109
 what are we going to have 3 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.589
 one thing is certain 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.449
 now 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.449
 let's take a bit of here 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.889
 the wounded 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.209
 and we are going to cut here 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.279
 I do not because fishing 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.229
 now we are going to contribute 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.359
 fifteen 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.839
 squares of land 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.179
 where the flower fits 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.179
 Flagella preferably be 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.579
 It can be like this as an end 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
 we cut 15 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.169
 we put our télam 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.129
 we pick it up 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.139
 We are like this 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.569
 how to fold it in half 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.589
 inside 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:23.259
 of the flower 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:25.609
 now the next 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.609
 this we arranged it well that I got here some of them 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.379
 and when we do it like that 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.379
 let's go other lares in 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.939
 and this way 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:43.289
 now with the scissors we are going to contribute 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:52.569
 in this way 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.819
 now having so 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.869
 let's take and bid 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:00.869
 and we will pass it on 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.489
 we leave a little ice 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.349
 i passed 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.669
 The explotion 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.569
 We are left with our flora, I will repeat it so that you can see it again 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.469
 we double 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:26.749
 the fabric and the pattern above enrique díaz 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.459
 then everywhere this a little village in 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.059
 in half 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:39.360
 already having what they do 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.360
 by sections 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.189
 and here I'm afraid I do 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.830
 we take out 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.689
 and not by staying that way 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.689
 now we just need to put the remaining thirteen 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.199
 road the last hour 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:27.129
 and now simply 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.129
 put everything together 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.779
 and tie a knot 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.270
 what are we going to press 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.610
 and as you will see it is already coming to the flower 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.059
 is already taking shape 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.999
 now simply 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.249
 we open the petals a little 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:00.259
 and when we already have it we think it's good 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.979
 this fair the bottom part 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.869
 where everything is put together 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:09.329
 now we take our piece of certain power télam 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.110
 two double bogeys 4 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.849
 we make 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.990
 my circle 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.990
 we calculate that it covers well behind 

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:28.749
 with the gun 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.699
 we are not going to hit 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.039
 we do not press 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.089
 and we have 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:51.069
 a flower that does not work for a hair clip for a headband 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.330
 in a very easy way that has not arrived almost time but that for this 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.379
 everyone asks that cox 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.979
 and you see 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.979
 this super easy to do and it's worth it 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.550
 the mind labors that explore the color that they are 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:14.089
 we put here the brooch if everything we want 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:16.839
 and we already have an accessory 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:19.869
