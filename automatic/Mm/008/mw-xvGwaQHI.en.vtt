00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
so cool we'd be like real scientist okay

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.990 
so cool we'd be like real scientist okay
Carly<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.530> technology<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.460> want<00:01:17.729> I'd

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
Carly one technology but do you want I'd

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.429 
Carly one technology but do you want I'd
say<00:01:18.299> video<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.869> audio<00:01:18.960> equipment<00:01:20.750> it<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.259> so

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
