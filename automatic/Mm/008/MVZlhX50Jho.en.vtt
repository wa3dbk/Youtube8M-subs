 Hello, today we are with you 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.860
 talk about such a wonderful 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:07.430
 medicinal plant like chamomile 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.099
 pharmacy 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.360
 or chamomile drug 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.940
 it grows everywhere on 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.580
 proper iconic fields and meadows on 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.470
 paths that is often possible 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.330
 meet even in our homestead 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.470
 areas in the gardens on podaloku mode 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.450
 from the accommodation itself housing 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.130
 human height but can reach to 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.650
 meter that is, see here 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.090
 tall enough plants but at the same 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.280
 time we have to learn with you 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.499
 identify and distinguish medicinal 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.739
 ramazh walk flow well well then ordinary 

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:41.149
 Frames The most important difference is that 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.649
 chamomile medicinal grows exactly 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.649
 so as it may be said a little 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.769
 a bush look at one plant to 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.390
 but there are a lot of flowers here 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.530
 this is the main difference of course 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.899
 is not 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.519
 it does not grow in one stem here 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.370
 quite a lot is a cane 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.799
 leaf now and old age through black 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.739
 quite tight to the stem at 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.900
 plants and the flower itself 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.110
 everyone knows of course this is a yellow heart 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.970
 kick and such white petals if we 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.520
 let's say you were met 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.070
 plants so called same as chamomile 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.050
 but it grows in one stem 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.300
 one large flower and enough such 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.750
 large , tight-fitting leaves 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.840
 but it is different from those 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.280
 pinnate they are enough a 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.290
