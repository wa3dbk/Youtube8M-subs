00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.270
 let's now local domain security policy 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.070
 click start 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.540
 Software 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.939
 administrative tools 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.419
 and Safe on Sunday 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.179
 let's go marques and use the screen 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.289
 achieves maitl security settings 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.640
 we have already seen account directive will see we will now see local delusions 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.140
 audit directive 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.510
 what a wolf event auditorium looks like 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.180
 user right assignment 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.340
 and security options 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.780
 I considered 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.200
 the most important part of your security option we will increase here 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.160
 the side of the screen 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.680
 a tragedy 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.970
 here is what these two items here 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.320
 It's very important for the company. 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.660
 if you administrator 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.800
 of a server in a company 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.120
 these two items are very important 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.630
 first item restrict access when assigning 1 only to users 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.250
 with the goal done locally and the other 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.000
 restricting photo access is only for the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.940
 with the goal done locally or only for that user the place 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.150
 this item 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.200
 when activated 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.540
 he restricted access to the user only or fault 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.590
 that is 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.010
 the server psychologist of this point with a br point can not have 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.370
 access to knowledge 1 and alf the worst whether you company this is important because 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.620
 it will not be able to copy any file for both your CD burner and 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.620

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.820
 Let's continue down here. 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.560
 this new imperative does not require contout and dell the local machines before the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.740
 user only place and will have to apply tight with celtic del and after 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.370
 the user by means of a password 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.820
 with regard to date the cephas needed this 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.889
 It's been too long, let's keep downloading 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.779

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:18.269
 in which if you had sent some message to your users with for 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.929
 example 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:23.519
 is this he sees that sharif and other cities 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.629
 or any other dossier message 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.549
 there will be no expedient on the day you put this message you want 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.069
 once the published computer or a client computer is connected 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.019
 before it runs the goal it will appear this screen informing itself the warning 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.659
 fonseka 2 resulted right over her 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.199
 I put the following email phrase welcome to our first server the 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.949
 server 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.949
 Let's give it here. 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.599
 Let's continue downloading edinho. 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.979

 there are several other encryption options 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.129
 customer's signature requirement there 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.649
 many other security options 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.099
 Let's see only five years. 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.019
 Let's minimize that.
