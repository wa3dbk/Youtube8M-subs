00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.520
 we make today I am your friend Carlos and in 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.710
 This video tutorial will teach you how to 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.720
 create partitions in windows 7 the 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.030
 difference in declaring partitions in 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.730
 windows xp here I leave the video in 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.360
 our part and we do not have to restart not 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.310
 we have to download nothing 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.000
 that can simply be done from the 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.970
 same system from the same system 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.890
 operative good as we can appreciate 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.410
 so this I have it windows 7 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.650
 ultimate serves as is this serves with 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.580
 any version of windows 7 this 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.190
 good that we have here if we are going to go 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.760
 at the beginning we are going to click right 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.379
 and we are going to give in administering I am going to 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.940
 show them that I have just one 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:09.630
 partition 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.630
 of a request of 14 gigabyte made 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.460
 let's wait until we're now 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.940
 well once done this will open us 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.920
 the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.010
 team management let's go to 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.630
 out tells you record management 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.620
 let's wait for him to load all 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.690
 our hard drives that are 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.900
 connected to the computer 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.810
 well here I put the hard disk is shown 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.730
 of fourteen gigas that I have simply 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.860
 to create the new partition we're going to 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.530
 give you right click reduce volume 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.080
 very good here a very important thing that 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.120
 should keep in mind is that the space 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.160
 that they are going to reduce you have to have 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.110
 free space will not remove 5 gigs 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.110
 then they have to have 5 free gigs 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.180
 and that is very important if your hard drive 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.810
 is full you can not do this nor what 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.720
 try because this is not going to give you this 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.000
 wait until I calculated how much space 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.870
 we can reduce 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.870
 and web 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.750
 well once I have calculated the space 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.000
 that we want to reduce will not leave that 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.950
 Little window will tell me what can I do 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.500
 produce 12 gb but it's not what 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.020
 advisable what it tells us here we are going to 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.750
 always reduce half is still in my 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.870
 case my disk of 14 and gasol to reduce them 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.920
 7 in this case would be 7 thousand but I do not 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.720
 say so much just 5 gigas 5000 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.240
 remember that for each girl they are 1024 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.520
 you then all in the account if the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.950
 half of the disk if they are 43 thousand 40,000 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.900
 50,000 etc. depending on the girls 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.959
 who want to reduce here will tell us 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.310
 how much each partition that is 10 gb 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.310
 ready do not go reduce 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.520
 this is a quick process 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.840
 It does not take not take longer than 23 minutes 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.459
 do the process 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.000
 let's wait for it to end 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.000
 reduce 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.950
 good a reduction advance we 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.500
 this partition will appear that that space 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.140
 dale not assigned new right - click 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.450
 new new volume simple person no 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.310
 comes out next we will notice how this 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.380
 following 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.150
 Here we assign a letter I recommend 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.280
 let him leave the one he places 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.000
 defect let's go to the next 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.430
 here where it says format if it takes files 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.770
 let's rotate like this size of 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.450
 assignment had predetermined 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.000
 here in volume label we are going to 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.020
 put the name we want to give to 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.690
 our second partition 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.130
 Now you next 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:49.330
 let's finish and let's wait for 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.330
 that the partition is created 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.320
 once and we have the partition of the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.580
 open this automatic playback 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.050
 close 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.319
 we are going to develop the administration of 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.790
 discs with tour started equipment 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.970
 and we see that our two are already 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.220
 partitions created 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.980
 good friends so easy they are created 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.290
 partitions 2017 I hope you have left 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.690
 the video also comment point of 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.700
 be written until a next video that 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.700
 have a happy and placid day goodbye
