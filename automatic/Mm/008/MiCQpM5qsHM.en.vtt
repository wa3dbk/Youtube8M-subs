00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
works I mean the old paradigm of

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.560 
works I mean the old paradigm of
healthcare<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.770> basically<00:01:08.340> disease<00:01:09.330> based

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
healthcare was basically disease based

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.149 
healthcare was basically disease based
healthcare<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.439> may<00:01:10.560> wait<00:01:10.740> till<00:01:10.950> something

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
healthcare you may wait till something

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.280 
healthcare you may wait till something
broke<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> tried<00:01:12.450> very<00:01:12.689> valiantly

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
broke and then you tried very valiantly

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
broke and then you tried very valiantly
and<00:01:13.439> sometimes<00:01:14.040> very<00:01:14.400> aggressively<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.330> try

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and sometimes very aggressively to try

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.210 
and sometimes very aggressively to try
and<00:01:15.720> fix<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.170> was<00:01:16.290> broken<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.860> often<00:01:17.189> times

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and fix what was broken but often times

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.100 
and fix what was broken but often times
you<00:01:17.580> couldn't<00:01:17.880> fix<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.570> could<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.780> at

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you couldn't fix it you could just at

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.950 
you couldn't fix it you could just at
best<00:01:19.320> live<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.280> often<00:01:20.460> times<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.840> was

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
best live with it and often times it was

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.149 
best live with it and often times it was
worse<00:01:22.200> than<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.500> couldn't<00:01:22.830> fix<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.100> at

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
worse than that you couldn't fix it at

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.520 
worse than that you couldn't fix it at
all<00:01:23.310> or<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.759> couldn't<00:01:24.270> live<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.869> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
all or you couldn't live with it and so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.320 
all or you couldn't live with it and so
we<00:01:25.950> believe<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.400> preventive<00:01:26.820> health<00:01:27.000> care<00:01:27.060> we

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
we believe in preventive health care we

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.580 
we believe in preventive health care we
believe<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.200> early<00:01:28.470> detection

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
believe in the early detection

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
believe in the early detection
prevention<00:01:29.100> treatment<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.909> or<00:01:30.119> reversal<00:01:30.750> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
prevention treatment and or reversal of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.090 
prevention treatment and or reversal of
aging<00:01:31.530> related<00:01:31.920> disease<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.720> that<00:01:33.720> has<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
aging related disease and that has it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.210 
aging related disease and that has it
works<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.759> people<00:01:36.540> want<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.220> most

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
works and people want it and most

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.469 
works and people want it and most
importantly<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> doctors<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.360> world

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
importantly the doctors of the world

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
importantly the doctors of the world
want<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> next

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
want this and so this is the next

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
want this and so this is the next
paradigm<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.210> health<00:01:42.509> care<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> what<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
paradigm of health care this is what the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.170 
paradigm of health care this is what the
world<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> that's<00:01:44.880> why

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
world is going to and that's why

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969 
world is going to and that's why
anti-aging<00:01:45.750> medicine<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.259> successful<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
anti-aging medicine is so successful and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.730 
anti-aging medicine is so successful and
has<00:01:47.369> grown<00:01:47.820> enormously<00:01:48.659> around<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> world<00:01:49.590> in

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
has grown enormously around the world in

to<00:01:58.799> anti-aging<00:01:59.490> medicine<00:01:59.850> well<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
to anti-aging medicine well I think the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
to anti-aging medicine well I think the
best<00:02:01.439> testament<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.969> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
best testament to that is if you have a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.580 
best testament to that is if you have a
chance<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> go<00:02:03.689> upstairs<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.140> look<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
chance to go upstairs and look at the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.890 
chance to go upstairs and look at the
doctors

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
doctors

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.350 
doctors

and just just just just look at them I

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.210 
and just just just just look at them I
mean<00:02:08.750> these<00:02:08.960> people<00:02:09.020> are<00:02:09.350> in<00:02:09.470> their<00:02:09.619> 50s<00:02:09.979> or

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
mean these people are in their 50s or

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.250 
mean these people are in their 50s or
60s<00:02:10.369> or<00:02:10.729> 70s<00:02:10.790> their<00:02:11.480> 80s<00:02:11.870> we<00:02:11.960> have<00:02:12.050> some<00:02:12.170> people

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
60s or 70s their 80s we have some people

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.620 
60s or 70s their 80s we have some people
in<00:02:12.410> their<00:02:12.590> 90's<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.160> they<00:02:13.790> all<00:02:14.000> look<00:02:14.330> 10<00:02:14.600> years

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
in their 90's and they all look 10 years

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.110 
in their 90's and they all look 10 years
younger<00:02:14.900> sometimes<00:02:15.770> 20<00:02:16.250> years<00:02:16.460> younger<00:02:16.820> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
younger sometimes 20 years younger and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.390 
younger sometimes 20 years younger and
more<00:02:17.990> importantly<00:02:18.530> than<00:02:18.680> they<00:02:18.830> look<00:02:19.070> younger

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
more importantly than they look younger

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.670 
more importantly than they look younger
because<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.120> not<00:02:20.270> about<00:02:20.680> aesthetics

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
because this is not about aesthetics

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.980 
because this is not about aesthetics
okay<00:02:22.430> not<00:02:22.880> that<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.090> don't<00:02:23.210> do<00:02:23.420> aesthetics<00:02:23.840> we

okay not that we don't do aesthetics we
do<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:24.830> it's<00:02:25.010> not<00:02:25.190> about<00:02:25.640> looking<00:02:26.090> younger

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
do but it's not about looking younger

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.690 
do but it's not about looking younger
it's<00:02:26.930> about<00:02:27.170> being<00:02:27.620> younger<00:02:28.070> it's<00:02:28.400> about

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700
