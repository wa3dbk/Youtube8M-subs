little<00:00:30.840> stud<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> top<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.830> what<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.980> did<00:00:32.099> is

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
little stud on the top so what I did is

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.000 
little stud on the top so what I did is
I<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> small<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.450> knife<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.559> guess<00:00:34.770> I

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
I got a small little knife I guess I

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.580 
I got a small little knife I guess I
just<00:00:35.730> cut<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> top<00:00:36.450> off<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.440> can

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
just cut the top off here it can you can

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.530 
just cut the top off here it can you can
cut<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> little<00:00:38.190> bit<00:00:38.340> better<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> has<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
cut it a little bit better but it has a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.650 
cut it a little bit better but it has a
hole<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.040> fits<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.660> perfectly

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
hole in it so it just fits on perfectly

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.830 
hole in it so it just fits on perfectly
I<00:00:42.870> would<00:00:43.350> recommend<00:00:43.770> putting<00:00:43.890> any<00:00:44.129> clue<00:00:44.520> on

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
I would recommend putting any clue on

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.600 
I would recommend putting any clue on
because<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.960> could<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.800> mess<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
because that could just mess it up and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.569 
because that could just mess it up and
make<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.329> stiff<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.559> mean<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.920> fits<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.280> well

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
make it stiff but I mean it fits on well

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.869 
make it stiff but I mean it fits on well
well<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.390> shake<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.870> come<00:00:52.230> off<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.699> works

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
well you shake it come off so it works

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.350 
well you shake it come off so it works
really<00:00:53.969> well<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:55.140> cheap<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:56.210> guess<00:00:57.210> if

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
really well and it's cheap I guess if

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.459 
really well and it's cheap I guess if
you<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.570> these<00:00:57.750> flying<00:00:57.989> around<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.320> house

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.360 
if you have Legos you most definitely
have<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> these<00:01:01.079> pieces<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.309> just
