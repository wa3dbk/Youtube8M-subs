00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
can play so this default bird called

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.270 
can play so this default bird called
Cardinal<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> bird<00:00:43.500> called<00:00:43.829> fuguro

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
Cardinal this is a bird called fuguro

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.010 
Cardinal this is a bird called fuguro
and<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> snitch<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.480> each

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and this is the snitch and each

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.529 
and this is the snitch and each
character<00:00:46.800> has<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.010> different<00:00:47.579> gameplay

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
character has a different gameplay

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.540 
character has a different gameplay
dynamic<00:00:49.879> handling<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.890> flies

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
dynamic handling and so this one flies

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.389 
dynamic handling and so this one flies
and<00:00:54.000> falls<00:00:54.480> very<00:00:54.870> first<00:00:55.199> by<00:00:55.469> tapping<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.219> is

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
and falls very first by tapping this is

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.360 
and falls very first by tapping this is
more<00:00:56.670> stable<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.780> stable<00:00:58.500> approach<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
more stable for a stable approach and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.670 
more stable for a stable approach and
this<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.850> will<00:01:00.120> fly<00:01:00.449> high<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> fall<00:01:01.410> very

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
this one will fly high and fall very

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.210 
this one will fly high and fall very
fast<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.260> choose<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.010> bird

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
fast so you have to choose the bird

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.399 
fast so you have to choose the bird
depending<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> level<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.240> play<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.869> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
depending on the level you play and you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.359 
depending on the level you play and you
can<00:01:07.770> unlock<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.180> bird<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:10.320> try<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
can unlock the bird for one try if you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.550 
can unlock the bird for one try if you
have<00:01:11.520> coins<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.350> bird

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
here and went through it so we can just

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.810 
here and went through it so we can just
start<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.950> new<00:01:29.490> level<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.700> here<00:01:32.700> we
