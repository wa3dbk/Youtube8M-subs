00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.870

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.290

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.650
 to lure out my ladies and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.759
 Gentlemen then they are almost automatic 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.390
 successfully 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.710
 every day when i say every day then 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.899
 I mean every day we knew 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.540

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:51.030

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.670
 started to get up with one 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.399
 Recommendation from the practice, they are superior 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.460
 when they get up in the morning who can i 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.990
 to make you happy today 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.180
 when I got up this morning 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.460
 wellcome hotel and thank you 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.979
 Everything worked out fine , I thought 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.899
 how many nice friendly people 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.100
 i can prepare you up here 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 in the last row 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.460
 everyone and what I tell them my 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.230
 ladies and gentlemen prepares them joy 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.470
 because it is finished and something is 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.450
 know that the beautiful thing I give you 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.710
 Today they already know or know 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.160
 most of it only many do not live 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.060
 after that and from that I live again and that 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.570
 is very interesting 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.460
 the theme is your success today 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.890
 is feasible if I am asked or 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.080
 they are asked what do they understand 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.140
 because under follows how do they define 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.320
 what is she doing successfully what 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.790
 I probably would answer for that 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.840
 am successful if you have a big one 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.690
 car ferry 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.630
 If I have a big flat I am 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.380
 Make a lot of money when I get a bonus 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.180
 get nice story my little one 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.940
 Grandchild was upstairs the other day - we are all 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.730
 Pigeons from the coastal area was with 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.560
 his kindergarten group in the sand 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.950
 playing in santa peter ording 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.380
 once chamber roaring and I said 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.390
 have my bank set in sand click 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.930
 I now a bonus you less 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.990
 the little ones have it on it 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.700
 interesting is that so that's how they are 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.100
 material elements of the done 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.740
 there would be immaterial elements there 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.800
 probably say status prestige 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.370
 everything just right everything wrong 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.480
 because here is the cause and effect 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.130
 many confuse success 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.780
 Definitions about success I am myself 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.280
 for one decided and that is 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.960
 Success is the achievement of a goal 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.060
 Agreed 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.550
 and if i look around here like that 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.990
 each one of them has different goals and goals 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.450
 so everyone is in his own wise 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.270
 otherwise successful and yet we are 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.270
 all connected because it is in 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.760
 us humans is that we make sense 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.330
 fulfillment that we need a success 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.330
 need
