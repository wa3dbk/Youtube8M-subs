hi<00:00:19.410> I'm<00:00:19.680> Dave<00:00:19.980> voltagio

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
hi I'm Dave voltagio

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.390 
hi I'm Dave voltagio
and<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.000> built<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.449> Mindstorms<00:00:22.380> robotic<00:00:23.100> arm

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and I built the Mindstorms robotic arm

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.750 
and I built the Mindstorms robotic arm
mark<00:00:24.090> 6<00:00:24.680> how<00:00:25.680> does<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.039> arm<00:00:26.220> work<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.670> what

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
mark 6 how does the arm work here what

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.160 
mark 6 how does the arm work here what
all<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> setup<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.449> make<00:00:27.599> everything<00:00:27.869> move

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
all is the setup to make everything move

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.380 
all is the setup to make everything move
well<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.920> actually<00:00:29.250> pretty<00:00:29.939> simple

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
well it's actually pretty simple

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.930 
well it's actually pretty simple
it's<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.109> four<00:00:31.439> motors<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:32.489> four

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
it's just four motors and then four

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.870 
it's just four motors and then four
buttons<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.920> pretty<00:00:34.920> simple<00:00:35.250> programming<00:00:35.760> so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
buttons and pretty simple programming so

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.940 
buttons and pretty simple programming so
every<00:00:36.030> time<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> touch<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> button<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.410> causes

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
every time I touch a button it causes

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.130 
every time I touch a button it causes
the<00:00:38.160> motor<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.670> close<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.270> release<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.930> button

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the motor to close I release the button

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.740 
the motor to close I release the button
that<00:00:40.200> goes<00:00:40.350> back<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> then<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.920> goes<00:00:40.980> limp

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
that goes back and then it goes limp

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.690 
that goes back and then it goes limp
pretty<00:00:43.260> straightforward<00:00:43.530> you've<00:00:44.520> got<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
pretty straightforward you've got a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.460 
pretty straightforward you've got a
phone<00:00:45.060> there<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.810> kind<00:00:45.990> of<00:00:46.080> what<00:00:46.230> runs

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
phone there so is that kind of what runs

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.320 
phone there so is that kind of what runs

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
we turned out all the lights which is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.030 
we turned out all the lights which is
kind<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.060> cool<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.450> put<00:01:06.720> edit<00:01:07.080> some<00:01:07.260> LEDs<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
kind of cool so I put edit some LEDs and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
kind of cool so I put edit some LEDs and
then<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.790> neat<00:01:09.060> little<00:01:09.090> light<00:01:09.780> bar<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
then this neat little light bar that I

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.130 
then this neat little light bar that I
found<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.560> target<00:01:11.240> just<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.390> fun<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
found a target just for fun just to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.200 
found a target just for fun just to
light<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.640> yeah<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.060> design

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
light it up yeah what was the design

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
light it up yeah what was the design
process<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.170> Jeff<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> few

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
process on this like Jeff to you a few

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.050 
process on this like Jeff to you a few
different<00:01:17.040> variations<00:01:17.640> trying<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.910> figure

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
different variations trying to figure

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.460 
different variations trying to figure
out<00:01:18.090> how<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> fit<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:18.750> arm<00:01:18.900> best<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
out how to fit on your arm best and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.380 
out how to fit on your arm best and
stuff<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.800> that<00:01:20.010> yeah<00:01:20.430> basically<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.210> is

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
stuff like that yeah basically this is

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
stuff like that yeah basically this is
the<00:01:21.540> sixth<00:01:21.930> version<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.680> I've<00:01:22.800> done<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.190> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the sixth version that I've done in a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.969 
the sixth version that I've done in a
year<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.180> every<00:01:24.840> time<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.050> build<00:01:25.380> an<00:01:25.590> arm<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
year so every time I build an arm and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.100 
year so every time I build an arm and
then<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> basically<00:01:26.820> play<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:28.050> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
then I basically play with it and then I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.080 
then I basically play with it and then I
strip<00:01:28.410> it<00:01:28.560> down<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.729> kind<00:01:29.910> of<00:01:29.970> like

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
strip it down so that I can kind of like

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.790 
strip it down so that I can kind of like
rebuild<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.050> learn<00:01:31.200> from<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.650> I've<00:01:31.770> just

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
rebuild it learn from what I've just

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.480 
rebuild it learn from what I've just
done

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
done

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.570 
done
so<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.509> basically<00:01:34.140> start<00:01:34.800> by<00:01:34.920> putting<00:01:35.100> four

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
so I basically start by putting four

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.210 
so I basically start by putting four
motors<00:01:35.910> together<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> hand<00:01:36.780> shape<00:01:37.050> in<00:01:37.500> basic

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
motors together in a hand shape in basic

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.219 
motors together in a hand shape in basic
hand<00:01:38.430> shape<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.850> then<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.420> start<00:01:39.690> adding<00:01:39.900> on

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
hand shape and then I start adding on

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.810 
hand shape and then I start adding on
and<00:01:40.500> reinforcing<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:41.550> it's<00:01:41.729> really

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and reinforcing it because it's really

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
and reinforcing it because it's really
heavy<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:42.930> need<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> lot<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> structural

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
heavy so you need a lot of structural

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.160 
heavy so you need a lot of structural
integrity<00:01:44.160> so<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.119> keep<00:01:45.300> adding<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.080> this

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
integrity so I keep adding on and this

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.570 
integrity so I keep adding on and this
see

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
see

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.910 
see
different<00:01:48.330> like<00:01:48.480> cross<00:01:48.750> braces<00:01:49.230> and<00:01:49.380> stuff<00:01:49.440> so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
different like cross braces and stuff so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.190 
different like cross braces and stuff so
that<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.510> stays<00:01:51.510> together

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that it stays together

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.780 
that it stays together
it<00:01:52.290> doesn't<00:01:52.620> like<00:01:52.740> wobble<00:01:53.130> apart<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.580> stuff

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it doesn't like wobble apart and stuff

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.460 
it doesn't like wobble apart and stuff
because<00:01:53.880> previous<00:01:54.720> versions<00:01:55.080> I've<00:01:55.200> had<00:01:55.320> have

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
because previous versions I've had have

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.020 
because previous versions I've had have
been<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:55.830> flimsy<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.460> I've<00:01:56.670> learned<00:01:56.910> from

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
been really flimsy and I've learned from

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.610 
been really flimsy and I've learned from
that<00:01:57.090> mistake

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
that mistake

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.810 
that mistake
can<00:01:58.620> you<00:01:58.740> wear<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.070> what's<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.430> longest

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820

you've ever worn this for does he get

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260 
you've ever worn this for does he get
pretty<00:02:01.470> heavy<00:02:01.650> after<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> while<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.700> gets<00:02:02.940> very

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
pretty heavy after a while it gets very

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.570 
pretty heavy after a while it gets very
heavy<00:02:03.510> I<00:02:03.870> worried<00:02:04.860> about<00:02:05.070> three<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.430> half

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
heavy I worried about three and a half

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.160 
heavy I worried about three and a half
hours<00:02:05.880> straight<00:02:06.060> yesterday<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.900> public

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
hours straight yesterday for the public

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.100 
hours straight yesterday for the public
and<00:02:07.410> I<00:02:07.980> was<00:02:08.130> walking<00:02:08.310> around<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.150> shaking

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and I was walking around and shaking

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.780 
and I was walking around and shaking
people's<00:02:10.410> hands<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.860> stuff<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
people's hands and stuff and it

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.570 
people's hands and stuff and it
definitely<00:02:12.390> gets<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.810> little<00:02:13.560> heavy<00:02:13.890> after<00:02:14.310> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
definitely gets a little heavy after a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.410 
definitely gets a little heavy after a
while<00:02:15.560> because<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.680> got<00:02:16.830> dv3<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.000> all<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
while because you got dv3 and all the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.750 
while because you got dv3 and all the
batteries<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.860> know<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.490> four

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
batteries on it so you know in the four

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.530 
batteries on it so you know in the four
motors<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.210> course<00:02:21.530> gets<00:02:22.530> heavy<00:02:22.830> there<00:02:23.040> I

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
motors of course gets heavy there I

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.790 
motors of course gets heavy there I
would<00:02:24.540> imagine<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.990> could<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.350> quite

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
would imagine that could be quite

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.700 
would imagine that could be quite
annoying<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.520> have<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.180> ever<00:02:27.720> had<00:02:28.440> any<00:02:28.530> big

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
annoying so I have you ever had any big

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.470 
annoying so I have you ever had any big
mishaps<00:02:29.130> with<00:02:29.340> wires<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.360> our

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
mishaps with wires and like that our

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.550 
mishaps with wires and like that our
engines<00:02:30.780> what<00:02:30.930> was<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.110> biggest<00:02:31.290> challenge

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
engines what was the biggest challenge

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.770 
engines what was the biggest challenge
of<00:02:31.980> putting<00:02:32.130> all<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.550> other<00:02:32.700> who<00:02:33.300> biggest

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
of putting all the other who biggest

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.450 
of putting all the other who biggest
challenge<00:02:34.200> biggest<00:02:34.530> challenge<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.010> probably

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
challenge biggest challenge is probably

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.360 
challenge biggest challenge is probably
getting<00:02:36.120> all<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.600> these<00:02:36.780> wires<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.160> wires

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
getting all of these wires and the wires

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.600 
getting all of these wires and the wires
underneath<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.900> kind<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.470> stay<00:02:41.460> out<00:02:41.490> of

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
underneath to kind of like stay out of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.940 
underneath to kind of like stay out of
the<00:02:41.760> way<00:02:41.990> because<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.260> need<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.500> change<00:02:43.830> the
