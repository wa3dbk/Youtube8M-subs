it is water vinegar all inside and you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.109 
it is water vinegar all inside and you
just<00:01:12.840> start<00:01:13.200> scraping<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.760> by<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.090> time

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
just start scraping it and by that time

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.520 
just start scraping it and by that time
everything<00:01:15.479> should<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.990> loose<00:01:16.200> enough

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
everything should be loose enough

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
everything should be loose enough
everything<00:01:17.009> should<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.220> good<00:01:17.400> enough<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.210> all

everything should be good enough and all
the<00:01:18.990> stuff<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.500> will<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.860> easily<00:01:20.250> scraped

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the stuff here will be easily scraped

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.420 
the stuff here will be easily scraped
off<00:01:21.619> that's<00:01:22.619> already<00:01:22.860> stripping<00:01:23.250> off

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
off that's already stripping off

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.510 
off that's already stripping off
decently<00:01:24.799> basically<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.070> got<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.340> wait<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
decently basically but you got to wait a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.480 
decently basically but you got to wait a
little<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.159> once<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.280> start

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
little bit so that once you start

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.380 
little bit so that once you start
scraping<00:01:29.700> they'll<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.299> easy<00:01:30.799> but<00:01:31.799> um

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
scraping they'll be really easy but um

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.100 
scraping they'll be really easy but um
wear<00:01:33.390> some<00:01:33.570> gloves<00:01:34.130> because<00:01:35.600> who<00:01:36.600> knows<00:01:36.810> what

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
wear some gloves because who knows what

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780
