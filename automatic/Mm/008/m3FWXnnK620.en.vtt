00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.820 
it's going to have a four point one inch
screen<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.199> very<00:01:04.559> tall

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
screen and you can see that's very tall

ipod touch again we have these on our a
partition<00:01:14.880> now<00:01:15.000> except<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.750> only<00:01:15.990> thing

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
partition now except the only thing

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.140 
partition now except the only thing
different<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.189> model<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.549> seems<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.909> is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
different in this model it seems like is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
different in this model it seems like is
the<00:01:18.420> larger<00:01:18.990> screen<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.500> course<00:01:20.009> Apple<00:01:20.189> might

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the larger screen of course Apple might

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.100 
the larger screen of course Apple might
decide<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> upgrade<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.330> hardware<00:01:21.600> inside<00:01:21.960> as

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
decide to upgrade the hardware inside as

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.719 
decide to upgrade the hardware inside as
well<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.619> now<00:01:22.710> all<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.340> leak

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
well but for now all we have to leak

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.090 
well but for now all we have to leak
today<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.659> guys<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.350> larger<00:01:25.740> panel

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
today for you guys is the larger panel

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.690 
today for you guys is the larger panel
so<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> bit<00:01:27.360> weird<00:01:27.720> because<00:01:28.400> Apple<00:01:29.400> like

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so it is a bit weird because Apple like

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.039 
so it is a bit weird because Apple like
a<00:01:29.759> rumor<00:01:30.150> has<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.479> came<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.780> about<00:01:30.840> two

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
a rumor has just came out about two

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.050 
a rumor has just came out about two
three<00:01:31.200> point<00:01:31.470> nine<00:01:31.530> five<00:01:31.680> inch<00:01:32.040> iphone<00:01:32.759> screen

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
three point nine five inch iphone screen

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.249 
three point nine five inch iphone screen
we<00:01:33.240> don't<00:01:33.390> know<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.540> that's<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.079> real

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
we don't know if that's going to be real

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.289 
we don't know if that's going to be real
but<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.829> definitely<00:01:35.130> seems<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.729> plausible

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
but this definitely seems very plausible

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
but this definitely seems very plausible
because<00:01:36.450> Apple<00:01:36.840> did<00:01:37.020> theta<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.590> higher

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
because Apple did theta will be higher

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.760 
because Apple did theta will be higher
than<00:01:38.460> four<00:01:38.759> inches<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.930> 4.1<00:01:40.380> inches

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
than four inches and this is 4.1 inches

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.730 
than four inches and this is 4.1 inches
so<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.040> definitely<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.640> higher<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so it's definitely is higher and it is a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.440 
so it's definitely is higher and it is a
bit<00:01:43.950> weird<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.310> Apple<00:01:44.850> white<00:01:45.030> Apple

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
bit weird because Apple white Apple

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.149 
bit weird because Apple white Apple
usually<00:01:45.780> does<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.110> they<00:01:46.259> release<00:01:46.530> ipod<00:01:46.920> touch

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
usually does is they release ipod touch

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.190 
usually does is they release ipod touch
and<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:47.880> follow<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.689> size<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and then they follow the size of the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.319 
and then they follow the size of the
ipod<00:01:49.470> touch<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> iphone<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.729> this

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
ipod touch with the iphone so this

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.090 
ipod touch with the iphone so this
should<00:01:51.479> point<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.869> rumors<00:01:52.229> or<00:01:52.470> should<00:01:52.950> point

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
should point to rumors or should point

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.760 
should point to rumors or should point
to<00:01:53.310> an<00:01:53.399> iphone<00:01:53.579> 5<00:01:54.060> having<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.780> 4.1<00:01:55.350> inch<00:01:55.530> screen

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
to an iphone 5 having a 4.1 inch screen

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.020 
to an iphone 5 having a 4.1 inch screen
because<00:01:55.979> that's<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.250> Apple<00:01:56.520> usually<00:01:56.820> does

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
because that's what Apple usually does

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.639 
because that's what Apple usually does
they<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.509> standardize<00:01:58.049> their<00:01:58.259> products

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
they like to standardize their products

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.530 
they like to standardize their products
and<00:01:58.770> that's<00:01:59.340> why<00:01:59.579> that's<00:01:59.939> exactly<00:02:00.090> why<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and that's why that's exactly why the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.170 
and that's why that's exactly why the
iphones<00:02:01.110> side<00:02:01.530> screen<00:02:01.890> size<00:02:02.100> hasn't<00:02:02.850> really

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
iphones side screen size hasn't really

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.130 
iphones side screen size hasn't really
changed<00:02:03.210> too<00:02:03.810> much<00:02:03.840> since<00:02:04.460> 2007<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.020> it's<00:02:07.020> been

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
changed too much since 2007 so it's been

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.960 
changed too much since 2007 so it's been
a<00:02:07.170> lot<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.439> years<00:02:07.710> since<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.759> seems

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
a lot of years since then and it seems

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.639 
a lot of years since then and it seems
like<00:02:09.060> apples<00:02:09.450> finally<00:02:09.869> deciding<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.379> change

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
like apples finally deciding to change

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.580 
like apples finally deciding to change
things<00:02:10.830> up<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.879> better<00:02:12.060> i<00:02:12.540> believe<00:02:12.870> so

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
things up for the better i believe so

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.350 
things up for the better i believe so
I<00:02:13.620> guess<00:02:14.040> that's<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.519> videos<00:02:14.849> that's<00:02:15.269> all

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
I guess that's all the videos that's all

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.839 
I guess that's all the videos that's all
the<00:02:15.480> news<00:02:15.510> i<00:02:15.870> had<00:02:16.050> today<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.440> talk<00:02:16.769> about<00:02:16.849> so
