00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
to the search box here and also we need

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.769 
to the search box here and also we need
to<00:00:15.780> push<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.970> navigation<00:00:17.970> background<00:00:18.449> down

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
to push the navigation background down

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.340 
to push the navigation background down
so<00:00:19.560> if<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:19.800> just<00:00:19.980> jump<00:00:20.070> over<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.640> Dreamweaver

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
so if we just jump over to Dreamweaver

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.840 
so if we just jump over to Dreamweaver
so<00:00:22.350> as<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.710> see<00:00:22.859> here<00:00:23.130> we've<00:00:23.430> got<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
so as you can see here we've got the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.120 
so as you can see here we've got the
search<00:00:24.660> box<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.199> corner<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:25.710> really<00:00:26.010> it

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
search box in this corner but really it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.250 
search box in this corner but really it
should<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.460> floated<00:00:27.060> right<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
should be floated right up to the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.620 
should be floated right up to the
right-hand<00:00:28.529> side<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.640> also<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
right-hand side here and also the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.569 
right-hand side here and also the
navigation<00:00:30.990> background<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.070> far<00:00:32.399> too

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
navigation background here is far too

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.190 
navigation background here is far too
close<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> top<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:33.600> need<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.809> push<00:00:34.020> that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
close to the top so we need to push that

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.020 
close to the top so we need to push that
down<00:00:34.370> so<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:35.969> jump<00:00:36.059> into<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.809> code<00:00:38.030> so

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
down so if we just jump into the code so

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.270 
down so if we just jump into the code so
as<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.170> search<00:00:40.530> content

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
as we can see here the search content

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.119 
as we can see here the search content
div<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.390> what's<00:00:42.690> holding<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.410> field<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
div is what's holding the field and the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.580 
div is what's holding the field and the
button<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.840> go<00:00:46.020> over<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590

slice we want we just zoom in so this is

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.249 
slice we want we just zoom in so this is
the<00:01:58.590> slice<00:01:58.880> number<00:01:59.880> 9<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.360> want<00:02:00.570> here<00:02:00.840> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the slice number 9 that we want here and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.800 
the slice number 9 that we want here and
click<00:02:01.530> Save<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.270> then<00:02:03.270> make<00:02:03.390> sure<00:02:03.420> these

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
click Save and then make sure these

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.200 
click Save and then make sure these
slices<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.439> selected<00:02:04.860> two<00:02:05.009> selected<00:02:05.670> slices

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
slices is selected two selected slices

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.399 
slices is selected two selected slices
and<00:02:06.450> click<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.810> save

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and click on save

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.190 
and click on save
I<00:02:07.439> will<00:02:08.129> now<00:02:08.310> save<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.360> if<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.899> jump

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
I will now save that so if we just jump

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.680 
I will now save that so if we just jump
back<00:02:10.319> over<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.979> Dreamweaver

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
back over to Dreamweaver

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.490 
back over to Dreamweaver
so<00:02:13.290> if<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:13.740> go<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.160> code<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:16.380> if<00:02:16.440> you

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so if we just go to the code so if you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.410 
so if we just go to the code so if you
look<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.190> search<00:02:17.430> box<00:02:17.730> it's<00:02:18.120> got<00:02:18.270> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
look here for the search box it's got a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.990 
look here for the search box it's got a
class<00:02:18.780> called<00:02:19.110> search<00:02:19.440> field<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:20.880> just

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
class called search field so we just

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.340 
class called search field so we just
need<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.150> find<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.810> style<00:02:22.140> sheet

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
need to find that in the style sheet

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.620 
need to find that in the style sheet
which<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:24.200> here<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.670> search<00:02:27.210> field

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
which is here so it's the search field

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.170 
which is here so it's the search field
class<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.320> we<00:02:28.380> want<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.620> style<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:30.060> we're

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
class that we want to style so we're

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.370 
class that we want to style so we're
just<00:02:30.210> going<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.450> say<00:02:30.710> background<00:02:33.080> image<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
just going to say background image and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.930 
just going to say background image and
we'll<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.680> browse<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.370> image<00:02:35.490> we<00:02:35.730> just

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
we'll just browse to that image we just

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.130 
we'll just browse to that image we just
created<00:02:38.210> so<00:02:39.210> if<00:02:39.300> we<00:02:39.360> go<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.600> tight<00:02:39.720> images

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
created so if we go in tight images

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.140 
created so if we go in tight images
folder<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.860> then<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.460> come<00:02:41.610> down<00:02:41.850> we

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
folder and then if we come down we

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.040 
folder and then if we come down we
should<00:02:42.210> see<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.990> search<00:02:43.260> BG<00:02:43.740> gradient

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
should see here and search BG gradient

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.150 
should see here and search BG gradient
and<00:02:46.050> then<00:02:46.170> we<00:02:46.230> always<00:02:46.380> say<00:02:46.590> background<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:50.070> we

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
and then we always say background so we

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.130 
and then we always say background so we
want<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> select<00:02:50.580> repeat<00:02:51.090> like<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.900> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
want to select repeat like that and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.310 
want to select repeat like that and
close<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.470> off<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:54.630> we<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:54.870> preview

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
close that off so if we just preview

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.260 
close that off so if we just preview
this<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.830> index<00:02:56.190> page<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.760> then<00:02:57.060> just

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
this in the index page and then just

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.070 
this in the index page and then just
preview<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.870> web<00:02:58.020> browser<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:59.340> ie<00:03:00.080> so

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
preview this in a web browser so ie so

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.210 
preview this in a web browser so ie so
as<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.260> can<00:03:01.350> see<00:03:01.410> we've<00:03:01.620> now<00:03:01.650> got<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.040> here

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
as you can see we've now got it here

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.310 
as you can see we've now got it here
over<00:03:02.520> in<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.700> right-hand<00:03:03.150> corner<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.690> we've

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
over in the right-hand corner and we've

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.810 
over in the right-hand corner and we've
now<00:03:04.440> got<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.770> gradient<00:03:05.220> effects<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
now got the gradient effects in the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.340 
now got the gradient effects in the
background<00:03:05.970> but<00:03:06.570> we've<00:03:06.720> got<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> slight<00:03:07.170> issue

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
background but we've got a slight issue

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.890 
background but we've got a slight issue
here<00:03:08.010> where<00:03:08.760> we<00:03:08.940> can't<00:03:09.150> see<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.540> full

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
here where we can't see the full

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.310 
here where we can't see the full
background<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.120> need<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.390> round<00:03:12.930> these

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
background and we do need to round these

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.590 
background and we do need to round these
corners<00:03:13.350> here<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.670> if<00:03:14.790> we<00:03:14.820> just<00:03:15.000> go<00:03:15.090> back<00:03:15.300> into

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
corners here so if we just go back into

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.440 
corners here so if we just go back into
Dreamweaver<00:03:16.580> so<00:03:17.580> we<00:03:17.790> need<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.030> tell<00:03:18.240> these

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
Dreamweaver so we need to tell these

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.449 
Dreamweaver so we need to tell these
search<00:03:18.810> content<00:03:19.440> div<00:03:19.770> which<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.280> one

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
search content div which is this one

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.460 
search content div which is this one
it's<00:03:20.730> in<00:03:20.820> yellow<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.690> be<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> little<00:03:22.110> bit<00:03:22.230> longer

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
it's in yellow to be a little bit longer

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.100 
it's in yellow to be a little bit longer
so<00:03:23.310> if<00:03:23.370> we<00:03:23.430> come<00:03:23.580> over<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.940> style<00:03:24.300> sheet<00:03:24.390> so

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
so if we come over to the style sheet so

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.170 
so if we come over to the style sheet so
here's<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.530> search<00:03:25.709> content<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.970> we're<00:03:27.090> going

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
here's a search content so we're going

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.949 
here's a search content so we're going
to<00:03:27.270> say<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:28.110> width<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:31.640> 400<00:03:32.640> pixels<00:03:33.090> that's

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
to say the width is 400 pixels that's

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.290 
to say the width is 400 pixels that's
just<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.200> rough<00:03:34.350> guess<00:03:34.410> at<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.770> moment<00:03:35.240> okay<00:03:36.240> so

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
just a rough guess at the moment okay so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.820 
just a rough guess at the moment okay so
that's<00:03:36.480> way<00:03:36.660> too<00:03:36.690> long<00:03:37.080> so<00:03:37.500> if<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:37.620> just<00:03:37.740> go

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
that's way too long so if we just go

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.870 
that's way too long so if we just go
back<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.150> change<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.720> say<00:03:39.930> 200<00:03:40.880> check

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
back and we change it to say 200 check

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.300 
back and we change it to say 200 check
that<00:03:42.060> again<00:03:42.560> okay<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:43.920> going<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.100> be<00:03:44.190> more

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
that again okay so it's going to be more

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.710 
that again okay so it's going to be more
than<00:03:44.520> that<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:44.910> let's<00:03:44.940> say<00:03:45.209> 300<00:03:47.480> okay<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.540> that

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
than that so let's say 300 okay so that

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.940 
than that so let's say 300 okay so that
looks<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> bit<00:03:48.930> better<00:03:49.140> now<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:49.650> if<00:03:49.709> we<00:03:49.800> just

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
looks a bit better now so if we just

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.490 
looks a bit better now so if we just
preview<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.520> in<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.790> web<00:03:50.910> browser<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:52.350> hit

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
preview that in the web browser and hit

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.580 
preview that in the web browser and hit
refresh<00:03:53.570> they<00:03:54.570> gauge<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.900> know<00:03:54.989> see<00:03:55.050> we<00:03:55.470> can

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
refresh they gauge you know see we can

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.610 
refresh they gauge you know see we can
see<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.980> whole<00:03:56.160> edge<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.120> now<00:03:57.300> so<00:03:57.570> if<00:03:58.470> you

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
see the whole edge of it now so if you

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.070 
see the whole edge of it now so if you
go<00:03:58.709> back<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:59.040> Dreamweaver<00:03:59.930> it'll<00:04:00.930> probably

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
go back to Dreamweaver it'll probably

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.510 
go back to Dreamweaver it'll probably
just<00:04:01.260> bring<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:01.800> little<00:04:02.100> bit<00:04:02.220> more

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:13.090 

so<00:04:05.520> if<00:04:05.640> we<00:04:05.790> say<00:04:09.980> 275

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.380 

and<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.130> think<00:04:14.310> that's<00:04:14.490> just<00:04:14.670> about<00:04:14.790> right<00:04:15.000> now

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
and I think that's just about right now

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.920 
and I think that's just about right now
so<00:04:15.600> we<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:15.750> preview<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.739> hit<00:04:17.640> refresh

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
so we just preview that and hit refresh

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.569 
so we just preview that and hit refresh
that<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.049> up<00:04:19.200> that's<00:04:19.320> looking<00:04:19.650> good<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.950> me

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
that is up that's looking good to me

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.430 
that is up that's looking good to me
we<00:04:20.910> just<00:04:21.060> need<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.239> round<00:04:21.480> these<00:04:21.690> corners<00:04:21.720> so

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
we just need to round these corners so

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.610 
we just need to round these corners so
we<00:04:22.530> use<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:23.480> css3<00:04:24.480> property<00:04:25.290> called

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
we use a css3 property called

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.640 
we use a css3 property called
border-radius<00:04:26.570> so<00:04:27.570> if<00:04:27.690> we<00:04:27.780> just<00:04:27.960> go<00:04:28.140> to<00:04:28.200> the

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
border-radius so if we just go to the

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.730 
border-radius so if we just go to the
lead<00:04:29.430> code<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.840> we<00:04:30.930> need<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.170> again<00:04:31.410> we<00:04:31.590> need<00:04:31.680> to

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
lead code so we need to again we need to

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.830 
lead code so we need to again we need to
be<00:04:31.860> targeting<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.460> search<00:04:32.760> field<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:33.630> if<00:04:33.750> we

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
be targeting the search field so if we

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.230 
be targeting the search field so if we
go<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.170> style<00:04:34.440> sheet<00:04:34.670> here's<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.910> search

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
go to the style sheet here's the search

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.910 
go to the style sheet here's the search
field<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.960> we're<00:04:37.350> going<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.500> add<00:04:37.650> in<00:04:37.890> the

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
field and we're going to add in the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.240 
field and we're going to add in the
following<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:39.450> it's<00:04:39.570> going<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.750> be<00:04:39.840> border<00:04:41.750> top

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
following so it's going to be border top

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.330 
following so it's going to be border top
left<00:04:47.330> radius<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.900> we're<00:04:49.350> going<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.530> say<00:04:49.800> about

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
left radius and we're going to say about

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.470 
left radius and we're going to say about
seven<00:04:50.820> pixels<00:04:51.090> for<00:04:51.690> that<00:04:52.940> so<00:04:53.940> if<00:04:54.000> we<00:04:54.060> just<00:04:54.270> save

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
seven pixels for that so if we just save

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.080 
seven pixels for that so if we just save
that<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:54.990> open<00:04:55.200> up<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.620> web<00:04:55.830> browser<00:04:55.890> if<00:04:56.730> we<00:04:56.910> hit

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
that and open up a web browser if we hit

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.110 
that and open up a web browser if we hit
refresh<00:04:58.100> you<00:04:59.100> can<00:04:59.250> now<00:04:59.340> see<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.580> top

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
refresh you can now see that top

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.270 
refresh you can now see that top
left-hand<00:05:00.600> corner<00:05:00.660> is<00:05:00.960> now<00:05:01.140> rounded<00:05:01.680> so<00:05:02.040> we're

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
left-hand corner is now rounded so we're

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.550 
left-hand corner is now rounded so we're
nearly<00:05:02.430> there<00:05:02.520> so<00:05:02.910> if<00:05:02.970> we<00:05:03.060> just<00:05:03.210> go<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:03.900> copy

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
nearly there so if we just go and copy

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.320 
nearly there so if we just go and copy
this<00:05:07.160> and<00:05:08.160> paste<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.640> underneath<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.270> just

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
this and paste it underneath and just

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.350 
this and paste it underneath and just
change<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:09.980> position<00:05:10.980> here<00:05:11.190> from<00:05:11.400> from<00:05:12.060> top

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
change the position here from from top

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.530 
change the position here from from top
to<00:05:12.690> bottom<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:14.550> then<00:05:14.669> go<00:05:14.820> back<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.300> web

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
to bottom and then go back to the web

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.740 
to bottom and then go back to the web
browser<00:05:15.720> hit<00:05:16.620> refresh<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:18.120> we've<00:05:18.240> now<00:05:18.419> got

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
browser hit refresh and we've now got

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.380 
browser hit refresh and we've now got
the<00:05:19.280> rounded<00:05:20.280> corners<00:05:20.640> now<00:05:21.090> we've<00:05:21.240> got<00:05:21.360> a

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
the rounded corners now we've got a

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.820 
the rounded corners now we've got a
slight<00:05:21.600> issue<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:21.900> think<00:05:22.080> I<00:05:22.140> need<00:05:22.290> to<00:05:22.470> change

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
slight issue I think I need to change

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.500 
slight issue I think I need to change
the<00:05:23.040> heights<00:05:23.310> of<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.640> search<00:05:23.910> box<00:05:24.150> because

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
the heights of the search box because

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.930 
the heights of the search box because
I'm<00:05:24.630> quite<00:05:24.840> line<00:05:25.020> up<00:05:25.050> with<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:25.350> button<00:05:25.760> so<00:05:26.760> the

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
I'm quite line up with the button so the

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.550 
I'm quite line up with the button so the
heights<00:05:27.180> here<00:05:27.540> if<00:05:27.690> we<00:05:27.840> change<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.320> save

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
heights here if we change that to save

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.940 
heights here if we change that to save
27<00:05:29.460> pixels<00:05:29.940> again<00:05:30.750> refresh<00:05:31.440> this<00:05:31.620> in<00:05:31.830> the

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
27 pixels again refresh this in the

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.120 
27 pixels again refresh this in the
browser<00:05:33.470> okay<00:05:34.470> so<00:05:34.530> that's<00:05:34.710> looking<00:05:34.919> a<00:05:35.010> lot

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
browser okay so that's looking a lot

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.710 
browser okay so that's looking a lot
nicer<00:05:35.310> now<00:05:35.669> okay<00:05:36.210> so<00:05:36.270> what<00:05:36.419> I<00:05:36.450> think<00:05:36.570> we<00:05:36.690> need

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
nicer now okay so what I think we need

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.560 
nicer now okay so what I think we need
to<00:05:36.900> do<00:05:37.050> is<00:05:37.140> just<00:05:37.320> decrease<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:38.160> width<00:05:38.910> of<00:05:39.180> the

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
to do is just decrease the width of the

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.450 
to do is just decrease the width of the
search<00:05:40.140> box<00:05:40.530> so<00:05:40.710> we'd<00:05:40.830> bring<00:05:41.010> this<00:05:41.190> in<00:05:41.400> a

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
search box so we'd bring this in a

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.830 
search box so we'd bring this in a
little<00:05:41.790> so<00:05:42.150> if<00:05:42.210> we<00:05:42.300> just<00:05:42.390> go<00:05:42.450> back<00:05:42.540> to

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
little so if we just go back to

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.150 
little so if we just go back to
Dreamweaver<00:05:43.050> so<00:05:43.710> if<00:05:43.860> we<00:05:44.010> change<00:05:44.250> this<00:05:44.580> to<00:05:44.820> say

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
Dreamweaver so if we change this to say

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.820 
Dreamweaver so if we change this to say
106<00:05:47.160> 206<00:05:47.940> pixels<00:05:48.390> and<00:05:48.690> then<00:05:49.050> go<00:05:49.290> back<00:05:49.470> over

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
106 206 pixels and then go back over

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.880 
106 206 pixels and then go back over
here<00:05:49.860> refresh<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:50.669> page<00:05:51.410> and<00:05:52.410> I<00:05:52.470> think<00:05:52.650> that's

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
here refresh the page and I think that's

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.710 
here refresh the page and I think that's
looking<00:05:53.160> quite<00:05:53.430> nice<00:05:53.610> now<00:05:53.640> so<00:05:54.270> that's<00:05:54.570> that

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
looking quite nice now so that's that

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.020 
looking quite nice now so that's that
bit<00:05:54.930> sorted<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.890> next<00:05:56.100> portion<00:05:56.460> is<00:05:56.640> to<00:05:56.790> move

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
bit sorted the next portion is to move

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.290 
bit sorted the next portion is to move
the<00:05:57.650> navigation<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:58.770> background<00:05:59.250> down<00:05:59.520> so<00:06:00.180> if

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
the navigation and background down so if
