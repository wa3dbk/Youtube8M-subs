like<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.470> said<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> doesn't<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.310> neat

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
like I said it doesn't have to be neat

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.429 
like I said it doesn't have to be neat
you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.700> take<00:01:56.969> your<00:01:57.149> finger<00:01:57.450> coming<00:01:57.719> pick<00:01:58.290> up

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you can take your finger coming pick up

the<00:02:00.450> same<00:02:00.479> direction<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:02.070> curl<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the same direction the curl is in the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.550 
the same direction the curl is in the
hair<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.390> see<00:02:03.659> how<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.869> already<00:02:03.990> curling

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
hair you see how it's already curling

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.310 
hair you see how it's already curling
and<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.399> flicking<00:02:05.729> back<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.060> way<00:02:06.320> follow

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
and it's flicking back that way follow

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.059 
and it's flicking back that way follow
the<00:02:07.619> curl<00:02:07.829> pattern<00:02:07.920> place<00:02:08.910> your<00:02:09.149> roller<00:02:09.420> in

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
the curl pattern place your roller in

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.260 
the curl pattern place your roller in
there

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
there

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.090 
there
and<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:12.050> gonna<00:02:12.170> bend<00:02:12.440> right<00:02:12.590> into<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.950> iron

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
and it's gonna bend right into the iron

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.010 
and it's gonna bend right into the iron
I<00:02:13.460> mean<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.850> um<00:02:14.000> roller<00:02:14.300> I'm<00:02:14.570> sorry

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
I mean the um roller I'm sorry

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.440 
I mean the um roller I'm sorry
and<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.680> roll<00:02:15.860> backwards<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:17.090> saw<00:02:17.270> that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
and just roll backwards you saw that

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.230 
and just roll backwards you saw that
curl<00:02:17.660> was<00:02:17.810> kind<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.230> c-shape<00:02:19.070> curl<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.180> you

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
curl was kind of a c-shape curl so you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.120 
curl was kind of a c-shape curl so you
just<00:02:20.630> roll<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.260> shape<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.680> then<00:02:21.740> you

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
just roll it in that shape and then you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.320 
just roll it in that shape and then you
take<00:02:22.400> another<00:02:22.520> clip<00:02:24.220> same<00:02:25.220> thing<00:02:25.490> place<00:02:26.120> it

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
take another clip same thing place it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.990 
take another clip same thing place it
right<00:02:27.290> there

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
right there

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.110 
right there
voila<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.630> do<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.840> same<00:02:30.080> thing<00:02:30.320> here<00:02:31.120> you

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
voila and you do the same thing here you

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.820 
voila and you do the same thing here you
see<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.420> curl<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.810> kind<00:02:33.020> of<00:02:33.110> C<00:02:33.260> shape<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.680> you

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
see that curl is kind of C shape so you

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.830 
see that curl is kind of C shape so you
place<00:02:34.070> your<00:02:34.250> roller<00:02:34.490> in<00:02:34.700> there<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.690> would

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
place your roller in there and you would

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.990 
place your roller in there and you would
roll<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.200> up<00:02:36.350> or<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.370> could<00:02:37.520> pick<00:02:37.640> curl<00:02:37.880> it

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
roll it up or you could pick curl it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.780 
roll it up or you could pick curl it
like<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.980> even<00:02:39.980> if<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.130> wanted<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.400> just<00:02:40.550> pin

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
like this even if you wanted to just pin

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.270 
like this even if you wanted to just pin
curl<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.330> not<00:02:41.480> use<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> roller

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
curl it and not use a roller

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.620 
curl it and not use a roller
y'all<00:02:43.280> get<00:02:43.430> 2<00:02:43.610> tips<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.000> one<00:02:44.240> bow

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.670 

you<00:02:50.630> see<00:02:50.810> how<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:50.960> curl<00:02:51.260> pattern<00:02:51.590> was

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
you see how that curl pattern was

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.900 
you see how that curl pattern was
already<00:02:52.010> there<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.370> just<00:02:52.550> placed<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
already there and we just placed the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.950 
already there and we just placed the
clip<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:54.100> so<00:02:55.100> these<00:02:55.970> are<00:02:56.030> ways<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.660> keep<00:02:56.810> your

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
clip and so these are ways to keep your

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.720 
clip and so these are ways to keep your
curls<00:02:57.380> without<00:02:57.890> putting<00:02:58.130> Heat

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
curls without putting Heat

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.430 
curls without putting Heat
we<00:02:58.850> want<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.120> stay<00:02:59.270> away<00:02:59.330> from<00:02:59.420> heat<00:02:59.750> you<00:03:00.320> know

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
we want to stay away from heat you know

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.680 
we want to stay away from heat you know
drop<00:03:00.740> throughout<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.280> week<00:03:01.430> twice<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.360> week

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
drop throughout the week twice a week

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.060 
drop throughout the week twice a week
that's<00:03:02.960> cool<00:03:03.200> we<00:03:03.470> don't<00:03:03.650> have<00:03:03.830> an<00:03:03.920> advantage

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
that's cool we don't have an advantage

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.500 
that's cool we don't have an advantage
something<00:03:04.640> like<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.910> but<00:03:05.060> during<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.360> week

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
something like that but during the week

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.090 
something like that but during the week
you<00:03:05.540> want<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:06.110> know<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.590> don't<00:03:06.650> wanna<00:03:06.830> sleep<00:03:06.980> in

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
you want I know you don't wanna sleep in

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.260 
you want I know you don't wanna sleep in
rollers<00:03:07.430> but<00:03:07.550> it's<00:03:07.730> better<00:03:07.850> than<00:03:07.940> burning

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
rollers but it's better than burning

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.090 
rollers but it's better than burning
