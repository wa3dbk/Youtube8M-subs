I'm<00:01:21.590> Kansas<00:01:22.070> discovered<00:01:22.549> that<00:01:22.640> his<00:01:22.760> radio

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
I'm Kansas discovered that his radio

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.149 
I'm Kansas discovered that his radio
frequency<00:01:23.659> generator<00:01:24.110> could<00:01:24.590> release<00:01:24.950> the

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
frequency generator could release the

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.219 
frequency generator could release the
oxygen<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.850> hydrogen<00:01:26.000> from<00:01:26.479> saltwater<00:01:26.869> and
