00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.680
 the cow bills showed droid and they 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.770
 I bring an incredible texture of 64 bits 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.330
 which is pax pocket time of kraft and the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.770
 truth be incredible because he tells me 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.270
 which is well taken any magazine 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.830
 forum in nothing but it happened to me a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.779
 Subscriber called here this is xx 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.660
 here is ok stopped blog launcher is 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.430
 from hunter by me happened what is the apk and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.140
 a sit down the two in the description 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.790
 in case you like to download any of 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.989
 both of them in case they do not want 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.370
 know it blanchett but I recommend that 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.559
 use the cip with blog launcher but good 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.120
 another thing I was going to mention is that it's 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.620
 He possibly does not believe I have not 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.360
 lowered but I think it's from the will 9 well 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.589
 that I recommend more generally if for 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.960
 when more google arrives than in the future 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.920
 but well said that we continue with the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.809
 review that screams like what they're going 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.460
 filling up a little weird but let's 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.800
 enter as you can see the to start 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.829
 the home screen looks epic looks 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.690
 very well I love you see looks great 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.730
 everything has no strange ships 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.850
 or anything the logo looks very good and good 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.649
 let's go to the texture map 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.040
 wait for maybe and well you can see that 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.720
 have a I do not know if I'm going but this thing 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.299
 strange that happens in some readings hd 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.950
 more than anything that of 64 that is when they go 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.479
 walking the blocks in the distance 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.360
 they have black stripes until they 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.509
 Come to them see and we have here 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.730
 for evil ways to enemies 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.830
 look there are a zombie out there 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.420
 we have here the pickman the sand of 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.210
 ccoo that is never 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.240
 the normal spider that looks amazing 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.310
 we have the skeleton 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.890
 lenderman who also looks super 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.060
 amazing also that this call 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.370
 but it also looks great his face gives 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.880
 fear we have here the bat and 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.979
 and for it is the febrile shrimp 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.939
 to see Mr. Squidward where are you 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.189

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.670
 squid that I do not know and we have 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.289
 here the sponges the water the water lilies 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.960
 the mushrooms the truth that texture is very 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.269
 good one of my favorites is a fire 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.709
 Here we have chewing gum and brought 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.940
 to the fifth my favorite usually not 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.560
 I have a texture that I do not like almost 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.780
 it's always water that I like and good 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.160
 we have here the links that also have 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.780
 this book as you already know I told you in 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.480
 all the videos lately that the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.489
 hd textures have certain problems 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.870
 right now with this neighbor minecraft that 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.549
 the transparencies in the flowers and in 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.739
 the plants look so black then 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.290
 we have here what bookstores are 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.940
 stone cut any great we have 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.940
 here the villagers are quite scared 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.990
 now that we have the sheep that are 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.660
 very pretty the wolves that I do not have I do not know 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.180
 yes 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.890
 this in all the necklaces because every 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.880
 logo with each necklace is different 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.500
 then I hope it is put what is the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.850
 texture for each wolf and good as 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.310
 can see the ipade is also very 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.090
 father is a bit transparent more 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.569
 that before 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.909
 we have here what the zeta cow is 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.129
 the do not cry ' but it has like ribs 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.499
 in the middle we have up to the pig that 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.470
 have face like I'm angry that I 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:10.020
 come and the little cow 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.140
 it's on a and it looks so strange and 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.540
 urges the cow and the chickens that also 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.150
 his eyes are very strange and I left 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.860
 we would be there to stay 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.390
 crops and what I commented the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.700
 flowers start all crops 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.050
 we have here the pumpkins we have 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.520
 around here the flowers that have this 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.800
 problem that I tell you about the sunflower that 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.080
 it looks great and to load your wool 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.550
 for changes for doors for 100 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.980
 transparency in this version as they 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.660
 I have commented they have certain books 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.380
 also what are the doors and we have in 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.890
 the cake the chests the two ovens the 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.260
 signs 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.190
 some around here is the angry block 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.840
 straw 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.780
 here in Mexico straw lessons though the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.030
 Spaniards take it as normal but here 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.730
 licenses and straw we have here what 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.319
 are the wool that look really cool and 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.640
 over here they put many also 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.790
 looks great father with a character and there 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.220
 and the reactor together with the fridge and let's 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.860
 over here 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.450
 I always do the review in a very order 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.030
 strange because we have the close tone and 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.650
 the portal and here we have all the 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.760
 blocks that as you already know and the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.820
 paintings also the two engines so 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.980
 cool see the supergas is there hd 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.630
 here we have more spending and these six 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.460
 painters the expenses are very very 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.250
 appropriate since we already have expenses for 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.750
 order and here we have the other motor and 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.550
 as I have said spending we can 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.070
 show in various textures why 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.010
 it's a disaster so I do not want a 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.260
 pyramid illuminati the gas I do not want it 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.990
 expose lately because if so it's very 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.190
 castrating and destroying everything and later not 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.190
 all the blocks look very good 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.740
 the buttons are also general says 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.360
 fish and we have all the blocks 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.620
 none has books meaning of those that 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.060
 you know they are 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.740
 the birch wood block we are going to 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.139
 see here we have clay the 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.000
 clays all look very good 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.580
 well fine well see it so fast in 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.100
 grafing look very very well has many 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.710
 texture details and also the inventory 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.270
 it looks great they see a detail what happens with 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.370
 all the hd textures that I have told you 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.830
 Well, it's because the weapons are not HD because 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.840
 the weapons can not be hd it's still things 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.030
 of minecraft so they do not get angry with 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.650
 the carrier or with me because good 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.990
 As I tell you, that's the way things are in a 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.430
 incredible its minerals so is the thing 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.770
 lately with minecraft that the 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.030
 weapons can not be hopefully 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.550
 suppose that I here said they were going to 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.100
 implement that and it is if they have not done 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.740
 but it would have to be done because 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.780
 really what 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.430
 yes yes you do need to have the weapons 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.919
 complete because if it 's weird to have the 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.470
 basic weapon of minecraft studies try 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.940
 hd and great and good we have here 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.669
 I think the woods are here 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.080
 the one with the bug see that if the 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.930
 birch trunk is the one that has that 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.330
 strange book and then the rest know very 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.190
 well to mention that it is very very well 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.860
 this texture 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.610
 and then nothing people cross and everything for this 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.020
 Laverdad video is a very nice texture 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.730
 that is already waiting for him to leave because 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.590
 after he's always on the channel from 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.590
 the steel point I think it says blond 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.450
 of the star point 70.8 0.9 psdeg you see and 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.370
 now then you can never miss this 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.600
 great reaction to the channel and then nothing but 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.800
 despite everything for this video I hope it has 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.030
 liked the texture the line in the 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.680
 instruction language link of the freckle and 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.000
 the parking texture link you 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.620
 you can install the hip where the 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.150
 symbol blanchett or parking you use the 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.920
 yep along with block launcher and what 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.650
 install from and lock options 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.660
 launcher already put him because textures and 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.280
 they select it in list then nothing 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.290
 people believe everything for this video it 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.910
 take care of many thanks to whoever I pass 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.910
 to which the portion is cared for
