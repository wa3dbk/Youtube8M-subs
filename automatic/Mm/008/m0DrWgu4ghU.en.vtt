00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
truck into the plane so really from the

truck into the plane so really from the
truck<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.969> the<00:01:13.000> aircraft<00:01:13.420> it's<00:01:13.899> approximately

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
truck to the aircraft it's approximately

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.010 
truck to the aircraft it's approximately
a<00:01:14.469> distance<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.829> 150<00:01:15.399> meters<00:01:15.670> which<00:01:16.329> makes<00:01:16.570> 20

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
a distance of 150 meters which makes 20

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.649 
a distance of 150 meters which makes 20
times<00:01:17.289> very<00:01:17.740> short<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.729> takes<00:01:18.969> about<00:01:19.119> 45

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
times very short it takes about 45

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.709 
times very short it takes about 45
minutes<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:20.289> offload<00:01:21.070> an<00:01:21.280> aircraft<00:01:21.759> or<00:01:22.060> 45

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
minutes to offload an aircraft or 45

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.890 
minutes to offload an aircraft or 45
minutes<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:23.229> reload<00:01:23.619> it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
minutes to reload it

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.720 
minutes to reload it
when<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> comes<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.010> Huntsville<00:01:26.310> we're<00:01:26.610> able

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
when it comes to Huntsville we're able

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.430 
when it comes to Huntsville we're able
to<00:01:26.940> get<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.750> quickly<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
to get in and out of here quickly and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.310 
to get in and out of here quickly and
and<00:01:29.190> so<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> lack<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> congestion<00:01:30.660> is<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> very

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and so the lack of congestion is a very

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.400 
and so the lack of congestion is a very
large<00:01:31.650> part<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> library<00:01:33.510> Huntsville<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.260> an

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
large part of library Huntsville in an

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.740 
large part of library Huntsville in an
aircraft<00:01:34.590> lands<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.370> 2:00<00:01:35.550> a.m.<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.570> have

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
we can have a sustainable supply chain

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.339 
we can have a sustainable supply chain
on<00:05:44.349> the<00:05:44.770> years<00:05:44.979> to<00:05:45.129> come<00:05:45.809> at<00:05:46.809> the<00:05:47.050> end<00:05:47.080> of<00:05:47.229> the

day it's planes and so what really makes
a<00:05:49.899> difference<00:05:49.929> is<00:05:50.649> the<00:05:50.889> schedule<00:05:51.309> integrity

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
a difference is the schedule integrity

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.600 
a difference is the schedule integrity
is<00:05:51.999> the<00:05:52.449> professionalism<00:05:53.319> is<00:05:53.649> the<00:05:53.949> ability<00:05:54.399> to

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
is the professionalism is the ability to

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.449 
is the professionalism is the ability to
