was<00:01:32.730> actually<00:01:33.030> exactly<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.140> point<00:01:34.350> that

article<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.870> precisely<00:01:37.470> when<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.070> hand

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
article was it's precisely when we hand

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.520 
article was it's precisely when we hand
over<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.120> responsibility<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.260> of<00:01:40.410> these

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
over the responsibility for all of these

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.460 
over the responsibility for all of these
things<00:01:40.830> to<00:01:41.130> specialists<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.540> cause<00:01:42.960> the

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
going to require a lot of testing and I

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.099 
going to require a lot of testing and I
really<00:03:08.129> wanted<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.549> be<00:03:08.849> an<00:03:09.090> open<00:03:09.599> project

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
really wanted it to be an open project

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.899 
really wanted it to be an open project

because hydroponics is one of the

the United States right now and could

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.289 
the United States right now and could
possibly<00:03:16.500> become<00:03:17.040> another<00:03:17.579> area<00:03:18.030> like

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
possibly become another area like

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.059 
possibly become another area like
Monsanto<00:03:19.290> where<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.829> lot<00:03:20.040> of

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
way of people people's food so I decided

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.300 
way of people people's food so I decided
that<00:03:27.090> instead<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:28.139> creating<00:03:28.439> a<00:03:28.650> product<00:03:28.889> what

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
that instead of creating a product what

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.159 
that instead of creating a product what
I<00:03:29.340> was<00:03:29.549> going<00:03:29.639> to<00:03:29.760> do<00:03:29.940> was<00:03:29.970> open<00:03:30.449> this<00:03:30.720> up<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.139> a

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
I was going to do was open this up to a

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.150 
I was going to do was open this up to a

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
few systems that we created they kind of

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.599 
few systems that we created they kind of
worked<00:03:37.410> we<00:03:37.650> were<00:03:37.739> actually<00:03:37.919> able<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.400> grow

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
bring on more co-developers what we did

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.490 
bring on more co-developers what we did
was<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.190> created<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.760> social<00:04:00.150> media<00:04:00.629> site<00:04:01.139> on

was we created a social media site on

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.530 
was we created a social media site on
which<00:04:01.560> we<00:04:02.069> published<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.669> designs<00:04:03.030> we

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
which we published the designs we

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.740 
which we published the designs we
explained<00:04:04.079> how<00:04:04.319> they<00:04:04.500> worked<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:05.159> we<00:04:06.090> even

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
explained how they worked and we even

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.050 
explained how they worked and we even
went<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:07.470> far<00:04:07.500> as<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.799> point<00:04:08.250> out<00:04:08.430> everything

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
went so far as to point out everything

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.909 
went so far as to point out everything
that<00:04:09.389> was<00:04:09.510> wrong<00:04:09.540> with<00:04:09.959> these<00:04:10.109> systems<00:04:10.590> and

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
that was wrong with these systems and

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.860 
that was wrong with these systems and
then<00:04:11.310> we<00:04:11.459> invited<00:04:11.879> people<00:04:11.909> all<00:04:12.479> over<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
then we invited people all over the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.869 
then we invited people all over the
world<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.379> build<00:04:13.590> them<00:04:13.889> and<00:04:14.159> experiment<00:04:14.819> with

us<00:04:15.919> so<00:04:16.919> actually<00:04:17.310> now<00:04:17.940> on<00:04:18.209> this<00:04:18.359> website<00:04:18.599> we

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
us so actually now on this website we

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.850 
us so actually now on this website we
have<00:04:19.669> 18,000<00:04:20.669> people<00:04:20.849> and<00:04:21.269> we<00:04:22.229> have<00:04:22.440> window

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
have 18,000 people and we have window

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.149 
have 18,000 people and we have window

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:28.820 
farms all over the world what we're
doing<00:04:26.550> is<00:04:26.699> what<00:04:27.360> NASA<00:04:27.960> or<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.530> large

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
doing is what NASA or a large

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.790 
doing is what NASA or a large
corporation<00:04:29.190> would<00:04:29.669> call<00:04:29.940> R&amp;D<00:04:30.870> or<00:04:31.050> research

corporation would call R&amp;D or research
and<00:04:32.099> development<00:04:32.639> but<00:04:33.240> what<00:04:33.419> we<00:04:33.599> call<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.020> is

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
and development but what we call it is

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.550 
and development but what we call it is
our<00:04:34.650> DIY<00:04:35.340> or<00:04:35.909> research<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.020> develop<00:04:37.440> it

so<00:04:40.430> for<00:04:40.729> example<00:04:40.990> Jackson<00:04:41.990> came<00:04:42.380> along<00:04:42.650> and

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
so for example Jackson came along and

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.010 
so for example Jackson came along and
suggested<00:04:43.430> that<00:04:43.520> we<00:04:43.669> use<00:04:43.910> air<00:04:44.210> pumps<00:04:44.660> instead

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
suggested that we use air pumps instead

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.080 
suggested that we use air pumps instead
of<00:04:45.139> water<00:04:45.349> pumps<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:46.009> took<00:04:46.280> building<00:04:46.849> a<00:04:46.910> whole

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
of water pumps it took building a whole

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.550 
of water pumps it took building a whole
bunch<00:04:47.270> of<00:04:47.419> systems<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.960> get<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:48.169> right<00:04:48.349> but

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
bunch of systems to get it right but

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.110 
bunch of systems to get it right but
once<00:04:48.740> we<00:04:48.889> did<00:04:48.919> we<00:04:49.130> were<00:04:49.340> able<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.729> cut<00:04:49.940> our

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
once we did we were able to cut our

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.740 
once we did we were able to cut our
carbon<00:04:50.360> footprint<00:04:51.050> nearly<00:04:51.680> in<00:04:51.800> half<00:04:52.539> Tony<00:04:53.539> in

an<00:06:31.130> experience<00:06:31.880> of<00:06:32.150> actually<00:06:32.509> contributing

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
an experience of actually contributing

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.399 
an experience of actually contributing
to<00:06:34.099> the<00:06:34.550> environmental<00:06:35.090> movement<00:06:35.360> in<00:06:35.930> a<00:06:36.259> way

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409 
to the environmental movement in a way

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.140 
to the environmental movement in a way
other<00:06:36.680> than<00:06:36.770> just<00:06:37.069> screwing<00:06:37.520> in<00:06:37.699> new<00:06:37.940> light

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
other than just screwing in new light

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.559 
other than just screwing in new light
bulbs<00:06:38.650> but<00:06:39.650> I<00:06:39.710> think<00:06:40.099> that<00:06:40.159> Eileen<00:06:40.849> expresses

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:41.569 
bulbs but I think that Eileen expresses

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:43.510 
bulbs but I think that Eileen expresses
best<00:06:41.990> what<00:06:42.440> we<00:06:42.650> really<00:06:42.949> get<00:06:43.130> out<00:06:43.280> of<00:06:43.400> this

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
best what we really get out of this

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.300 
best what we really get out of this
which<00:06:43.819> is<00:06:44.060> the<00:06:44.330> actual<00:06:44.870> joy<00:06:45.259> of<00:06:45.530> collaboration

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
which is the actual joy of collaboration

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.899 
which is the actual joy of collaboration
so<00:06:47.300> she<00:06:48.020> expresses<00:06:48.620> here<00:06:49.070> what<00:06:49.250> it's<00:06:49.400> like<00:06:49.610> to

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909 
so she expresses here what it's like to

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.100 
so she expresses here what it's like to
see<00:06:50.089> someone<00:06:50.419> halfway<00:06:50.839> across<00:06:51.289> the<00:06:51.409> world

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
if we really want to see the kind of

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.130 
if we really want to see the kind of
wide<00:06:58.680> consumer<00:06:59.550> behavior<00:07:00.000> change<00:07:00.390> that<00:07:01.020> we're

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.140 
wide consumer behavior change that we're

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.900 
wide consumer behavior change that we're
all<00:07:01.290> talking<00:07:01.530> about<00:07:01.770> as<00:07:02.100> environmentalists

all talking about as environmentalists

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.360 
all talking about as environmentalists
and<00:07:03.150> food<00:07:03.720> people<00:07:04.110> maybe<00:07:04.740> we<00:07:04.920> just<00:07:05.100> need<00:07:05.280> to

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
and food people maybe we just need to

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.760 
and food people maybe we just need to
ditch<00:07:05.640> the<00:07:05.910> term<00:07:06.120> consumer<00:07:06.780> and<00:07:06.960> get<00:07:07.350> behind

of their own and what we're seeing is

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.270 
of their own and what we're seeing is
that<00:07:14.910> our<00:07:15.210> DIY<00:07:15.630> has<00:07:16.140> moved<00:07:16.440> beyond<00:07:16.950> just

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
that our DIY has moved beyond just

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.320
