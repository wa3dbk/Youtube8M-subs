 well rage freddy alias kangaroo rage 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.609
 for the close friends 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.010
 the guy who jump shot with every shot at 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.229
 every duel as you will see 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.479
 surely very soon in an end 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.670
 in a video that will be him a 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.220
 gameplay on a normal map and all that 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.900
 so for the gameplay the people you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.700
 go see I cut you some 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.720
 moment because it will turn out that freddy is going 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.430
 as we say we take our time to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.130
 do that my not to piss you off 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.159
 to wait until eight years 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.479
 Once he finds an enemy and I will bah 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.670
 just cut you off - finally who 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.290
 transition and that's so I presented 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.840
 like the gameplay so get up on the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 fog map aka the tablecloth that I feel that 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.229
 I hated because there is 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.159
 fog everywhere we see nothing at all 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.450
 it's a map for campers and 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.880
 and the guys at the camp are called 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.530
 thermal there because basically with a 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.380
 thermal this chance to win one 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.990
 from them was wearing him that we see nothing and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.140
 so was playing with the peace keeper handle 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.320
 charge large capacity no taxing 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.330
 or at least not 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.729
 we call explosives or something like 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.650
 it's not secondary so he was playing with 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.960
 death silence with ace of the trigger 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.310
 ghost head I do not know too much 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.070
 determination all the bazaar and in 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.020
 specialist he had looters 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.220
 simplification and lynx pass goes on and 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.680
 all the tralala years that if I can not 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.390
 know too much about friends and they were playing 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.760
 so this time a group of five 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.340
 young people abuse with cartel at eros center 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.050
 maybe go to bed that's not it 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.980
 big group with the members of the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.930
 team xbox and pals to them and he's going 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.300
 we must realize a pretty that m 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.680
 on snap so as I say I'm going 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.680
 cut some moments it's just for 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.390
 you avoid waiting sometimes it takes 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.340
 know that that's how I say on xbox 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.010
 on there are ben pencils even more 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.360
 only on xbox 360 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.970
 there is also the habit of the joystick 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.060
 people it's different m 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.380
 the console is different here after 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.120
 I think we still have a little 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.459
 more the challenge seen than those who bought 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.840
 the xbox one is mostly hab d'arte 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.360
 core gamer we can also it's this 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.290
 who plays not just for himself players 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.910
 casual if you want it's not 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.980
 guys who played only once 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.380
 in their life at a game and who sees there 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.430
 Briefly they extinguished the console rekindled 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.709
 three weeks later it's really 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.420
 people who play often enough and 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.160
 finally falcon against players 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.900
 like that it's not easy and so 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.829
 it was still believed tivaouane 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.590
 realize I think it's still 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.700
 a pretty good performance I would put 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.680
 of course the link his chain in the 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.250
 description 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.880
 soon there will be another 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.900
 gameplay of rage credit so I hope that 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.049

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.340

 review a little the new brake 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.299
 finally no, it's still 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.280
 old of age but these new 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.500

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.510
 a storm that sway gameplay not 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.700
