00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.840
 2 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.840
 I 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.980
 the link is obvious between the sea ​​and 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:19.360
 creation is introspection it is 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.700
 the awakening we are zen and we want to be 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.820
 even more engaged in his work 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.369
 artistic common respect vis-à-vis 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.189
 from what we see in front ie 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:36.330
 an expanse of water that with so much 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.330
 force gives us so much calm 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.130
 when I am facing the sea I surrender 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:48.720
 account how much art and the human 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:53.260
 are completely tiny and that 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.470
 maybe it's nature that dominates 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.470
 all 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.870
 the sea ​​for me is the thermometer of 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.870
 our system 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.060
 the human behaves well the nature we 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.170
 makes it good 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.970
 m 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.340
 what is impressive about them 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.540
 waste is that in the face of the immense 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.330
 ocean expanse 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.899
 they seem infinitely small and when 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.440
 we finish the pickup on the beaches 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.640
 it seems unacceptable 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.289
 many people even go there 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.450
 not waste account that has 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:41.939
 continually continue what I have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.960
 wanted to represent with the chapel of 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.789
 sea ​​is precisely the absurdity know 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.450
 it's not a sea chapel 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:55.399
 rather a shit chapel and in fact 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.399
 that's it in the ocean 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.560
 the chapel is a little bit 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.590
 the place where you are a believer or 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.239
 we will not be able to pray for it 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.239
 eventually disappear all that 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.320
 different positions 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.080
 intellectual or anybody else 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.040
 understood each other on the same thing ya too 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.580
 of waste in the face of a dramatic problem 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.490
 people who are aware of that are 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.490
 hyper solidarity and solve the problem 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.989
 pink is the healing of 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.989
 something we had in the past 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:52.040
 and that must be corrected in the present 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.040
 and in the future
