a little bit small I thought it'd be

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.829 
a little bit small I thought it'd be
kind<00:00:51.530> of<00:00:51.620> nice<00:00:51.800> i<00:00:52.149> like<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.329> little<00:00:53.449> shapes

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
when i cut them earlier they're like

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.680 
when i cut them earlier they're like
mini<00:00:58.280> steak<00:00:58.729> fries

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:14.170 

you'll<00:01:04.690> be<00:01:04.840> in<00:01:04.870> here<00:01:05.140> for<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.410> long<00:01:05.530> time

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:32.170 

I've<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.600> oven<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.050> at<00:01:16.820> 450

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.600 

and<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.080> two<00:01:34.470> pounds<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:35.130> red

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and this was what two pounds of red

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:51.370 
and this was what two pounds of red
potatoes

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.360 

we<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.530> look<00:01:52.650> out<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.920> window<00:01:53.160> and<00:01:53.220> watch

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
we can look out the window and watch

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.420 
we can look out the window and watch
people<00:01:53.580> run<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> their<00:01:54.030> cars

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:23.600 

that<00:02:00.430> wouldn't<00:02:00.700> be<00:02:00.820> nice

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:36.190 

all<00:02:24.480> right<00:02:24.840> one<00:02:25.710> more<00:02:30.920> okay<00:02:31.920> potatoes<00:02:32.520> done

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.630 

so<00:02:37.200> we're<00:02:37.319> going<00:02:37.379> to<00:02:37.500> pour<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:38.189> pour<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.610> oil

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
so we're going to pour just pour the oil

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.949 
so we're going to pour just pour the oil
over<00:02:39.209> them<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.420> said<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.689> steak

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
over them and like I said the steak

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.360 
over them and like I said the steak
seasoning<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.920> use<00:02:44.129> there's

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
seasoning and you can use there's

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.009 
seasoning and you can use there's
different<00:02:44.819> kinds<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:46.879> chose<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.090> food<00:02:48.599> club<00:02:48.840> of

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
different kinds I chose the food club of

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.259 
different kinds I chose the food club of
course<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.560> i<00:02:50.159> believe<00:02:50.459> they<00:02:50.879> had<00:02:51.030> like<00:02:51.239> a

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
course and i believe they had like a

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.210 
course and i believe they had like a
barbecue<00:02:51.900> they<00:02:52.200> had<00:02:52.379> this<00:02:52.620> they<00:02:52.920> had<00:02:53.040> that

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
barbecue they had this they had that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:06.800 
barbecue they had this they had that
just<00:02:53.489> got<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.849> plane<00:02:57.409> them<00:02:58.409> all<00:02:58.590> just

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.180 

I<00:03:07.190> think<00:03:08.190> one<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.610> secrets<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:10.190> to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
I think one of the secrets to this is to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.490 
I think one of the secrets to this is to
put<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:11.970> make<00:03:12.390> sure<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:12.959> kind<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.380> in

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
put it make sure you have it kind of in

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.470 
put it make sure you have it kind of in
a<00:03:13.560> single<00:03:14.040> layer<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.610> they<00:03:14.730> get<00:03:14.880> wrote<00:03:15.150> nice

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
a single layer so they get wrote nice

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.870 
a single layer so they get wrote nice
and<00:03:15.780> roasted<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:19.590> depending<00:03:20.099> on<00:03:20.250> what<00:03:20.580> size

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
and roasted so depending on what size

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.720 
and roasted so depending on what size
you<00:03:21.120> cut<00:03:21.390> them<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.959> how<00:03:22.890> many<00:03:23.069> potatoes<00:03:23.400> you

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
you cut them and how many potatoes you

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.180 
you cut them and how many potatoes you
use<00:03:23.970> will<00:03:24.810> depend<00:03:24.840> on<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.440> size<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.950> pan

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
use will depend on the size of the pan

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.130 
use will depend on the size of the pan
so<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:27.390> got<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.690> big<00:03:27.930> one<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:30.420> half<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.840> sheet<00:03:31.080> pan

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
so I got a big one the half a sheet pan

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:45.010 
so I got a big one the half a sheet pan
and<00:03:32.090> i<00:03:33.090> am<00:03:33.450> going<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.780> spray<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.290> little<00:03:34.500> bit

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:56.160 

and<00:03:45.500> we're<00:03:45.800> going<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:45.950> put<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.190> potatoes<00:03:46.670> and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.480 

also<00:03:57.170> if<00:03:57.260> you<00:03:57.350> want<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.620> cut<00:03:57.830> these<00:03:58.010> in<00:03:58.310> big

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
also if you want to cut these in big

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.990 
also if you want to cut these in big
wedges<00:03:58.790> that'd<00:03:59.240> be<00:03:59.420> great<00:04:00.460> you<00:04:01.460> may<00:04:01.700> take<00:04:01.970> a

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
wedges that'd be great you may take a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.670 
wedges that'd be great you may take a
little<00:04:02.240> bit<00:04:02.330> longer<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.870> cook<00:04:04.060> that's<00:04:05.060> fine<00:04:08.680> or

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
little bit longer to cook that's fine or

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.190 
little bit longer to cook that's fine or
i<00:04:09.740> also<00:04:10.190> think<00:04:10.640> instead<00:04:11.060> of<00:04:11.240> putting<00:04:11.600> them<00:04:11.810> in

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
i also think instead of putting them in

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.400 
i also think instead of putting them in
the<00:04:13.040> oven<00:04:13.070> like<00:04:13.520> this<00:04:13.820> if<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.390> took<00:04:14.630> your<00:04:14.960> foil

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
the oven like this if you took your foil

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.910 
the oven like this if you took your foil
packet<00:04:15.860> and<00:04:15.950> use<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.190> heavy-duty<00:04:16.459> foil<00:04:17.390> or

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
packet and use the heavy-duty foil or

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.400 
packet and use the heavy-duty foil or
two<00:04:18.920> layers<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.580> foil<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.120> wrap<00:04:20.840> this<00:04:21.049> in<00:04:21.230> like

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
two layers of foil and wrap this in like

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.110 
two layers of foil and wrap this in like
