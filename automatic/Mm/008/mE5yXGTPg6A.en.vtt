some of the new celebrations under new

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.120 
some of the new celebrations under new
skill<00:00:29.200> move<00:00:29.350> which<00:00:29.470> I<00:00:29.560> know<00:00:29.680> we<00:00:29.770> can<00:00:29.890> look<00:00:30.010> at

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
skill move which I know we can look at

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.560 
skill move which I know we can look at
now<00:00:30.280> they've<00:00:30.610> been<00:00:30.730> trying<00:00:30.910> out<00:00:31.150> this<00:00:31.270> skill

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
now they've been trying out this skill

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.450 
now they've been trying out this skill
maybe<00:00:31.780> it's<00:00:31.930> a<00:00:31.990> new<00:00:32.110> type<00:00:32.320> of<00:00:32.349> spin<00:00:32.860> so<00:00:33.219> how<00:00:33.399> do

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
maybe it's a new type of spin so how do

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.009 
maybe it's a new type of spin so how do
you<00:00:33.579> do<00:00:33.730> it<00:00:33.879> and<00:00:34.030> how<00:00:34.179> have<00:00:34.329> you<00:00:34.449> been<00:00:34.570> using<00:00:34.780> it

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
you do it and how have you been using it

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.779 
you do it and how have you been using it
yeah<00:00:35.379> I<00:00:35.410> really<00:00:35.559> like<00:00:35.649> it's<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.339> four<00:00:36.550> star

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
yeah I really like it's a four star

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.639 
yeah I really like it's a four star
above<00:00:37.120> move<00:00:37.359> and<00:00:37.600> you<00:00:37.719> do<00:00:37.870> it<00:00:37.989> just<00:00:38.019> by<00:00:38.230> looking

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
above move and you do it just by looking

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.220 
above move and you do it just by looking
back<00:00:39.149> diagonally<00:00:40.149> to<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.449> left<00:00:40.960> or<00:00:41.109> the<00:00:41.140> right

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
back diagonally to the left or the right

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.720 
back diagonally to the left or the right
depending<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.829> which<00:00:41.949> way<00:00:42.129> you<00:00:42.190> want<00:00:42.429> to<00:00:42.460> spin

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
depending on which way you want to spin

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.700 
depending on which way you want to spin
and<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.510> way<00:00:43.600> i<00:00:43.629> like<00:00:43.899> to<00:00:43.929> use<00:00:44.109> it<00:00:44.320> or<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.530> way

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
and the way i like to use it or the way

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.169 
and the way i like to use it or the way
i<00:00:44.739> found<00:00:45.010> most<00:00:45.160> useful<00:00:45.309> is<00:00:45.730> when<00:00:45.879> i'm<00:00:45.999> being

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
i found most useful is when i'm being

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.930 
i found most useful is when i'm being
pressed<00:00:46.870> or<00:00:47.109> chased<00:00:47.409> by<00:00:47.679> a<00:00:47.710> defender<00:00:48.100> so<00:00:48.460> I've

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
pressed or chased by a defender so I've

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.520 
pressed or chased by a defender so I've
got<00:00:49.089> my<00:00:49.120> back<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.449> goal<00:00:49.629> and<00:00:49.809> perhaps<00:00:49.960> running

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
got my back to goal and perhaps running

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.110 
got my back to goal and perhaps running
away<00:00:50.710> from<00:00:50.769> the<00:00:51.039> box<00:00:51.219> just<00:00:51.429> sort<00:00:51.699> of<00:00:51.730> trying<00:00:52.030> to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
away from the box just sort of trying to

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.459 
away from the box just sort of trying to
work<00:00:52.239> a<00:00:52.269> bit<00:00:52.449> of<00:00:52.539> space<00:00:52.719> and<00:00:53.019> being<00:00:53.230> closely

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
work a bit of space and being closely

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.979 
work a bit of space and being closely
followed<00:00:53.920> then<00:00:54.100> if<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:54.309> do<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.819> spin<00:00:55.030> back

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
followed then if you do the spin back

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.569 
followed then if you do the spin back
you<00:00:56.319> know<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.710> left<00:00:56.980> or<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.129> right<00:00:57.219> then

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
you know to the left or the right then

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.250 
you know to the left or the right then
you<00:00:57.819> can<00:00:57.940> do<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.089> fairly<00:00:58.359> quick<00:00:58.600> turn<00:00:58.809> off<00:00:59.050> than

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
you can do a fairly quick turn off than

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.349 
you can do a fairly quick turn off than
the<00:00:59.429> defender<00:01:00.429> just<00:01:00.579> moved<00:01:00.789> past<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.179> and

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
the defender just moved past you and

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.029 
the defender just moved past you and
you've<00:01:01.569> got<00:01:01.690> created<00:01:02.109> a<00:01:02.170> load<00:01:02.289> space<00:01:02.530> now<00:01:02.979> you

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
you've got created a load space now you

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.160 
you've got created a load space now you
use<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.489> right<00:01:03.670> stick<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.300> tap<00:01:04.780> back<00:01:04.989> and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
use the right stick to tap back and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.990 
use the right stick to tap back and
diagonal<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.710> used<00:01:05.980> to<00:01:06.100> be<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.430> heel<00:01:06.760> chop

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
diagonal that used to be the heel chop

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.400 
diagonal that used to be the heel chop
me<00:01:07.150> didn't<00:01:07.480> ya<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.810> chop<00:01:07.960> movie<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:08.290> can

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
me didn't ya the chop movie you can

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.080 
me didn't ya the chop movie you can
still<00:01:08.590> do<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.860> by<00:01:09.370> holding<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.880> left

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
still do that by holding the left

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.730 
still do that by holding the left
trigger<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:10.510> doing<00:01:10.720> me<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.110> fake<00:01:11.290> pass<00:01:11.500> move

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
trigger and doing me the fake pass move

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.890 
trigger and doing me the fake pass move
so<00:01:12.430> powering<00:01:12.910> up<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.060> long<00:01:13.210> pass<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.570> counting

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
so powering up a long pass and counting

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.690 
so powering up a long pass and counting
the<00:01:13.960> short<00:01:14.200> pass<00:01:14.380> or<00:01:15.040> holding<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.400> trigger

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
the short pass or holding that trigger

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.010 
the short pass or holding that trigger
and<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:15.910> direction<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.360> under<00:01:16.720> you<00:01:16.810> want<00:01:16.960> to

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
and the direction that under you want to

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.080 
and the direction that under you want to
chop<00:01:17.170> for<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.440> lipstick<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.550> I<00:01:18.640> do<00:01:18.700> still<00:01:19.030> use

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
chop for the lipstick and I do still use

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.700 
chop for the lipstick and I do still use
that<00:01:19.210> move<00:01:19.420> all<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.690> time<00:01:19.900> but<00:01:20.230> yeah<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.590> the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
that move all the time but yeah that the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.170 
that move all the time but yeah that the
controls<00:01:21.220> I've<00:01:21.400> changed<00:01:21.640> slightly<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.060> now

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
controls I've changed slightly and now

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.820 
controls I've changed slightly and now
just<00:01:22.360> double<00:01:22.660> tapping<00:01:22.840> diving<00:01:23.260> left<00:01:23.500> or<00:01:23.650> right

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
just double tapping diving left or right

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.500 
just double tapping diving left or right
backwards<00:01:24.460> is<00:01:24.670> going<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.120> make<00:01:25.240> you<00:01:25.300> do<00:01:25.420> this

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
backwards is going to make you do this

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.090 
backwards is going to make you do this
new<00:01:25.690> spin<00:01:25.900> it's<00:01:26.290> certainly<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.620> nasty<00:01:26.950> little

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
new spin it's certainly a nasty little

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
ways if we got of controlling the keeper

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.100 
ways if we got of controlling the keeper
before<00:01:51.670> penalties<00:01:52.270> taken<00:01:52.630> yeah<00:01:52.840> well<00:01:52.960> if<00:01:53.050> you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
before penalties taken yeah well if you

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.500 
before penalties taken yeah well if you
hold<00:01:53.260> down<00:01:53.350> B<00:01:54.010> you<00:01:54.220> can<00:01:54.340> do<00:01:54.520> kind<00:01:54.790> of<00:01:54.910> a<00:01:55.030> point

hold down B you can do kind of a point

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.300 
hold down B you can do kind of a point
so<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.200> keeper<00:01:56.440> kind<00:01:56.620> of<00:01:56.680> pointed<00:01:56.980> himself

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
so the keeper kind of pointed himself

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.070 
so the keeper kind of pointed himself
and<00:01:57.490> then<00:01:57.580> points<00:01:57.880> at<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.090> corner<00:01:58.870> that<00:01:58.990> he

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
and then points at the corner that he

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.510 
and then points at the corner that he
says<00:01:59.230> he's<00:01:59.350> going<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.590> dive<00:01:59.800> towards<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.370> it's

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
says he's going to dive towards so it's

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.460 
says he's going to dive towards so it's
just<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.790> little<00:02:01.030> way<00:02:01.120> to<00:02:01.150> maybe<00:02:01.360> try<00:02:02.290> and<00:02:02.380> get

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
just a little way to maybe try and get

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.990 
just a little way to maybe try and get
in<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.620> mind<00:02:02.800> of<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:02.980> penalty<00:02:03.550> taker<00:02:03.730> there
