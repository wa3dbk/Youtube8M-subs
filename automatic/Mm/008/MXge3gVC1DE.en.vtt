00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 that of the world the application today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.770
 what you present is called mac fan 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.330
 control version 1.2.1 this 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.809
 application helps manage your 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.099
 fan of your mac and also on 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.789
 windows so everything will depend on the version 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.930
 that you will install the advantage 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.970
 this application is that you can 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.830
 know in real time the number of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.630
 revolutions per minute of your fan 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.510
 so you can better make yourself 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.759
 account of energy needs and even 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.719
 pc or mac temperature level 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.010
 then as power had this window 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.020
 on mac 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.570
 you have indeed the services and in 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.940
 same time here in the toolbar or 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.789
 of menus in the menu bar the number 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.200
 of revolutions per minute so you have here 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.820
 the number of fans I have 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.640
 only one on my boat causes a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.170
 portable minimum and maximum speed 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.840
 and current better 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.469
 you see these 2000 and it pays up 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.879
 6000 200 rpm then you 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.510
 have control either they stay in 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.609
 automatic 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.820
 the mac saddle that runs where you have 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.640
 custom to be able to customize the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.439
 fan speed before 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.630
 take care of personalizing like you 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.100
 can see next you have the probe and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.180
 you can see the temperature hard 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.530
 Ambient eg your mac 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.850
 see a battery level 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.299
 apparently there are several points on 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:30.200
 the battery you can see also the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.200
 mici processor it's ram memory 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.100
 and other elements as well as your 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.899
 hard drives storage devices 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.460
 so here it's less it's as soon as we 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.990
 could see one at 31 degrees and my 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.630
 hard drive it's at 31 degrees so in 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.119
 custom you can choose the speed 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.770
 constant that you desire on your mac 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.140
 here for example for the teich you 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.869
 put at 6200 turn so that was good 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:01.470
 hear like violent poison of 2000 that 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:04.799
 went to 6206 let you turn 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.110
 your fan at its maximum speed 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.940
 you go directly to see everything 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.390
 is here in temperature they are going 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.790
 decrease as you go 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.730
 hour of use I had fun at 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.430
 leave a little time 6200 round and I have 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.500
 easily lost every time 10 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.420
 degrees makes us to tell you how 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.220
 how hot it is 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.849
 you can here according to the data 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.380
 of the probe adapt the speed of the 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.220
 fan sent by doing what 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.010
 way 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.440
 what I advise if you use a 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.640
 laptop is to buy this if 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.620
 nationally at least I had it so 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.709
 it's a platform to cool 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.239
 your laptop plug you in 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.580
 on usb then this one she 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.099
 has two fans and therefore well 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.599
 it will allow your mac to be 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.410
 cooled and even if you do not 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.590
 turn it will allow at least that down 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.599
 of the mac where it is laid does not make 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.340
 so that it heats uselessly 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.709
 for example here my mac and on a tablecloth 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.450
 is to the plastic also underneath so 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.730
 the problem is left between tournai 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.069
 aluminum and heats the fabric warms 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.620
 and that only raises the temperature of the 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.110
 mak unnecessarily if possible 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.910
 advises that two fans 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.799
 this model is my rabbit he has 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.230
 puffed the cable checked more used 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.930
 but really eat up art at the exit 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.730
 so I bought a new one and a4 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.110
 anti author and the with the four 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.810
 fans it's loud and that's 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.829
 it annoys me so personally I you 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.440
 advise no we take two only two a 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.239
 big finally this may be less good but 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.620
 two at least that's the top 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.180
 and so here is if you have any 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.560
 questions or at all even want to me 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.510
 to say something else could put it to me 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.440
 in the comments and you answer them 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.100
 as quickly as usual 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.100
 and so here
