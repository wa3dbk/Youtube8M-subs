00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello I hope you are well 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.490
 is today for a small 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.080
 tackle I know that's still a 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.380
 sacred time that I have not done 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.360
 to tell you I would not even be at 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.309
 when goes back the last one that has to do 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.650
 really really long two good 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.029
 months anyway but there these last 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.650
 time I was carved by a lot of 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.000
 people for a lot of tags so he 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.830
 I still have to do it 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.689
 the least I want to do 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.060
 say and I have among others were tagged 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.920
 by justine from neverland ferries to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.599
 to do the tag these five books that I have 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.669
 still not read so I 'm going to you 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.340
 present five books that I have 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.440
 still not him and believe me singing 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.559
 thinking after that you're going 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.390
 damn want to hit me and I 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.640
 think you're going to want to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.920
 to hit me because of that because I 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.030
 still have not had a mouth games from 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.890
 suzanne collins 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.079
 yes I must be one of the only 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.210
 people in the world still not 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.710
 having read hunger games is not pursuing the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.600
 only there are some college comrades who 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.390
 like me have seen the movies without having read 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.559
 the books but here I have never read 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.480
 I never took the time 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.610
 so there you do not ask why 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.290
 How do I have this book in French? 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.000
 in this petition etc 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.229
 I do not want to explain because 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.720
 it's a long story and because 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.369
 it may piss me off more then I 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.350
 risk especially to launch a big debate 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.790
 but still is it that I read in the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.650
 library but that I do not count 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.990
 at all read it since it is in 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.700
 French and that niang m I preferred the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.009
 read in waters because I have very 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.470
 afraid of the translation that does not seem to me 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.780
 terrible terrible I think I rather 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.090
 buy me a stay when I get 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.909
 under a box is with the narrow home in 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 English like that because I have no 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.380
 all desire to read them in French in 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.479
 do that it does not appeal to me that's actually 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.920
 such a good time it is since out 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.720
 before they movies I saw them 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.240
 I took them in hand I read the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.920
 first lines and I was there we 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.600
 know a little bit at their top top 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.899
 So I think it will be better 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.670
 per pill go better in water 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.079
 to have in addition there I saw the last movie 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.110
 did not pack at all so that's me 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.960
 even less motivates me to dive but a 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.329
 day I will read it is promised I did not 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.039
 still not read the following of caleb 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.629
 shame on me while it's still 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.790
 a good time that I read the first 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.489
 tome I just did not find 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.230
 the time to dive in 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.629
 and yet God knows I want to 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.670
 because really the 1st of May standards 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.459
 loving higher and higher we already have them 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.079
 finished so I feel a little behind 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.670
 and here I have to say it because 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.250
 that I want to know what happens to 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.540
 I want to know what's going on 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.760
 hide behind this story a little 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.340
 mysterious volcano children etc 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.859
 but here I still have not found the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.840
 time the moment to immerse myself that does not 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.209
 should not delay I do not know when I 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.530
 will try but here I really 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.670
 want to read them more but I have not 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.769
 still not found the time to go there 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.489
 dive in addition to the 2 and the 3 in the 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.109
 library 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.090
 in fact I do not really know what 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.650
 I'm waiting for another suite that I did not 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.959
 still not going on and that I did not 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.549
 not want to continue in fact it's 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.530
 from the divergent saga 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.750
 so here I have the volume 2 in English a 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.220
 ron veronica's only leg is everything 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.019
 I just do not want to continue 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.609
 because I do not have anybody did not like 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.260
 and I loved this second round a little 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.489
 less than the first but I find that 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.689
 it's a really great series of a 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.159
 very good quality where it happens 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.430
 always something and we're bored 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.930
 not at all when we read them but in 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.099
 do I have not delirious last because 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.040
 that I do not want to leave 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.260
 characters and here I am going 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.909
 to leave that after and sad I have no 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.109
 all want to leave this universe I 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.040
 not want to know the end I have not 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.329
 want it to stop 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.069
 so I do not want to read the 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.530
 last and I still have not bought 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.120
 so right now when we talk about the 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.349
 subject diverge from infamy she is not 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.120
 not happy at all because she is 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.739
 there no one and 3 and she can not even speak 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.629
 of hunger since there is nobody for 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.519
 discuss with them since 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.269
 horror and I still have not read the 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.129
 latest 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.599
 but one day it will still be necessary 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.709
 that I say it because I really 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.299
 want to know what's going on at the end 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.909
 but I do not want to leave 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.040
 the characters that I actually delay 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.859
 a maximum reading I still have 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.209
 not read fender of rengo she while 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.949
 it's a book that tempts me but 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.120
 really enormously and who even tempts me 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.220
 since its release 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.889
 since I saw on the chains 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.180
 English speakers because of its history with 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.340
 the trick of a leak he made 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.799
 fanfictions and tend that I was writing 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.150
 as in the past it's fanfiction 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.790
 something that really attracts me but I 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.169
 not already I took some time to myself 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.410
 buy it but it's not very 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.600
 long as I teeth 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.880
 tel but now i'm going to take 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.710
 even more time to dive to me 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.000
 dive in but I know I have 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.930
 read one day i'm sure i'm going 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.490
 really liked 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.530
 I just have to find the right one 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.760
 moment to do it but that's it 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.610
 now that I finally have my 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.990
 library I do not read so that's it 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.300
 is part of the mysteries of life I 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.920
 want to tell you other book I 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.660
 still have not read and where you say 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.850
 but what is this thing 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.950
 this is victor of the jean aveyron 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.440
 itard so in fact I discovered this 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.180
 current book of philosophy in 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.740
 terminal actually because I believe that 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.110
 it's when we talk when we talk about 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.810
 language theme and so on we ask ourselves 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.610
 question of what we talked about because 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.390
 that we are in society is what the 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.530
 company has an impact on language etc 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.760
 me it seems to me that it's in the frame 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.830
 of this course there I hope I do not 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.410
 tells no nonsense but normally 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.030
 that's it and in fact it's about the small 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.710
 boy we found so it's a 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.240
 true story that we found I do not 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.430
 know more too high but basically he has 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.330
 lived for a while alone in the forest 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.050
 or I do not know what 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.140
 and in fact they have found it and we will 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.090
 try to teach him how to live like 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.280
 we because they actually do not speak 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.480
 and lots of things like that and actually 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.730
 it'll be more or less a failure 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.540
 since he will never really succeed in 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.730
 speak 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.950
 so it's a bit of a kid thing 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.940
 wild see for mme houby but except 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.410
 that's forgotten here and they did that 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.570
 it's a study on this jean child 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.300
 itard and I had rap when the teacher 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.070
 we spoke I really wanted to 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.710
 read I talked to my mother my mother me 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.000
 offered it and in fact I never read 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.220
 so that's the thing the room 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.960
 trance in my library and since the 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.010
 terminal or since the beginning terminal 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.490
 because he hires it's one of the first 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:03.850
 themes that we address in philosophy and I 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.470
 still have not read I have not too much 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.120
 of excuses I do not know why I 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.740
 know I 'm going I know that someday I 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.150
 will read it but while in May then 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.130
 that but I want to tell you I have 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.900
 no idea 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.120
 and a sentence well his share behind these 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.680
 we find among the morons a lot 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.100
 to moult and who yet are not 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.590
 deaf 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.810
 thank you jean itard that's all for 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.610
 this little hack I hope you liked it 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.160
 I will detail the person because I 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.720
 believe that justin has already tagged everything 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.520
 but if you want to do it and 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.290
 that you have not been tagged I you 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.390
 invite to do so and I tell you to 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.390
 soon for the next video lease
