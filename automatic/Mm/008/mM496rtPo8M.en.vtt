00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.189
 my name is thierry philip I am 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.410
 professor of oncology I led 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.950
 bÃ©rard the trail for 20 years and 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.710
 In 2009 I created with Beatrice to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.199
 to his department called cancer 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.350
 environment and health economics where 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:28.140
 we are working on this relationship between the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:31.109
 cancer and the environment first the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.360
 nutrition it is necessary to define what it is 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.730
 because everyone confuses the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.440
 nutrition with food 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.840
 food is one of the chapters of 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.300
 nutrition do you figure that activity 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.789
 physical it's part of nutrition 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.520
 so already it's a bigger subject than 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.600
 what we could imagine at the start 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.820
 so yes what are we eating at a relationship 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.020
 direct with the way we will live 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.660
 and the way we will probably 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.129
 die so to the question of lipids and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.359
 meat is the question of fruits 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.280
 and vegetables there is the question of 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.660
 alcohol there is the question of activity 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.470
 physical is the questions 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.960
 fundamental 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.000
 so for lipids is better not to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.070
 eat red meat too often 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.960
 because it's been shown that at a 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.030
 relationship with colon cancer and these 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.430
 suspects and that there may be 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.600
 relationships with other cancers alcohol 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.909
 everyone knows that it gives 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.119
 cancers of the throat cancerous orl 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.370
 especially associated with tobacco obviously 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.800
 so alcohol 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.480
 it is also a product of which we have the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.320
 demonstration that he is responsible for a 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.330
 number of cancers 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.190
 then fruits and vegetables 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.900
 you know there are recommendations 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.560
 who say you have to eat at 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.940
 minimum five different per day 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.650
 these recommendations were discussed 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.840
 but today we can only 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.370
 recommend eating fruits and 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.810
 vegetables is precisely to eat from 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.980
 fruits and vegetables rather than alcohol 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.050
 and meat 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.450
 and then to physical activity then that 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.890
 it's a real revolution it's 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.480
 today demonstrated that if we do 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.580
 physical activity it's not about being 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.580
 Olympic champion it's about doing 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.060
 three times a week half an hour 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.310
 sport in a relatively intensive way 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.060
 from there you decrease in a way 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.070
 significant your cancer risk 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.230
 if you have cancer today it's 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.460
 demonstrated for breast cancer this is in 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.150
 being demonstrated for heaps 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.210
 other cancers 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.050
 if you have cancer and that during the 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.150
 chemotherapy 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.910
 you do a sports activity in lyon 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.470
 we do Nordic walking 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.110
 you see it's something that is at 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.290
 both sweet and both a real sport 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.150
 well we decrease we increase survival 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.150
 that is, a woman who will do 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.920
 of sport live better lives to more 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.920
 survival that those who do not
