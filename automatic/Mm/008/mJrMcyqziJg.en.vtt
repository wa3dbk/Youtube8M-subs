00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
to sell it but it's probably bit more

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.280 
to sell it but it's probably bit more
pricey<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.340> got<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.329> around<00:00:36.630> twenty<00:00:37.079> six

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
pricey I got this for around twenty six

pricey I got this for around twenty six
twenty<00:00:37.469> seven<00:00:37.649> dollars<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.940> Amazon<00:00:39.360> I

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
it's just a game controller and so this

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.240 
it's just a game controller and so this
is<00:01:43.409> what<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> US<00:01:44.040> version<00:01:44.280> looks<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:47.100> we

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
is what the US version looks like and we

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.859 
is what the US version looks like and we
can<00:01:47.280> compare<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.360> GameCube

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
can compare that with the GameCube

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.880 
can compare that with the GameCube
controller<00:01:49.229> from<00:01:49.740> Japan<00:01:50.720> exclusive<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.960> would

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
controller from Japan exclusive I would

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.230 
controller from Japan exclusive I would
say<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.189> an<00:01:53.280> exclusive<00:01:53.549> because<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.119> not

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
say it's an exclusive because it's not

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.050 
say it's an exclusive because it's not
released<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> US<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.340> know<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.909> guys

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
instruction thing I'm pretty sure this

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.100 
instruction thing I'm pretty sure this
is<00:03:01.740> kind<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.010> about<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> controller

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
is kind of just about the controller

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.020 
is kind of just about the controller
functionality<00:03:04.110> probably<00:03:04.740> compatible<00:03:05.250> for

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
functionality probably compatible for

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.010 
functionality probably compatible for
the<00:03:06.270> Wii<00:03:06.450> Wii<00:03:07.260> U<00:03:07.500> whatever<00:03:07.980> kind<00:03:08.490> of<00:03:08.520> tells<00:03:08.700> you

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
the Wii Wii U whatever kind of tells you

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
the Wii Wii U whatever kind of tells you
you<00:03:10.020> know<00:03:10.110> stuff<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.650> japan<00:03:10.920> japanese<00:03:13.010> got<00:03:14.010> a

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
you know stuff in japan japanese got a

you know stuff in japan japanese got a
little<00:03:14.280> box<00:03:14.460> insert<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.720> then<00:03:16.050> we<00:03:16.260> have<00:03:16.500> the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
little box insert and then we have the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.150 
little box insert and then we have the
controller<00:03:17.160> itself<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.090> bag<00:03:18.560> now<00:03:19.560> this

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
controller itself in the bag now this

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.280 
controller itself in the bag now this
controller<00:03:20.580> I'm<00:03:20.910> pretty<00:03:21.209> sure<00:03:21.420> it's<00:03:21.660> exactly

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
controller I'm pretty sure it's exactly

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.800 
controller I'm pretty sure it's exactly
the<00:03:22.440> same<00:03:22.680> as<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.760> US<00:03:24.060> version<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.720> smash

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.620 
that movie a little closer look here we
got<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.430> back<00:03:46.610> now<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.640> know<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:48.120> know<00:03:48.270> there<00:03:48.540> is

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
got the back now I know I know there is

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.610 
got the back now I know I know there is
a<00:03:48.780> difference<00:03:49.200> here<00:03:49.580> with<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.780> logo<00:03:52.260> on<00:03:52.530> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
a difference here with the logo on the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.949 
a difference here with the logo on the
back<00:03:52.830> because<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.760> new<00:03:53.910> controllers<00:03:54.360> it

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
back because the new controllers it

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.430 
back because the new controllers it
doesn't<00:03:55.320> have<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.680> Gamecube<00:03:56.420> logo<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:58.200> just

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
doesn't have the Gamecube logo it just

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.830 
doesn't have the Gamecube logo it just
has<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:59.070> know<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.340> words<00:03:59.580> and<00:04:00.000> for<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.630> old

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
has you know the words and for the old

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.100 
has you know the words and for the old
ones<00:04:01.050> like<00:04:02.150> this<00:04:03.150> one<00:04:03.330> right<00:04:03.480> here<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:04.050> one

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
ones like this one right here this one

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.880 
ones like this one right here this one
actually<00:04:04.410> has<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.860> Gamecube<00:04:05.310> logo<00:04:06.890> kinda

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
actually has the Gamecube logo kinda

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.560 
actually has the Gamecube logo kinda
hard<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.130> focus<00:04:08.340> but<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.850> newer<00:04:09.030> ones<00:04:09.300> don't

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.990 

so<00:04:12.570> here's<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:13.050> black<00:04:13.320> version<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:14.700> US

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
so here's the black version the US

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.560 
so here's the black version the US
release<00:04:15.239> version<00:04:16.640> over<00:04:17.640> here<00:04:17.910> this<00:04:18.270> is<00:04:18.330> what

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
release version over here this is what

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.700 
release version over here this is what
it<00:04:18.660> looks<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:18.959> there's<00:04:19.140> no<00:04:19.260> load<00:04:19.470> on<00:04:19.620> the

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
it looks like there's no load on the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.229 
it looks like there's no load on the
back<00:04:19.890> but<00:04:20.100> that's<00:04:20.190> really<00:04:20.400> difference<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.120> all

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
back but that's really difference of all

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.500 
back but that's really difference of all
the<00:04:21.299> controllers<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.900> mean<00:04:22.049> there's<00:04:22.260> no

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
the controllers I mean there's no

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.820 
the controllers I mean there's no
there's<00:04:23.470> no<00:04:23.620> significant<00:04:24.660> different<00:04:25.830> quality

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
there's no significant different quality

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.650 
there's no significant different quality
or<00:04:27.040> anything<00:04:27.090> everything<00:04:28.090> functions<00:04:28.510> the

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
or anything everything functions the

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.960 
or anything everything functions the
same<00:04:29.100> this<00:04:30.100> one<00:04:30.280> just<00:04:30.370> looks<00:04:30.460> like<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.760> more

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
same this one just looks like a more

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.240 
same this one just looks like a more
cleaner<00:04:31.240> look<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.750> length<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.650> cord<00:04:33.070> is

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
cleaner look the length of the cord is

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.110 
cleaner look the length of the cord is
about<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.640> same<00:04:33.940> as<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:35.110> US<00:04:35.470> version<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.700> you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
about the same as the US version and you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.670 
about the same as the US version and you
know<00:04:37.210> everything's<00:04:37.570> basically<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.260> same<00:04:38.440> and

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
know everything's basically the same and

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
know everything's basically the same and
this<00:04:38.890> does<00:04:39.250> work<00:04:39.460> on<00:04:39.640> u.s.<00:04:39.940> consoles<00:04:40.480> I've

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
this does work on u.s. consoles I've

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.180 
this does work on u.s. consoles I've
tested<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:42.790> out<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:42.970> little<00:04:43.210> bit<00:04:43.450> so<00:04:44.190> just

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
tested it out a little bit so just

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.160 
tested it out a little bit so just
really<00:04:45.340> haven't<00:04:45.790> seen<00:04:46.420> anyone<00:04:46.690> really<00:04:46.930> post

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
really haven't seen anyone really post

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.350 
really haven't seen anyone really post
anything<00:04:47.410> about<00:04:47.500> this<00:04:47.740> controller<00:04:48.160> so<00:04:49.030> as<00:04:49.180> you

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
anything about this controller so as you

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.880 
anything about this controller so as you
can<00:04:49.480> see<00:04:49.540> in<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.050> end<00:04:50.170> there<00:04:50.470> really<00:04:50.680> isn't

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
can see in the end there really isn't

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.830 
can see in the end there really isn't
much<00:04:51.220> different<00:04:51.730> of<00:04:51.880> any<00:04:52.120> of<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.360> controllers

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
much different of any of the controllers

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.110 
much different of any of the controllers
you<00:04:53.530> know<00:04:53.650> it's<00:04:53.860> I'm<00:04:54.610> pretty<00:04:54.850> sure<00:04:55.000> core

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
you know it's I'm pretty sure core

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.690 
you know it's I'm pretty sure core
functionality<00:04:55.690> is<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.900> same<00:04:56.140> and<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:57.550> works

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
functionality is the same and it works

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.660 
functionality is the same and it works
great<00:04:57.970> so<00:04:58.860> let<00:04:59.860> me<00:04:59.920> know<00:05:00.010> in<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.130> comments

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
which one would you pick up you know

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.220 
which one would you pick up you know
they<00:05:03.430> even<00:05:03.550> care<00:05:03.940> what<00:05:04.330> game<00:05:04.570> controller<00:05:05.020> it

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
they even care what game controller it

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.920 
they even care what game controller it
is<00:05:05.700> does<00:05:06.700> it<00:05:06.790> really<00:05:06.940> matter<00:05:07.180> of<00:05:07.570> if<00:05:07.840> it's

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
is does it really matter of if it's

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.470 
is does it really matter of if it's
japan-exclusive<00:05:08.650> or<00:05:09.130> not<00:05:09.280> I<00:05:09.550> want<00:05:10.240> to<00:05:10.360> know

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
japan-exclusive or not I want to know

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.710 
japan-exclusive or not I want to know
and<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:11.530> know<00:05:11.650> if<00:05:12.040> I<00:05:12.550> had<00:05:12.700> to<00:05:12.790> choose<00:05:13.000> I<00:05:13.390> mean<00:05:13.690> I

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
and you know if I had to choose I mean I

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.880 
and you know if I had to choose I mean I
do<00:05:13.870> have<00:05:14.140> both<00:05:14.290> of<00:05:14.320> them<00:05:14.500> so<00:05:14.620> no<00:05:14.740> one<00:05:14.860> really

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
do have both of them so no one really

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.920 
do have both of them so no one really
matter<00:05:15.310> but<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.850> do<00:05:16.090> like<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.450> white<00:05:16.600> one<00:05:16.810> it

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
matter but I do like the white one it

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.180 
matter but I do like the white one it
does<00:05:17.230> give<00:05:17.470> it<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.590> little<00:05:17.710> bit<00:05:17.890> of<00:05:17.950> cleaner

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
does give it a little bit of cleaner

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.760 
does give it a little bit of cleaner
look<00:05:18.490> but<00:05:19.210> then<00:05:19.330> again<00:05:19.450> it<00:05:19.720> can<00:05:19.930> be<00:05:19.960> you<00:05:20.740> know

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
look but then again it can be you know

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.380 
look but then again it can be you know
could<00:05:21.430> probably<00:05:21.580> get<00:05:21.790> dirty<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.120> little<00:05:22.300> bit

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
could probably get dirty a little bit

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.240 
could probably get dirty a little bit
faster<00:05:22.810> but<00:05:23.020> you<00:05:23.230> know<00:05:23.320> that<00:05:23.500> it's<00:05:24.130> on

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
faster but you know that it's on

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.650 
faster but you know that it's on
consideration<00:05:24.970> of<00:05:25.060> how<00:05:25.150> you<00:05:25.210> take<00:05:25.420> care<00:05:25.450> of

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
consideration of how you take care of

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.050 
consideration of how you take care of
your<00:05:25.750> stuff<00:05:26.020> but<00:05:26.290> until<00:05:26.740> next<00:05:26.890> time<00:05:27.060> thanks
