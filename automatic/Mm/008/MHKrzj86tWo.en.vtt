different<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.510> drivers<00:01:07.900> had<00:01:08.049> more<00:01:08.260> driving

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
different the drivers had more driving

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.920 
different the drivers had more driving
time<00:01:09.010> which<00:01:09.790> meant<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.150> car<00:01:10.360> drivers<00:01:10.630> were

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
time which meant the car drivers were

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.109 
time which meant the car drivers were
out<00:01:11.020> of<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.229> vehicle<00:01:11.409> just<00:01:11.950> as<00:01:12.130> much<00:01:12.310> as<00:01:12.940> this

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
out of the vehicle just as much as this

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.149 
out of the vehicle just as much as this

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
mostly obstacles required winching they

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.640 
mostly obstacles required winching they
were<00:01:17.710> very<00:01:17.950> tight<00:01:18.479> sharp<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.810> steep<00:01:20.380> not

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
were very tight sharp and steep not

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.500 
were very tight sharp and steep not
necessarily<00:01:21.400> long<00:01:21.640> but<00:01:22.180> it<00:01:22.270> was<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.420> very

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
necessarily long but it was a very

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.620 
necessarily long but it was a very
demanding<00:01:23.080> course<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.130> I'm<00:01:24.700> hoping<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.420> have

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
demanding course and I'm hoping to have

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.510 
demanding course and I'm hoping to have
the<00:01:25.659> next<00:01:26.020> two<00:01:26.170> rounds<00:01:26.439> as<00:01:26.799> demanding<00:01:27.370> we're

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
the next two rounds as demanding we're

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.960 
the next two rounds as demanding we're
into<00:01:27.760> a<00:01:27.790> new<00:01:28.000> year<00:01:28.800> this<00:01:29.800> weekend<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.610> essence

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
into a new year this weekend the essence

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.790 
into a new year this weekend the essence
was<00:01:31.150> teamwork<00:01:31.480> they<00:01:32.050> had<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.320> contend<00:01:32.710> with

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
was teamwork they had to contend with

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.920 
was teamwork they had to contend with
multi<00:01:33.220> anchor<00:01:33.460> point<00:01:33.700> winching<00:01:34.240> on<00:01:34.390> three

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
multi anchor point winching on three

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.990 
multi anchor point winching on three
stages<00:01:35.260> which<00:01:35.890> is<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.130> bit<00:01:36.580> of<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.760> first

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
stages which is a bit of a first

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.570

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
normally given one and they just had to

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.450 
normally given one and they just had to
think<00:01:39.820> about<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.240> all<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.010> first<00:01:42.190> time

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
think about it all it's the first time

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.759 
able to achieve what they set out to do
one<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.239> ARB<00:02:13.629> extreme<00:02:14.110> winch<00:02:14.349> challenge

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
one of the ARB extreme winch challenge

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.130 
one of the ARB extreme winch challenge
was<00:02:15.099> all<00:02:15.459> compulsory<00:02:16.300> winching<00:02:16.720> bit<00:02:17.019> of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
was all compulsory winching bit of

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.350 
was all compulsory winching bit of
disappointment<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.950> some<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.610> crowds<00:02:18.909> but

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
disappointment to some of the crowds but

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.360 
disappointment to some of the crowds but
I<00:02:19.420> think<00:02:19.720> overall<00:02:20.230> because<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.860> winching<00:02:21.220> was

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
I think overall because the winching was

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.800 
I think overall because the winching was
very

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
very

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.720 
very

minding it kept the show very active as

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.059 
minding it kept the show very active as
the<00:02:27.030> name<00:02:27.239> shows<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.170> ARB<00:02:28.530> extreme

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
they're winching skills tested and I'd

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.600 
they're winching skills tested and I'd
say<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.840> was<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.140> first<00:02:49.560> time<00:02:49.860> ever<00:02:50.190> that

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
say it was the first time ever that

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.059 
say it was the first time ever that
everything<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.660> we<00:02:51.810> set<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.230> be<00:02:52.349> winched<00:02:52.650> was

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
everything that we set to be winched was

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.820 
everything that we set to be winched was
winched<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:54.239> was<00:02:54.390> very<00:02:54.690> demanding<00:02:55.080> 4am<00:02:55.680> I'd

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
winched it was very demanding 4am I'd

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.280 
winched it was very demanding 4am I'd
say<00:02:56.069> would<00:02:56.580> have<00:02:56.670> been<00:02:56.819> one<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> hardest

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
say would have been one of the hardest
