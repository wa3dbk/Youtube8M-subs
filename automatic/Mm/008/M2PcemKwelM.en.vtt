00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 long time did not make a video on your channel 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.420
 so I decided to correct the situation I bought 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.150
 a bunch of sneakers and 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.050
 you need to see the review 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.920
 these sneakers 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.809
 here we are with vega really if I 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.270
 originally made this box 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.220
 this box and knew how I want I probably 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.320
 make any such partitions and all 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.000
 sneakers would stand like this then I would 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.880
 they fit here most of all as well 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.580
 It turns out 1 2 3 4 which can be quickly 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 take but plus slaps steel there in 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.899
 boxes are 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.489
 I recently bought three pairs of it 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 these sneakers are not called the crop model 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.070
 in them I will try her now 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.920
 show she's called rf k x0 76 44 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.840
 the size of the word is always when you buy 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.850
 sneakers do not look at the size think 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.340
 just measure everything because 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.500
 may be such as my case that 44 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.680
 I thought I would never be like that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.960
 such a pinnacle turned out so that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.710
 I'm already 44 size look these 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.439
 sneakers u so they are black with gold 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.340
 elements black gold color with this 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.180
 parties here here there is this type of fish 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.549
 the skin here is crocodile-type leather at the very 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.710
 actually it's not why guys are skin 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.630
 bought it in blood and because it was 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.000
 sale and such sneakers cost 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.590
 I am 400 hryvnia very pleasant 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.770
 Now of course this is not the season 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.500
 old old old collection therefore 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.939
 they always gave me cheaper 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.100
 big problem how to tie shoelaces 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.110
 can and if you know how to do 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.729
 Ideally do this then write in 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.479
 comments because i'm doing this 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.520
 and then here and in short and and thrust 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.920
 to me, they can interfere with how you can 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.759
 do that they do not interfere at all I 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.220
 shoelace is evil 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.329
 why took such i don't like sneakers 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.780
 who have some 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.729
 from the sole inversion here because he 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.369
 maybe I will come off I love when here 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.380
 exactly and i liked the dark sneakers 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.930
 I have not had a dark black 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.810
 Gold is not like the colors and 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.720
 Then I thought a long time between both how such 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.330
 choose white with red or black ass 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.840
 therefore I scored and bought about by the two 400 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.250
 hryvnia therefore it was very profitable they 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.940
 also called jerks 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.060
 x86 for white model perforated 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.630
 the insert here is some kind of dirty 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.160
 the gray box here is the only thing for me 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.860
 embarrassed at the very beginning it is such 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.230
 pieces here the seam goes exactly here here he 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.860
 more or less neat and here he is 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.350
 such as it seemed that a marriage of some kind 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.150
 In fact, he does n't care exactly 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.000
 this area can do it specifically 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.100
 so that it bends to the right 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.010
 I already wore the route a couple of times 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.350
 black and a couple of times even these white ones 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.630
 although not recently bought and I was 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.910
 It's hot but I understand I bought new sneakers and 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.100
 don't wear them I'd rather sweat very much 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.800
 comfortable and very comfortable and probably 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.530
 because I still wore shoes before 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.270
 which we did not sit tight plus there 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.760
 die a store sits tight then later 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.470
 sock thicker and do mine and generally like 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.360
 would sit tight and not pay attention 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.940
 no matter how much it interferes 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.550
 and here it's just the size probably my 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.140
 and therefore it became even more comfortable but 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.380
 these whites for some reason 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.019
 little finger still rubbed but on the dark 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.630
 one leg that kinda brings me to 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.370
 one more thought 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.290
 who wanted to show you a thought 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.060
 sad and instructive here are my old 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.280
 sneakers them and we are almost starting 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.720
 the third year I've just washed them 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.220
 changed the laces and that's how they look 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.320
 this is the original puma 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.910
 by the way if you have any advice 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.660
 how to clean this part 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.940
 so she was the same white I will 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.600
 thankful so that's why I rubbed on 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.780
 one leg 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.310
 I advise you to also take your sneakers 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.980
 which you wear for a long time and make 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.690
 like this and everything will be immediately 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.690
 I see, as you can see, I am a little bit 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.750
 kosorylym ie some I 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.850
 just it turns out I am a masseur alone 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.769
 once said that I have not quite 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.100
 correctly worth periodically this but 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.990
 too curvature shukri 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.750
 i'm sitting crookedly at work i sit and 

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.550
 so it turns out so somehow for 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.040
 crooked and it turns out one leg 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.700
 below another as a result of you 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.220
 see that wearing 1 to 40 more 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.330
 the other is visible and there is visible and inside 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:40.630
 see if you can see so here is 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:44.080
 such a formality and here it is not here 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.270
 how new is all this I feel and when 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.460
 football I do everything that I do 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.500
 I feel that one leg is worth a little bit 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.140
 more you need to do it you need to go to 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.840
 massage therapist I just signed up to 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.210
 masseur who after several 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.190
 sessions can this thing fix 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.890
 it's not that hard pay attention if 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.950
 you have something that every trouble running some 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.380
 chiropractor so here are 3 sneakers that 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.460
 I have it here such they are more such 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.850
 its you high rise in them they are more 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.600
 warmer winter thicker and they have 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.040
 such 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.020
 sticky by the way I came up with a life hack 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.960
 with laces I slaughtered them so that less 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:30.100
 in total they stuck out and then when I wear 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.960
 shoelaces like this up and we fasten them 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.970
 accordingly, they do not hang out here 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.910
 there are jeans on top and it turns out like this 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.280
 not quite see that there is a mink like this 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.740
 I like them most of all 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.740
 whites here it is generally a rag thing and 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.140
 such as mesh despite the fact that 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.680
 it was very hot now last couple 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.300
 days I also department them once and I think 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.740
 it would be hotter enough in them 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.870
 comfortable so sole white lettuce in 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.090
 the bundle comes in by the way light green 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:06.100
 and white laces which are white I'm here 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:08.710
 I put on this fashion blogger 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.710
 and so i bought three pairs of sneakers 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.140
 total complexity for 1200 hryvnia that time 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.200
 like all of us and rich friends buy for 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.290
 2200 UAH only one pair of sneakers here 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.120
 I have such a life well if you 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.300

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.340
 a bunch of t-shirts a bunch of jeans and a lot of things 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.810
 interesting I am generally so awesome 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.639
 fashion blogger seems to me not to you 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.949
