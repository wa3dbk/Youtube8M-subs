00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
 good night bernardo what feeling side 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.739
 Malaga today on the lawn of the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.739
 Carmen is 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.480
 to the certain time to our height 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.700
 controlling the opponent's match 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:14.620
 doing almost everything trying to create 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.620
 danger danger in attack 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.240
 and then also sometimes 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.980
 as it happened a couple of times we helped 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.490
 to the rival so that the 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.490
 head 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.630
 and really at the end, I think that 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.630
 with the second blow 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.340
 the confidence was a hard hit after 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.480
 to tie 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.940
 and with the second goal 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.980
 and also by the methods as produced 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.480
 I do not think we are doing ourselves much harm and 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.480
 that is then noticed to the team 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.320
 good value comes from an injury a couple of 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.670
 months 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.880
 went back 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.890
 the day of the bernabÃ©u that were the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.890
 a very difficult day to return 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.770
 Angeleri's injury he was playing 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.110
 three parties infiltrated 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.700
 and then five matches in a row not me 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.280
 I think that 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.740
 lesbia a little tired a little 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.590
 and that's why the frame change that was 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.480
 coolest for this match 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.480
 very close matches and therefore 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.690
 that change 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.800
 no I have not seen it 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.709
 good is what I said before I think 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.959
 that the second goal as it has 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.920
 also produced as the same as 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.019
 first but then we knew how to react 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.629
 but the second if what has made us 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.310
 much damage to morale and the team has 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.069
 lowered my arms a little 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.450
 I believe that 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.450
 is what I said before 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.920
 but that's not why I think that 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.080
 I tell you that 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.080
 to put doubt at the end with a 31 not 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.830
 I do no favor 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:05.670
 so that's why we did not do the third 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:08.190
 change 2-1 at best with 31 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.810
 I think it was more about keeping clothes 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.810
 what else then 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.140
 we would not do him any favors 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.100
 so you do not understand it seems 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.100
 all right 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.150
 thank you very much
