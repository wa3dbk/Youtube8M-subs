hi<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:01.129> this<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:04.160> pocket<00:00:05.160> ranch<00:00:05.730> apart<00:00:06.299> -<00:00:06.600> I

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
hi guys this is a pocket ranch apart - I

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.870 
hi guys this is a pocket ranch apart - I
was<00:00:08.130> initially<00:00:08.429> thinking<00:00:09.530> about<00:00:10.880> just

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
was initially thinking about just

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.120 
was initially thinking about just
utilizing<00:00:13.219> stock<00:00:14.219> components<00:00:15.049> and<00:00:16.130> convert

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
utilizing stock components and convert

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.070 
utilizing stock components and convert
into<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:18.150> single<00:00:18.630> answer<00:00:20.660> there<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.810> little

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
into a single answer there is a little

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.150 
into a single answer there is a little
problem<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.680> within<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:27.859> light<00:00:28.859> line<00:00:29.130> -<00:00:29.519> one

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
problem in within the light line - one

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.510 
problem in within the light line - one
the<00:00:32.899> middle<00:00:33.899> part<00:00:34.230> has<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.630> female<00:00:36.630> fit<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
the middle part has the female fit and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.540 
the middle part has the female fit and
gear<00:00:38.520> part<00:00:39.260> pinion<00:00:40.260> gears<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.250> stopping

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
gear part pinion gears and stopping

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.940 
gear part pinion gears and stopping
mechanism<00:00:41.790> there<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.050> enough<00:00:43.320> clearance

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
mechanism there is not enough clearance

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.270 
mechanism there is not enough clearance
so<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> could<00:00:45.539> actually<00:00:45.780> make<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.469> plastic

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so I could actually make the plastic

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.389 
so I could actually make the plastic
parts<00:00:47.670> -<00:00:49.670> all<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.969> strings<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
parts - all the strings so so that the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.900 
parts - all the strings so so that the
string<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:56.780> go<00:00:57.780> over<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.609> boundary<00:00:59.609> so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
string will not go over the boundary so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
string will not go over the boundary so
that<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.300> does<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.750> doesn't<00:01:01.399> tangles<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:03.650> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that it does it doesn't tangles the the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.929 
that it does it doesn't tangles the the
axle<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> chest<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.520> should<00:01:08.760> do

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
axle but you have a chest I should do

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.380 
axle but you have a chest I should do
that<00:01:08.970> much<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:10.340> my<00:01:11.340> original<00:01:11.640> purpose

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that much and I was my original purpose

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.740 
that much and I was my original purpose
was<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> make<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.170> simple<00:01:14.100> modification<00:01:14.970> so

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
was to make a simple modification so

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
was to make a simple modification so
that<00:01:15.900> everyone<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:17.030> yet<00:01:18.590> achieve<00:01:20.180> River

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that everyone can do yet achieve River

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.300 
that everyone can do yet achieve River
plancha<00:01:21.630> speed<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:23.270> instead<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.960> guess<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.680> kinda

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
plancha speed so instead I guess I kinda

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.100 
plancha speed so instead I guess I kinda
cheated<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:27.090> time<00:01:27.330> again<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:30.329> same<00:01:30.540> concept

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
cheated this time again the same concept

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.710 
cheated this time again the same concept
quarter<00:01:31.979> inch<00:01:33.110> cap<00:01:34.110> bulk<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.720> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
quarter inch cap bulk so this one and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.910 
quarter inch cap bulk so this one and
two<00:01:39.110> one<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.350> quarter<00:01:40.650> inch<00:01:41.299> washes

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
two one and a quarter inch washes

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.010 
two one and a quarter inch washes
resetting<00:01:43.920> inside<00:01:44.310> -<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> won't

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
resetting inside - so that it won't

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.039 
resetting inside - so that it won't
wobble<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:48.860> as<00:01:49.860> usual<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.549> make<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> hole<00:01:51.390> into

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
wobble and as usual I make a hole into

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.480 
wobble and as usual I make a hole into
the<00:01:52.259> spindles<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.990> that's<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.110> big<00:01:55.490> strings

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the spindles and that's a big strings

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.850 
the spindles and that's a big strings
actually<00:01:56.700> go<00:01:57.180> through<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:58.170> tied<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
actually go through that was tied to the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.580 
actually go through that was tied to the
hole<00:01:59.360> and<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.110> wrap<00:02:01.290> wrap<00:02:01.560> wrap

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
hole and then you have to wrap wrap wrap

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.050 
hole and then you have to wrap wrap wrap
it<00:02:02.159> like<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.880> one

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
it like this one

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.090 
it like this one
or<00:02:05.510> user<00:02:05.810> just<00:02:06.470> like<00:02:06.619> this<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.070> rabbit

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
or user just like this and rabbit

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.780 
or user just like this and rabbit
so<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.580> promise<00:02:11.440> river<00:02:12.440> blancher<00:02:13.870> and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
so this is a promise river blancher and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.090 
so this is a promise river blancher and
not<00:02:16.790> expensive<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:18.350> you're<00:02:18.530> interested<00:02:18.920> you

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
not expensive if you're interested you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.210 
not expensive if you're interested you
might<00:02:19.459> want<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.670> try<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.930> yet<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:21.739> was<00:02:21.980> not

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
might want to try and yet this was not

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:34.050 
might want to try and yet this was not
too<00:02:22.340> bad<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:29.239> just<00:02:30.050> broke<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:31.420> yeah

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
too bad I just broke it yeah

inside it's not gonna be really exciting

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.640 
inside it's not gonna be really exciting
it's<00:02:54.170> pretty<00:02:55.660> simple

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
it's pretty simple

another cesium not another washer and
this<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.940> it

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
this is it

this is it
everything<00:03:24.560> else<00:03:24.769> is<00:03:24.980> stuck<00:03:27.010> what<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.040> did

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.930 

using<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.840> have<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.140> do<00:03:33.320> much<00:03:33.829> more<00:03:34.130> occasion<00:03:34.670> to

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
using I have to do much more occasion to

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.949 
using I have to do much more occasion to
that<00:03:36.459> this<00:03:37.459> line<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.880> cover<00:03:38.090> itself<00:03:38.540> because

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
that this line to cover itself because

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.180 
that this line to cover itself because
that<00:03:39.530> was<00:03:40.340> quite<00:03:40.549> big<00:03:40.959> flow<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.290> goes<00:03:42.620> whoo

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
that was quite big flow and goes whoo

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.130 
that was quite big flow and goes whoo
there's<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.820> some<00:03:45.370> way<00:03:46.370> that's<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.630> reason<00:03:47.989> I

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
there's a some way that's the reason I

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.330 
there's a some way that's the reason I
put<00:03:48.709> this<00:03:48.980> one<00:03:49.250> inside<00:03:50.049> so<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:51.109> reduces<00:03:52.070> the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
put this one inside so you reduces the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.690 
put this one inside so you reduces the
way<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:54.709> always<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.190> little<00:03:55.489> bit

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
way and this I always a little bit

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.430 
way and this I always a little bit
tricky<00:03:57.040> there<00:03:58.040> is<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.299> female

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.690 

shaft<00:04:02.580> hole<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:04.810> from<00:04:05.320> that<00:04:05.560> point<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:06.220> just

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
shaft hole so from that point I just

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.560 
shaft hole so from that point I just
gradually<00:04:07.710> use<00:04:08.710> a<00:04:08.740> larger<00:04:09.490> drill<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:10.060> open<00:04:10.240> it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
gradually use a larger drill to open it

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.140 
gradually use a larger drill to open it
up<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:11.560> that<00:04:11.590> now<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.220> has<00:04:12.460> a<00:04:12.490> quarter-inch

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
up so that now it has a quarter-inch

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.840 
up so that now it has a quarter-inch
hole<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.680> this<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.220> how<00:04:15.460> yes<00:04:17.010> now<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.280> have<00:04:18.730> a

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
hole so this is how yes now I have a

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.630 
hole so this is how yes now I have a
hole<00:04:19.120> here<00:04:19.709> maybe<00:04:20.709> should<00:04:21.130> have<00:04:21.340> moved

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
hole here maybe should have moved

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.960 
hole here maybe should have moved
somewhere<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.870> middle<00:04:23.200> then<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.460> have<00:04:24.640> more

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
somewhere in the middle then I have more

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.430 
somewhere in the middle then I have more
room<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.360> wrap<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.870> strings

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
room to wrap the strings

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.640 
room to wrap the strings
anyway<00:04:27.600> this<00:04:28.600> is<00:04:28.870> just<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:29.290> simple<00:04:29.680> demo<00:04:31.650> this

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
anyway this is just a simple demo this

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.960 
anyway this is just a simple demo this
is<00:04:32.920> how<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.190> do<00:04:35.130> like<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:38.560> jam<00:04:38.770> nut

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
is how I do like that and the jam nut

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.050 
is how I do like that and the jam nut
sits<00:04:39.970> somewhere<00:04:40.330> in<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.810> middle<00:04:41.760> not<00:04:42.760> too

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
sits somewhere in the middle not too

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.620 
sits somewhere in the middle not too
deep

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
deep

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.620 
deep
what<00:04:44.290> has<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.680> go<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.890> little<00:04:45.040> bit<00:04:45.250> more<00:04:48.630> another

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
what has to go a little bit more another
