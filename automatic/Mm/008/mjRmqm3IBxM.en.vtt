00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 Hi, I'm a teacher, Team Marcia. 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.450
 Today we are going to present a 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.750
 combination of wire to wire more and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.809
 smoked this procedure 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.449
 we used the derma line the mag starting 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.670
 by the hygienic concept based on 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.439
 chlorhexidine mint 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.500
 but the sanctions that are rightfully the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.070
 lubricant based on azulay and for 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.070
 promote the anti-theme effect 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.340
 to help in the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.340
 tissue regeneration 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.570
 the pigment that was used both for 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.250
 the wire and the melt was the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 medium brown pigment in the procedure 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 wire of the wire tip of a used needle 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.789
 and circular nozzle in the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.859
 we used needles of five 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.859
 tips and contain the circular 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.980
 see fashion and source at the appropriate speed 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.610
 The first step is to check all the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.040
 measures 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.259
 adjusting the drawing according to the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.259
 pre-set markings 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.710
 the pyramidal region is very important 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.190
 positioning of the eyebrow in the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.190
 face 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.470
 according to the measures 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.320
 the excess hairs are removed with the 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.830
 tweezers and a new design can be 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.940
 performed to follow up 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.540
 procedure 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.910
 then the anesthetic cream to serve 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.910
 cushion and soften the pain 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.000
 the first step is a structured structure 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.670
 in wire to format the design 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.970
 taking care of the slope and lightness of each 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.970
 thread 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.900
 is 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.730
 this wire rope structure serves as 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.019
 skeleton to cover the faults of 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.019
 thin eyebrows 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.489
 O 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.640
 then overlapping this skeleton 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:00.460
 or frame that has already been made 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.860
 We will follow this drawing with 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.550
 three-dimensional blur of borders 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.470
 infinite enhancing and giving lightness 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.040
 adequate volume and positioning of the 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.040
 Brazil 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.430
 Thank you all for your continued attention.
