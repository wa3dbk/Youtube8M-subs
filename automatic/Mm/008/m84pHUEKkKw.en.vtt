which is also referred to sometimes as
the<00:00:36.070> female<00:00:36.460> part<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.750> then<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.110> toggle<00:00:38.590> bar

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
the female part and then the toggle bar

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.069 
the female part and then the toggle bar
which<00:00:39.460> is<00:00:39.489> also<00:00:39.760> referred<00:00:40.450> to<00:00:40.480> as<00:00:40.629> the<00:00:40.780> male

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
which is also referred to as the male

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.420 
which is also referred to as the male
part<00:00:41.350> you'll<00:00:41.530> see<00:00:41.710> it<00:00:41.800> both<00:00:41.950> ways<00:00:42.160> and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
part you'll see it both ways and

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.549 
part you'll see it both ways and
instructions<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:43.210> so<00:00:43.870> what<00:00:44.050> you<00:00:44.170> do<00:00:44.320> to<00:00:44.350> make

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
instructions and so what you do to make

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.369 
instructions and so what you do to make
these<00:00:44.770> work<00:00:44.980> is<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.219> just<00:00:45.520> take<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.969> bar<00:00:46.379> slip

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
these work is you just take the bar slip

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.819 
these work is you just take the bar slip
one<00:00:47.800> in<00:00:48.010> first<00:00:48.340> through<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.270> ring<00:00:49.649> pull<00:00:50.649> it

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
one in first through the ring pull it

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.540 
one in first through the ring pull it
through<00:00:51.250> and<00:00:51.960> then<00:00:52.960> it<00:00:53.230> locks<00:00:53.559> in<00:00:53.920> place<00:00:53.949> and

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
through and then it locks in place and

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.040 
through and then it locks in place and
so<00:00:54.699> when<00:00:54.850> you<00:00:54.940> have<00:00:55.120> this<00:00:55.300> on<00:00:55.480> your<00:00:55.600> wrist<00:00:55.809> or

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
so when you have this on your wrist or

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.990 
so when you have this on your wrist or
on<00:00:56.170> your<00:00:56.260> neck<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:57.250> have<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.550> tension

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
on your neck you have the tension

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.639 
on your neck you have the tension
pulling<00:00:58.269> in<00:00:58.449> either<00:00:58.570> direction<00:00:58.899> and<00:00:59.410> that's

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
pulling in either direction and that's

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.099 
pulling in either direction and that's
not<00:00:59.859> going<00:01:00.129> to<00:01:00.190> come<00:01:00.399> undone<00:01:00.750> until<00:01:01.750> you<00:01:01.930> want

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
not going to come undone until you want

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.100 
not going to come undone until you want
it<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:02.680> then<00:01:02.890> you<00:01:03.010> simply<00:01:03.250> take<00:01:03.609> the<00:01:03.820> bar

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
it to and then you simply take the bar

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.230 
it to and then you simply take the bar
put<00:01:05.110> it<00:01:05.200> back<00:01:05.440> through<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.040> ring<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.520> undo<00:01:07.060> it

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
put it back through the ring and undo it

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.960 
put it back through the ring and undo it
so<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:08.500> tip<00:01:08.920> though<00:01:09.190> if<00:01:09.400> you<00:01:09.550> are<00:01:09.580> making

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
so one tip though if you are making

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.930 
so one tip though if you are making
jewelry<00:01:10.420> using<00:01:10.630> toggle<00:01:11.260> clasps<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.010> you<00:01:12.730> want

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
jewelry using toggle clasps is you want

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.300 
jewelry using toggle clasps is you want
to<00:01:13.060> make<00:01:13.240> sure<00:01:13.480> that<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.230> bar<00:01:14.710> can<00:01:15.010> very

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
to make sure that the bar can very

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.670 
to make sure that the bar can very
easily<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.090> freely<00:01:16.420> go<00:01:16.810> through<00:01:17.050> through<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
easily and freely go through through the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.510 
easily and freely go through through the
ring<00:01:17.920> so<00:01:18.790> in<00:01:19.030> this<00:01:19.180> case<00:01:19.510> here<00:01:20.050> I<00:01:20.230> actually<00:01:21.190> had

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
ring so in this case here I actually had

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.640 
ring so in this case here I actually had
to<00:01:21.670> add<00:01:21.790> extra<00:01:22.570> jump<00:01:22.840> ring<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.260> instead<00:01:23.590> of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
to add extra jump ring so instead of

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.070 
to add extra jump ring so instead of
just<00:01:23.890> attaching<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:24.610> right<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.600> end<00:01:25.750> of<00:01:25.960> my

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
just attaching it right to the end of my

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.380 
just attaching it right to the end of my
chain<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.620> had<00:01:27.160> to<00:01:27.310> create<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.610> little<00:01:28.000> smaller

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
chain I had to create a little smaller

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.320 
chain I had to create a little smaller
chain<00:01:28.510> of<00:01:29.050> jump<00:01:29.530> rings<00:01:29.800> so<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.670> when<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:30.820> do<00:01:30.940> go

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
chain of jump rings so that when I do go

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.440 
chain of jump rings so that when I do go
to<00:01:31.390> put<00:01:31.750> it<00:01:31.870> through<00:01:32.170> my<00:01:32.290> toggle<00:01:32.800> ring<00:01:33.760> there's

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
to put it through my toggle ring there's

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.650 
to put it through my toggle ring there's
enough<00:01:34.890> leeway<00:01:35.890> before<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:36.970> hits<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.300> thicker

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
enough leeway before it hits the thicker

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.080 
enough leeway before it hits the thicker
chain<00:01:38.020> which<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.230> too<00:01:38.650> wide<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.670> go<00:01:39.790> through

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
chain which is too wide to go through

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.500 
chain which is too wide to go through
the<00:01:40.210> ring<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.690> can<00:01:41.200> pull<00:01:41.470> through<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.510> latch

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
the ring it can pull through and latch

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.230 
the ring it can pull through and latch
like<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:44.350> you'll<00:01:44.860> see<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.220> an<00:01:45.340> example<00:01:45.670> such<00:01:46.060> as

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
like so you'll see in an example such as

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.360 
like so you'll see in an example such as
this<00:01:46.450> one<00:01:46.720> here<00:01:47.230> that<00:01:47.800> wasn't<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.160> problem

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
this one here that wasn't a problem

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.580 
this one here that wasn't a problem
because<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:49.060> chain<00:01:49.330> itself<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:50.170> narrow

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
because the chain itself is narrow

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.190 
because the chain itself is narrow
enough<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:50.920> go<00:01:51.220> through<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.940> actual<00:01:52.200> toggle

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
enough to go through the actual toggle

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.050 
enough to go through the actual toggle
ring<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.650> so<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:53.980> didn't<00:01:54.280> have<00:01:54.370> to<00:01:54.550> allow<00:01:54.760> any

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
ring and so I didn't have to allow any

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.140 
ring and so I didn't have to allow any
extra<00:01:55.690> space<00:01:56.320> between<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:57.100> chain<00:01:57.370> and<00:01:57.640> the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
extra space between the chain and the
