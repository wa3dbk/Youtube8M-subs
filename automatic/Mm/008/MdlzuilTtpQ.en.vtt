00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
and the presentation of the series I

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.209 
and the presentation of the series I
feel<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> main<00:02:01.770> reasons

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
feel like that's one of the main reasons

why<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.399> feel<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.939> series<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.329> doing<00:02:03.570> so

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
why I feel like this series is doing so

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.450 
why I feel like this series is doing so
good<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.500> because<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> way<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.280> series

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
good it's because the way the series

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.660 
good it's because the way the series
presents<00:02:06.210> its<00:02:06.390> drama<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.829> beams<00:02:08.220> along

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
presents its drama and it's beams along

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.219 
presents its drama and it's beams along
with<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.910> characters<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.660> drama<00:02:10.200> and

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
with the characters like drama and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.479 
with the characters like drama and
different<00:02:10.619> inner<00:02:10.739> workings<00:02:11.129> when<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.340> comes

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
different inner workings when it comes

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.050 
different inner workings when it comes
to<00:02:11.550> their<00:02:11.640> mind

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
to their mind

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.309 
to their mind
I<00:02:12.120> feel<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.750> handles<00:02:13.110> it

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
I feel like it handles it

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.410 
I feel like it handles it
properly<00:02:13.590> does<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.859> feel<00:02:14.069> forced<00:02:14.999> it<00:02:15.150> does<00:02:15.269> it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
properly does it feel forced it does it

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.089 
properly does it feel forced it does it
feel<00:02:15.629> cliche<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.349> doesn't<00:02:16.650> feel<00:02:16.739> like<00:02:16.799> it<00:02:17.069> just

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
feel cliche it doesn't feel like it just

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.890 
feel cliche it doesn't feel like it just
came<00:02:17.340> out<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.519> nowhere<00:02:17.609> it's<00:02:18.329> just<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.659> way

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
came out of nowhere it's just the way

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.259 
came out of nowhere it's just the way

truly<00:02:21.989> saying<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.349> pacing<00:02:22.829> is<00:02:23.579> great

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
truly saying the pacing is great

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:25.970 
truly saying the pacing is great

twelve<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:03.209> thirteen<00:03:03.510> episodes<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.319> that

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
twelve or thirteen episodes so that

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.679 
twelve or thirteen episodes so that
sounds<00:03:04.769> like<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:04.889> ridiculous<00:03:05.430> amount<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:06.480> from

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
sounds like a ridiculous amount but from

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.569 
sounds like a ridiculous amount but from
what<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.139> know<00:03:07.260> manga<00:03:07.739> readers<00:03:07.949> have<00:03:08.129> told<00:03:08.400> me

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
what you know manga readers have told me

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.879 
what you know manga readers have told me
is<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.969> the<00:03:09.209> way<00:03:09.449> the<00:03:09.780> structure<00:03:10.409> of<00:03:10.620> this

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
is that the way the structure of this

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.229 
is that the way the structure of this
series<00:03:11.219> is<00:03:11.340> being<00:03:11.519> done<00:03:11.669> especially<00:03:12.060> when<00:03:12.150> it

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
series is being done especially when it

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.270 
series is being done especially when it
comes<00:03:12.359> to<00:03:12.480> Zanna<00:03:12.719> main<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.109> that<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:14.099> is

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
comes to Zanna main is that it is

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.280 
comes to Zanna main is that it is
flowing<00:03:14.760> right<00:03:15.180> then<00:03:15.419> whoever's<00:03:15.810> directing

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
flowing right then whoever's directing

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.020 
flowing right then whoever's directing
this<00:03:16.409> is<00:03:16.560> doing<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.799> damn<00:03:16.949> good<00:03:16.980> job<00:03:17.189> of<00:03:17.489> able<00:03:17.879> to

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
this is doing a damn good job of able to

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.789 
this is doing a damn good job of able to
I<00:03:18.299> guess<00:03:18.689> kick<00:03:18.930> up<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.169> pacing<00:03:19.409> with<00:03:19.680> all

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
I guess kick up the pacing with all

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.679 
I guess kick up the pacing with all
these<00:03:19.949> chapters<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:20.879> adapted<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.479> where<00:03:21.569> the

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
these chapters but adapted to where the

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.839 
these chapters but adapted to where the
entire<00:03:21.989> story<00:03:22.439> links<00:03:23.069> together<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.549> does<00:03:23.669> it

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
entire story links together and does it

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.369 
entire story links together and does it
feel<00:03:24.000> like<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:24.419> missing<00:03:24.900> anything<00:03:25.109> that's

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
feel like it's missing anything that's

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.619 
feel like it's missing anything that's

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.070 
they're like you see pictures of her by
herself<00:04:29.460> forcing<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.120> smile<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:30.720> stuff<00:04:30.900> like

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
herself forcing a smile and stuff like

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.600 
herself forcing a smile and stuff like
that<00:04:31.350> she's<00:04:31.620> by<00:04:31.830> herself

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
that she's by herself

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.340 
that she's by herself
and<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.150> can<00:04:33.270> assume<00:04:33.479> that<00:04:33.780> she's<00:04:34.020> always

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.779 
and so you can assume that she's always
alone<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.740> don't<00:04:34.979> know<00:04:35.069> if<00:04:35.190> her<00:04:35.280> parents<00:04:35.490> have
