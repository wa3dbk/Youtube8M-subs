hi<00:00:00.930> I'm<00:00:01.439> suffering<00:00:02.010> Janina<00:00:02.520> from<00:00:02.700> Denmark<00:00:03.120> and

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
hi I'm suffering Janina from Denmark and

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.390 
hi I'm suffering Janina from Denmark and
I<00:00:03.780> would<00:00:03.959> like<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.140> show<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.710> polyphonic

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
I would like to show you a polyphonic

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.680 
I would like to show you a polyphonic
guitar<00:00:06.120> Chima

so<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.620> idea<00:00:07.890> about<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.639> tuna<00:00:09.500> was<00:00:10.500> born

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
so this idea about this tuna was born

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.580 
so this idea about this tuna was born
some<00:00:11.160> months<00:00:11.429> ago<00:00:11.639> when<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.509> went<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> small

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
some months ago when I went to a small

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.470 
some months ago when I went to a small
concert<00:00:14.070> where<00:00:14.460> one<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.790> my<00:00:14.940> friends<00:00:15.330> is

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
concert where one of my friends is

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.750 
concert where one of my friends is
playing<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.900> guitar<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.500> band<00:00:16.760> he

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
playing the guitar and this band he

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.170 
playing the guitar and this band he
spent<00:00:18.109> several<00:00:19.109> seconds<00:00:19.850> start<00:00:20.850> trying<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
spent several seconds start trying to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.650 
spent several seconds start trying to
figure<00:00:21.420> out<00:00:21.630> which<00:00:22.160> string<00:00:23.160> was<00:00:23.820> out<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.449> tune

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
figure out which string was out of tune

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.040 
figure out which string was out of tune
and<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:26.699> rest<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> musicians<00:00:27.750> was

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
and the rest of the musicians was

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.160 
and the rest of the musicians was
waiting<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:29.039> him<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.910> after<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> concert<00:00:30.779> I

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
waiting for him so after the concert I

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.280 
waiting for him so after the concert I
went<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.619> him<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.219> proposed<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:33.110> we<00:00:34.110> could

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
went to him I proposed that we could

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.200 
went to him I proposed that we could
investigate<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.280> making<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.820> polyphonic

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
investigate a bit in making a polyphonic

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.229 
investigate a bit in making a polyphonic
June<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.170> death<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.280> he<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:39.000> able<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
June is death so he would be able to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.069 
June is death so he would be able to
detect<00:00:40.280> instantly<00:00:41.280> which<00:00:42.059> string<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:43.050> of

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
detect instantly which string is out of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.220 
detect instantly which string is out of
tune<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:44.309> target<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:46.050> would

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
tune the target is here that we would

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.959 
tune the target is here that we would
like<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.770> standard<00:00:47.340> equipment<00:00:47.670> like

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
like to have standard equipment like

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.450 
like to have standard equipment like

to make this polyphonic gene so one of
the<00:00:57.149> problems<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:59.160> some<00:00:59.430> kind

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the problems is that we have some kind

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.400 
the problems is that we have some kind
of<00:01:00.149> collisions<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> frequency<00:01:01.379> domain

I<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.330> made<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> small<00:01:15.810> application<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> first

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
I have made a small application so first

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.359 
I have made a small application so first
of<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.619> explain<00:01:20.130> how<00:01:20.189> the

of all I would like to explain how the
system<00:01:20.729> actually<00:01:21.240> works<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.930> my<00:01:22.680> system

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
system actually works so my system

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.640 
and when we plot the a-string Rhys can
observe<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.600> some<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.380> harmonics

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
observe that some of the harmonics

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.550 
observe that some of the harmonics
actually<00:02:17.310> collides<00:02:17.670> with<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.840> fundamental

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
actually collides with the fundamental

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.220 
actually collides with the fundamental
of<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.130> case<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.580> high<00:02:20.760> E<00:02:20.790> string<00:02:21.230> so

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
of in this case the high E string so

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.190 
of in this case the high E string so
when<00:02:23.130> we<00:02:23.280> want<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.670> detect<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.810> exact

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
when we want to detect the exact

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.790 
when we want to detect the exact
frequency<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:26.130> high<00:02:26.250> E<00:02:26.280> string<00:02:26.430> its<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.480> is

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
frequency of the high E string its it is

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.380 
frequency of the high E string its it is
it's<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.920> problem<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.490> we<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.850> such<00:02:30.360> high

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
it's a problem that we have such high

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.320 
it's a problem that we have such high
level<00:02:31.050> at<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.830> frequency<00:02:32.400> from<00:02:33.270> the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
level at this frequency from the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.470 
level at this frequency from the
overtones<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> string<00:02:35.480> so

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
overtones of the a string so

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.199 
overtones of the a string so
nevertheless<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:38.220> actually<00:02:38.700> managed<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
nevertheless I actually managed to

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.260 
nevertheless I actually managed to
separate<00:02:39.900> these<00:02:40.110> strings<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.910> will<00:02:42.090> show

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
separate these strings and I will show

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.229 
separate these strings and I will show
you<00:02:42.330> an<00:02:42.720> example<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.380> another<00:02:44.100> algorithm<00:02:44.760> that

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
you an example of another algorithm that

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.010 
you an example of another algorithm that
illustrates<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.880> we<00:02:47.880> can<00:02:48.150> now<00:02:48.360> see<00:02:48.600> we<00:02:48.840> have

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
illustrates that we can now see we have

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.880 
illustrates that we can now see we have
six<00:02:49.950> different<00:02:50.160> colors<00:02:51.200> showing<00:02:52.200> deviations

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
six different colors showing deviations

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.300 
six different colors showing deviations
from<00:02:53.430> each<00:02:53.730> string<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:55.470> if<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.739> plot<00:02:55.950> all<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
from each string so if I plot all the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.340 
from each string so if I plot all the
Springs

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
Springs

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.530 
Springs
we<00:02:58.350> now<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:58.769> estimates<00:02:59.550> coming<00:03:00.090> out<00:03:00.209> showing

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
we now have estimates coming out showing

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.180 
we now have estimates coming out showing
that<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:00.959> have<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.290> guitar<00:03:01.440> almost<00:03:02.010> in

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
that we have the guitar almost in

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.729 
that we have the guitar almost in
perfect<00:03:02.370> tune<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.010> adjust<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:06.330> high<00:03:06.739> you

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
perfect tune so if I adjust the high you

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.479 
perfect tune so if I adjust the high you
can<00:03:07.890> see<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.070> can<00:03:08.489> move<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.090> up<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.390> down<00:03:10.489> we

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
can see I can move it up and down we

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.640 
can see I can move it up and down we
have<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.850> B<00:03:12.030> string

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.900 

we<00:03:17.160> have<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.489> g-string

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.890 

we<00:03:22.390> have<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.720> d-string<00:03:27.450> we<00:03:28.450> have<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.870> a

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
we have the d-string we have the a

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:40.950 
we have the d-string we have the a
string<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:33.810> finally<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.380> low<00:03:35.560> restrain<00:03:39.960> so

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
string and finally the low restrain so

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.380 
string and finally the low restrain so
this<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.710> proof<00:03:42.040> of<00:03:42.220> concept<00:03:42.460> of<00:03:42.970> this

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
this is a proof of concept of this

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.580 
this is a proof of concept of this
polyphonic<00:03:44.050> tuna<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:46.600> in<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:46.900> display<00:03:47.260> we

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
polyphonic tuna so in this display we

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.100 
polyphonic tuna so in this display we
now<00:03:47.710> see<00:03:47.980> on<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.850> x-axis<00:03:49.210> we<00:03:49.690> have<00:03:49.720> the

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
now see on the x-axis we have the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.950 
now see on the x-axis we have the
strings<00:03:50.410> low<00:03:51.310> e<00:03:51.340> ad<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.210> so<00:03:52.360> on<00:03:52.510> or<00:03:52.660> too<00:03:52.780> high

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
strings low e ad and so on or too high

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.220 
strings low e ad and so on or too high
and<00:03:53.350> on<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.370> y-axis<00:03:54.670> we<00:03:55.270> have<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.540> deviation

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
and on the y-axis we have the deviation

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.320 
and on the y-axis we have the deviation
and<00:03:56.350> cent<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.970> when<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.150> pluck<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.600> strings<00:04:00.330> we

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
and cent so when I pluck the strings we

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.180 
and cent so when I pluck the strings we
can<00:04:01.480> see<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:01.840> we<00:04:02.050> have<00:04:02.230> some<00:04:02.470> small<00:04:02.710> boxes

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
can see that we have some small boxes

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.390 
can see that we have some small boxes
which<00:04:04.030> moves<00:04:04.390> up<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.810> down<00:04:04.900> according<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:06.190> the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
which moves up and down according to the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.830 
which moves up and down according to the
tune<00:04:06.940> of<00:04:07.150> each<00:04:07.360> string<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:09.280> if<00:04:09.460> I<00:04:09.640> adjust<00:04:10.210> the<00:04:10.810> a

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
tune of each string so if I adjust the a

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.870 
tune of each string so if I adjust the a
string<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:11.590> can<00:04:11.620> see<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:12.130> it<00:04:12.250> moves<00:04:12.490> up<00:04:12.730> and

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
string you can see that it moves up and

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:23.760 
string you can see that it moves up and
down<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:14.380> on<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:17.380> g<00:04:17.590> string

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.070 

so<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:26.370> having<00:04:27.370> in<00:04:27.520> mind<00:04:27.729> that<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.569> region

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
so and having in mind that the a region

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.189 
so and having in mind that the a region
of<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.410> original<00:04:30.039> idea<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.759> was<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.199> it

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
of the original idea it was that it

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.290 
of the original idea it was that it
would<00:04:32.590> be<00:04:32.770> nice<00:04:32.949> for<00:04:33.009> the<00:04:33.370> asses<00:04:33.759> to<00:04:33.970> quick

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
would be nice for the asses to quick

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.010 
would be nice for the asses to quick
identify<00:04:35.110> which<00:04:35.440> train<00:04:35.800> needs<00:04:36.039> adjustment<00:04:37.020> we

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
identify which train needs adjustment we

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.409 
identify which train needs adjustment we
can<00:04:38.199> make<00:04:38.349> a<00:04:38.380> small<00:04:38.650> example<00:04:38.949> so<00:04:39.759> if<00:04:39.940> we<00:04:40.120> kind

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
can make a small example so if we kind

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:46.800 
can make a small example so if we kind
of<00:04:41.250> Miss<00:04:42.250> adjust<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:43.150> D<00:04:43.330> for<00:04:43.630> instance<00:04:45.810> so

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
of Miss adjust the the D for instance so

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.689 
of Miss adjust the the D for instance so
this<00:04:47.050> is<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.349> situation<00:04:47.560> from<00:04:48.069> the<00:04:48.280> concert

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
this is the situation from the concert

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.180 
this is the situation from the concert
and<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.720> artist<00:04:50.139> would<00:04:50.349> then<00:04:50.500> clock<00:04:50.800> all

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
and the artist would then clock all

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.439 
and the artist would then clock all
Springs<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:53.130> quick<00:04:54.130> you<00:04:54.490> can<00:04:54.669> see<00:04:54.849> that<00:04:55.030> oh<00:04:55.150> we

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
Springs and quick you can see that oh we

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.270 
Springs and quick you can see that oh we
need<00:04:55.599> to<00:04:57.720> adjust<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:59.020> D<00:04:59.229> string<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.650> then<00:05:00.099> he

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
need to adjust the D string and then he

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.589 
need to adjust the D string and then he
is<00:05:00.370> ready<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.819> go<00:05:01.060> on<00:05:01.270> with<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.599> concert<00:05:03.030> so<00:05:04.030> I

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
is ready to go on with the concert so I

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.740 
is ready to go on with the concert so I
believe<00:05:05.050> that<00:05:05.349> this<00:05:06.250> polyphonic<00:05:07.060> Kimura

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
believe that this polyphonic Kimura

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.499 
believe that this polyphonic Kimura
approach<00:05:08.080> is<00:05:08.470> much<00:05:09.370> more<00:05:09.639> intuitive<00:05:09.970> way<00:05:10.479> to

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
approach is much more intuitive way to

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.260 
approach is much more intuitive way to
to<00:05:11.169> tune<00:05:11.380> your<00:05:11.620> guitar<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:12.310> at<00:05:12.669> least<00:05:12.819> it's<00:05:13.180> a

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
to tune your guitar and at least it's a

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.809 
to tune your guitar and at least it's a
lot<00:05:13.539> faster<00:05:13.840> than<00:05:14.259> having<00:05:15.159> to<00:05:15.370> shim<00:05:15.580> each

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
lot faster than having to shim each

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.830 
lot faster than having to shim each
individual<00:05:16.569> string<00:05:16.900> and<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:19.120> next<00:05:19.419> step<00:05:19.599> for

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
individual string and the next step for

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.740 
individual string and the next step for
me<00:05:19.960> will<00:05:20.259> of<00:05:20.560> course<00:05:20.740> be<00:05:21.009> to<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:22.060> investigate<00:05:22.720> a

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
me will of course be to to investigate a

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.839 
me will of course be to to investigate a
bit<00:05:22.990> further<00:05:23.229> and<00:05:23.560> perhaps<00:05:24.310> even<00:05:24.520> make<00:05:24.819> a

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
bit further and perhaps even make a

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.629 
bit further and perhaps even make a
small<00:05:25.240> prototype<00:05:25.659> for<00:05:26.169> my<00:05:26.199> friend<00:05:26.590> so<00:05:27.280> we<00:05:27.430> can

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
small prototype for my friend so we can

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.360 
small prototype for my friend so we can
bring<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:28.360> on<00:05:28.599> stage<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:29.199> think<00:05:29.650> it's<00:05:29.979> not<00:05:30.130> that

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
bring it on stage I think it's not that

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.999 
bring it on stage I think it's not that
realistic<00:05:30.699> to<00:05:31.240> have<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:31.419> laptop<00:05:31.719> a<00:05:32.139> long<00:05:32.770> long

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
realistic to have a laptop a long long

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.600 
realistic to have a laptop a long long
stage<00:05:33.280> so<00:05:33.580> a<00:05:34.259> small<00:05:35.259> device<00:05:35.620> that<00:05:35.650> will<00:05:36.580> allow

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
stage so a small device that will allow

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.040 
stage so a small device that will allow
him<00:05:37.000> to<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:38.080> use<00:05:38.259> this<00:05:38.500> new<00:05:39.219> technique<00:05:40.050> on

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
him to to use this new technique on

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.129 
him to to use this new technique on
stage<00:05:41.349> would<00:05:41.650> be<00:05:41.710> very<00:05:42.099> nice<00:05:42.340> thank<00:05:42.990> you<00:05:43.990> for

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
stage would be very nice thank you for

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.200 
stage would be very nice thank you for
watching<00:05:44.440> this<00:05:44.560> video

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
watching this video

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.210 
watching this video
bye-bye
