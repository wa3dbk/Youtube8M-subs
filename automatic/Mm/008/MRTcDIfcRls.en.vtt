is having a pill and you should have to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.729 
is having a pill and you should have to
perform<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:29.000> task<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:30.079> I<00:02:30.140> want<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.379> appear

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
perform this task and I want to appear

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.160 
perform this task and I want to appear
in<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.859> RAM<00:02:31.189> movie<00:02:31.909> carefully<00:02:32.480> by<00:02:32.689> pulling

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
in the RAM movie carefully by pulling

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.610 
in the RAM movie carefully by pulling
out<00:02:33.290> both<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:34.069> these<00:02:34.280> software's<00:02:35.439> this<00:02:36.439> will

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
out both of these software's this will

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.429 
out both of these software's this will
and<00:02:36.799> you're<00:02:37.790> done<00:02:38.030> now<00:02:38.269> you<00:02:38.900> need<00:02:39.049> to<00:02:39.170> slowly

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
and you're done now you need to slowly

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.589 
and you're done now you need to slowly
raise<00:02:39.739> your<00:02:39.799> ramps<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.760> by<00:02:41.090> default<00:02:41.450> as<00:02:41.540> you

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
raise your ramps so by default as you

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.569 
raise your ramps so by default as you
can<00:02:41.720> see<00:02:41.870> there<00:02:42.049> are<00:02:42.170> two<00:02:42.379> RAM<00:02:42.739> available<00:02:43.040> in

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
can see there are two RAM available in

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.360 
can see there are two RAM available in
let<00:02:44.000> me<00:02:44.030> just<00:02:44.150> pour<00:02:45.019> in<00:02:45.139> some<00:02:45.290> light<00:02:45.650> inside<00:02:46.099> so

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
let me just pour in some light inside so

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.789 
let me just pour in some light inside so
that<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.579> can<00:02:46.730> get<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:46.909> quick<00:02:47.349> overview<00:02:48.349> of<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
that you can get a quick overview of the

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.399 
that you can get a quick overview of the
same<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:50.209> there<00:02:50.389> are<00:02:50.480> two<00:02:50.659> rams<00:02:50.930> near<00:02:51.230> which

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
same so there are two rams near which

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.210 
same so there are two rams near which
you<00:02:51.530> can<00:02:51.680> clearly<00:02:51.920> find<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:53.799> above<00:02:54.799> below

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
you can clearly find and above below

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.869 
you can clearly find and above below
that<00:02:55.519> I'd<00:02:56.180> be<00:02:56.569> adding<00:02:57.019> two<00:02:57.859> of<00:02:57.980> these<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:58.730> we

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
that I'd be adding two of these so we

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.360 
that I'd be adding two of these so we
need<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.120> first<00:02:59.389> find<00:02:59.480> out<00:03:00.049> which<00:03:00.769> way<00:03:01.099> these

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
need to first find out which way these

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.839 
need to first find out which way these
Rams

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
Rams

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.399 
Rams
actually<00:03:02.269> have<00:03:02.480> will<00:03:02.629> be<00:03:02.689> inserted<00:03:02.989> through

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
actually have will be inserted through

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.099 
actually have will be inserted through
pieces<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.250> try<00:03:04.579> to<00:03:04.639> pull<00:03:04.939> out<00:03:05.090> one<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.750> these

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
pieces to try to pull out one of these

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:13.210 
pieces to try to pull out one of these
and<00:03:06.379> then<00:03:06.799> check<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.909> out<00:03:08.030> first<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:11.260> once<00:03:12.260> the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
and then check it out first so once the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.129 
and then check it out first so once the
first<00:03:13.250> Ram<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:13.939> out<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.450> can<00:03:14.629> really<00:03:14.959> see<00:03:15.109> that

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
first Ram is out you can really see that

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.789 
first Ram is out you can really see that
the<00:03:16.180> smaller<00:03:17.180> area<00:03:17.629> here<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.139> actually<00:03:18.590> on<00:03:18.709> the

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
the smaller area here is actually on the

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.710 
the smaller area here is actually on the
right<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.340> this<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.730> how<00:03:19.879> it<00:03:20.030> actually<00:03:20.209> enters

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
right so this is how it actually enters

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.409 
right so this is how it actually enters
in<00:03:20.959> so<00:03:21.530> let<00:03:21.680> me<00:03:21.769> just<00:03:21.949> push<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:22.819> back<00:03:23.150> and

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
in so let me just push this back and

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.809 
in so let me just push this back and
then<00:03:24.079> insert<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.919> other<00:03:25.069> pole<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.579> on

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
then insert the other pole and on

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:37.240 
then insert the other pole and on
releasing<00:03:26.599> me<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:27.500> would<00:03:27.680> less<00:03:27.919> memory<00:03:28.669> module

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.070 

so<00:03:38.250> here<00:03:38.489> people<00:03:38.790> all<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.300> four<00:03:39.510> lamps<00:03:39.810> are

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
so here people all the four lamps are

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.080 
so here people all the four lamps are
actually<00:03:40.470> placed<00:03:40.980> now<00:03:41.220> as<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.610> can<00:03:41.730> see<00:03:41.790> here

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
actually placed now as you can see here

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.000 
actually placed now as you can see here
if<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.629> just<00:03:42.810> have<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.170> press<00:03:43.349> them<00:03:43.590> once<00:03:43.830> and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
if you just have to press them once and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.150 
if you just have to press them once and
then<00:03:44.370> push<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.239> whole<00:03:45.870> sack<00:03:46.260> socket<00:03:46.830> inside

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
then push this whole sack socket inside

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.140 
then push this whole sack socket inside
and<00:03:47.599> slowly<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:49.260> need<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:50.120> press<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.330> back

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
and slowly you need to press this back

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.180 
and slowly you need to press this back
to<00:03:54.150> ensure<00:03:54.569> that<00:03:54.630> they<00:03:55.260> are<00:03:55.319> again<00:03:55.560> back<00:03:55.950> in

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
to ensure that they are again back in

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:03.860 
to ensure that they are again back in
place<00:03:56.459> now<00:03:57.150> close<00:03:57.900> back<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.470> whole<00:03:58.709> panel<00:04:02.870> the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
place now close back the whole panel the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:21.800 
place now close back the whole panel the
way<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.049> actually<00:04:04.349> opened<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:21.299> here<00:04:21.780> we

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
way you actually opened it and here we

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.430 
way you actually opened it and here we
go<00:04:22.049> I'm<00:04:22.710> expected<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.430> push<00:04:23.790> back<00:04:24.120> the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
go I'm expected to push back the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.090 
go I'm expected to push back the
equivalent<00:04:25.639> and<00:04:26.639> here<00:04:26.910> that
