work except for this button at the very
right<00:00:16.529> which<00:00:16.770> simply<00:00:17.190> engages<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.940> reverse

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
right which simply engages the reverse

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.990 
right which simply engages the reverse
effect<00:00:18.980> now<00:00:19.980> when<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> engage<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.850> we're

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
effect now when I engage this we're

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000 
effect now when I engage this we're
going<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.150> hear<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.630> music<00:00:21.750> go<00:00:22.080> backwards<00:00:22.740> but

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
going to hear the music go backwards but

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.500 
going to hear the music go backwards but
the<00:00:23.160> music<00:00:23.490> will<00:00:23.640> continue<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.210> play<00:00:24.449> for

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the music will continue to play for

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.839 
the music will continue to play for
words<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.410> screen<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.519> when<00:00:26.820> I

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
words on the screen so that when I

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.150 
words on the screen so that when I
disengage<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.840> reverse<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.710> music<00:00:29.039> will

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
disengage the reverse the music will

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.800 
disengage the reverse the music will
actually<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> point<00:00:30.390> where<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> was

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
actually be at the point where it was

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.690 
actually be at the point where it was
supposed<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.289> instead<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.859> being<00:00:32.070> prior<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
supposed to be instead of being prior to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.819 
supposed to be instead of being prior to
where<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> was<00:00:33.149> before<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.930> were<00:00:34.110> engaged<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
where I was before I were engaged the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.600 
where I was before I were engaged the
reverse<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:36.090> example<00:00:40.040> and<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.430> come

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
reverse for example and then we come

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.490 
reverse for example and then we come
back<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.059> downbeat<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> reverse

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
back in on the downbeat so the reverse

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.290 
back in on the downbeat so the reverse
just<00:00:43.890> stays<00:00:44.040> active<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.610> long<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.120> hold

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
just stays active as long as you hold

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.119 
just stays active as long as you hold
the<00:00:45.510> button<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.379> could<00:00:46.559> hold<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.890> button

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the button and I could hold this button

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.100 
the button and I could hold this button
until<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:48.120> actually<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.539> all<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> way<00:00:48.960> back

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
until we actually got all the way back

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
until we actually got all the way back
to<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> beginning<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> song<00:00:50.070> again<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
to the beginning of the song again if I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.600 
to the beginning of the song again if I
prefer<00:00:51.260> or<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.739> use<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.340> very

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
prefer or I can use it for just very

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.729 
prefer or I can use it for just very
short<00:00:53.940> amounts<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:59.899> all<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> time<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> music

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
short amounts and all the time the music

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.799 
short amounts and all the time the music
keeps<00:01:01.890> playing<00:01:02.039> straight<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> never<00:01:03.449> lose

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
keeps playing straight so I never lose

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.830 
keeps playing straight so I never lose
my<00:01:03.989> position<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> song<00:01:08.119> this<00:01:09.119> next<00:01:09.390> one<00:01:09.659> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
my position in the song this next one is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.440 
my position in the song this next one is
the<00:01:10.409> brake<00:01:10.530> effect<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.640> simulates<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the brake effect and this simulates the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.690 
the brake effect and this simulates the
effect<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.990> turning<00:01:13.500> off<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.799> turntable<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
effect of turning off the turntable and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.230 
effect of turning off the turntable and
having<00:01:14.970> music<00:01:15.390> slow<00:01:15.720> down<00:01:15.990> automatically<00:01:17.240> in

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
having music slow down automatically in

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640 
having music slow down automatically in
order<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.900> work<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.290> simply

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
order for this one to work you simply

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.410 
order for this one to work you simply
set<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.920> brake<00:01:20.159> speed<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.880> knob<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
set the brake speed with this knob and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.149 
set the brake speed with this knob and
then<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.020> engage<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.560> effect<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
then you engage the effect with the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.450 
then you engage the effect with the
button<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.570> turn<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.500> maybe<00:01:25.830> 2.8

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
button so if I turn this up to maybe 2.8

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.590 
button so if I turn this up to maybe 2.8
seconds<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.180> engage<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:29.820> takes<00:01:30.119> 2.8

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
seconds and engage it it takes 2.8

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.749 
seconds and engage it it takes 2.8
seconds<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> music<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> come<00:01:31.890> down<00:01:32.130> but

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
seconds for the music to come down but

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.340 
seconds for the music to come down but
when<00:01:32.880> i<00:01:32.909> turn<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.270> off<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.630> music<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.049> right

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.780 
when i turn it off the music is right
back<00:01:34.560> where<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.920> was<00:01:34.950> supposed<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
back where it was supposed to be the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
back where it was supposed to be the
music<00:01:35.909> keeps<00:01:36.299> playing<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.920> again

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
music keeps playing so this is again

music keeps playing so this is again
just<00:01:38.490> an<00:01:38.610> effect<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.420> dropped<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.930> at

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
just an effect that can be dropped in at

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:51.319 
just an effect that can be dropped in at
any<00:01:40.200> time<00:01:42.680> just<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.590 

pretty<00:01:52.329> neat<00:01:53.009> finally<00:01:54.009> we<00:01:54.939> have<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.149> repeat

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
pretty neat finally we have the repeat

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.410 
pretty neat finally we have the repeat
effect<00:01:55.929> this<00:01:56.710> one<00:01:56.950> is<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.159> whole<00:01:57.579> lot<00:01:57.820> of<00:01:57.850> fun<00:01:58.119> in

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
effect this one is a whole lot of fun in

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.029 
effect this one is a whole lot of fun in
fact<00:01:58.630> let<00:01:58.840> me<00:01:58.869> jump<00:01:59.079> back<00:01:59.289> in<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.439> music<00:01:59.770> so<00:01:59.950> we

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
fact let me jump back in the music so we

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.389

have<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:00.219> little<00:02:00.399> bit<00:02:00.549> time<00:02:00.939> to<00:02:01.090> play<00:02:01.179> with<00:02:01.390> it

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
have a little bit time to play with it

have a little bit time to play with it
this<00:02:03.399> is<00:02:03.700> kind<00:02:03.939> of<00:02:03.970> like<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.149> sampler<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:04.990> that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
this is kind of like a sampler and that

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.260 
this is kind of like a sampler and that
the<00:02:05.679> instant<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.159> engage<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.759> effect<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
the instant you engage the effect the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.690 
the instant you engage the effect the
effect<00:02:07.360> records<00:02:08.289> two<00:02:08.560> bars<00:02:08.860> worth<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.369> audio

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
effect records two bars worth of audio

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.880 
effect records two bars worth of audio
and<00:02:10.000> then<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.630> starts<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.019> repeat<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.500> over<00:02:11.680> and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
and then it starts to repeat it over and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.280 
and then it starts to repeat it over and
over<00:02:12.040> again<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:13.090> size<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.720> repeat<00:02:14.140> is

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
over again the size of the repeat is

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.100 
over again the size of the repeat is
controlled<00:02:14.890> by<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.610> knob<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.629> more<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.840> turn

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
controlled by the knob the more you turn

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.580 
controlled by the knob the more you turn
up<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.470> knob<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.860> smaller<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.580> loop<00:02:18.760> becomes

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
up the knob the smaller the loop becomes

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.479 
up the knob the smaller the loop becomes
for<00:02:20.590> example<00:02:21.209> I'll<00:02:22.209> engage<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.260> here<00:02:23.829> on<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
for example I'll engage this here on the

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.870 
for example I'll engage this here on the
downbeat<00:02:25.680> now<00:02:26.680> I'll<00:02:26.829> get<00:02:26.980> two<00:02:27.190> bars<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.700> keep

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
downbeat now I'll get two bars that keep

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.720 
downbeat now I'll get two bars that keep
coming<00:02:28.030> over<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.510> over<00:02:28.630> again<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:30.310> if<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.519> turn

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
coming over and over again but if I turn

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.420 
coming over and over again but if I turn
this<00:02:30.760> knob<00:02:31.090> up<00:02:31.360> here's<00:02:32.200> one<00:02:32.440> half<00:02:32.829> bar<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:35.430> keep

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
this knob up here's one half bar I keep

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.559 
this knob up here's one half bar I keep
getting<00:02:36.549> smaller<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.180> smaller

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.619 

until<00:02:41.319> really<00:02:41.709> small<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.370> grow<00:02:43.180> back<00:02:43.209> out

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
until really small and grow back out

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.929 
until really small and grow back out
again<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.379> then<00:02:45.370> when<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.549> turn<00:02:45.700> off<00:02:45.909> the

effect<00:02:46.389> the<00:02:47.139> music<00:02:47.469> is<00:02:47.560> right<00:02:47.769> back<00:02:47.920> where<00:02:47.980> it

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:48.249 
effect the music is right back where it

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:51.690 
effect the music is right back where it
was<00:02:48.280> again<00:02:49.319> now<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.379> button<00:02:50.829> on<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.249> effect

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
was again now the button on this effect

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.800 
was again now the button on this effect
will<00:02:52.299> actually<00:02:52.829> reseed<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.040> effect<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:55.060> right

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
will actually reseed the effect so right

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.140 
will actually reseed the effect so right
now<00:02:55.840> with<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.379> running<00:02:56.530> I'm<00:02:57.489> just<00:02:57.730> listening

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
now with it running I'm just listening

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.300 
now with it running I'm just listening
to<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.329> same<00:02:58.659> quarter<00:02:59.469> note<00:02:59.650> worth<00:02:59.889> of<00:03:00.099> loop

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
to the same quarter note worth of loop

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.339 
to the same quarter note worth of loop
over<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:00.819> over<00:03:00.879> again<00:03:01.090> but<00:03:01.900> when<00:03:02.019> I<00:03:02.049> hit<00:03:02.200> this

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349
