00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
were pretty much the same concept just a

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.450 
were pretty much the same concept just a
little<00:01:02.020> bit<00:01:02.140> heavier<00:01:02.500> material<00:01:03.160> heavier

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
expensive that actually costs more than

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.889 
expensive that actually costs more than
what<00:01:11.979> I<00:01:12.009> paid<00:01:12.100> from<00:01:12.399> a<00:01:12.550> camera<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.810> was

this cool little robotic arm that you
know<00:01:15.940> when<00:01:16.149> different<00:01:16.509> ways<00:01:16.660> a<00:01:16.840> really<00:01:17.440> neat

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.250 
know when different ways a really neat
tripod<00:01:18.160> it<00:01:19.000> was<00:01:19.150> just<00:01:19.240> really<00:01:19.450> expensive<00:01:19.930> and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.030 
a snake lamp that you know was not fully
adjustable<00:01:54.100> but<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.670> noticed<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.090> bottom

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
adjustable but I noticed the bottom

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.350 
adjustable but I noticed the bottom
wasn't<00:01:57.040> heavy<00:01:57.189> enough<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:57.790> kept<00:01:58.090> trying

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
wasn't heavy enough and it kept trying

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.760 
wasn't heavy enough and it kept trying
to<00:01:58.420> fall<00:01:58.630> over<00:01:58.659> while<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.200> was<00:01:59.409> making<00:01:59.530> my

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
to fall over while I was making my

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.460 
to fall over while I was making my
videos<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.970> wanted<00:02:01.930> something<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.290> little

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
videos so I wanted something a little

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.069 
videos so I wanted something a little
bit<00:02:02.799> more<00:02:02.950> sturdy<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:04.119> I've<00:02:04.299> already<00:02:04.479> tested

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
bit more sturdy and I've already tested

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.710 
bit more sturdy and I've already tested
this<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.439> it<00:02:05.500> works<00:02:05.710> well<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:07.180> all<00:02:07.329> I<00:02:07.360> did<00:02:07.689> was

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
this and it works well and all I did was

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.759 
this and it works well and all I did was
I<00:02:08.110> cut<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.950> slot<00:02:09.310> in<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:10.119> 90<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:11.380> put<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.620> on<00:02:11.739> top

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
I cut a slot in a 90 and put it on top

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.280 
I cut a slot in a 90 and put it on top
and<00:02:12.220> then<00:02:12.370> made<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.269> to<00:02:13.360> where<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.600> bar<00:02:13.900> sat

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
and then made it to where this bar sat

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.650 
and then made it to where this bar sat
down<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.680> there<00:02:14.860> flush<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.459> then<00:02:16.360> wrapped

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
down in there flush and then wrapped

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.569 
down in there flush and then wrapped
some<00:02:16.959> electrical<00:02:17.769> tape<00:02:17.799> around<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.310> really

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
some electrical tape around it really

added this piece to make it a little bit

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.890 
added this piece to make it a little bit
taller<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:06.379> now<00:03:07.379> when<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:09.390> know<00:03:09.450> have<00:03:09.720> it

taller but now when you you know have it

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.330 
taller but now when you you know have it
forward<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.500> wants<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.489> lean<00:03:11.670> forward<00:03:13.340> saw

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
forward it wants to lean forward saw

forward it wants to lean forward saw
added<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.879> piece<00:03:17.629> to<00:03:18.629> weigh<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.870> down<00:03:18.900> and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
added this piece to weigh it down and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.710 
added this piece to weigh it down and
back<00:03:19.700> now<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.730> don't<00:03:20.879> have<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.180> worry<00:03:21.360> about<00:03:21.480> it

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
back now I don't have to worry about it

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.729 
back now I don't have to worry about it
took<00:03:21.930> tipping<00:03:22.620> forward<00:03:22.769> on<00:03:23.099> me<00:03:24.379> well<00:03:25.379> I<00:03:25.410> wanted

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
took tipping forward on me well I wanted

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.920 
took tipping forward on me well I wanted
it<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.129> be<00:03:26.850> just<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:27.180> little<00:03:27.209> bit<00:03:27.690> more

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
it to be just a little bit more

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.129 
it to be just a little bit more
versatile<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.950> could<00:03:29.130> always<00:03:29.930> make<00:03:30.930> this

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
versatile and you could always make this

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.440 
versatile and you could always make this
platform<00:03:31.440> bigger<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.160> just<00:03:32.310> use<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.489> longer

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
platform bigger and just use a longer

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.360 
platform bigger and just use a longer
piece<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.230> PVC<00:03:35.100> pipe<00:03:36.530> maybe<00:03:37.530> put<00:03:38.340> some

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
piece of a PVC pipe maybe put some

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.720 
piece of a PVC pipe maybe put some
weight<00:03:38.730> on<00:03:38.760> here<00:03:39.150> somehow<00:03:39.480> some<00:03:40.370> string<00:03:41.370> make

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
weight on here somehow some string make

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.150 
weight on here somehow some string make
a<00:03:41.760> little<00:03:42.060> net<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.389> there<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:42.989> set<00:03:43.950> this

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
a little net in there and set this

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.949 
a little net in there and set this
inside<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.030> or<00:03:45.150> something<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.630> know<00:03:45.660> some

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
inside of it or something you know some

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.440 
inside of it or something you know some
lead<00:03:46.170> or<00:03:46.470> something<00:03:46.880> fishing<00:03:47.880> weights<00:03:48.060> things

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
lead or something fishing weights things

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.319 
lead or something fishing weights things
like<00:03:48.660> that<00:03:49.489> but<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.609> like<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.000> way<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.150> is

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
like that but I like it the way it is

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.860 
like that but I like it the way it is
right<00:03:51.599> here<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.049> what<00:03:52.260> i'm<00:03:52.410> going<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.680> use

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
right here this is what i'm going to use

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.710 
right here this is what i'm going to use
but<00:03:54.870> i<00:03:54.930> did<00:03:55.139> want<00:03:55.169> to<00:03:55.440> do<00:03:56.359> overheads<00:03:57.359> with<00:03:57.599> it

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
but i did want to do overheads with it

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.849 
but i did want to do overheads with it
as<00:03:57.840> well<00:03:58.019> because<00:03:58.260> that's<00:03:58.410> one<00:03:58.620> thing<00:03:58.799> that

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
as well because that's one thing that

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:06.200 
as well because that's one thing that
the<00:03:59.130> robot<00:03:59.519> arm<00:03:59.730> did<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.590> really<00:04:02.040> liked<00:04:02.419> so

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.020 

now<00:04:09.590> we<00:04:10.590> can<00:04:10.680> do<00:04:10.800> overhead<00:04:11.190> shots<00:04:11.490> with<00:04:11.760> it<00:04:11.880> I

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
now we can do overhead shots with it I

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.850 
now we can do overhead shots with it I
can<00:04:12.240> set<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.570> up<00:04:12.660> on<00:04:12.810> my<00:04:12.990> shelf<00:04:13.290> on<00:04:13.500> my<00:04:13.650> wall

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
can set it up on my shelf on my wall

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.850 
can set it up on my shelf on my wall
there<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:15.050> do<00:04:16.050> overhead<00:04:16.470> shots<00:04:16.770> with<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:18.860> so

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
there and do overhead shots with it so

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.400 
there and do overhead shots with it so
that's<00:04:20.040> how<00:04:20.190> we<00:04:20.220> made<00:04:21.150> our<00:04:21.300> camera<00:04:21.720> tripod<00:04:22.200> I'm

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410
