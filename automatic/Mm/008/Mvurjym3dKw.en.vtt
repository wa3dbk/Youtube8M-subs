thing when you mentioned also that in

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.820 
thing when you mentioned also that in
2010<00:02:01.530> survey<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.680> your<00:02:02.830> men

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
2010 survey of your men

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.530 
2010 survey of your men
lack<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:05.010> confidence<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> sector<00:02:06.240> yeah

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
lack of confidence in the sector yeah

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.990 
lack of confidence in the sector yeah
and<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.170> appears<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.040> have<00:02:08.160> reversed<00:02:08.580> I

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
and that appears to have reversed I

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.940 
and that appears to have reversed I
would<00:02:09.540> you<00:02:09.660> say<00:02:09.840> that's<00:02:10.020> borne<00:02:10.350> out<00:02:10.560> by<00:02:10.590> which

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
would you say that's borne out by which

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.190 
would you say that's borne out by which
you<00:02:11.070> can<00:02:11.100> see<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.790> show<00:02:11.940> today<00:02:12.150> very<00:02:13.020> much
