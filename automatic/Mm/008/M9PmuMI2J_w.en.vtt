00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.680
 Here we see Hanna and Anna Anna 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.930
 always perfectly styled and hanna is 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.230
 annoyed because her hair is never right 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.680
 My hair is too thin 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.500
 and too little for a cool cut like that 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.380
 a nonsense comforts anna you want 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.099
 but uncomplicated hair or too 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.869
 fit you 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.419
 best not shared in the morning 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.840
 have to be and look beautiful for a long time 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:36.199
 hannah have you ever shines? 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.170
 I heard of organic cutting 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.090
 it's you organic herr cutting is one 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.550
 patented hair cutting technique of 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.109
 brockmann and knÃ¶dler the organic 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.239
 Cutting hair is one 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.000
 Further development of all known hair 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.739
 cuts techniques 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.449
 decisive for the revolutionary 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.910
 Organic hair cuts are the 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:00.170
 actually and the intrinsic volume of 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.510
 hair all hair whether curly smooth dick 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.449
 thin or light weight have one 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.910
 Together they have a round up 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.520
 elliptical cross section and therefore too 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.160
 a round surface results 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.140
 the so-called owner 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.240
 that means the hair has the need 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.970
 to turn in on itself 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.560
 that's all natural and in nature 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.110
 everything is round 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.170
 considered organic her cutting 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.430
 this share in the cut 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.040
 does not cut wet and taut 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.950
 but slightly dry and completely 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.410
 without tension you can see which ones better 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.470
 move the hair naturally 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.150
 like the hair fits so thick 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.090
 tear flows easily through the 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.560
 guide hand and the cut hand follows 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.560
 the movement of the hair 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.440
 the hair will never be in a form 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.400
 forced for example taut in one 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.650
 direction 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.680
 it's cut like nature's 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.720
 so it keeps its longer 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.010
 new form like everything in nature and is 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.100
 Everything in nature is subject to that 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.550
 growth and decay so too 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.970
 hair 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.720
 It goes through the growth and failure 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.550
 phase 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.370
 all have hair 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.310
 different lengths in such a hair 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.459
 Pass are both short and 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.920
 long hairs push the short ones on the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.350
 long hair and so arises own 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.750
 volume mhh organic 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.650
 Haircutting is modeled with the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.540
 sliced 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.270
 because in contrast to a place lock 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.280
 or a knife cuts that 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.560
 Scissors every single hair 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.940
 clean off the different 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.350
 to get harlingen 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.910
 This will also preserve the intrinsic volume 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.519
 whether natural or cut 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.830
 graphic bob because the hair inside 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.470
 the new form can grow anyway 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.750
 It wants to keep the cut double up 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.570
 three times as long and desperate 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.989
 styling is history the hair falls 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.510
 always perfect shines is voluminous and 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.110
 keeps this own volume for a long time 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.380
 as well as the great shape 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.250
 what do you say hanna wonderful i can do it 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.440
 hardly describe 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.959
 You just have to make organic herr cutting 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.460
 feel there is nothing off the shelf 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.390
 but tailored to me 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.400
 like a tailor made dress organic 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.360
 Mr. Cutting leaves a new hair 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.360
 language arise
