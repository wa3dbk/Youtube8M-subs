00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
Commonwealth Games it was just a pan

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
Commonwealth Games it was just a pan
flat<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.970> hot

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
flat and it was so hot

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.690 
flat and it was so hot
I<00:00:30.510> mean<00:00:30.840> ridiculously<00:00:31.470> hot<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.189> think<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
I mean ridiculously hot and I think the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.590 
I mean ridiculously hot and I think the
advantage<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.180> gave<00:00:33.329> me<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:33.570> only

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
advantage it gave me not only

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.090 
advantage it gave me not only
aerodynamically<00:00:34.350> also<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:34.829> meant<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:34.980> never

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
aerodynamically also just meant I never

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.840 
aerodynamically also just meant I never
came<00:00:35.309> out<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> position<00:00:37.340> one<00:00:38.340> yeah

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
back in the time trial environment we do

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.660 
back in the time trial environment we do
use<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> race<00:00:43.440> back<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.100> an<00:00:44.190> incredibly

use the race back which is an incredibly
handy<00:00:45.059> device<00:00:45.210> during<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> long<00:00:46.320> time<00:00:46.649> trials

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
handy device during the long time trials

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.060 
handy device during the long time trials
the<00:00:47.370> boys<00:00:47.550> need<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.090> stay<00:00:48.329> hydrated<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.320> they

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the boys need to stay hydrated and they

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340 
the boys need to stay hydrated and they
break<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.760> arrow<00:00:51.059> form<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.199> few

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
break that arrow form for just a few

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.439 
break that arrow form for just a few
seconds<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> bottle<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.000> really

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
seconds to get the bottle it really

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.670 
seconds to get the bottle it really
could<00:00:54.750> make<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> difference<00:00:55.350> between

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
could make the difference between

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.979 
could make the difference between
seconds<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> time<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.090> by<00:00:57.239> having<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
seconds on the time so by having the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.560 
seconds on the time so by having the
Camelbak<00:00:58.800> products<00:00:59.370> we're<00:00:59.910> able<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.359> provide

them with the tools in order to keep
their<00:01:03.449> core<00:01:03.660> temperature<00:01:04.140> down<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.680> their

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
their core temperature down and their

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.840 
their core temperature down and their
bodies<00:01:05.430> available<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.270> race<00:01:07.430> now<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> know<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
bodies available to race now I know this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.520 
bodies available to race now I know this
isn't<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.240> time<00:01:09.479> trial<00:01:09.720> bike<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.260> when<00:01:10.380> he's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
isn't the time trial bike but when he's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.840 
isn't the time trial bike but when he's
on<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.680> time<00:01:10.979> trial<00:01:11.250> bike<00:01:11.400> how<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
on the time trial bike how is it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
on the time trial bike how is it
important<00:01:12.570> his<00:01:12.659> position<00:01:13.140> yeah<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.770> know

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
important his position yeah you know

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
important his position yeah you know
it's<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.070> critical<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
it's really critical because if the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030 
it's really critical because if the
physician<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> right<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:16.680> happens

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
physician is it right then what happens

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.130 
physician is it right then what happens
is<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.220> they<00:01:17.640> can't<00:01:17.880> start<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.330> close<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
is that they can't start to close up and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.870 
is that they can't start to close up and
you're<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.890> able<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> stay<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.580> an

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you're not able to stay in an

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.609 
you're not able to stay in an
aerodynamic<00:01:21.119> position<00:01:21.990> when<00:01:22.290> you're<00:01:22.409> down

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
aerodynamic position when you're down

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.200 
aerodynamic position when you're down
there<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.130> able<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.400> stay<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:23.939> there<00:01:24.090> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
there to be able to stay down there is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090 
there to be able to stay down there is
just<00:01:24.390> critical<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.470> what<00:01:25.619> happens<00:01:25.920> when

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
just critical so what happens when

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
just critical so what happens when
somebody's<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.640> narrow<00:01:26.850> position<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.509> they

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
somebody's in a narrow position and they

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.270 
somebody's in a narrow position and they
need<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> hydrate<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:28.920> break<00:01:29.130> their

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
need to hydrate and they break their

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.789 
need to hydrate and they break their
position<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.119> spend<00:01:30.619> thousands<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.740> dollars

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
position we spend thousands of dollars

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
position we spend thousands of dollars
and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.549> wind<00:01:32.790> tunnels<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.299> try<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.509> get

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and then wind tunnels to try to get

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.480 
and then wind tunnels to try to get
these<00:01:33.810> guys<00:01:33.869> arrow<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.340> produce

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
these guys arrow here and then produce

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.130 
these guys arrow here and then produce
power<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.270> soon<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.540> they<00:01:36.689> lift<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
power here and as soon as they lift that

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.800 
power here and as soon as they lift that
arm<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.890> becomes<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.280> huge<00:01:38.640> drag<00:01:39.150> if<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
arm up it becomes a huge drag if you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.590 
arm up it becomes a huge drag if you
look<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.170> studies<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> importance<00:01:41.310> of

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
look at studies and the importance of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.889 
look at studies and the importance of
hydration<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:43.560> know<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:44.040> pick<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.460> 3<00:01:45.299> 4

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
hydration you know you can pick up 3 4

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.069 
hydration you know you can pick up 3 4
or<00:01:46.140> even<00:01:46.399> 6%<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.790> speed<00:01:48.210> when<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.630> start<00:01:48.930> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
or even 6% of speed when you start to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.289 
or even 6% of speed when you start to
talk<00:01:49.259> about<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.560> one-hour<00:01:50.100> TT<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.000> difference

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
talk about a one-hour TT the difference

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.810 
talk about a one-hour TT the difference
between<00:01:51.479> hydrated<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.350> unhydrated<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.369> I'm

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
between hydrated and unhydrated and I'm

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.219 
between hydrated and unhydrated and I'm
really<00:01:54.210> glad<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.810> has<00:01:54.990> come<00:01:55.200> out

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
really glad that this has come out

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.780 
really glad that this has come out
because<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.890> allow<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.159> guys<00:01:56.490> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
because it's going to allow the guys to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.840 
because it's going to allow the guys to
be<00:01:56.869> aerodynamic<00:01:57.869> deep<00:01:58.380> control<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.670> be

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
be aerodynamic deep control and just be

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.930 
be aerodynamic deep control and just be
so<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.240> more<00:02:00.450> efficient
