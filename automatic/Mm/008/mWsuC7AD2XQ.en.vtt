00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
absolutely crazy and there's so many

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.720 
absolutely crazy and there's so many
enemies<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.650> enemies<00:02:41.070> when<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.550> call

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
enemies and the enemies when you call

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.180 
enemies and the enemies when you call
them<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.030> instantly<00:02:42.630> spawn<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.740> it<00:02:43.830> goes<00:02:44.010> on

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190

but<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.380> absolutely<00:02:49.980> crazy<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.400> actually

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
but it's absolutely crazy and actually

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.060 
but it's absolutely crazy and actually
after<00:02:51.450> watch<00:02:51.630> out<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.050> don't<00:02:52.080> die<00:02:52.470> but<00:02:53.010> it

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
after watch out you don't die but it

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.500 
after watch out you don't die but it
doesn't<00:02:53.310> matter<00:02:53.460> if<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:53.760> die<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.210> just

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
doesn't matter if you die you just

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.810 
doesn't matter if you die you just
respawn<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.080> keep<00:02:55.260> going<00:02:55.560> but<00:02:55.740> as<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.670> see

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820
