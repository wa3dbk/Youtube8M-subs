00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.750
 arias now we the wish book but sand 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.809
 and names and tourists 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.780
 if we talk about that 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.460
 when I signed up and well I in high school 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.539
 I already played in this position 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.539
 I come to cover 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.770
 spain 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.130
 yes that was the reason 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 at first it was my goal but good 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.270
 at the end to bilbao 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.770
 phenomenal choice a great city and for 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.770
 supposed to center what 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.080
 is the position in which 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.360
 we're going to need more you though 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.780
 I've talked to him is he can play the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.210
 two positions and what and that our game 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.210
 neither does playing four or so vary 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.770
 of five and as a player of 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.580
 qualities with which we have signed is 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.659
 because he is a player 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.490
 very old 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.259
 with very good energy at the level 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.680
 defensive in a good good plugger 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.840
 rebounder in 2 to 2 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.159
 very athletic to run phenomenally 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.920
 track 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.380
 and the feeling that I have the days that already 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.009
 has trained with us is that it is a 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.019
 player also at the tactical level looks 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.000
 who has a good sports education 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.099
 I believe that the fact of completing the 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.150
 four years the university is 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:22.090
 fundamental to it and well I think that 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.920
 that one of his things to improve but that 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.290
 I think it has been done for 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.680
 this summer is your average shot 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.000
 distance and good the feeling that I have 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.490
 is that he will end up being a player 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.910
 reliable in those shots of 5 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.140
 with eyes since we already closed the template 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.640
 I think 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.720
 that was the piece that we needed to 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.230
 have a very compensated team I'm very 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.090
 happy 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.310
 template has very good balance and 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.040
 also has several players who can 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.900
 play in different positions 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.610
 therefore it is versatile and we are 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.440
 also prepared for any 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.410
 eventuality 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.400
 in principle without having to sign 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.019
 nobody else because as I say 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.060
 there are players both outside and outside 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.840
 interiors that can occupy 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.580
 different positions 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.290
 the preseason that is so far what 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.200
 What are you waiting for? 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:23.730
 eurobasket or not the season 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.830
 it's going well we're working 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.909
 at a good pace with concentration with 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.250
 intensity but obviously when 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:36.370
 you have four internationals 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.850
 there is here that just arrived because it is 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.340
 Of course you can not advance 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.210
 everything that is what you want 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.340
 and at the time of 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.580
 after enjoying matches that is 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.380
 note but but the truth is that it is something 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.140
 with what we counted 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.660
 and with what happens to practically the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.270
 totality of the equipment and therefore 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.300
 we are happy with how it is 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.300
 going
