cadence right so you've got high cadence

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.900 
cadence right so you've got high cadence
workouts<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.070> you<00:01:09.250> can<00:01:09.400> start<00:01:09.580> spinning

stroke<00:01:16.000> smooth<00:01:16.360> at<00:01:17.290> higher<00:01:17.530> rpms<00:01:18.070> like<00:01:18.250> 120

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
stroke smooth at higher rpms like 120

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.260 
stroke smooth at higher rpms like 120
130<00:01:19.300> rpms<00:01:20.050> really<00:01:20.920> able<00:01:21.040> to<00:01:21.190> feel<00:01:22.090> like

130 rpms really able to feel like

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.480 
130 rpms really able to feel like
they're<00:01:22.450> an<00:01:22.540> efficient<00:01:23.050> pedal<00:01:23.320> stroke<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.830> big

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
they're an efficient pedal stroke a big

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.730 
they're an efficient pedal stroke a big
pro<00:01:24.700> that<00:01:24.909> most<00:01:25.090> people<00:01:25.450> go<00:01:25.659> towards<00:01:26.230> rollers

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
pro that most people go towards rollers

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.250 
pro that most people go towards rollers
is<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.220> feeling<00:01:27.730> of<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.300> road<00:01:28.540> so<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.080> gives

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
is the feeling of the road so it gives

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.170 
is the feeling of the road so it gives
you<00:01:29.409> a<00:01:29.440> side-to-side<00:01:29.950> motion<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.760> it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
you a side-to-side motion and it

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.980 
you a side-to-side motion and it
definitely<00:01:31.479> kind<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.659> gives<00:01:31.870> this

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
definitely kind of gives this

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.930 
definitely kind of gives this
oscillating<00:01:32.500> feel<00:01:32.770> on<00:01:32.890> your<00:01:33.010> hips<00:01:33.190> feels<00:01:33.670> more

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
oscillating feel on your hips feels more

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.850 
oscillating feel on your hips feels more
traditionally<00:01:34.840> like<00:01:35.140> you're<00:01:35.560> out<00:01:35.680> on<00:01:35.710> the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
traditionally like you're out on the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.200 
traditionally like you're out on the
road<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:38.020> leads<00:01:38.380> into<00:01:38.620> a<00:01:39.220> con<00:01:39.610> of<00:01:39.970> where

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
road but that leads into a con of where

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.719 
road but that leads into a con of where
I<00:01:40.390> thought<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:41.050> was<00:01:41.470> going<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:41.710> be<00:01:41.890> much<00:01:42.520> easier

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
I thought it was going to be much easier

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.660 
I thought it was going to be much easier
mentally<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.930> spin<00:01:44.560> an<00:01:44.710> hour<00:01:44.860> on<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> rollers

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
mentally to spin an hour on the rollers

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.520 
mentally to spin an hour on the rollers
because<00:01:46.150> it<00:01:46.450> felt<00:01:46.630> more<00:01:46.750> like<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.049> road<00:01:47.229> it's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
because it felt more like the road it's

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.980 
because it felt more like the road it's
not<00:01:47.770> it's<00:01:48.070> way<00:01:48.520> worse<00:01:48.790> than<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.690> trainer

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
not it's way worse than the trainer

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.750 
not it's way worse than the trainer
because<00:01:50.290> with<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.620> trainer<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:51.370> could<00:01:51.490> send

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
because with the trainer you could send

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.640 
because with the trainer you could send
emails<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.450> can<00:01:52.600> get<00:01:52.720> on<00:01:52.810> your<00:01:52.840> phone<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.470> can

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
emails you can get on your phone you can

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.920 
emails you can get on your phone you can
watch<00:01:54.520> TV<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.150> not<00:01:55.240> have<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.540> worry<00:01:55.780> about

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
watch TV and not have to worry about

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.750 
watch TV and not have to worry about
where<00:01:56.260> you're<00:01:56.409> going<00:01:56.770> with<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.400> rollers

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
where you're going with the rollers

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.000 
where you're going with the rollers
you're<00:01:58.570> pretty<00:01:58.810> much<00:01:58.960> constantly<00:01:59.440> staring<00:01:59.770> at

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
you're pretty much constantly staring at

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.590 
you're pretty much constantly staring at
your<00:02:00.100> front<00:02:00.310> wheel<00:02:00.490> making<00:02:01.060> sure<00:02:01.299> that<00:02:01.450> you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
your front wheel making sure that you

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.200 
your front wheel making sure that you
don't<00:02:01.750> fall<00:02:02.020> off<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:03.159> mean<00:02:03.850> I've<00:02:03.940> been<00:02:03.970> riding

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
don't fall off I mean I've been riding

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.570 
don't fall off I mean I've been riding
them<00:02:04.510> for<00:02:04.720> two<00:02:04.930> years<00:02:05.200> now<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.619> even<00:02:06.040> though<00:02:06.340> I

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
them for two years now and even though I

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.460 
them for two years now and even though I
feel<00:02:06.790> comfortable<00:02:07.510> sometimes<00:02:08.170> I'll<00:02:08.289> be

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
feel comfortable sometimes I'll be

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.990 
feel comfortable sometimes I'll be
watching<00:02:08.739> TV<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.459> just<00:02:09.670> kind<00:02:09.849> of<00:02:09.879> get

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
watching TV and I just kind of get

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.879 
watching TV and I just kind of get
distracted<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.719> then<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:11.560> know<00:02:11.650> I'm<00:02:11.709> hitting

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:11.889 
distracted and then you know I'm hitting

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.390 
distracted and then you know I'm hitting
the<00:02:12.040> side<00:02:12.219> so<00:02:12.730> definitely<00:02:13.299> con<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:14.400> it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
the side so definitely con is that it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.390 
the side so definitely con is that it
takes<00:02:15.700> you

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
takes you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.479 
takes you
a lot<00:02:17.269> of<00:02:17.299> mental<00:02:17.629> strength<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.470> sit<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
a lot of mental strength to sit on the

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.080 
a lot of mental strength to sit on the
rollers<00:02:19.849> for<00:02:20.090> an<00:02:20.180> hour<00:02:21.400> standing<00:02:22.400> sitting<00:02:22.640> you

know skidding out of the saddle is

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.520 
know skidding out of the saddle is
definitely<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.430> con<00:02:25.730> on<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.090> rollers<00:02:26.530> it's

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
definitely a con on the rollers it's

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.850 
definitely a con on the rollers it's
hard<00:02:28.099> to<00:02:28.340> do<00:02:28.549> you<00:02:29.390> can't<00:02:29.629> really<00:02:29.810> surge<00:02:30.170> see
