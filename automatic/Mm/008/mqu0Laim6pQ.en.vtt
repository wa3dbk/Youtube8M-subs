00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
dr. net at West Ham and that is just a

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.440 
dr. net at West Ham and that is just a
mentality<00:03:06.250> thing<00:03:06.520> that<00:03:06.640> we<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:06.760> lose<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.210> if

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
mentality thing that we just lose it if

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.640 
mentality thing that we just lose it if
something<00:03:07.720> like<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.110> think<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.350> was<00:03:08.530> their

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
something like I think that was their

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.640 
something like I think that was their
16th<00:03:09.190> point<00:03:09.580> from<00:03:09.910> losing<00:03:10.750> positions<00:03:11.230> like

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
16th point from losing positions like

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.830 
16th point from losing positions like
goals<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.490> last<00:03:12.670> 5-10<00:03:13.060> minutes<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.720> know

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
goals in the last 5-10 minutes you know

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.050 
goals in the last 5-10 minutes you know
so<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.440> is<00:03:14.500> disappointing<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.550> let's<00:03:15.760> click<00:03:15.880> on

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
so it is disappointing so let's click on

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.060 
so it is disappointing so let's click on
but<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.210> day<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.960> face<00:03:17.140> yesterday<00:03:17.620> yeah

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
but a day to face yesterday yeah

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.160 
but a day to face yesterday yeah
absolutely<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.700> think<00:03:18.820> Crystal<00:03:19.480> Palace<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.780> week

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
absolutely I think Crystal Palace a week

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.440 
absolutely I think Crystal Palace a week
insane<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.620> they<00:03:20.770> know<00:03:21.220> no<00:03:21.670> strikers<00:03:22.240> today

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
insane that they know no strikers today

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.230 
insane that they know no strikers today
effectively<00:03:23.380> out<00:03:23.530> there<00:03:23.740> I<00:03:23.920> think<00:03:24.700> we'll<00:03:25.030> see

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
effectively out there I think we'll see

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.610 
effectively out there I think we'll see
we're<00:03:25.540> trying<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.750> work<00:03:25.870> out<00:03:25.990> the<00:03:26.110> size<00:03:26.230> name

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
we're trying to work out the size name

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.500 
we're trying to work out the size name
meaning<00:03:27.040> meaning<00:03:27.370> they<00:03:27.550> need<00:03:27.730> any<00:03:28.060> any<00:03:28.270> we

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
meaning meaning they need any any we

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.930 
meaning meaning they need any any we
don't<00:03:28.630> know<00:03:29.220> we<00:03:30.220> expect<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.550> see<00:03:30.700> them<00:03:30.790> today

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
don't know we expect to see them today

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.580 
don't know we expect to see them today
but<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.360> think<00:03:31.630> we'll<00:03:31.750> go<00:03:31.870> for<00:03:32.050> a<00:03:32.080> solid<00:03:32.350> two<00:03:32.470> or

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
but I think we'll go for a solid two or

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.370 
but I think we'll go for a solid two or
three<00:03:32.770> nil<00:03:32.950> win<00:03:33.130> yeah<00:03:33.430> no<00:03:34.420> problem<00:03:34.630> no<00:03:35.020> free

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
three nil win yeah no problem no free

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.930 
three nil win yeah no problem no free
now<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:38.260> on<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.530> video<00:03:38.770> front<00:03:39.130> should<00:03:39.850> we

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
now so on the video front should we

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.940 
now so on the video front should we
expect<00:03:40.270> more<00:03:40.420> more<00:03:40.810> videos<00:03:41.230> from<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.590> getting

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
expect more more videos from you getting

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.199 
expect more more videos from you getting
the<00:03:42.040> same<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.250> manager<00:03:42.870> probably<00:03:43.870> not<00:03:44.910> but<00:03:45.910> we

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
the same a manager probably not but we

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.170 
the same a manager probably not but we
didn't<00:03:46.510> really<00:03:46.720> plan<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.260> happen<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:48.180> I

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
didn't really plan it to happen so I

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.420 
didn't really plan it to happen so I
suppose<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:50.290> know<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.410> think<00:03:50.920> we've<00:03:51.250> just
