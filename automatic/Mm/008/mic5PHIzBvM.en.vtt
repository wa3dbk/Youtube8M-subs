blanket<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.660> decided<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.680> make

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
blanket so I decided I was going to make

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.010 
blanket so I decided I was going to make
my<00:00:40.980> own<00:00:41.010> bending<00:00:41.579> iron<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
my own bending iron and like all the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.610 
my own bending iron and like all the
tools<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.559> make<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.879> goal<00:00:45.090> was<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:46.320> keep<00:00:46.500> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
tools I make the goal was to keep it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
tools I make the goal was to keep it
simple<00:00:46.680> keep<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.460> cheap<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.300> make<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.510> work

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
simple keep it cheap but make it work

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.990 
simple keep it cheap but make it work
and<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.190> achieved<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.760> those

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and I think I have achieved all those

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
and I think I have achieved all those
goals<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.930> tool<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:54.149> tube<00:00:55.010> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
goals with this tool the tube the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.360 
goals with this tool the tube the
bending<00:00:56.309> iron<00:00:56.460> itself<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:58.070> steel<00:00:59.070> pipe

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
bending iron itself is a steel pipe

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.779 
bending iron itself is a steel pipe
which<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.090> cut<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.500> leg<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.640> an

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
which I actually cut out of a leg for an

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.880 
which I actually cut out of a leg for an
old<00:01:02.969> retired<00:01:03.379> trampoline<00:01:04.379> that's<00:01:04.619> been

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
old retired trampoline that's been

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.880 
old retired trampoline that's been
sitting<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.430> backyard<00:01:06.409> it's<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
sitting in my backyard it's one and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.260 
sitting in my backyard it's one and
three-quarter<00:01:08.250> inches<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.549> diameter<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
three-quarter inches in diameter and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.880 
three-quarter inches in diameter and
about<00:01:09.360> eight<00:01:09.630> inches<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.020> length<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.680> think

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
about eight inches in length and I think

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500 
about eight inches in length and I think
that's<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> pretty<00:01:11.280> good<00:01:11.490> size<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> bending

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
that's a pretty good size for a bending

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.690 
that's a pretty good size for a bending
iron<00:01:14.210> next<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.770> stuffed<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.070> inside<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.610> the

notice the white blocks those are
actually<00:01:51.810> pieces<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.250> quarter-inch<00:01:53.850> thick

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
actually pieces of quarter-inch thick

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.770 
wood with Brad nails the reason for that
is<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.320> knew<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.579> use<00:02:02.790> wood<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.119> clamp<00:02:03.570> this

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
is I knew if I use wood to clamp this

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.770 
is I knew if I use wood to clamp this
tube<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.380> into<00:02:04.860> place<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:06.119> heat<00:02:06.390> from<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
tube and into place the heat from the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.940 
tube and into place the heat from the
tube<00:02:07.049> would<00:02:07.380> scorch<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.069> wood<00:02:08.959> Teflon<00:02:09.959> can

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
tube would scorch the wood Teflon can

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.990 
tube would scorch the wood Teflon can
withstand<00:02:11.220> pretty

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
withstand pretty

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.630 
withstand pretty
temperatures<00:02:12.480> usually<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:13.320> 450<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.130> 500

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
temperatures usually for 450 to 500

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.000 
temperatures usually for 450 to 500
degrees<00:02:15.170> which<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.320> more<00:02:16.530> than<00:02:16.710> what<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.920> need

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
degrees which is more than what I need

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.460 
degrees which is more than what I need
and<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.020> use<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.800> teflon<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:21.750> isolate<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and so I use the teflon to isolate the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.140 
and so I use the teflon to isolate the
heat<00:02:22.650> or<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.980> at<00:02:23.130> least<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.520> prevent<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> heat

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
heat or to at least to prevent the heat

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.370 
heat or to at least to prevent the heat
from<00:02:24.360> conducting<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.080> wood<00:02:25.230> and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
from conducting to the wood and

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.340 
from conducting to the wood and
scorching<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.950> wood<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:30.080> method<00:02:31.080> for

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
scorching the wood the method for

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.740 
scorching the wood the method for
heating<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.950> tube<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.520> can<00:02:33.060> actually<00:02:33.240> consider

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
heating the tube I can actually consider

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.780 
heating the tube I can actually consider
it<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.900> couple<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.260> techniques<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.980> thought

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
it a couple of techniques I thought

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.660 
it a couple of techniques I thought
about<00:02:35.910> using<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.690> blowtorch<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:38.640> heat<00:02:39.420> gun<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.670> I

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
about using a blowtorch a heat gun and I

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.340 
about using a blowtorch a heat gun and I
even<00:02:42.120> looked<00:02:42.300> at<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.450> electric<00:02:42.870> charcoal

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
even looked at a electric charcoal

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.990 
even looked at a electric charcoal
starter<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:43.950> they<00:02:44.040> don't<00:02:44.250> they're<00:02:44.610> too<00:02:44.790> big

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
starter but they don't they're too big

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.240 
starter but they don't they're too big
they<00:02:45.150> don't<00:02:45.300> fit<00:02:45.570> into<00:02:45.770> anything<00:02:46.770> smaller

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
they don't fit into anything smaller

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.960 
they don't fit into anything smaller
than<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.810> three<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.959> half<00:02:49.080> orange<00:02:49.350> -

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
than like a three and a half orange -

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.699 
than like a three and a half orange -
well<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.030> ended<00:02:51.150> up<00:02:51.390> going<00:02:51.570> with<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:52.170> cartridge

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
well I ended up going with a cartridge

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.460 
well I ended up going with a cartridge
heater<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.880> picked<00:02:54.510> up<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.810> cartridge<00:02:55.290> heater

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
heater I picked up this cartridge heater

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.860 
heater I picked up this cartridge heater
on<00:02:55.739> ebay<00:02:56.160> for<00:02:56.220> three<00:02:56.640> dollars<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.180> 70<00:02:57.600> cents

and that included free shipping came
from<00:03:00.239> China<00:03:00.680> they<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.860> lot<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.310> them<00:03:02.430> on

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
from China they have a lot of them on

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.660 
from China they have a lot of them on
eBay<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.620> there<00:03:04.620> are<00:03:04.709> all<00:03:04.860> different<00:03:04.890> shapes

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
eBay and there are all different shapes

so<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:08.850> tailor<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:10.200> cartridge

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
so you can really tailor a cartridge

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.140 
so you can really tailor a cartridge
heater<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.340> your<00:03:11.489> needs<00:03:12.410> this<00:03:13.410> heater<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.150> six

watts<00:03:22.680> now<00:03:23.070> 500<00:03:23.610> watts<00:03:23.820> is<00:03:24.299> pretty<00:03:24.720> potent<00:03:25.230> you

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
watts now 500 watts is pretty potent you

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.340 
watts now 500 watts is pretty potent you
could<00:03:26.310> probably<00:03:26.760> back<00:03:26.970> down<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.330> 150<00:03:28.140> and

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
could probably back down to 150 and

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.270 
could probably back down to 150 and
still<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:29.180> pretty<00:03:30.180> good<00:03:30.420> heater<00:03:31.220> if<00:03:32.220> you

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
still get a pretty good heater if you

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.150 
still get a pretty good heater if you
get<00:03:32.610> if<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.850> do<00:03:32.970> go<00:03:33.120> into<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.420> 500<00:03:34.019> watt<00:03:34.860> range

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
get if you do go into the 500 watt range

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.759 
get if you do go into the 500 watt range
it'll<00:03:35.820> heat<00:03:36.090> up<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.390> iron<00:03:36.420> super<00:03:37.170> fast<00:03:37.440> but

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
it'll heat up the iron super fast but

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.560 
it'll heat up the iron super fast but
you<00:03:37.950> need<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.280> have<00:03:38.430> some<00:03:38.790> way<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:39.000> control<00:03:39.420> the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
you need to have some way to control the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.240 
you need to have some way to control the
temperature<00:03:40.049> which<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.380> do<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.739> I'll<00:03:40.829> explain

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
temperature which I do and I'll explain

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.750 
temperature which I do and I'll explain
that<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.489> second<00:03:42.650> now<00:03:43.650> that's<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.130> reason<00:03:44.340> why

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
that a second now that's the reason why

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.080 
that a second now that's the reason why
I'm<00:03:45.150> using<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:46.380> aluminum<00:03:46.890> foil<00:03:47.220> inside<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
I'm using the aluminum foil inside the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.350 
I'm using the aluminum foil inside the
two<00:03:48.320> cartridge<00:03:49.320> heaters<00:03:50.060> don't<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.269> very

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
two cartridge heaters don't do a very

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.259 
two cartridge heaters don't do a very
good<00:03:51.630> job<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:52.079> radiating<00:03:52.920> heat<00:03:53.250> they<00:03:53.910> get<00:03:54.120> very

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
good job of radiating heat they get very

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.270 
good job of radiating heat they get very
very<00:03:54.390> hot<00:03:54.840> but<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.290> heat<00:03:55.500> doesn't<00:03:55.739> radiate

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
very hot but that heat doesn't radiate

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.920 
very hot but that heat doesn't radiate
so<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.700> have<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.060> find<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.420> way<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.570> get<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
so you have to find a way to get the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.110 
so you have to find a way to get the
heat<00:03:58.079> from<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.470> cartridge<00:03:58.860> out<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.610> to

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
heat from the cartridge out to the to

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.860 
heat from the cartridge out to the to
the<00:04:00.269> walls<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.959> tube<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:03.540> best<00:04:03.750> way

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
the walls of the tube and the best way

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.000 
the walls of the tube and the best way
to<00:04:03.900> do<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.320> is<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.680> conduct<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.450> I

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
to do that is to conduct it and I

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.110 
to do that is to conduct it and I
considered<00:04:08.010> using<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.670> know<00:04:08.730> filling<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
considered using you know filling the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.479 
considered using you know filling the
tube<00:04:09.269> with<00:04:09.420> sand<00:04:09.780> or<00:04:10.350> filling<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.860> with<00:04:10.890> BBS

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
tube with sand or filling it with BBS

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.090 
tube with sand or filling it with BBS
and<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:12.360> ended<00:04:12.600> up<00:04:12.690> settling<00:04:13.079> on<00:04:13.380> aluminum<00:04:13.829> foil

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
and I ended up settling on aluminum foil

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.039 
and I ended up settling on aluminum foil
because<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.850> much<00:04:15.329> more<00:04:15.540> efficient

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
because it's a much more efficient

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.780 
because it's a much more efficient
conductor<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.739> by<00:04:17.280> packing<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.570> can

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
conductor and by packing it in I can

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.910 
conductor and by packing it in I can
drill<00:04:20.420> a<00:04:20.450> hole<00:04:20.690> it's<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.080> same<00:04:21.320> diameter<00:04:21.680> as

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
drill a hole it's the same diameter as

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.440 
drill a hole it's the same diameter as
the<00:04:22.040> cartridge<00:04:22.670> and<00:04:22.850> then<00:04:22.970> slide<00:04:23.270> the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
the cartridge and then slide the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.990 
the cartridge and then slide the
cartridge<00:04:23.840> in<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.200> that's<00:04:24.320> what<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.560> did

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
cartridge in and that's what I did

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.870 
cartridge in and that's what I did
there's<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.060> 5/16<00:04:26.900> inch<00:04:27.080> hole<00:04:27.290> drilled<00:04:27.880> six

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
there's a 5/16 inch hole drilled six

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.090 
there's a 5/16 inch hole drilled six
inches<00:04:29.180> into<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.630> tube<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.860> allowed<00:04:31.070> me

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
inches into the tube and that allowed me

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.840 
inches into the tube and that allowed me
to<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.790> slide<00:04:32.090> that<00:04:32.360> cartridge<00:04:32.870> in<00:04:33.050> there<00:04:33.850> now

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
to to slide that cartridge in there now

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.850 
to to slide that cartridge in there now
the<00:04:34.910> lead<00:04:35.540> wires<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:36.170> connect<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.680> back

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
the lead wires that connect to the back

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.100 
the lead wires that connect to the back
of<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.190> cartridge<00:04:37.580> are<00:04:37.940> it's<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:38.870> fairly

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
of the cartridge are it's a fairly

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.540 
of the cartridge are it's a fairly
fragile<00:04:39.440> connection<00:04:40.160> so<00:04:40.490> I<00:04:41.360> took<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:42.550> washer

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
fragile connection so I took a washer

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.540 
fragile connection so I took a washer
which<00:04:44.330> is<00:04:44.480> actually<00:04:45.020> a<00:04:45.320> crimping<00:04:45.980> washer<00:04:46.370> from

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
which is actually a crimping washer from

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.860 
which is actually a crimping washer from
a<00:04:46.640> buffing<00:04:47.000> wheel<00:04:47.150> I've<00:04:47.330> got<00:04:47.450> a<00:04:47.480> bunch<00:04:47.780> of

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
a buffing wheel I've got a bunch of

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.750 
a buffing wheel I've got a bunch of
those<00:04:47.990> laying<00:04:48.260> around<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:49.190> stuck<00:04:49.580> that

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
those laying around and I stuck that

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.120 
those laying around and I stuck that
inside<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.300> tube<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:51.020> then<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:51.620> took<00:04:51.740> one<00:04:52.100> of

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
inside the tube and then I took one of

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.070 
inside the tube and then I took one of
these<00:04:52.340> wall<00:04:53.330> protecting<00:04:54.050> door<00:04:54.500> spring

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
these wall protecting door spring

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.290 
these wall protecting door spring
dealies<00:04:57.080> cut<00:04:57.980> it<00:04:58.100> shorter<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.580> slipped<00:04:59.090> it<00:04:59.210> on

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
dealies cut it shorter and slipped it on

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.220 
dealies cut it shorter and slipped it on
so<00:04:59.750> that<00:04:59.900> kind<00:05:00.170> of<00:05:00.230> protects<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.960> wire

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
so that kind of protects the the wire

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.420 
so that kind of protects the the wire
leads<00:05:03.560> where<00:05:03.860> they<00:05:03.950> connect<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.400> the

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
leads where they connect to the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.200 
leads where they connect to the
cartridge<00:05:04.850> heater<00:05:05.050> then<00:05:06.050> I<00:05:06.080> wired<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.970> leads

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
cartridge heater then I wired the leads

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.520 
cartridge heater then I wired the leads
up<00:05:08.600> to<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:09.310> black<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.580> white<00:05:10.990> leads<00:05:11.990> of<00:05:12.320> a

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
up to the black and white leads of a

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.680 
up to the black and white leads of a
three<00:05:12.770> prong<00:05:13.070> plug<00:05:13.430> which<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.090> clipped<00:05:14.330> off<00:05:14.480> of

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
three prong plug which I clipped off of

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.520 
three prong plug which I clipped off of
an<00:05:14.810> old<00:05:14.960> computer<00:05:15.440> monitor<00:05:15.980> and<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:17.780> took<00:05:18.350> the

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
an old computer monitor and I took the

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.820 
an old computer monitor and I took the
ground<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.880> green<00:05:20.120> ground<00:05:20.510> wire<00:05:21.170> and<00:05:21.560> ran

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
ground the green ground wire and ran

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.460 
ground the green ground wire and ran
that<00:05:22.070> up<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.520> that's<00:05:23.270> screwed<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.140> bottom

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
that up and that's screwed to the bottom

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.990 
that up and that's screwed to the bottom
of<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.680> tube<00:05:24.980> and<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:27.800> grounds<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.760> tube

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
of the tube and that grounds the tube

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.840 
of the tube and that grounds the tube
because<00:05:29.240> I<00:05:29.480> wanted<00:05:29.810> I<00:05:30.080> was<00:05:31.040> concerned<00:05:31.550> that<00:05:31.670> if

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
because I wanted I was concerned that if

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.510 
because I wanted I was concerned that if
I<00:05:31.970> was<00:05:32.150> touching<00:05:32.570> the<00:05:33.070> temperature<00:05:34.070> control

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
I was touching the temperature control

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.610 
I was touching the temperature control
and<00:05:34.550> then<00:05:35.030> happened<00:05:35.450> to<00:05:35.510> touch<00:05:35.720> the<00:05:35.990> tube<00:05:36.440> at

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
and then happened to touch the tube at

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.320 
and then happened to touch the tube at
the<00:05:36.710> same<00:05:36.920> time<00:05:37.160> I'd<00:05:37.340> get<00:05:37.490> electrocuted

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
the same time I'd get electrocuted

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.410 
the same time I'd get electrocuted
so<00:05:38.960> I<00:05:38.990> grounded<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:40.430> tube<00:05:40.640> for<00:05:41.060> safety

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
so I grounded the the tube for safety

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.950 
so I grounded the the tube for safety
reasons

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
reasons

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.090 
reasons
then<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.620> plug<00:05:42.920> itself<00:05:44.050> plugs<00:05:45.050> into<00:05:45.350> my

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
then the plug itself plugs into my

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.920 
then the plug itself plugs into my
trusty<00:05:48.700> router<00:05:49.700> speed<00:05:50.180> control<00:05:50.690> that<00:05:50.900> I

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
trusty router speed control that I

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.340 
trusty router speed control that I
picked<00:05:51.260> up<00:05:51.380> for<00:05:51.560> 20<00:05:51.890> bucks<00:05:52.040> years<00:05:52.520> ago<00:05:52.820> I<00:05:53.690> think

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
picked up for 20 bucks years ago I think

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.910 
picked up for 20 bucks years ago I think
I<00:05:54.410> got<00:05:54.560> it<00:05:54.650> from<00:05:54.710> Harbor<00:05:55.070> Freight<00:05:55.100> and<00:05:56.920> this

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
I got it from Harbor Freight and this

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.610 
I got it from Harbor Freight and this
thing<00:05:58.160> works<00:05:58.370> great<00:05:58.700> I<00:05:59.300> just<00:05:59.870> have<00:06:00.110> to<00:06:00.260> switch

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
thing works great I just have to switch

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.130 
thing works great I just have to switch
it<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:00.830> variable<00:06:01.640> and<00:06:01.850> then<00:06:02.150> I<00:06:02.180> can<00:06:02.450> use<00:06:02.480> the

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
it to variable and then I can use the

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.980 
it to variable and then I can use the
knob<00:06:03.350> to<00:06:03.890> adjust<00:06:04.010> temperature<00:06:04.580> and<00:06:05.090> because

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
knob to adjust temperature and because

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.530 
knob to adjust temperature and because
it's<00:06:06.290> a<00:06:06.380> 500<00:06:06.950> watt<00:06:08.050> heater<00:06:09.050> I<00:06:09.940> can<00:06:10.940> keep<00:06:11.360> the

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
it's a 500 watt heater I can keep the

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.390 
it's a 500 watt heater I can keep the
temperature<00:06:12.020> down<00:06:12.050> pretty<00:06:12.620> low<00:06:12.890> and<00:06:13.160> still

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
temperature down pretty low and still
