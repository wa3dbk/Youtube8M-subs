weeks<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.210> don't<00:00:36.660> know<00:00:36.980> when<00:00:37.980> it'll<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.629> and

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
weeks I don't know when it'll be and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.860 
weeks I don't know when it'll be and
nobody's<00:00:41.250> cleaner<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.090> more<00:00:42.239> eager<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> fly

nobody's cleaner and more eager to fly
than<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.230> are

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
than we are

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.389 
than we are
so<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.640> think<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.149> think<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.039> rely

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
so I think I think you just have to rely

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.340 
so I think I think you just have to rely
that<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.270> soon<00:00:48.450> as<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.719> feel<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that as soon as we feel that in the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.840 
that as soon as we feel that in the
airplanes<00:00:49.620> ready<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.950> will<00:00:50.070> fly<00:00:52.309> in<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.579> time

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
airplanes ready we will fly in that time

airplanes ready we will fly in that time
these<00:00:54.570> guys<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:54.899> test<00:00:55.350> flow<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.620> everything

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129

everything is working by April the 8th
the<00:02:38.500> team<00:02:38.950> are<00:02:39.130> ready<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.519> test<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.910> engines

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
the team are ready to test the engines

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.740 
the team are ready to test the engines
we<00:02:41.860> start<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.250> engines<00:02:42.610> there's<00:02:43.180> there's<00:02:43.569> one

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
we start the engines there's there's one

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.280 
we start the engines there's there's one
ignition<00:02:44.019> which<00:02:44.319> is<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.620> one<00:02:44.769> for<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:45.099> APU

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
ignition which is that one for the APU

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.710 
ignition which is that one for the APU
then<00:02:47.290> we<00:02:47.440> start<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.769> engine<00:02:47.950> number<00:02:48.190> one

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
then we start the engine number one
