00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.569
 Euro 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:17.659
 also 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.919
 now it is only the bullet that needs this ball 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.189
 April has beaten 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.109
 and Dieter Wehe, who paints in Photoshop tender 30-year-old harmfully too 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.780
 could 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.919
 But then they would rather have as a subject 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.960
 we will need a 3-d object for this 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.980
 There are basically two options, one is 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.890
 Building an object in to a deduction might even change a room 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.630
 the other option would be to use a photo show per click but there 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.130
 Unfortunately we can not come up with Photoshop with such a nice ball 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.940
 therefor 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.050
 go in the team Amore 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.070
 depending on whether they have idea of ​​senses or do not need them 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.140
 at all this tutorial or just not 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.900
 if you have not got any Anna of Cinema scratch the first open drive 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.290
 Do not shy away from that Do not look at it is not 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.960
 It's really hard what we do here 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.520
 and I'll try it 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.740
 good as possible 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.910
 to explain 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.120
 we will become them 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.860
 Cinema a three-dimensional 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.260
 Construct the body of the Stumph to find from the top 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.969
 it will be able to do so for the first time with one 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.489
 yes, so-called working in it which is nothing else to go on the ride 

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:24.630
 they also know photoshop of course 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.980
 glued on it 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.850
 I get four views and of these animals I use those here 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.420
 Kickers back out here I now have the view towards the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.340
 z-axis 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.700
 because I want to get around this twisted axis 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.260
 Object, so to speak, turn on nature for Schalke 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.820
 So that the program knows in which directions where I like to turn 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.380
 We would like to create this small investor for this part 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.980
 and we get that here 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.470
 b stay it and l what do you see after the bite is also speaking 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.730
 Do you want to speak English or prefer 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.070
 German-French 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.229
 and that band, as I said, did nothing else than play 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.750
 the so to speak 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.100
 one half of the profile of our balls and I draw attempts so 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.569
 to set a point as close as possible to the middle axis 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.089
 It certainly does not have to be that either still corrected 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.649
 I think a square ahead of our goal the next point at least 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:17.789
 approximately 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.859
 three squares upwards 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.809
 Eater three and a half 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.319
 about two square jackets continue on goal but already like 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.660
 usually too 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.059
 2 1 or father pulls Nater 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.059
 so and the last forty about at this point 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.169
 the last Milster though 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.599
 so be that the tangents and relatively just there 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.039
 whether this is the case or not 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.519
 we'll see you soon 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.790
 the structures 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.960
 when editing 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.650
 used the soft interpolation and then you see that they are tangent unfortunately 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.650
 are not aligned with fair but are aligned obliquely 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:00.559
 If you press the button 2 then you can if you want to feat here more 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.409
 To zoom in, you now enter the keys 1 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.399
 you can drive the whole picture down 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.969
 and now it's easy to grab these seared ones 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.909
 align the whole range 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.280
 then I pull the point a little bit upwards so that suits the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.319
 not so endure stage 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.069
 Of course, these icons can also use Suhl to get out of mine 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.749
 image 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:25.959
 Make sure that here too a soft Napola Sion arises because of the 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.799
 Interpolation replaces the behavior of this point if it is a vertex 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.229
 or in curves point it is unfavorable at the moment you would kink 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:34.559
 to get 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.989
 again, structure planners work 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.129
 Going back the pole loses you can see that it has become louder now 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.459
 So I've sort of boiled down to that corner point 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.449
 that's the first part of it 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.650
 at the hearth defines the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.059
 the ball should look like 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.509
 Now you have to make sure that it is also built exactly to that I have 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.989
 here already opened the structure of my door 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.939
 The structural change killed every point in what value the Colin old system 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:01.360
 Has 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.230
 and I'm going to type this front top dot on the EBIT i get the 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.499
 Highlight would have seen 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:09.739
 that we have a look worth of Pauline Strike on a 4 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.999
 but if I want my ball to be targeted and defensive around 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.549
 I do not need zero value from zero so just this 0 yes because 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:19.359
 and have with it 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.749
 this point placed exactly on the EBS Lotte 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.740
 I push the button 1 more formal piece down 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.479
 Beijing this point years ago 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.219
 These points below have exactly the same value as 0 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.419
 that is also necessary with foam you have the line still on 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.180
 which has a value of +0 3% 8 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.940
 that's a principle okay but it should definitely be the same type 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.280
 their value here as both have this point at the same height 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.389
 lying behind getting a nice flat plate ball 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.069
 so that the noble value are the same in any case, we must soon 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.699
 to the other, or vice versa, as I'll just do it that way 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.129
 Think of it goals and now you can see that here we are an absolute 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.270
 have flaps graduation 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.580
 Now I can go back to our perspective view 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.169
 and if we move around it now 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.650
 for example through 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.169
 this symbol Lia 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.689
 then you see that our speed is actually 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.650
 in a three-dimensional space so to speak 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.139
 Reason in this case one can be treated in Aarau and now what 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.500
 should we do so that we want 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.520
 that of the plan andrologist becomes 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.830
 and that's why they're going back to objects manager he's just the one at the moment 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.840
 small objects and if I want to make that into a volume 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.020
 baptized this menu 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.210
 if i am on this 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.660
 Ax up there go up 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.080
 this one serves which and bicycles that together leave a so-called 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.270
 the team stays open 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.270
 and we can still look at what he needs from here 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.990
 Blum's icon is just as right because that 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.770
 Int does not talk about what you do on a structure-borne sound 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.550
 always so we have a so-called here 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.550
 Plate only Abs now I can do it again 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:56.690
 This will lead you to be taken care of 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.100
 the 2 1 small is turned around its doors axis as soon as the little animal 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.999
 simply being pulled in » 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:05.479
 says ball finished 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.919
 this ball is supposed to be natural 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.229
 Question right and do not look vertically upwards 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.159
 so us-masters would have to click on Side 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.069
 I could go for a split but thanks to Kommer right away 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.990
 s click now and complete with this tool here 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.839
 and hold down the shift key 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.089
 Remo a little bit 

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:28.180
 with pressed shift button in a 90 degrees 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.589
 To bring spelled 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.999
 pressed shift button to see that I here exactly 90 years rich 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:36.879
 and this thing is actually perfectly horizontal should it be our coal 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:39.589
 covered for the first time what is needed now 

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:40.919
 and material 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:41.949
 but there you come right to it
