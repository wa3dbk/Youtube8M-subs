lineman's<00:01:35.939> hat<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.240> front<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.540> my<00:01:36.630> right<00:01:36.869> okay

lineman's hat in front of my right okay
now<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> guess<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.759> where<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
now I guess this is where this is the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.910 
now I guess this is where this is the
the<00:01:39.750> cat<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.200> mouse<00:01:40.290> from<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> chess<00:01:40.890> game

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the cat and mouse from the chess game

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160 
the cat and mouse from the chess game
with<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.570> angles<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:42.720> everything<00:01:42.930> in

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
with this angles are everything in

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.050 
with this angles are everything in
football<00:01:43.500> especially<00:01:43.710> when<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.610> smaller

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
football especially when it a smaller

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.240 
football especially when it a smaller
guys<00:01:45.329> go<00:01:45.540> against<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.960> bigger<00:01:46.140> guy<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:46.619> all

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
guys go against a bigger guy now all

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.950 
guys go against a bigger guy now all
things<00:01:47.520> aside<00:01:47.640> we're<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.180> short<00:01:48.479> area<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
things aside we're in a short area the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.440 
things aside we're in a short area the
athleticism<00:01:49.439> component<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.119> tightened

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
athleticism component can get tightened

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.179 
athleticism component can get tightened
down<00:01:51.509> especially<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.350> he<00:01:52.439> takes<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.799> good<00:01:52.979> angle

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
down especially if he takes a good angle

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.149 
down especially if he takes a good angle
so<00:01:53.579> what<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.270> want<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:55.020> especially<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
so what I want to do especially in the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.920 
so what I want to do especially in the
case<00:01:56.369> where<00:01:56.610> he<00:01:56.729> has<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.270> free<00:01:57.540> rein<00:01:57.750> he's

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
case where he has a free rein he's

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.990 
case where he has a free rein he's
coming<00:01:58.259> at<00:01:58.380> me<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.710> want<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> make<00:01:59.430> sure<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.670> can

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
coming at me I want to make sure I can

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.319 
coming at me I want to make sure I can
get<00:02:00.180> flat<00:02:00.600> first<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.100> take<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> step<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:03.000> guess

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
get flat first if I take a step up guess

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.209 
get flat first if I take a step up guess
what<00:02:03.600> you're<00:02:04.229> gonna<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.560> having<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.860> play<00:02:05.100> off

this bunt and you've had to be Superman

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.650 
this bunt and you've had to be Superman
exactly<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.770> able<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.950> get<00:02:08.129> at<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.250> ball

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
exactly to be able to get at that ball

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.010 
exactly to be able to get at that ball
so<00:02:09.660> many<00:02:09.869> times<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.259> want<00:02:10.410> to

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
so many times you want to

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.620 
so many times you want to
attacks<00:02:11.800> guys<00:02:12.310> we've<00:02:12.880> got<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.090> get<00:02:13.300> flat<00:02:13.600> a

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
attacks guys we've got to get flat a

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.870 
attacks guys we've got to get flat a
little<00:02:13.990> bit<00:02:14.110> before<00:02:14.290> we<00:02:14.860> can<00:02:15.250> get<00:02:15.370> downhill

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
little bit before we can get downhill

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.650 
little bit before we can get downhill
now

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
now

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.050 
now
I<00:02:16.690> think<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.560> obviously<00:02:18.060> biggest

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I think the obviously biggest

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.450 
I think the obviously biggest
application<00:02:19.750> would<00:02:19.840> be<00:02:19.900> keep<00:02:20.500> your<00:02:20.710> depth<00:02:20.950> we

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
application would be keep your depth we

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.280 
application would be keep your depth we
get<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:21.820> excited<00:02:21.850> its<00:02:22.540> third<00:02:22.750> one<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.200> we'll

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
get so excited its third one and we'll

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.180 
get so excited its third one and we'll
make<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.560> big<00:02:23.800> hit

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
make a big hit

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.980 
make a big hit
I'm<00:02:24.490> at<00:02:24.670> three<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.000> half<00:02:25.150> yards<00:02:25.570> good<00:02:25.780> luck

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
I'm at three and a half yards good luck

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.930 
I'm at three and a half yards good luck
getting<00:02:26.320> around<00:02:26.560> him<00:02:26.800> at<00:02:27.280> three<00:02:27.520> half<00:02:27.700> guys

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
getting around him at three half guys

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.770 
stay at five and a half how much of that
is<00:02:38.560> about<00:02:39.010> as<00:02:39.520> far<00:02:39.550> as<00:02:39.790> disability<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.480> yak

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
is about as far as disability to yak

with idea my line back is doing this
flash<00:04:09.490> for<00:04:10.120> me<00:04:10.420> would<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.020> make<00:04:11.170> me<00:04:11.470> do<00:04:11.710> and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
flash for me would it make me do and

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.730

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
angles and I see you taking a little

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.420 
angles and I see you taking a little
baby<00:04:18.459> step<00:04:18.640> forward<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.360> do<00:04:20.170> this<00:04:20.470> once<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.370> do

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
baby step forward I do this once I do

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.770 
baby step forward I do this once I do
this<00:04:21.790> it's<00:04:22.690> around<00:04:22.960> do<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:23.950> especially<00:04:24.940> when

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
this it's around do it especially when

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.660 
this it's around do it especially when
you<00:04:25.840> have<00:04:26.080> step<00:04:26.410> it<00:04:27.070> makes<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.400> even<00:04:27.460> more

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
you have step it makes it even more

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.850 
you have step it makes it even more
difficult<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.390> make<00:04:28.840> up<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:29.110> ground<00:04:29.320> because

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
difficult to make up that ground because

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.560 
difficult to make up that ground because
the<00:04:29.950> angle<00:04:30.250> at<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.400> point<00:04:30.760> is<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.360> much

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
the angle at that point is so much

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.840 
the angle at that point is so much
greater<00:04:31.870> but<00:04:32.320> if<00:04:32.410> you're<00:04:32.590> close<00:04:32.980> to<00:04:33.250> me<00:04:33.460> so

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
greater but if you're close to me so

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.930 
greater but if you're close to me so
still<00:04:34.120> gate<00:04:34.300> it's<00:04:34.560> $3<00:04:35.560> hey<00:04:36.130> I'm<00:04:36.310> here<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.790> you
