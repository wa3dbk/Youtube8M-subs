00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 the fresh lemons are great in 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.020
 sweet and salty dishes so today I'm going 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.780
 to talk about lemons how to choose the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.090
 and how to use them I am your samba amen 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.009
 registered artist and I love the use 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.470
 of fresh lemons because they are very 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.840
 versatile I can use them in dishes 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.910
 sweet in salty dishes I can use the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.710
 juice and you can use the peel 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.990
 when you go to the market and you are 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.029
 looking for your lemons there are two things that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.070
 wants to do one of them is that he wants 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.710
 pick it up and make sure your lemon 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.899
 it feels heavy for its size is a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.940
 good indication that you will have enough 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.550
 juice inside it the other thing is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.829
 look at the shell should be soft and not 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.379
 must have wrinkles once it reaches 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.149
 house put your lemon on the cabinet 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.370
 to stay cool during 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.050
 about a week if it's going to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.390
 need it for a longer time 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.399
 keep it in the refrigerator the lemons 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.379
 they are interesting because the juice has the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.690
 vitamin c that acts as a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.789
 antioxidant and the shell has the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.550
 lemon oil in it that gives you a 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.320
 very intense taste and that is the reason why 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.190
 the one that sometimes your recipes will call 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.860
 both of them 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.290
 then how to peel your lemon there 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.120
 different ways of doing this sometimes 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.190
 just use a grater 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.320
 box because my grater here has the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.360
 very small holes I can only 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.280
 take this lemon and I can only start 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.080
 to grate the holes in my 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.540
 Grater can scratch your lemon 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.520
 directly on your vegetables you can 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 put a fruit salad in a 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.900
 green salad can be put on the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.510
 fish or chicken can be scratched on a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.820
 protein shake there are all kinds of 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.640
 things that you can do so 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.980
 the grater works very well if you want 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.530
 get a little more luxury you can 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.870
 buying something called a tester is 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 a great tool and if you look at it 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.400
 very carefully you will see that it has 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.160
 little holes in it those are the 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.050
 small cutters and when it is used 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.600
 cester a lemon in it only for the 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.790
 surface of your lemon well and you can see 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.220
 I'm going to get these little curls 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.020
 perfect lemon peel but these 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.630
 they are nice because if you are going to add 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.090
 these let's say to a drink or you can use it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.800
 as an ornament and it's an easy way to 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.170
 get only perfect curls 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.180
 if you do not have one of those the other 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.520
 What you can do is that you can take 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.470
 a regular vegetable peeler and can 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.300
 peel large slices as well as what 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.730
 I would do like anything else now 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.320
 this is a pretty big piece but 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.600
 so what you can do is 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.180
 just take a knife and you can 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.550
 cut into strips more girls is much 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.530
 work but if you do not use the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.420
 this lemon peel 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.550
 it will probably be an easy thing to 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.590
 do now we have peeled our lemon 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.870
 suppose that our recipe also 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.060
 ask us to use the juice first thing 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.400
 wants to ensure is to get the most out of 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.410
 juice of your lemon there are a couple of things that 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.270
 can do one of them is that you 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.030
 You can put it in the microwave during 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.880
 10 or 15 seconds this is lemon says a 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.920
 little softens the cells the inside the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.930
 another easy thing to do is take the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.970
 lemon and take your hands and surround it 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.920
 around the cutting board what 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.900
 I'm doing again is that I'm 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.660
 breaking some cells inside 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.160
 to get more juice is likely not 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.260
 He wants to do what my grandmother used to do 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.480
 do put it on the ground and surrounded it 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.810
 with the foot but if it worked very well 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.250
 so now that I shot my 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.680
 and now all I'm going to do for 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.540
 course is to cut it in half there is a 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.150
 couple of different ways to get 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.130
 the juice of your lemon if you feel strong 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.770
 you can take the lemon half in your hand 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.840
 and can tighten very hard hold the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.450
 another hand below to catch some of 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.940
 the seeds that is a very easy way 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.190
 to do it if you feel that you need 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.990
 more instruments if you want 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.480
 find some other ways to 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.760
 do it there are lemon squeezers 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.160
 special where you take the lemon where 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.190
 It is put on the juicer and rubbed 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.920
 well and get the juice my preference is 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.390
 use this instrument I find that 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.970
 for me it works well 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.459
 I hold the lemon in one hand and hold 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.530
 the juicer the other hand what I 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.069
 I do is put a strainer to cover the 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.870
 seeds and ended up pushing like that what I 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.870
 like this is that I really can 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.280
 push to the max and give me all this and a 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.530
 little juice of the pulp 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.930
 you can see that I cleaned a lot 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.540
 well then I have that nice juice of 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.760
 lemon is very good in adobo because the 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.280
 acid in the lemon juice will help 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.440
 soften the meat and the chicken so it's 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.540
 a good utility is also 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.370
 wonderful in salad dressings 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.800
 so instead of using vinegar in your 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.689
 seasoning you can use the lemon there 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.059
 another trick that you can try 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.429
 is to try to put the lemon juice in 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:47.619
 the rice while cooking keeps the 

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:50.349
 beads without sticking together so 

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:52.689
 it works really well and the other thing 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.579
 is that you have vitamin C you can put 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.589
 on top of things like 

00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:59.019
 fruit salad to avoid your 

00:04:56.589 --> 00:05:00.759
 maturation is why people 

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:03.159
 puts in the avocado for the guacamole 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.529
 I also like to put lemon juice 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:08.169
 in the drinks I like to put in my 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:10.179
 protein shakes put it emits and I 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.309
 like to add it in my water or my water 

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:14.769
 mineral alone to get a good shot 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:17.110
 fresh lemon the last thing that is 

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:19.869
 great is that if you add it to things like 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.329
 soups or stews or the curry in the last 

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:24.579
 moment since it only adds this small 

00:05:22.329 --> 00:05:26.589
 bright explosion of flavor at the end what 

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:28.959
 that really makes a big difference 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:30.699
 on his final plate so I hope he gets 

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:34.499
 have inspired to try to use a 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.499
 little lemon in new ways
