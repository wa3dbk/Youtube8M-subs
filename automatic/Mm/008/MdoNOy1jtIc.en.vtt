00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:59.100
 down the shoe says 2006 bands 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.100

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.409
 and the purple color 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.920
 now we go with the attribution of the 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:34.450

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.580
 Next comes the helmet and above 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.080
 one of the arms is the front part 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.080
 the legs that are here 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.989

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:06.420
 the shadows are up here 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.600
 that is the whole distribution of the base 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:14.310

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.620

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:24.120
 It is very showy when we are spinning 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.120

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.080
