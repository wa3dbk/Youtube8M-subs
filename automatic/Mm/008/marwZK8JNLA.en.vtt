it's<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> weird<00:01:48.479> how<00:01:48.600> they<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.110> but

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
it's kind of weird how they do it but

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.530 
it's kind of weird how they do it but
it's<00:01:49.409> easy<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> install<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.210> makes<00:01:51.390> a

it's easy to install and it makes a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.819 
it's easy to install and it makes a
significant<00:01:52.200> difference<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.790> power<00:01:54.829> one
