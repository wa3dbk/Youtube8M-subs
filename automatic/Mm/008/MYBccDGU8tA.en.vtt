00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.330
 very good to all welcome to the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.049
 part 2 of chapter 5 of addons of the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.049
 world I study 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.719
 yes 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.189
 as I said in part 1 in this 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.590
 chapter we are learning to use 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.200
 2 to 2 the two most important of the 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.470
 economy category and course action 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.470
 dot com 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.310
 in part 1 the previous video 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.070
 We explain how to use the functions 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.840
 most important of the addon operated in 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.370
 this video we will learn to use the 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.790
 most important functions of the two 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.380
 options 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.150
 If you have not visited the previous one 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.500
 I advise you video you do it because 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.910
 explains the functions of the donation 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.260
 Ador that we will come in handy for 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.400
 Keep a good rhythm in the house of 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.200
 auctions 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.000
 now if we take strong because with this 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.070
 video we are going to learn how to earn a lot 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.220
 gold through the auction house we go 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.220
 there 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.780
 get the result that allows us 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.479
 conduct market of 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.100
 with it 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.750
 we can have more or less controlled 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.700
 all prices of all objects 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.390
 of the auction house or at least of the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.390
 more traded 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.670
 on the national side we find options 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.619
 very complex to carry out the studies 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.689
 of market the function that we are going to 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.100
 learn today is buying buy back 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.679
 objects wants to sell them at a price 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.060
 greater than they were is a very 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.310
 powerful to get big 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.689
 amounts of gold in a short time but not 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.369
 The only one 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.329
 so without hesitation I will explain 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.329
 how to use this function 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.950
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.509
 scan the auction house to know 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.549
 all the items that are auctioned 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.439
 at that time for it we will go to the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.990
 consult and click tab we will do the 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.700
 scanner this process can last several 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.319
 minutes especially if it's the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.319
 first time we do the scanner 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.070
 Once the scan is complete we will be 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.710
 ready to use the functions that 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.750
 our 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.370
 in this video as disguises we are going to 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.020
 learn to use the ruiz function 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.790
 sail buyback 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.980
 It is a very simple function to use 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.720
 but at the same time very powerful to get 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.720
 large amounts of gold in a short time 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.460
 the first thing we have to make a 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.350
 once the scan of the auction has been completed 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.540
 would be to go to the search or tab 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.160
 in the search search tab 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.810
 we found multiple options 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.140
 search for the objects of the house of 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.140
 auction 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.690
 we will apply the bevel and it will appear 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.640
 automatically a new page with 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.200
 multiple new options like the minimum 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.400
 discount we want or the price 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.400
 maximum repurchase 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.550
 once the options for 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.540
 search that we want we will apply in 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.540
 this case 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.480
 Once the search was completed, we were 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.980
 will appear lots of objects that 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.400
 we can sort by price 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.770
 purchases at a bid price or even your 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.420
 pt and profit to enough new ones that 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.100
 brings us this very important addon for 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.080
 the sale and what happened explained 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.270
 now 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.790
 the pct is a kind of discount 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.260
 hidden applied to an object what this 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.300
 tells us is that the object in question 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.090
 is at a lower price than it could 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.980
 sometimes bought the players of 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.570
 world of warcraft place objects in the 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.580
 auction at a much lower price than 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.770
 it could be bought we can 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.300
 take advantage of it by buying your object and 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.100
 relocating in the house of 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.140
 auctions at the maximum price that could 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.180
 bought and in this way resell the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.690
 objects double or triple gold at 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.240
 that we had bought it 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.340
 the profit is the maximum price of gold that 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.560
 an object was sold if we met 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.850
 before an object whose profit is greater than 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.650
 the purchase price at that time 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.080
 we can buy it and resell it to 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.910
 own price however the price 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.650
 of profit many times will rub 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.570
 the absurd since it will represent values 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.830
 well above normal here is 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.510
 where our experience in the 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.100
 auction house as we have 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.810
 to know that the price of the profit is 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.160
 suitable for the object or if by 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.160
 otherwise it is too high 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.060
 knowing this we will just have to start 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.130
 to find the objects for the 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.020
 buying and selling by looking at both the pct 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.700
 like the profit and the looking for those 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.300
 objects of which we are going to obtain 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.300
 a greater benefit 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.720
 finished our walk through the auction 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.270
 we will arrange to collect all the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.190
 objects that we have bought for 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.810
 Collect all objects in the mailbox is 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.550
 advisable to use the postal add-on 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.260
 since simply by hitting the button 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.850
 collect all the add-on will take care of 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.560
 go opening all the messages and 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.060
 collecting all the objects without having 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.170
 We have to click on each of 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.170
 they keep giving him to pick up 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.430
 finally we will only have to go back to the 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.100
 auction house and put on sale all 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.360
 the objects that we have bought as I have 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.770
 said before if you have not visited the 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.330
 previous video I recommend you what 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.770
 do since you explained the functions of the 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.390
 donation to thor that will come in handy 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.750
 to keep a good rhythm in the house of 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.750
 auctions 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.499
 we will only have to wait for fresh cando 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.919
 until our auctions are 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.919
 bought 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:53.259
 Well, here ends part 2 of the 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:55.539
 chapter 5 of the series to gift second 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.339
 point to discover I hope this 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.080
