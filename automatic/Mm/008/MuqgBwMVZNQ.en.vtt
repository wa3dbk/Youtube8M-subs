the years um we've realized the lack of
limitations<00:00:55.350> which<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:55.860> fun<00:00:55.949> like

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
limitations which is really fun like

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.180 
limitations which is really fun like

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.200 
can have exaggerated extended dance
sequences<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.250> choreography<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:03.090> can

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
sequences we can do choreography we can

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.080 
sequences we can do choreography we can
do<00:01:03.329> moving<00:01:04.140> cameras<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.799> could<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.100> cinematic

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
do moving cameras we could do cinematic

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.490 
do moving cameras we could do cinematic
angles<00:01:06.510> we've<00:01:06.689> sort<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.020> evolved<00:01:07.409> our

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
angles we've sort of evolved our

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560 
angles we've sort of evolved our
processes<00:01:08.130> we've<00:01:08.310> got<00:01:09.030> more<00:01:09.210> comfortable

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
processes we've got more comfortable

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
have a prefix I think that sums it up is
that<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> way<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.640> hasn't<00:01:42.060> changed<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.509> we

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
that the way it hasn't changed is we

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.569

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
horrible thing i think what makes it a

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.430 
horrible thing i think what makes it a
little<00:03:31.060> bit<00:03:31.210> different<00:03:31.540> also<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.140> he's

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
little bit different also is that he's

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.230 
little bit different also is that he's
very<00:03:32.530> self<00:03:32.920> aware<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.430> fact<00:03:33.610> that<00:03:33.700> there's

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
very self aware of the fact that there's

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.820 
very self aware of the fact that there's
a<00:03:34.330> camera<00:03:34.720> following<00:03:34.900> them<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.440> it's<00:03:35.560> kind<00:03:35.740> of

a camera following them and it's kind of

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.320 
a camera following them and it's kind of
