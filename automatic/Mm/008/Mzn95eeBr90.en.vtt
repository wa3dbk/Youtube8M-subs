chicken<00:01:25.869> so<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.380> can<00:01:26.530> see<00:01:26.680> they're<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.920> same

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
chicken so you can see they're the same

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.550 
chicken so you can see they're the same
size<00:01:27.159> still<00:01:27.760> I<00:01:27.970> thought<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.960> turkey<00:01:29.260> to<00:01:29.380> get<00:01:29.530> a

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
size still I thought the turkey to get a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.000 
size still I thought the turkey to get a
little<00:01:29.710> bigger<00:01:30.930> sooner<00:01:31.930> but<00:01:32.170> I<00:01:32.320> guess<00:01:32.560> not<00:01:32.740> I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
little bigger sooner but I guess not I

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.500 
little bigger sooner but I guess not I
guess<00:01:33.159> they're<00:01:33.310> gonna<00:01:33.430> be<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.850> same<00:01:34.030> size<00:01:34.210> for

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
guess they're gonna be the same size for

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.469 
guess they're gonna be the same size for
a<00:01:34.540> while<00:01:34.720> so<00:01:35.049> anyway<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:35.830> is<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.970> update<00:01:37.299> on
