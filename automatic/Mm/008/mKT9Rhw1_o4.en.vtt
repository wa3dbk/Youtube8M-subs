it's a lefty loosey righty tighty kind

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.590 
it's a lefty loosey righty tighty kind
of<00:01:55.670> bolt<00:01:57.100> that<00:01:58.100> bolt<00:01:58.369> is<00:01:58.490> hollow<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.329> it<00:01:59.479> is

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
of bolt that bolt is hollow and it is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.999 
of bolt that bolt is hollow and it is
possible<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.140> break<00:02:00.259> it<00:02:00.439> if<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.590> over<00:02:00.799> tighten

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009
