I mean they did this map here still

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.170 
I mean they did this map here still
download<00:01:07.080> over<00:01:07.320> 10,000<00:01:07.830> times<00:01:08.310> still<00:01:08.790> popular

people<00:01:17.759> probably<00:01:17.790> download<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.979> but<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.939> might

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
people probably download it but it might

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
people probably download it but it might
actually<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> case<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.500> map<00:01:22.710> itself

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
actually be the case that the map itself

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.520 
actually be the case that the map itself
kind<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.430> sucks<00:01:23.700> i<00:01:23.970> did<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> gene<00:01:24.840> OSIS<00:01:25.170> map<00:01:25.380> i

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.810 
idea who is with me or who's not with me
because<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:45.979> friendly<00:01:46.979> units<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.490> enemy

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
because the friendly units and enemy

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.460 
because the friendly units and enemy
units<00:01:48.119> don't<00:01:48.360> look<00:01:48.570> very<00:01:48.600> different<00:01:49.110> from

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
units don't look very different from

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.950 
units don't look very different from
each<00:01:49.649> other<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.130> honest<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.700> mean<00:01:51.570> they<00:01:51.810> have

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
each other to be honest I mean they have

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.340 
each other to be honest I mean they have
live<00:01:52.950> sorts<00:01:53.490> even<00:01:53.700> though<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.350> soared

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
live sorts even though we have soared

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.179 
live sorts even though we have soared
units<00:01:55.680> units<00:01:56.310> also<00:01:56.549> at<00:01:56.820> at<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:57.060> point<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.509> saw

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
units units also at at one point I saw

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.170 
units units also at at one point I saw
but

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
but

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.230 
but
I<00:02:01.220> guess<00:02:02.220> you<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.460> look<00:02:02.610> at<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:02.820> helmets

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
I guess you have to look at the helmets

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.550 
I guess you have to look at the helmets
we<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.480> those<00:02:03.600> yellow<00:02:03.810> helmets<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.380> they

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
we have those yellow helmets that they

is pretty small I have no idea what the
fuck<00:02:41.040> base<00:02:41.550> means<00:02:41.880> though<00:02:42.060> base<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> little

random<00:02:44.660> this<00:02:45.660> mat<00:02:45.900> only<00:02:46.170> supports<00:02:46.530> conquest

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
random this mat only supports conquest

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.280 
random this mat only supports conquest
but<00:02:47.489> as<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.630> has<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.810> lot<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.020> units

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
but as you can see it has a lot of units

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.580 
but as you can see it has a lot of units
I<00:02:49.380> think<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.459> number<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.120> units<00:02:51.540> exceeds<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
I think the number of units exceeds the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.760 
I think the number of units exceeds the
regular<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:54.050> regular<00:02:55.050> conquest<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
regular one a regular conquest and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.660 
regular one a regular conquest and
actually<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.790> supposed<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.750> be<00:02:57.870> XL<00:02:58.590> or<00:02:58.890> at

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
actually is supposed to be XL or at

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.820 
actually is supposed to be XL or at

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
least I get the feeling let's actually

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.770

hmm<00:05:16.619> getting<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.669> bit<00:05:17.819> of<00:05:17.879> lag<00:05:18.089> again<00:05:18.509> that<00:05:19.289> kind

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:19.439 
hmm getting a bit of lag again that kind

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.530 
hmm getting a bit of lag again that kind
of<00:05:19.499> sucks

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:31.290 

so<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.710> think<00:05:24.890> I<00:05:25.280> will<00:05:26.350> stop<00:05:27.350> it<00:05:27.530> here<00:05:27.560> then<00:05:27.860> Oh

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.050 

actually<00:05:32.300> it<00:05:32.930> got<00:05:33.080> back<00:05:33.380> what<00:05:34.130> I<00:05:34.160> am<00:05:34.490> when<00:05:35.030> I

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
actually it got back what I am when I

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.520 
actually it got back what I am when I
figured<00:05:35.390> I<00:05:35.480> would<00:05:35.630> do<00:05:35.810> with<00:05:38.200> getting<00:05:39.200> those

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
figured I would do with getting those

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.430 
figured I would do with getting those
frames<00:05:40.370> back<00:05:40.580> up<00:05:40.700> again<00:05:40.910> is<00:05:41.210> plugging<00:05:42.200> the

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
frames back up again is plugging the

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.470 
frames back up again is plugging the
external<00:05:42.890> hard<00:05:43.070> disk<00:05:43.250> here<00:05:43.550> because<00:05:44.180> I'm<00:05:44.450> a

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
external hard disk here because I'm a

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.780 
external hard disk here because I'm a
normal<00:05:44.810> computer<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.110> get<00:05:45.500> less<00:05:45.920> frames<00:05:46.280> when<00:05:46.760> I

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
normal computer I get less frames when I

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.610 
normal computer I get less frames when I
play<00:05:47.180> on<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.480> external<00:05:47.720> hard<00:05:47.990> disk<00:05:48.200> because

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
play on the external hard disk because

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.180 
play on the external hard disk because
it's<00:05:48.920> less<00:05:49.040> fast<00:05:49.460> but<00:05:50.420> here<00:05:51.380> obviously<00:05:51.590> if<00:05:52.100> I

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
it's less fast but here obviously if I

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.130 
it's less fast but here obviously if I
do<00:05:52.250> it<00:05:52.430> on<00:05:52.490> an<00:05:52.550> external<00:05:52.610> hard<00:05:52.910> if<00:05:53.150> I<00:05:53.360> get<00:05:53.960> more

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
do it on an external hard if I get more

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.140 
do it on an external hard if I get more
frames<00:05:54.440> because<00:05:55.160> my<00:05:55.400> laptop<00:05:55.760> obviously

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
frames because my laptop obviously

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.710 
frames because my laptop obviously
cannot<00:05:56.450> perform<00:05:56.690> that<00:05:57.530> well<00:05:58.450> with<00:05:59.450> fraps

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
cannot perform that well with fraps

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.620

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
are a lot of maps they are even probably

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.610 
are a lot of maps they are even probably
some<00:06:11.300> map<00:06:11.510> packs<00:06:11.780> i<00:06:11.900> would<00:06:12.050> recommend<00:06:12.440> them

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
some map packs i would recommend them

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.240 
some map packs i would recommend them
more<00:06:12.920> because<00:06:13.820> i<00:06:14.270> do<00:06:14.530> custom<00:06:15.530> maps<00:06:15.740> from<00:06:15.950> pure

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
more because i do custom maps from pure

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.340 
more because i do custom maps from pure
episode<00:06:16.520> i<00:06:16.940> will<00:06:17.390> probably<00:06:17.720> at<00:06:17.930> one<00:06:18.080> point

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
episode i will probably at one point

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.180 
episode i will probably at one point
also<00:06:18.650> come<00:06:19.160> to<00:06:19.190> those<00:06:19.490> maps<00:06:19.760> I<00:06:19.940> don't<00:06:20.120> know<00:06:20.210> why

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
also come to those maps I don't know why

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.880 
also come to those maps I don't know why
these<00:06:22.190> maps<00:06:22.490> are<00:06:22.580> not<00:06:22.670> downloaded<00:06:23.240> more<00:06:23.890> but

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
these maps are not downloaded more but

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.500 
these maps are not downloaded more but
like<00:06:25.040> I<00:06:25.160> said<00:06:25.220> I<00:06:25.430> am<00:06:25.700> a<00:06:25.940> little<00:06:26.270> bit
