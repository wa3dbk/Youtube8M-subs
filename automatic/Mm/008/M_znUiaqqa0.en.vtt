00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.500
Over the past couple of months that the number
of single strand knots..and not that I have

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.480
a really big single strand knot problems because
I think that preventative measures like protective

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.510
hair styling and just setting my hair in ways
that are very controlled help to prevent tangles

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.010
and even single strand knots.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.710
In keeping hair grouped together in chunks
also helps.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.810
I think that single strand knots, a lot of
the times what happens is hair when it is

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.690
left on it's own like a single strand it doesn't
weigh as much as when it is clumped together

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.930
so curly hair springs up and as it springs
up the curls, the curls, obviously the ends,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.090
there are curls can come up on itself and
form a little knot.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.600
I noticed a drastic reduction like it is difficult
for me to even find them and I don't really

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.690
have a split end problem, I almost don't even
find split ends they are very scarce.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.610
Normally what I find with trimming is single
strand knots a few single strand knots here

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:11.390
and there, more than I would like to have
. I notice that using... there's a correlation

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.470
between using.. starting to use shea butter
in my hair and the reduction of single strands

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.640
and I think the reason may be that shea butter,
being heavy, and helping to clump my hair

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.840
together and having my hair lay together heavily.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.360
Right now my hair is spongy even though I
have shea butter in it, it's just clumped

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.040
together and although it is moving and it
is loose, an my hair is totally loose, it's

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.600
still together and it is still protected and
I think that a big contribution to my hair

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.430
when my hair is totally loose is shea butter.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.090
The reason for that is that it is heavy, it
reduces mobility.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.190
My hair doesn't come apart, the locks of hair
are thicker and more together and so because

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.720
of that there is more weight... and there's
less mobility and if there is more weight

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:16.470
and stiffness and I don't mean stiffness like
hard, there's a thick butter on the hair so

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.390
it is not floating everywhere.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.850
Because of that the hair is weighed down and
the ends are packed together in groups of

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.670
strands and because of that I think the hair
isn't as free to come loose and spring up

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.340
and curl up on itself and form knots.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.310
For months now I have been noticing a huge
reduction.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:54.000
I went from having a few, a few to having
almost none.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.910
Like see here this is all clumped together,
because of shea butter it is kept together

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.950
in addition to the other things I do to my
hair.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.050
Alot of it is from shea butter and so these
strands are not going to come loose and weigh

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.691
less, because when a single strand of hair
is all by itself it weighs less than if it's

00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:16.850
together like this.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.930
So if it weighs less it can kind of bounce
up and move more freely and curl up on itself

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.930
and form knots.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:32.069
So I think preventing that... ...my hair is
wild, I haven't been letting my hair get super

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.240
spongy lately just because I have been having
a lot of control over it, I've been enjoying

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.350
that.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.730
Right now I can probably wash my hair tonight
even though I could go another day, I could

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.910
probably go another two days, but I am going
to wash it tonight because I want to keep

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.510
it controlled and I want to keep it clumped
together and I want to keep it protected.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.510
So it is it is kind of like..

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.180
I guess it is not protective styling but it's
like preventative styling is what I think

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.360
I will call it.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.240
Applying things heavy enough and setting it
in a way so that it sticks together even though

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.880
it is loose yet it's protected and single
strand knots are being prevented.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.450
I am giving tons of credit to shea butter
and I think shea butter deserves all of the

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.950
credit that I am giving it.
