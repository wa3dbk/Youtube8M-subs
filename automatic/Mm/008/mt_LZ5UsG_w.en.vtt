00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.120 
finish which is I guess it's sandblasted
and<00:00:26.939> then<00:00:27.090> sandblasted<00:00:27.510> again<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.320> don't<00:00:29.070> know

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
this this is not bad I was planning on

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.780 
this this is not bad I was planning on
using<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:57.470> as<00:03:57.620> an<00:03:59.049> XR<00:04:00.459> wedded<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.489> thicker

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
using this as an XR wedded to thicker

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.149 
using this as an XR wedded to thicker
than<00:04:03.430> my<00:04:04.430> zoo<00:04:04.669> lobe<00:04:04.879> which<00:04:05.000> I<00:04:05.150> was<00:04:05.329> using<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:06.159> I

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
than my zoo lobe which I was using and I

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.809 
than my zoo lobe which I was using and I
was<00:04:07.879> also<00:04:08.030> using<00:04:08.209> this<00:04:08.419> is<00:04:08.720> my<00:04:08.840> neck<00:04:09.049> knife<00:04:09.230> and

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
was also using this is my neck knife and

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.910 
was also using this is my neck knife and
you<00:04:10.819> can<00:04:10.939> see<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.150> the

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.770 

you<00:04:16.430> can<00:04:16.579> see<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.780> handle<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.380> the

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
you can see that the the handle of the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.409 
you can see that the the handle of the
the<00:04:20.780> hiker<00:04:20.959> is<00:04:21.320> smaller<00:04:22.130> as<00:04:22.550> well<00:04:22.730> and<00:04:23.000> not<00:04:23.300> as

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
the hiker is smaller as well and not as

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.510 
the hiker is smaller as well and not as
long<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:24.680> is<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:25.010> is<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.220> little<00:04:25.430> bit

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
long so this is this is a little bit

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.610 
long so this is this is a little bit
more<00:04:25.639> easy<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:25.970> conceal<00:04:26.419> and<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:27.260> just<00:04:27.470> as

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
more easy to conceal and it just as

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.740 
more easy to conceal and it just as
sharp<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.910> know<00:04:29.000> this<00:04:29.150> is<00:04:29.210> rounded<00:04:29.660> off

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
sharp and you know this is rounded off

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
sharp and you know this is rounded off

is<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:34.070> sharpest<00:04:34.310> knife<00:04:34.639> I've<00:04:34.910> ever<00:04:35.120> had<00:04:35.500> you

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
is the sharpest knife I've ever had you

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.970 
is the sharpest knife I've ever had you
know<00:04:36.620> I<00:04:37.480> regularly<00:04:38.480> cut<00:04:38.900> paper<00:04:39.260> at<00:04:39.500> work<00:04:39.710> and

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
know I regularly cut paper at work and

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.390 
know I regularly cut paper at work and
this<00:04:40.880> thing<00:04:41.060> goes<00:04:41.240> through<00:04:41.450> it<00:04:41.570> like<00:04:41.750> butter

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
this thing goes through it like butter

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.850 
this thing goes through it like butter
but<00:04:43.400> this<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.700> incredibly<00:04:44.630> sharp<00:04:44.930> I<00:04:45.230> thought

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
but this is incredibly sharp I thought

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.250 
but this is incredibly sharp I thought
it<00:04:46.010> was<00:04:46.100> going<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.280> be<00:04:46.400> convex<00:04:46.960> but<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.050> seems

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
it was going to be convex but it seems

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.080 
it was going to be convex but it seems
like<00:04:48.440> it's<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.740> V<00:04:48.979> edge<00:04:49.160> I<00:04:49.490> tell<00:04:49.790> you<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:49.910> truth

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
like it's a V edge I tell you the truth

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.740 
like it's a V edge I tell you the truth
I'm<00:04:50.240> in<00:04:50.389> it<00:04:50.600> might<00:04:51.169> be<00:04:51.290> a<00:04:51.320> slight<00:04:51.590> kind<00:04:52.280> of<00:04:52.340> X

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
I'm in it might be a slight kind of X

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.320 
I'm in it might be a slight kind of X
but<00:04:53.750> i<00:04:54.110> wish<00:04:54.380> i<00:04:54.500> wish<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.820> camera<00:04:55.820> quality<00:04:56.000> was

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
but i wish i wish the camera quality was

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.270 
but i wish i wish the camera quality was
a<00:04:56.360> little<00:04:56.510> better<00:04:56.690> but<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.740> seems<00:04:57.979> like<00:04:58.040> it's

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
a little better but it seems like it's

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.570 
a little better but it seems like it's
pretty<00:04:58.340> flat<00:04:58.669> to<00:04:58.970> me<00:04:59.590> you<00:05:00.590> know<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:00.889> I<00:05:01.190> did

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
pretty flat to me you know and I did

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.800 
pretty flat to me you know and I did
convex<00:05:02.060> my<00:05:02.360> Azula<00:05:03.350> by<00:05:04.010> hand<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:05.570> know<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.690> got

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
convex my Azula by hand you know I got

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.980 
convex my Azula by hand you know I got
some<00:05:06.020> tips<00:05:06.620> from<00:05:06.889> kylie<00:05:07.550> as<00:05:07.700> well<00:05:07.880> as<00:05:08.030> watching

some tips from kylie as well as watching
blunt<00:05:09.320> truths<00:05:09.590> video<00:05:09.889> but<00:05:10.160> Kylie<00:05:10.490> actually

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
blunt truths video but Kylie actually

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:11.740 
blunt truths video but Kylie actually
gave<00:05:10.820> me<00:05:10.850> more<00:05:11.060> information<00:05:11.180> about<00:05:11.510> how<00:05:11.720> to

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
gave me more information about how to

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.860 
gave me more information about how to
convex<00:05:12.200> it<00:05:12.790> took<00:05:13.790> quite<00:05:13.970> a<00:05:14.120> long<00:05:14.240> time<00:05:14.389> to<00:05:14.810> get

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
convex it took quite a long time to get

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.990 
convex it took quite a long time to get
this<00:05:15.020> context<00:05:15.530> but<00:05:15.680> of<00:05:16.520> course<00:05:16.700> nothing
