each trading card focusing on the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.280 
each trading card focusing on the
character<00:03:05.340> symbol<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:07.390> I'm<00:03:07.510> guessing<00:03:08.230> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
character symbol so I'm guessing the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.559 
character symbol so I'm guessing the
character<00:03:08.650> symbol<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.220> what's<00:03:09.549> down<00:03:09.819> there<00:03:10.360> on

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
character symbol is what's down there on

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.770 
character symbol is what's down there on
the<00:03:10.630> bottom<00:03:11.019> because<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.370> backs<00:03:12.670> that's<00:03:13.599> just

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
the bottom because the backs that's just

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.800 
the bottom because the backs that's just
the<00:03:13.900> type<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.220> guess<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.580> point<00:03:15.849> it<00:03:15.970> at<00:03:16.209> that

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
the type so I guess you point it at that

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.970 
the type so I guess you point it at that
square<00:03:17.350> right<00:03:17.769> there

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.590 

let's<00:03:20.980> see<00:03:21.190> you'll<00:03:21.519> see<00:03:21.760> your<00:03:21.850> invisible<00:03:22.420> up

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
let's see you'll see your invisible up

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.810 
let's see you'll see your invisible up
here<00:03:23.019> each<00:03:23.560> training<00:03:23.950> card<00:03:24.220> has<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.400> symbol

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
here each training card has a symbol

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.240 
here each training card has a symbol
each<00:03:25.060> symbol<00:03:25.570> hides<00:03:25.840> an<00:03:25.989> invisible<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:27.100> can

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
each symbol hides an invisible you can

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.949 
each symbol hides an invisible you can
see<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.489> 131<00:03:28.060> Invisibles<00:03:28.510> whether<00:03:28.810> you've

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
see that 131 Invisibles whether you've

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.800 
see that 131 Invisibles whether you've
captured<00:03:29.290> them<00:03:29.590> or<00:03:29.799> not<00:03:30.510> see<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:31.690> all<00:03:31.780> just

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
captured them or not see is it all just

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.000 
captured them or not see is it all just
different<00:03:32.170> languages<00:03:32.650> then<00:03:33.750> yeah<00:03:34.750> that's<00:03:35.709> the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
different languages then yeah that's the

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.590 
different languages then yeah that's the
trick<00:03:36.430> if<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.819> want<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.030> see<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.239> Invisibles

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
trick if you want to see the Invisibles

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.660 
trick if you want to see the Invisibles
bigger<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:38.470> use<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.829> game<00:03:39.069> track

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
bigger you can use the game track

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.819 
bigger you can use the game track
position<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.750> trap<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.530> square<00:03:41.799> is

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
position the trap so that the square is

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.740 
position the trap so that the square is
centered<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.459> symbol<00:03:42.880> be<00:03:43.359> careful

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
centered on the symbol be careful

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.599 
centered on the symbol be careful
position<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.200> diamond<00:03:44.470> face<00:03:44.620> up<00:03:44.920> ready<00:03:45.370> a

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
position the diamond face up ready a

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.210 
position the diamond face up ready a
really<00:03:46.000> big<00:03:46.209> invisible<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:47.680> apparently<00:03:48.160> you

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
really big invisible so apparently you

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.890 
really big invisible so apparently you
can<00:03:48.519> actually<00:03:48.700> use<00:03:48.970> these<00:03:49.120> with<00:03:49.480> the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
can actually use these with the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.009 
can actually use these with the
PlayStation<00:03:50.609> well<00:03:51.639> PSP<00:03:52.209> game<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.630> says

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
PlayStation well PSP game it says

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.740 
PlayStation well PSP game it says
neither<00:03:53.650> PSP<00:03:54.489> an<00:03:54.670> invisible<00:03:55.030> shadow<00:03:55.510> code

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
neither PSP an invisible shadow code

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.840 
neither PSP an invisible shadow code
I'll<00:03:56.410> see<00:03:56.530> those<00:03:56.650> ps3<00:03:57.100> game<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.400> must<00:03:57.549> be<00:03:57.670> for

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
I'll see those ps3 game it must be for

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.479 
I'll see those ps3 game it must be for
PSP<00:03:58.380> maybe<00:03:59.380> it's<00:03:59.530> for<00:03:59.620> ps3<00:03:59.829> as<00:04:00.069> well<00:04:00.220> I'm<00:04:00.340> not

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
PSP maybe it's for ps3 as well I'm not

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.849 
PSP maybe it's for ps3 as well I'm not
positive<00:04:00.670> but<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.989> apparently<00:04:02.319> you<00:04:02.410> can<00:04:02.650> use

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
positive but so apparently you can use

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.800 
positive but so apparently you can use
them<00:04:03.040> so<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.150> point<00:04:04.359> the<00:04:04.450> camera<00:04:04.480> at<00:04:04.750> the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
them so you point the camera at the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.599 
them so you point the camera at the
little<00:04:05.170> square<00:04:05.620> there<00:04:05.650> then<00:04:06.010> they<00:04:06.130> appear<00:04:06.519> in

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
little square there then they appear in

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.580 
little square there then they appear in
