all my hair right here this is all mine
so<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.450> lock<00:04:08.630> extension<00:04:09.230> is<00:04:09.350> not<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.800> long

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
so the lock extension is not that long

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.370 
so the lock extension is not that long
because<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.550> keep<00:04:10.730> cutting<00:04:11.180> it<00:04:11.330> up<00:04:11.480> but

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
because I keep cutting it up but

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.270 
because I keep cutting it up but
basically<00:04:13.340> my<00:04:14.120> hair<00:04:14.360> is<00:04:14.480> healthy<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.530> don't

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
basically my hair is healthy I don't

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.159 
basically my hair is healthy I don't
take<00:04:16.580> back<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:17.060> decision<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.660> having<00:04:17.989> lock

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
take back the decision of having lock

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.130 
take back the decision of having lock
extensions<00:04:18.950> because<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:20.180> worked<00:04:20.510> for<00:04:20.870> me<00:04:21.109> in
