yeah<00:03:30.830> it's<00:03:31.040> crazy<00:03:31.340> we<00:03:31.640> have<00:03:31.760> like<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.330> think

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
yeah it's crazy we have like I think

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.370 
yeah it's crazy we have like I think
maybe<00:03:33.770> even<00:03:34.010> under<00:03:34.340> two<00:03:34.640> weeks<00:03:34.850> between<00:03:35.380> the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
maybe even under two weeks between the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.680 
maybe even under two weeks between the
first<00:03:36.680> day<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.340> pipe<00:03:37.550> opens<00:03:37.940> until<00:03:38.120> our<00:03:38.420> first

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
first day the pipe opens until our first

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.620 
first day the pipe opens until our first
progress<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.459> it<00:03:40.459> happens<00:03:40.790> pretty<00:03:40.970> fast<00:03:41.269> but

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
progress so it happens pretty fast but

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.440 
progress so it happens pretty fast but
with<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> place<00:03:42.709> like<00:03:42.950> this<00:03:43.180> even<00:03:44.180> if<00:03:44.300> the

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
with a place like this even if the

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.600 
know
obviously<00:05:42.660> Olympics

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
obviously Olympics

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.899 
obviously Olympics
I<00:05:43.639> think<00:05:43.849> to<00:05:43.969> create<00:05:44.240> stretcher

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.970 

keep<00:05:47.909> whisking

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
keep whisking

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.260 
keep whisking
to<00:05:49.040> go<00:05:49.160> when<00:05:49.370> you<00:05:49.430> can<00:05:49.580> create<00:05:49.730> some<00:05:50.000> sort<00:05:50.150> of

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
to go when you can create some sort of

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.230 
to go when you can create some sort of
safety

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
safety

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.950 
safety
and<00:05:51.449> have<00:05:52.229> discussions<00:05:52.440> keep<00:05:52.979> judging<00:05:53.960> fans

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
and have discussions keep judging fans

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.110 
and have discussions keep judging fans
you<00:05:55.620> know<00:05:55.650> make<00:05:55.949> sure<00:05:56.160> that<00:05:56.400> athletes<00:05:57.060> are

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120

taken<00:05:57.419> care<00:05:57.479> of<00:05:57.660> I<00:05:58.190> think<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.250> other<00:05:59.370> aspect

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
taken care of I think the other aspect

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.420 
taken care of I think the other aspect
is<00:06:00.030> also<00:06:00.360> showing<00:06:00.690> kids

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430
