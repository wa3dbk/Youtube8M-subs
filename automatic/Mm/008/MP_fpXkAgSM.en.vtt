 this goes after what happened in the 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.080
 first delivery or a few years later 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.180
 in which there are certain surprises in that 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.600
 certain characters from the region of 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.100
 teselia have moved or elche is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.710

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.400
 liked 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.210
 here we have already when the 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.100
 two strong is born a legend here a 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.659
 new new teacher that would be of 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.360
 plasma equipment as we already know in the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.189
 first delivery will have something to do 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.420
 then we can create the news of 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.820
 create our explained is on the ship 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.409
 wood as we all know in the why 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.119
 bolt is that the new one that has been 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.030
 adhered to what we would have in this 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.570
 game that allows us to express center in 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.090
 we know our own in 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.280
 danger and then how to signal if you have 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.800

 I will do a review is taught more or 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.860
 less how it works, but what radar 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.500
 it's only for people who have 3ds what 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.420
 who has bought the pokemon radar that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.840
 I guess this Thursday they are going to put what 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.460
 that would be the pokemon radar on sale I think 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.630
 that is worth four euros or that is 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.400
 quite expensive 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.230
 I do not know if he caught me and now or later 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.610
 but we're going here because the 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.990
 initials and the protagonists that are 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.390
 more or less like the first for a bit 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.960
 Most disheveled bar and well let's 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.960
 proceed to open it like all life 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.020
 as always here you have to always sign 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.420
 and that's a video of always opening them and 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.090
 it is always to remove this band from the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.710
 zetas is always a little elastic open 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.900
 the eyes because it is the castillito to me 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.500
 like it very much we find 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.500
 interview 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.050
 sea 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.480
 and we found the pin code that 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.629
 again it's used to redeem I do not 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.200
 I'm going to show anything, what I have 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:54.530
 put in the pool nintendo 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.530
 always and always I like being good 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.360
 and they are called or dismissals I love 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.670
 the cover honestly 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.670
 it means everything here 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.310
 yesterday explains the wifi manual how it 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.110
 configure the instructions in order without 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.700
 have played this is a little lost os 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.430
 I remember that is look at the instructions 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.460
 above all the same here as main 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.310
 novelty we will find the pokemon frog 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.380
 and what he has was understandable vrae 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.570
 those he says is about the 11th 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.280
 10 of 2012 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.680
 this is not true usually the 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.800
 nintendo eshop is updated on Fridays 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.330
 on Thursdays or if it 's tomorrow that's fine 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.970
 it's fine and good here we find what 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.300
 we will be able to capture as it is called through 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.730
 of augmented reality 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.410
 these legendary tornadoes that 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.350
 it depends on the way it is otherwise 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.960
 same is a little invizimal to look like this 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.060
 say it and good because it exploits you because 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.240
 it is improved only intergoles available 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.180
 have to have 3ds part of this or 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.250
 which is what I highly recommend and 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.860
 well here is the pokemon even 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.630
 coaches worth this is fine if 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.020
 you have an account of what they would be 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.850
 in what would be that dropped because 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.550
 contract order now you realize no 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.140
 you can enter with that account and 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.140
 quietly for example you'll see 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.750
 or fourth if not well played steps by 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.520
 my channel and I recommend that you 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.020
 you pass because he is very handsome can play 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.910
 over the internet against more people and against 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.930
 offline in the tournaments and is very very 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.870
 Handsome 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.820
 100% recommended to play at the end game 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.620
 online through the letters 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.389
 originals give you a code and also 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.430
 the decks general proposal of groups 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.960
 for more information steps then look 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.210
 basically the same because mont global the 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.760
 link that would be what we already know all 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.820
 from the previous one I think if it was put in the 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.440
 black and white or before it does not go neither pokemon 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.460
 black and white in which you can visit the 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.139
 world of dreams that you can capture 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.870
 pokémons see statistics of all the 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.550
 world etc and well that's all I think that 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.050
 you liked this in the pits good if 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.729
 of the pokemon game you think it's for 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.030
 learn this and I recommend it for 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.860
 younger children who want it and 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.110
 study and their positions in game of 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.300
 pokémon and they want we could even 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.039
 be well in this game by miami to dad 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.630
 here I can learn to write that 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.760
 I keep it I would not buy it being 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.510
 afraid of what I have 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.510
 neither is it worth 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.550
 now we go to the cartridge that many 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.590
 people and this that advertising 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.040
 there is nothing more bone than tomorrow 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.360
 agreed that the soft ones enter to see that 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.360

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.949

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.449
 black 2 I do not know how I'm going to do it and 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.580
 you also have to fight to make it equal 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.639
 here 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.090
 nothing more very handsome this time 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.490
 to see if it's because the world has 3ds created 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.810
