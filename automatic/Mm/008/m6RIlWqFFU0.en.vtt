for<00:00:44.450> both<00:00:44.630> models<00:00:45.220> we're<00:00:46.220> looking<00:00:46.460> at<00:00:46.550> a<00:00:46.580> TV

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
for both models we're looking at a TV

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.229 
for both models we're looking at a TV
range<00:00:47.360> here<00:00:47.570> which<00:00:47.780> are<00:00:48.050> full<00:00:48.559> HD<00:00:49.220> they<00:00:50.120> have<00:00:50.210> a

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
range here which are full HD they have a

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.479 
range here which are full HD they have a
contrast<00:00:50.870> ratio<00:00:50.989> of<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.410> hundred<00:00:51.680> thousand<00:00:52.370> to

so<00:00:55.820> extremely<00:00:56.420> high<00:00:56.780> specification<00:00:57.769> there<00:00:58.070> so

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
so extremely high specification there so

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.759 
so extremely high specification there so
just<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.489> run<00:00:58.699> through<00:00:58.970> that<00:00:59.150> with<00:00:59.390> you<00:00:59.769> full

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.680 
just to run through that with you full
