00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.750
 good morning dear viewers 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 today's topic is greenhouse tomatoes 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.500
 I want to show 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.670
 not a process that is where we conclude 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.699
 in itself all you need to put tomato 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.699
 when landing and the geometry itself I am very 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.949
 I want to ease your task work 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.519
 gardener he is just incredible 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.759
 heavy 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.529
 so take a look right here at me 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.920
 divided into sections here should 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.530
 hold well 8 there is a maximum of 9 tomatoes 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.609
 here look i broke the bamboo 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.989
 chopsticks so that you understand the principle 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:46.890
 what do I want to show you 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.649
 dug trenches no more than 20 deep 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.469
 centimeters no more cold there 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.489
 when you put all the fertilizers 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.399
 there there it can be all the codes 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.710
 This good and here is located 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.500
 only strict tomato we need to plant 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.720
 so that each tomato is illuminated by the sun 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.360
 that is, staggered as a rule 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.080
 some site is done here two rows 2 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.320
 a series of cramped not enough light it's all in 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.800
 detriment of fruiting here I there from to 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.810
 top of the leaves here is the root 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.500
 we stack it like this unfolding it 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.640
 crown 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.580
 here this side of measles and here 2 tomato 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.710
 should the top of the head here the top should 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.470
 being here means he should lie like this 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.500
 the next crown should be somewhere 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.550
 about at a distance this one 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.690
 half yes here here so and so 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.090
 further along the length of this trench 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.220
 because there is nothing difficult now we 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.650
 fill the roots 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.080
 Look, we all fall asleep roots crown 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.680
 will we spill naturally 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.410
 look here is the top of the tomatoes on 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.290
 tomorrow they must lie no need them 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.209
 try to raise they will stand up 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.210
 and on the second and third day when the plant 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.180
 get up 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.640
 we will stick the shelves they can be what 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.510
 please me bamboo they serve very 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.940
 a long time here and so he will and he tomatik 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.760
 we will begin to fasten it along its entire length and 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:31.580
 also a greenhouse thomas and he grows in one 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.920
 to the following degree on the same side they 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.250
 bend beautifully 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.380
 here look very firmly and this 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.630
 Tomato, too, will rise here next 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.440
 here we have the root up here in 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.990
 in this zone , let's do it like this 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.940
 let's make a scallop well so 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.460
 neatly only yes not touching there 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.930
 nothing extra make a comb that is 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.140
 cover the root system 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.060
 And now pay attention here and here it is 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.950
 there will be a furrow for watering 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.510
 and if you don't want such a comb and 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.940
 make a furrow in the middle 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.300
 that is, make sure you have water 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.750
 flowed here and went for all 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.450
 roots absolutely you understand what feeds 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.480
 and there we will water the fertilizer and 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.760
 water leu and nothing is easier 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.320
 I hope you heard me all 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.320
 good and good bye
