00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.519
 the ingredients that we are going to need for this recipe are fried tomato 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.099
 smoked salmon 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.099
 anchovies and pasta 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.300
 The first thing we are going to do is choose the anchovies, cut them into pieces and leave them well 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.779
 chopped 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.859
 in a saucepan add the cream and put to heat over low heat 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.430
 we add the anchovies 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.990
 and we are going to remove 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.680
 until we see that those anchovies before facts 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.000
 then add the fried tomato that we saw in previous marrakech 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.850
 stir well 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.850
 to mix 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.970
 and we are going to reserve 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.450
 with salmon, what I've done is cut the entity 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.330
 and we leave it there for later 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.920
 meanwhile we know the pasta 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.370
 per hundred put a little salt 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.660
 laurel 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.660
 the water and a trickle of water 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 peace always following the instructions 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.980
 enap until we bought in this case were seven minutes past that 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.650
 time we see 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.650
 siena pasta that nobody loose 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.760
 and we went to the fruit of it 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.880
 17 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 we are not going to change because if not 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.840
 in my opinion it has properties 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.480
 we put the sauce on top 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.800
 and the salmon and so we have left 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.050
 delicious 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.180
 I hope you liked it 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.300
 that's all to another
