00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.370
 it even considers 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.410
 I am comfortable 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.290
 school of cyberspace 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.009
 on the marsa a barn 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:08.930
 Anyway 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.729
 not sure in the morning 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.729
 the counter of the iron hand in mid-november 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.890
 but I managed to get out of the mark 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.259
 from here one night here 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.589
 like that says a lot about 3 but tomorrow because they feel they 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.679
 will be able as is the ballot 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.539
 and I sell parcels that will kick me in the back and propel him outside 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.370
 so watch is going through the stuff 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.370
 but mostly posed a tactical insertion 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.880
 in misery 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.880
 so I wanted to show that 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.600
 here at hand 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 but that's because there is more interesting 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.300
 so we always replace his ascent 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 to visit 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.530
 mclaren can hide no one sees that I am in the cities 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.300
 so you see this book it's a possible past of pyromaniac and true 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:11.600
 blood 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.270
 we passed 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.270
 so we continue to classify a housing yes 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.930
 so we can easily get people off 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.760
 he does not cry it's very good 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.150
 he can no longer conceal behind the great penalty if you know 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.720
 if you recognize 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.470
 by hand it's a fence 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.540
 it's their problem 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.880
 now we could get closer 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 and here I am inside 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.580
 here 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.580
 luc plamondon and that's where she harmed people 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.780
 we can make a carnage quietly 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.800
 then my to the road but it is not necessary and because there are holes 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.159
 so we continue for more of the brand and by email 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.010
 but that all political parties 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.010
 I try to show something here meal 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.919
 look at me it's juice 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.599
 and yet I'm not there yet but it's very tempting guardini 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.949
 the advanced it's a pleasure 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.469
 treyarch is neglected beasts like that 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.429
 we can go out 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:35.269
 a place you recognize 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.329
 nÃ©rac 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.609
 you are going slaughterhouses lambiel has doubled you are looking for 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.769
 the age of twelve 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:48.819
 a place that drags butcher 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.639
 and here I am behind 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.719
 Boumelha 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.719
 see fault some people between strategic packages here 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:00.679
 now in hand what is here 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.420
 the lme of vegetables 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.069
 it's a beautiful screen so he talks 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.109
 all want fixed 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.179
 not quite sublime 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:10.819
 but I'm going through 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.819
 do not worry I'm going through this movie 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.399
 I can go to this canyon 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.399
 we need all simplicity 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.119
 place you know times when some people when it's little bit 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.119

 not happy to go back too much 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:44.519
 so to extend the barrier can not die 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.789
 that's why 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:49.389
