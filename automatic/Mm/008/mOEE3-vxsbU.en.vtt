00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
more as a tablet where I would take the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.030 
more as a tablet where I would take the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
mode but I've really gotten away from

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.250 
mode but I've really gotten away from
that<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.430> that's<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:53.060> shame<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.930> can<00:02:54.080> tell

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
that and that's a shame and I can tell

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.020 
that and that's a shame and I can tell
you<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:55.010> single<00:02:55.310> reason<00:02:55.640> I've<00:02:55.760> gotten<00:02:55.940> away

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
you the single reason I've gotten away

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.699 
you the single reason I've gotten away
from<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.900> reason<00:02:57.260> I've<00:02:57.380> gotten<00:02:57.620> away

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
from that the reason I've gotten away

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.660 
from that the reason I've gotten away
from<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:59.200> because<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:01.459> lack<00:03:01.610> of

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
from that is because of the lack of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.960 
from that is because of the lack of
Google<00:03:02.120> Apps<00:03:02.300> I've<00:03:02.959> mentioned<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:03.440> before

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
Google Apps I've mentioned this before

Google Apps I've mentioned this before
for<00:03:04.970> me<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:06.160> am<00:03:07.160> very<00:03:07.880> very<00:03:08.150> much<00:03:08.269> entrenched<00:03:08.780> in

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
for me I am very very much entrenched in

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.780 
for me I am very very much entrenched in
Google's<00:03:09.920> ecosystem<00:03:10.550> I<00:03:10.900> am<00:03:11.900> that's<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.890> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
Google's ecosystem I am that's just the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.620 
Google's ecosystem I am that's just the
way<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.459> course<00:03:16.820> we<00:03:17.090> have<00:03:17.239> Google

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
way it is so of course we have Google

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.390 
way it is so of course we have Google
Chrome<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:18.200> there's<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.739> Google<00:03:19.010> Search<00:03:19.190> app

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
Chrome and there's the Google Search app

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.729 
Chrome and there's the Google Search app
there's<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.670> third-party<00:03:20.540> Google<00:03:21.260> Maps<00:03:21.470> app

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
there's a third-party Google Maps app

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.110 
there's a third-party Google Maps app
which<00:03:22.070> is<00:03:23.050> we'll<00:03:24.050> call<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.320> sufficient<00:03:24.950> um

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
which is we'll call it sufficient um

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.850 
which is we'll call it sufficient um
it's<00:03:26.120> not<00:03:26.300> Google<00:03:26.600> Maps<00:03:26.780> but<00:03:26.959> it's<00:03:27.110> close<00:03:27.380> but

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
it's not Google Maps but it's close but

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
it's not Google Maps but it's close but
as<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:27.980> can<00:03:28.100> tell<00:03:28.160> in<00:03:28.459> here<00:03:28.640> there's<00:03:28.820> just

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
as you can tell in here there's just

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.170 
as you can tell in here there's just
nothing<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:30.080> that's<00:03:30.500> obviously<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:31.180> Google

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
nothing and that's obviously a Google

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.210 
nothing and that's obviously a Google
and<00:03:32.360> Microsoft<00:03:32.650> relationship<00:03:33.650> issue<00:03:33.890> and

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
and Microsoft relationship issue and

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.620 
and Microsoft relationship issue and
that's<00:03:34.670> fine<00:03:35.000> that's<00:03:35.030> okay

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
that's fine that's okay

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.759 
that's fine that's okay
but<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.980> problem<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.550> users<00:03:38.180> suffer<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:39.050> would

dedicated app and that's kind of

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.750 
dedicated app and that's kind of
disheartening<00:04:33.830> so<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.860> couple<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.370> cool<00:04:35.550> things

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
that I saw and I'll put the link to

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.590 
that I saw and I'll put the link to
another<00:04:37.410> video<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:38.010> has<00:04:38.130> all<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.520> cool<00:04:39.150> tips

another video that has all the cool tips
and<00:04:39.750> tricks<00:04:39.930> on<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.170> but<00:04:40.890> if<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.730> hold<00:04:42.000> down<00:04:42.410> I

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
and tricks on it but if you hold down I

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.610 
and tricks on it but if you hold down I
believe<00:04:44.100> its<00:04:44.310> function<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.450> delete<00:04:46.200> you'll

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
believe its function and delete you'll

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.440 
believe its function and delete you'll
turn<00:04:46.830> your<00:04:46.980> brightness<00:04:47.280> up<00:04:47.490> function<00:04:48.300> and

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
turn your brightness up function and

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.800 
turn your brightness up function and
backspace<00:04:48.990> will<00:04:49.830> turn<00:04:50.010> your<00:04:50.130> brightness<00:04:50.460> down

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
backspace will turn your brightness down

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.720 
backspace will turn your brightness down
so<00:04:51.810> just<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.050> couple<00:04:52.170> quick<00:04:52.800> shortcuts<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.550> can

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
so just a couple quick shortcuts you can

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.220 
so just a couple quick shortcuts you can
hit<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:54.510> believe<00:04:55.410> it<00:04:55.620> there's<00:04:56.100> a<00:04:56.190> shift<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:57.120> a

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
hit I believe it there's a shift and a

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.380 
hit I believe it there's a shift and a
function<00:04:58.230> caps<00:04:59.100> lock<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.730> that'll<00:05:00.000> change

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
function caps lock and that'll change

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.210 
function caps lock and that'll change
your<00:05:01.190> short<00:05:02.190> keys<00:05:02.340> up<00:05:02.550> here<00:05:02.880> from<00:05:03.570> the

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
your short keys up here from the

brightness settings volume play pause to

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.470 
brightness settings volume play pause to
the<00:05:07.500> actual<00:05:07.920> function<00:05:08.190> keys<00:05:08.580> which<00:05:09.240> I<00:05:09.420> don't

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
the actual function keys which I don't

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.030 
the actual function keys which I don't
use<00:05:09.720> very<00:05:09.900> often<00:05:10.170> so<00:05:10.470> that's<00:05:10.620> not<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.800> huge

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
use very often so that's not a huge

setup<00:06:39.100> and<00:06:39.430> I've<00:06:39.520> also<00:06:39.640> used<00:06:39.880> it<00:06:40.000> as<00:06:40.150> just

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
setup and I've also used it as just

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.060 
setup and I've also used it as just
mirroring<00:06:41.140> the<00:06:41.320> other<00:06:41.440> monitor<00:06:41.680> because

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
mirroring the other monitor because

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.370 
mirroring the other monitor because
obviously<00:06:42.310> you<00:06:42.550> have<00:06:42.670> the<00:06:42.760> keyboard<00:06:42.910> here<00:06:43.380> so

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
obviously you have the keyboard here so

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.840 
obviously you have the keyboard here so
there's<00:06:44.860> lots<00:06:45.070> of<00:06:45.190> different<00:06:45.490> things<00:06:45.550> you<00:06:45.730> can

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
do with the device the only thing that's

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.660 
do with the device the only thing that's
missing<00:06:47.950> that<00:06:48.430> that<00:06:48.880> I<00:06:48.910> can<00:06:49.240> see<00:06:49.510> is<00:06:49.860> not<00:06:50.860> just

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670 
missing that that I can see is not just

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.200 
missing that that I can see is not just
apps<00:06:52.240> but<00:06:52.720> Google<00:06:53.110> apps<00:06:53.290> and<00:06:53.910> obviously<00:06:54.910> like
