miss<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.500> onto<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> clay<00:02:17.160> we're<00:02:17.730> going<00:02:17.850> to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
miss it onto the clay we're going to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.130 
miss it onto the clay we're going to
miss<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.120> onto<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> paint<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.960> we're<00:02:19.080> just

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
miss it onto the paint and we're just

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.480 
miss it onto the paint and we're just

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
going to come and rub this back and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.970 
going to come and rub this back and
forth<00:02:20.810> or<00:02:21.810> circle<00:02:22.320> motion<00:02:22.620> doesn't<00:02:22.770> matter

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
forth or circle motion doesn't matter

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.320 
forth or circle motion doesn't matter
because<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.490> not<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> bracelet<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.120> it

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
because this is not a bracelet so it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.760 
because this is not a bracelet so it
won't<00:02:24.450> scratch<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.720> paint<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.530> we're<00:02:25.650> going

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
won't scratch the paint and we're going

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.530 
won't scratch the paint and we're going
to<00:02:25.800> when<00:02:26.340> we<00:02:26.430> start<00:02:26.730> out<00:02:26.880> we'll<00:02:27.090> probably<00:02:27.270> feel

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
to when we start out we'll probably feel

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.360 
to when we start out we'll probably feel
a<00:02:27.570> kind<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.870> bite<00:02:28.110> or<00:02:28.350> drag<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> paint<00:02:29.190> but

a kind of bite or drag on the paint but

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.890 
a kind of bite or drag on the paint but
as<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.640> removes<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.120> above<00:02:30.330> service<00:02:30.600> bond<00:02:30.780> of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
as it removes the above service bond of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.420 
as it removes the above service bond of
contaminants<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.830> starts<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.220> glide

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
contaminants it starts to glide

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
what we call a missile a product or a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.670 
what we call a missile a product or a
spray<00:02:45.360> lubricant<00:02:45.870> I'm<00:02:46.320> going<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.530> go<00:02:46.590> ahead

spray some onto my clay and then onto

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.960 
spray some onto my clay and then onto
the<00:02:49.230> paint<00:02:49.470> I'm<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.489> going<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.670> come<00:02:50.850> down

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
the paint I'm just going to come down

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.090 
the paint I'm just going to come down
here<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.330> once<00:02:51.510> glide<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.410> clay<00:02:52.680> bar<00:02:52.890> back

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
here and once glide this clay bar back

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.460 
here and once glide this clay bar back
and<00:02:53.340> forth<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.540> again<00:02:54.780> because<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.200> clay<00:02:55.410> is

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
and forth and again because the clay is

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.900 
and forth and again because the clay is
not<00:02:55.650> abrasive<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.250> can<00:02:56.430> go<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.700> any<00:02:56.790> direction

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
not abrasive you can go in any direction

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.729 
not abrasive you can go in any direction
you<00:02:57.300> want<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.600> for<00:02:57.900> example<00:02:58.320> I'm<00:02:58.380> using<00:02:58.440> a

you want to for example I'm using a

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.400 
you want to for example I'm using a
circle<00:02:58.980> motion<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.930> come<00:03:01.110> down<00:03:01.140> here

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
circle motion so I can come down here

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.560 
circle motion so I can come down here
and<00:03:01.470> go<00:03:01.590> straight<00:03:01.650> lines<00:03:02.040> if<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.310> want<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
and go straight lines if I want to and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.930 
and go straight lines if I want to and
you<00:03:04.410> want<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.650> apply<00:03:04.769> just<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.370> gentle<00:03:05.640> pressure

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
you want to apply just a gentle pressure

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.930 
you want to apply just a gentle pressure
and<00:03:07.040> when<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.070> started<00:03:08.430> out<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.580> could<00:03:08.820> actually

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
and when I started out I could actually

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.540 
and when I started out I could actually
feel<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.269> dragging<00:03:09.900> as<00:03:10.050> its<00:03:10.739> removing<00:03:11.430> those

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
feel it dragging as its removing those

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.070 
feel it dragging as its removing those
bonnet<00:03:11.970> contaminants<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.690> now<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.930> they're

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
bonnet contaminants and now that they're

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.140 
bonnet contaminants and now that they're
all<00:03:13.230> gone<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:14.130> can<00:03:14.280> feel<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.519> very<00:03:14.730> smooth

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
all gone you can feel this very smooth

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.550 
all gone you can feel this very smooth
so<00:03:15.390> we'll<00:03:15.480> go<00:03:15.570> ahead<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.780> wipe<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.110> off<00:03:16.320> then

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
so we'll go ahead and wipe this off then

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.920 
so we'll go ahead and wipe this off then
we'll<00:03:16.620> inspect<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.130> again
