pretty good he did actually have bedroom
and<00:00:26.910> saw<00:00:27.119> me<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.449> right-back<00:00:27.750> he<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.710> planning

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and saw me at right-back he was planning

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.200 
and saw me at right-back he was planning
a<00:00:28.949> left<00:00:29.130> back<00:00:29.220> at<00:00:29.400> right<00:00:29.550> back<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.939> thought<00:00:30.150> I

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
guess it's kind of fair that I can put a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.530 
guess it's kind of fair that I can put a

all the posts seem to be getting the
better<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.140> most<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.590> time<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.520> then

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
better of it most of the time and then

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.039 
better of it most of the time and then
this<00:01:17.820> guy<00:01:17.939> finally<00:01:18.180> had<00:01:18.450> an<00:01:18.509> attack<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.960> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049

was<00:01:19.140> pretty<00:01:19.320> promising<00:01:19.860> he<00:01:20.610> sadly<00:01:21.090> did<00:01:21.479> not

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689

cut<00:01:21.900> inside<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.560> he<00:01:22.619> should<00:01:22.830> have

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
his dribbling was really sloppy very

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
his dribbling was really sloppy very
slow<00:01:51.840> clunky<00:01:52.259> dribbling<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:52.979> i<00:01:53.040> couldn't<00:01:53.340> beat

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
slow clunky dribbling so i couldn't beat

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.340 
slow clunky dribbling so i couldn't beat
players<00:01:53.820> his<00:01:54.329> shot<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.930> didn't<00:01:55.140> seem<00:01:55.290> very

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
players his shot just didn't seem very

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.440 
players his shot just didn't seem very
good<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.430> very<00:01:56.610> tricky<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> ball

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
good it's very tricky to get the ball

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.780 
good it's very tricky to get the ball
onto<00:01:57.659> him<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.049> headers<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:59.340> all<00:01:59.520> round

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
onto him for headers so just all round

onto him for headers so just all round
he<00:02:00.090> had<00:02:00.450> no<00:02:00.630> skills<00:02:00.930> nothing<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.500> so

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
he had no skills nothing like that so

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.380 
he had no skills nothing like that so
all<00:02:01.890> around<00:02:02.100> he<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.460> was<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.820> very<00:02:03.000> good<00:02:03.270> at

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
all around he just was not very good at

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.030 
all around he just was not very good at
all<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.780> every<00:02:03.990> time<00:02:04.140> i<00:02:04.229> tried<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.439> shoot<00:02:04.799> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
all and every time i tried to shoot it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.100 
all and every time i tried to shoot it
did<00:02:05.460> not<00:02:05.610> work<00:02:05.820> too<00:02:06.149> well<00:02:06.180> for<00:02:06.360> me<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:06.750> i<00:02:06.899> had<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
did not work too well for me so i had a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.050 
did not work too well for me so i had a
terrible<00:02:07.469> shot<00:02:07.770> accuracy<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:08.910> had

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
terrible shot accuracy because we had

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.279 
terrible shot accuracy because we had
quite<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> few<00:02:09.509> from<00:02:09.629> outside<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.080> books

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
quite a few from outside of the books

quite a few from outside of the books
most<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.009> them<00:02:11.099> were<00:02:11.129> onto<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> post<00:02:12.239> it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.960 
doesn't even count as a shot
on<00:02:13.660> target<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.320> yeah<00:02:15.250> he<00:02:15.430> was<00:02:15.550> having<00:02:15.760> quite<00:02:15.940> a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
on target but yeah he was having quite a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.280 
on target but yeah he was having quite a
few<00:02:16.120> corners<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.570> stuff<00:02:16.720> like<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.900> be<00:02:17.170> he

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
was wasn't really having any clear-cut

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.310 
was wasn't really having any clear-cut
chances<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.420> did<00:02:19.600> seem<00:02:19.750> like<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:20.110> had<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
chances it did seem like I had the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.780 
chances it did seem like I had the
better<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.650> him<00:02:20.800> for<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.040> majority<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.610> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
better of him for the majority of the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.970 
better of him for the majority of the
game<00:02:22.240> he<00:02:22.870> really<00:02:23.050> was<00:02:23.230> looking<00:02:23.530> at<00:02:23.830> better

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
game he really was looking at better

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.860 
game he really was looking at better
than<00:02:24.160> me<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.550> time<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.820> decided<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.570> try<00:02:25.750> and

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
than me this time I decided to try and

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.150

rush<00:02:25.990> my<00:02:26.140> goalie<00:02:26.350> out<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:26.710> running<00:02:26.920> back

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
rush my goalie out and then running back

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.660

very<00:02:37.390> worrying<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:37.990> couple<00:02:38.320> occasions<00:02:38.350> but

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
very worrying on a couple occasions but

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.800 
very worrying on a couple occasions but
I<00:02:38.920> seem<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.250> deal<00:02:39.430> with<00:02:39.550> it<00:02:39.670> most<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.600> time

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
I seem to deal with it most of the time

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.630 
I seem to deal with it most of the time
then<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.560> was<00:02:41.710> just<00:02:41.800> using<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.130> pace<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.490> pace

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
then I was just using the pace and pace

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.730 
then I was just using the pace and pace
and<00:02:42.820> pace<00:02:43.060> even<00:02:43.270> here<00:02:43.600> traore<00:02:44.020> this<00:02:44.500> seemed<00:02:44.710> to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
and pace even here traore this seemed to

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.560 
and pace even here traore this seemed to
be<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.920> case<00:02:45.130> every<00:02:45.550> time<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.760> see<00:02:45.970> Roy<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.300> would

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
be the case every time I see Roy I would

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.330 
be the case every time I see Roy I would
shoot<00:02:46.990> he<00:02:47.470> would<00:02:47.590> manage<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.920> get<00:02:48.040> his<00:02:48.130> legs

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
shoot he would manage to get his legs

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.830 
shoot he would manage to get his legs
stuck<00:02:48.580> into<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.910> whereas<00:02:49.240> that<00:02:49.330> didn't<00:02:49.600> happen

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
stuck into it whereas that didn't happen

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.060 
stuck into it whereas that didn't happen
with<00:02:49.960> everyone<00:02:50.260> else<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.890> was<00:02:51.010> very

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
with everyone else so it was very

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.070 
with everyone else so it was very
frustrating<00:02:51.400> there<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.270> have<00:02:52.420> no<00:02:52.630> idea<00:02:52.900> how<00:02:53.020> he

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
frustrating there I have no idea how he

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.260 
frustrating there I have no idea how he
didn't<00:02:53.380> score<00:02:53.560> great<00:02:54.130> save<00:02:54.340> by<00:02:54.370> my<00:02:54.700> goalie<00:02:54.970> to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
didn't score great save by my goalie to

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.030 
didn't score great save by my goalie to
stop<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.930> but<00:02:56.050> that<00:02:56.200> made<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.440> was<00:02:56.530> nil<00:02:56.740> nil<00:02:56.890> by

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
stop it but that made it was nil nil by

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.860 
stop it but that made it was nil nil by
halftime<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.580> absolutely<00:02:58.150> action-packed

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
halftime and absolutely action-packed

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.230 
halftime and absolutely action-packed
game<00:02:59.260> but<00:02:59.770> it<00:02:59.950> went<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.280> extra<00:03:00.610> time<00:03:00.970> and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
game but it went to extra time and

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.770 
game but it went to extra time and
penalties<00:03:01.690> as<00:03:01.870> we<00:03:02.260> chose<00:03:02.740> it<00:03:02.980> too<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.780> he

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
penalties as we chose it too and he

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.120 
penalties as we chose it too and he
seemed<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.110> play<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.320> little<00:03:05.500> bit<00:03:05.740> better<00:03:05.890> in

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
seemed to play a little bit better in

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.010 
seemed to play a little bit better in
this<00:03:06.280> period<00:03:06.520> now<00:03:06.790> you'll<00:03:07.360> see<00:03:07.570> here<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.810> was

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
this period now you'll see here I was

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.480 
this period now you'll see here I was
going<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.260> run<00:03:08.380> down<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.680> wing<00:03:08.830> with<00:03:08.980> kona<00:03:09.250> and

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
going to run down the wing with kona and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.430 
going to run down the wing with kona and
I<00:03:09.520> decided<00:03:09.880> he<00:03:10.180> far<00:03:10.420> as<00:03:10.510> good<00:03:10.660> chopping<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.410> I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
I decided he far as good chopping so I

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.990 
I decided he far as good chopping so I
left<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.770> until<00:03:11.860> right<00:03:12.310> at<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.610> end<00:03:12.760> for<00:03:12.850> I

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
left it until right at the end for I

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.420 
left it until right at the end for I
finally<00:03:13.420> did<00:03:13.570> actually<00:03:13.750> chopping<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:15.040> try<00:03:15.280> and

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
finally did actually chopping to try and

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.980 
finally did actually chopping to try and
fool<00:03:15.640> him<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.210> to<00:03:16.330> kind<00:03:16.570> of<00:03:16.690> work<00:03:16.810> to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
fool him and that to kind of work to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.750 
fool him and that to kind of work to
manage<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.290> get<00:03:17.410> another<00:03:17.740> shot<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.040> seemed

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
like I was just dominating most of the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.620 
like I was just dominating most of the
game<00:03:20.710> and<00:03:20.890> then<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.580> terrible<00:03:22.360> terrible

game and then to terrible terrible
defensive<00:03:23.290> tackles<00:03:23.710> by<00:03:23.830> me<00:03:23.980> allowed<00:03:24.520> him<00:03:24.670> to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
defensive tackles by me allowed him to

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.300
