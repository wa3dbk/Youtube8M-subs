 [Music] 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.650
 hello everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.410
 be sharing how you can do 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.720
 nails with sponge techniques and with 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.090
 some stickers that are very nice 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.610
 As a first step, you are going to apply 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.710
 protective base then you're going to paint 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.630
 your nails the color of your taste and I used a 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.760
 white enamel because I feel that the 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.920
 white enamel colors helps 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.930
 that I'm going to put on top stand out 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.670
 more then what are you going to do to 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.250
 stick the pebbles you can put 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.590
 Protective shine so they stick very 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.450
 well then you are going to grab your sponge and 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.059
 you are going to choose the color glazes of 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.670
 your taste I used a green color that is 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.239
 as a pink mint color and a color 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.850
 purple softly using your sponge you're going to 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.100
 tap your nails with the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.530
 enamel to make the design of 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.570
 degraded with sponge then what are we going 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.550
 to do is to cut your decal 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.979
 these stickers are in a plastic 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.580
 what is to protect them you will remove 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.200
 the plastic then you are going to cut them 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.509
 individually 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.520
 to put the stickers on what you're going 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.579
 to do is to soak them in water of 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.920
 10 to 20 seconds later I what I do 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.229
 is I put it on my finger and slid the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.240
 picture with my other finger and then I 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.230
 grabbed with the tweezers and put it on 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.480
