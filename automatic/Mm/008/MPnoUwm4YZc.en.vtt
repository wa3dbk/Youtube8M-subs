and that's it for mod loader mod loaders

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.910 
and that's it for mod loader mod loaders
now<00:02:32.210> installed<00:02:32.630> we<00:02:33.020> just<00:02:33.230> need<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.500> get<00:02:33.650> those

good idea to make sure that the mod
successfully<00:03:17.690> loaded<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.200> we<00:03:18.290> can<00:03:18.440> do

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
successfully loaded it and we can do

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.740 
successfully loaded it and we can do
this<00:03:18.650> by<00:03:18.860> checking<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.880> text<00:03:20.240> file<00:03:20.420> called

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
this by checking the text file called

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.199 
this by checking the text file called
mod<00:03:20.990> loader<00:03:21.170> dot<00:03:21.530> txt<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.670> once<00:03:22.820> that's<00:03:22.970> loaded

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
mod loader dot txt so once that's loaded

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.940 
mod loader dot txt so once that's loaded
we'll<00:03:23.780> go<00:03:23.900> back<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.290> application<00:03:24.770> data

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
we'll go back to the application data

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.490 
we'll go back to the application data
folder<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.660> open<00:03:26.930> up<00:03:27.050> this<00:03:27.260> file<00:03:28.240> and<00:03:29.380> in<00:03:30.380> this

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
folder and open up this file and in this

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.260 
folder and open up this file and in this
case<00:03:30.740> it's<00:03:30.950> been<00:03:31.100> unsuccessful<00:03:31.820> you<00:03:32.000> can<00:03:32.120> see

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
case it's been unsuccessful you can see

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.840 
case it's been unsuccessful you can see
it's<00:03:32.420> searched<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:33.020> two<00:03:33.170> separate<00:03:33.590> locations

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
it's searched in two separate locations

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.550 
it's searched in two separate locations
for<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:34.880> mod<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.330> has<00:03:35.690> been<00:03:35.870> unsuccessful<00:03:36.140> in

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
for a mod and has been unsuccessful in

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.520 
for a mod and has been unsuccessful in
finding<00:03:36.739> a<00:03:36.950> name<00:03:37.070> for<00:03:37.340> anything<00:03:38.230> so<00:03:39.230> let's<00:03:39.380> go

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
finding a name for anything so let's go

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.990 
finding a name for anything so let's go
back<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.920> mods<00:03:40.130> folder<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.670> find<00:03:40.880> out

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
back to the mods folder and find out

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:58.860 
back to the mods folder and find out
what's<00:03:41.180> gone<00:03:41.330> wrong

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.809 

so<00:03:59.470> in<00:03:59.590> this<00:03:59.739> case<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.250> files<00:04:00.489> aren't

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
so in this case the files aren't

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.880 
so in this case the files aren't
directly<00:04:00.970> within<00:04:01.480> that<00:04:01.599> sub<00:04:01.840> in<00:04:02.170> that<00:04:02.650> zip

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
directly within that sub in that zip

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.650 
directly within that sub in that zip
folder<00:04:03.280> if<00:04:03.790> they<00:04:03.970> aren't<00:04:04.150> there<00:04:04.390> then

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
folder if they aren't there then

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.020 
folder if they aren't there then
minecraft<00:04:05.319> won't<00:04:05.530> be<00:04:05.590> hard<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.769> find<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.190> so

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
minecraft won't be hard to find it so

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.430 
minecraft won't be hard to find it so
what<00:04:07.150> we're<00:04:07.239> going<00:04:07.330> to<00:04:07.420> have<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.629> do<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:08.140> to

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
what we're going to have to do is to

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.949 
what we're going to have to do is to
extract<00:04:08.650> all<00:04:08.920> those<00:04:09.129> files<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:10.480> make<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.720> new

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
extract all those files and make a new

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.000 
extract all those files and make a new
zip<00:04:11.170> file<00:04:11.410> folder<00:04:13.349> which<00:04:14.349> has<00:04:14.560> all<00:04:14.709> of<00:04:14.739> these

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
zip file folder which has all of these

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.640 
zip file folder which has all of these
files<00:04:15.910> directly<00:04:16.359> within<00:04:16.660> them

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.770 

we'll<00:04:23.220> amend<00:04:23.520> our<00:04:23.699> folder<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:24.389> you<00:04:24.449> don't<00:04:24.660> have

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.459
