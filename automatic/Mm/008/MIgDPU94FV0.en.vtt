00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.430
 do not 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.119
 min 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.460
 do not 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.460
 min 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.510
 so that all flights 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.150
 abused tutorial 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.010
 because what is promised is debt 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.280
 now my face 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.380
 I'm a little ugly that they steal 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.830
 this 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.320
 ernesto schÃ¼tz in these authors I will teach you how to finish the violin 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.210
 as promised by this 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.180
 more mature and explained lamata the other part the foundation some techniques 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.850
 basic plan 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.370
 I am in that part explains it very little because he is going to be very tedious 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.300
 and life 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.980
 more or less I will explain what that day the machinery of the violin 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.590
 it's not the same as the accident guitar 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.630
 is a housekeeper who would make very different this machinery did not evolve until he 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.700
 dry the 18th century 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.300
 although it's good that it stayed that way 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.670
 it's a strange mobile machinery in tarbes for you but not the pins 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.950
 they have are funny 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.400
 so if we buy just goes up when Lucas goes, it is to remove the pins and to give them 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.890
 a bit of comedy or talcum I recommend you hear that this is and always 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.410
 comes with the violin 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.800
 although it was bought nothing better quality 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.800
 but he still recommended that you couple 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.610
 and then they put the pegs and accuse things well 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.500
 yes they tried it once 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.530
 by tightening the strings if you do not know very well how to do it or you are going to loosen up 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.950
 after in time 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.330
 then what we are going to do as it is an economic machinery 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.599
 When we press it, we praise it. 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.169
 not very clear 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.989
 taking care of the violin is a very delicate instrument then when we give ourselves 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.839
 mind we are going to press it a little inwards so that the ropes are thrown 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.229
 that's also why the brasserie is going to serve us 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.519
 mimi and basically 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.059
 you can is all that he also recommended you buy a cushion 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.209
 so he did not wonder turkish neck 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.389
 who buy a cushion are not very expensive 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.609
 these range from 1 100 pesos do not appear 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.419
 they are already very expensive very exaggerated 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.459
 but I recommend that you compose it for what 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.709
 who space where they live 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.180
 this space since the chengchi limeÃ±os all sarkozy 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:51.859
 and good 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.680
 that would be all in this video and in the following is the synthesis of the Lord 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.619
 as dominators 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:58.159
 over and out
