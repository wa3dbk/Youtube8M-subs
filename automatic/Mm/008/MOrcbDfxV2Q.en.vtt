00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.710 
give me an idea of what the hair is like
once<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.680> installed<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> did<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> wash

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
once it's installed so I did do a wash

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.630 
once it's installed so I did do a wash
on<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.110> hair<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.710> once<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.009> comb<00:01:44.280> through

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
on this hair and once I comb through

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.270 
on this hair and once I comb through
there<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.270> minimal<00:01:45.659> shedding<00:01:46.290> between<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
there was minimal shedding between the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.899 
there was minimal shedding between the
two<00:01:47.430> bundles<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.090> probably<00:01:48.869> collected<00:01:49.350> about

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
two bundles I probably collected about

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.260 
two bundles I probably collected about
15<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.119> 20<00:01:51.509> hairs<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:53.040> longer<00:01:53.460> bundle<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> 14

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
15 to 20 hairs the longer bundle the 14

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
15 to 20 hairs the longer bundle the 14
can<00:01:54.450> shed<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> lot<00:01:55.020> more<00:01:55.259> than<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> 12<00:01:55.770> inch<00:01:56.009> did

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
can shed a lot more than the 12 inch did

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.760 
can shed a lot more than the 12 inch did
so<00:01:57.090> that's<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.810> thing<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.500> want<00:01:58.710> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
so that's one thing that you do want to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.289 
so that's one thing that you do want to
know<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.189> there<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.430> minimal<00:01:59.790> shedding<00:02:00.180> but

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
know so there is minimal shedding but

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
know so there is minimal shedding but
again<00:02:00.570> with<00:02:00.719> any<00:02:00.930> product<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.710> get

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
again with any product that you get

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.249 
again with any product that you get

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
again I've had this installed for about

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.000 
again I've had this installed for about
one<00:02:15.670> week<00:02:15.700> now<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.810> have<00:02:17.020> not<00:02:17.200> experienced

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
one week now and I have not experienced

any tangling any matting your fingers

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.290 
any tangling any matting your fingers
just<00:02:21.940> run<00:02:22.240> through<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.959> hair<00:02:26.670> no<00:02:27.670> problems<00:02:28.120> at

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.420 
just run through the hair no problems at
all<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.569> remember<00:02:29.260> when<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.680> hair<00:02:29.920> comes<00:02:30.190> it

for<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.470> african-american<00:03:02.890> texture<00:03:03.670> you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
for the african-american texture you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.699 
for the african-american texture you
know<00:03:04.239> we've<00:03:04.390> tried<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.660> indian<00:03:05.140> remy<00:03:05.470> the

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
know we've tried that indian remy the

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.330 
know we've tried that indian remy the
brazilian<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:07.170> everything<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.530> this<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:09.130> the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
brazilian the everything so this is the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.500 
brazilian the everything so this is the
first<00:03:09.489> time<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.790> I've<00:03:09.880> actually<00:03:09.910> tried<00:03:10.390> the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
first time that I've actually tried the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.910 
first time that I've actually tried the
Mongolian<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.320> was<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.470> little<00:03:11.650> nervous

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
Mongolian and I was a little nervous

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.650 
Mongolian and I was a little nervous
because<00:03:12.250> when<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.580> first<00:03:12.820> initially<00:03:13.420> got<00:03:13.540> the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
because when I first initially got the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.770 
because when I first initially got the
hair<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.320> has<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.500> thicker<00:03:15.150> texture<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.540> does

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
hair it has a thicker texture it does

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.479 
hair it has a thicker texture it does
have<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.049> texture<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:17.890> it's<00:03:18.040> not<00:03:18.160> bone

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
have a texture to it so it's not bone

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.819 
have a texture to it so it's not bone
straight<00:03:18.880> but<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:20.110> is<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.320> great<00:03:20.560> thing<00:03:20.799> for

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
very very well so I don't have any color

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.190 
very very well so I don't have any color
on<00:03:42.340> my<00:03:42.579> natural<00:03:42.970> hair<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.450> didn't<00:03:43.720> color<00:03:43.959> this

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
on my natural hair I didn't color this

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.449 
on my natural hair I didn't color this
hair<00:03:44.410> this<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.860> natural<00:03:45.190> color<00:03:45.340> that

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
hair this is the natural color that

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.470 
hair this is the natural color that
comes<00:03:45.910> in<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.200> think<00:03:47.400> for<00:03:48.400> me<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:48.820> hair<00:03:49.120> so

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
comes in so I think for me this hair so

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.319 
comes in so I think for me this hair so
far<00:03:49.780> has<00:03:50.019> been<00:03:50.290> doing<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.739> great<00:03:50.920> job<00:03:51.150> again<00:03:52.150> I

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
far has been doing a great job again I

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.390 
far has been doing a great job again I
don't<00:03:52.390> expect<00:03:52.720> any<00:03:53.290> hair<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.680> come<00:03:53.890> in<00:03:54.040> and

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
don't expect any hair to come in and

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.310 
don't expect any hair to come in and
that<00:03:54.519> has<00:03:54.700> absolutely<00:03:55.480> no<00:03:55.690> shedding<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:56.170> don't

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
that has absolutely no shedding I don't

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.270 
that has absolutely no shedding I don't
think<00:03:56.470> there's<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.709> product<00:03:57.070> on<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.250> market

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
think there's a product on the market

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.550 
think there's a product on the market
that<00:03:57.640> actually<00:03:57.760> does<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.180> so<00:03:59.110> again<00:03:59.440> the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
that actually does that so again the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.020 
that actually does that so again the
shedding<00:03:59.860> minimal<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.930> matting

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
shedding minimal the matting

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.060 
shedding minimal the matting
non-existent<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.180> far<00:04:04.420> for<00:04:04.600> me<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:05.070> the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
non-existent so far for me and the

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.460 
non-existent so far for me and the
texture<00:04:06.700> blends<00:04:07.510> perfectly<00:04:07.810> with<00:04:08.200> an

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
texture blends perfectly with an

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.310 
texture blends perfectly with an
african-american<00:04:08.890> hair<00:04:09.459> again<00:04:10.239> it's<00:04:10.780> thicker

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
african-american hair again it's thicker
