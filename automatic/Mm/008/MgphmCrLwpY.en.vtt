undisputed champion but it's so rare
that<00:05:17.199> the<00:05:17.530> other<00:05:17.650> champions<00:05:18.160> want<00:05:18.729> to<00:05:18.850> face

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
that the other champions want to face

each other at least their promoters well

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.219 
each other at least their promoters well
I<00:05:21.490> think<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:22.000> other<00:05:22.180> three<00:05:22.450> champions<00:05:22.990> of<00:05:23.110> all

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
I think the other three champions of all

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.790 
I think the other three champions of all
control<00:05:23.650> by<00:05:23.830> Don<00:05:24.100> King<00:05:24.460> i<00:05:27.120> think<00:05:28.120> if<00:05:28.210> you

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
control by Don King i think if you

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.960 
control by Don King i think if you
watching<00:05:29.800> Hopkins<00:05:30.250> said<00:05:30.430> hey<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:30.610> think<00:05:30.850> it's

watching Hopkins said hey I think it's

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.990 
watching Hopkins said hey I think it's
going<00:05:31.090> to<00:05:31.150> be<00:05:31.240> very<00:05:32.430> doubtful<00:05:33.430> of<00:05:33.580> King<00:05:33.820> would

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
going to be very doubtful of King would

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.820 
going to be very doubtful of King would
let<00:05:34.150> any<00:05:34.330> of<00:05:34.510> his<00:05:34.660> champion<00:05:35.169> spike<00:05:35.410> cannot

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
don't think any of the other

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.140 
don't think any of the other
middleweight<00:05:56.250> champion<00:05:56.640> even<00:05:56.970> have<00:05:57.060> a<00:05:57.090> chance
