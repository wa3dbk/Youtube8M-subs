the equity that I was having problems

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.299 
the equity that I was having problems
with<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.660> made<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> previous<00:00:13.380> video<00:00:13.679> as<00:00:13.980> far<00:00:14.190> as

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
with I made a previous video as far as

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.519 
with I made a previous video as far as
to<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.639> tested<00:00:15.179> out<00:00:15.890> given<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.390> my

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
to what I tested out given that on my

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.900 
to what I tested out given that on my
apartment<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.949> don't<00:00:20.609> know<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:20.820> my

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
apartment here I don't know but my

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.580 
apartment here I don't know but my
windows<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.570> don't<00:00:21.810> get<00:00:21.930> much<00:00:22.109> fresh<00:00:22.410> air

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
windows so we don't get much fresh air

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.490 
windows so we don't get much fresh air
circulation<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.490> get<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> lot<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.750> co2<00:00:24.990> build-up

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
circulation I get a lot of co2 build-up

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.029 
circulation I get a lot of co2 build-up
in<00:00:25.680> side<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.310> my<00:00:26.460> tank<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.539> because<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.590> it

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
in side of my tank so because of that it

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.030 
in side of my tank so because of that it
causes<00:00:29.310> Michael<00:00:29.849> initi<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> stay<00:00:30.359> high<00:00:31.040> so

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
causes Michael initi to stay high so

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.729 
causes Michael initi to stay high so
what<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.219> ended<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.489> doing<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.390> took<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> line

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
what I ended up doing was I took a line

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.119 
what I ended up doing was I took a line
from<00:00:35.160> my<00:00:35.399> air<00:00:36.239> intake<00:00:36.750> valve<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.770> protein

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
from my air intake valve of my protein

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.760 
from my air intake valve of my protein
skimmer<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:39.450> put<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.020> outside<00:00:40.170> through

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
skimmer and I put it outside through

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.670 
skimmer and I put it outside through
this<00:00:40.920> window<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.670> back<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
this window you see back here and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.700 
this window you see back here and
basically<00:00:44.149> what<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.180> does<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.440> sucks

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
basically what that does is just sucks

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.260 
basically what that does is just sucks
in<00:00:46.860> air<00:00:47.070> from<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> outside<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:50.090> pretty<00:00:51.090> much

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
in air from the outside and pretty much

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.510 
in air from the outside and pretty much
you<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.600> gets<00:00:51.960> introduced<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> tank<00:00:52.829> so

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
you know gets introduced to the tank so

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.250 
you know gets introduced to the tank so
because<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.719> helped<00:00:55.110> out

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
because of that it is helped out

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.760 
because of that it is helped out
tremendously<00:00:56.239> my<00:00:57.239> pH<00:00:58.230> used<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.160> be<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:01.680> know

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
tremendously my pH used to be you know

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.920 
tremendously my pH used to be you know
while<00:01:02.039> amid<00:01:02.520> when<00:01:02.820> once<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.390> lights<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:03.780> on

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
while amid when once the lights was on

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.880 
while amid when once the lights was on
for<00:01:04.320> over<00:01:04.670> half<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.200> amount<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.350> hours<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
for over half the amount of hours you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.490 
for over half the amount of hours you
know<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> they<00:01:08.310> stay<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:09.930> my<00:01:10.170> pH

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
know that they stay on you know my pH

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.830 
know that they stay on you know my pH
would<00:01:10.799> normally<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> almost<00:01:11.610> eight<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
would normally get to almost eight so it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
would normally get to almost eight so it
was<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.110> horrible<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.790> also<00:01:14.790> did<00:01:15.119> add<00:01:15.860> show

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
was like horrible I also did add show

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.810 
was like horrible I also did add show
you<00:01:16.920> real<00:01:17.220> quick<00:01:17.630> here<00:01:18.650> those<00:01:19.650> air<00:01:19.979> stones<00:01:20.369> you

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
you real quick here those air stones you

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.499 
you real quick here those air stones you
see<00:01:20.850> there<00:01:21.439> added<00:01:22.439> those<00:01:22.590> air<00:01:22.799> stones<00:01:23.509> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
see there added those air stones and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.100 
see there added those air stones and
then<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:26.729> line<00:01:27.450> inside<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
then you can see that line inside of the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.850 
then you can see that line inside of the
intake<00:01:28.470> valve<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> protein<00:01:29.280> skimmer<00:01:29.689> so

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
intake valve of the protein skimmer so

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.429 
intake valve of the protein skimmer so
because<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.670> has<00:01:33.570> helped<00:01:34.320> out

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
because of that it has helped out

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.120 
because of that it has helped out
tremendously

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
my economy went down to 11 and look at

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.280 
my economy went down to 11 and look at
what<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.350> pH<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.890> like

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.650 

that's<00:01:45.010> my<00:01:45.160> pH<00:01:45.490> remind<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:46.090> my<00:01:46.240> lights<00:01:46.420> go<00:01:46.630> on

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
that's my pH remind you my lights go on

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.850 
that's my pH remind you my lights go on
at<00:01:46.900> 1<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:47.650> it's<00:01:48.000> 4:45<00:01:49.000> now<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.780> that's<00:01:50.680> what

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
at 1 so it's 4:45 now and that's what

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.470 
at 1 so it's 4:45 now and that's what
it's<00:01:50.980> looking<00:01:51.070> like<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.700> because<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.300> the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
it's looking like and because of the

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.090 
it's looking like and because of the
introduction<00:01:52.960> of<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.110> kalkwasser<00:01:53.560> reactor

introduction of the kalkwasser reactor

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.330 
introduction of the kalkwasser reactor
my<00:01:54.280> pH<00:01:54.610> does<00:01:54.910> not<00:01:55.090> drop<00:01:55.420> below<00:01:55.450> 8<00:01:56.340> throughout

said previously for my other videos I
wasn't<00:03:04.030> introducing<00:03:04.510> corals<00:03:04.870> because<00:03:05.380> I<00:03:05.410> was

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
wasn't introducing corals because I was

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.790 
wasn't introducing corals because I was
making<00:03:06.280> sure<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:07.269> know<00:03:07.360> my<00:03:07.480> calcium<00:03:07.800> my

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
making sure that you know my calcium my

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.030 
making sure that you know my calcium my
ability<00:03:09.430> my<00:03:09.459> pH<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:11.110> know<00:03:11.230> my<00:03:11.680> senility

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
ability my pH you know my senility

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.490 
ability my pH you know my senility
everything<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:13.090> know<00:03:13.120> pretty<00:03:13.959> much<00:03:14.050> up<00:03:14.380> to

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
everything is you know pretty much up to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.979 
everything is you know pretty much up to
date<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:16.060> know<00:03:16.180> where<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.420> should<00:03:16.660> be<00:03:16.690> so

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
date and you know where it should be so

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.900 
date and you know where it should be so
so<00:03:17.440> far<00:03:17.680> everything's<00:03:18.100> been<00:03:18.310> working<00:03:18.700> good

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
so far everything's been working good

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.320 
so far everything's been working good
the<00:03:19.900> algae<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.410> pretty<00:03:20.830> much<00:03:21.040> as<00:03:21.640> you<00:03:21.670> can<00:03:22.030> see

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
the algae is pretty much as you can see

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.050 
the algae is pretty much as you can see
going<00:03:23.170> away<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.830> everything<00:03:26.830> is<00:03:26.950> working<00:03:27.130> one

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
going away so everything is working one

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.140 
going away so everything is working one
thing<00:03:28.269> about<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:29.670> I've<00:03:30.670> learned

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
thing about this is that I've learned

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.990 
thing about this is that I've learned
throughout<00:03:32.110> these<00:03:32.640> couple<00:03:33.640> years<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:33.910> I've

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
throughout these couple years that I've

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.120 
throughout these couple years that I've
been<00:03:34.030> doing<00:03:34.120> this

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
been doing this

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.500 
been doing this
patience<00:03:36.130> is<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> key<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:37.209> time<00:03:37.390> around

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
patience is a key and this time around

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.630 
patience is a key and this time around
when<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:37.870> set<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.200> tank<00:03:38.440> up<00:03:38.620> I've<00:03:39.340> been<00:03:39.400> very

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
when I set this tank up I've been very

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.360 
when I set this tank up I've been very
patient<00:03:40.620> rather<00:03:41.620> than<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:41.920> way<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.040> did<00:03:42.280> it

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
patient rather than the way I did it

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.800 
patient rather than the way I did it
before<00:03:42.430> where<00:03:42.850> I<00:03:42.910> just<00:03:42.970> start<00:03:43.150> introducing<00:03:43.540> so

before where I just start introducing so

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.180 
before where I just start introducing so
many<00:03:43.989> things<00:03:44.140> to<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.350> tank<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.709> they<00:03:44.860> all<00:03:45.010> pay

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
many things to the tank and they all pay

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.400 
many things to the tank and they all pay
the<00:03:45.340> ultimate<00:03:45.400> price<00:03:45.760> or<00:03:46.090> if<00:03:46.750> not<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.200> know<00:03:47.380> I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410
