00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
basic noob stuff maybe it is but this is

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.930 
basic noob stuff maybe it is but this is
my<00:02:59.720> tactic<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.410> how<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.650> get<00:03:01.190> at<00:03:01.310> least<00:03:01.340> 10

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940
