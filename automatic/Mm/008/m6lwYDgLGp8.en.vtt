00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.340
 processes without borders 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.899
 You have to put the course that you 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.940
 does and course what and what subjects you 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.910
 you want to study outside the country 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.399
 in the second part of the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.989
 I know how to do especially specify 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.449
 whatever you want to do what you 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.940
 want to study what kind of matter and all 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.189
 the subjects that I went behind and that I 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.439
 I was wanting to study were related 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.150
 you select three universities 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.740
 What would you like to study but not in? 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.140
 at the end of the day is the program 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.080
 what does the university tell you? 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.240
 stay is my case the sketch was not 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.090
 nor among the three chosen but my 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.189
 I loved to have fallen then as soon as I went 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.710
 approved in the sketch I can see which 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.310
 It's my way and that's personal too. 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.590
 because a couple of years ago it was two 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.060
 years ago also to you 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.150
 inscribing a university of the states 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.829
 Together they lose their portfolio so 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.600
 your portfolio as I knew I 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.119
 I wanted to study fashion and how I already had 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.060
 studied informal mode of fashion in Brazil 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.070
 and obviously because of the blog I have 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.939
 quite a fashion portfolio then it was 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.630
 very good for me I got into 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.460
 order to get into the field I 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.650
 wanted in the field 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.610
 in the field that I wanted then 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.070
 It was that I got it. 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.350
 I do not know about advertising and 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.630
 communication courses that all I 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.700
 'm talking about are also things of my 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.319
 call I do not know how are 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.970
 coming calls in the cinemas that 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.750
 have joined the calls to speak to 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.280
 truth 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.950
 so if you are interested in doing 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.709
 without borders enters the site without 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.870
 borders tells you exactly what is going to 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.480
 to give good study of fashion in the states 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.970
 Together it was incredible for me I know that 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.580
 In Brazil we have some schools of 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.989
 professions and also has a university of 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.910
 fashion in brazil 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:38.190
 but I had access to something so 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.470
 good how much I had here so you have 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.340
 notion is how they give value to fashion 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.060
 here are several means then there is fashion 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.420
 design and has faith show bar quietinho and has 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.630
 a mattress I think the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.010
 marketing was one of the things that is 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.690
 They surprised me so I liked it. 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.819
 enough and I think because it's because 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.470
 of the blog and also because I and my 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.010
 sisters we only work with this there is a 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.019
 good weather to barbarian the beard formed 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.340
 in communication design and the work of formed 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.260
 in public relations 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.440
 then this whole design base 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.880
 communication I learned a lot from them 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.549
 and here I had the opportunity to 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.989
 really studying something is relationship 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.120
 to this the growth that I had 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.760
 here in the United States is 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.739
 really giant is huge and I'm 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.959
 very happy if you have opportunity 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.220
 really do an exchange 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.600
 to study here do because the style of 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.160
 Teaching them discipline is 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.840
 punctuality all things is one thing 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.090
 What do you learn a lot from was the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.890
 practically as soon as I got to study 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.810
 fashion was here in the united states 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.620
 process boundaries message was the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.239
 following staff I usually skit 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.709
 the universities have a portal 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.420
 of work 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:03.140
 happens that neither work 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.140
 that I got 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.580
 still from July because I have two 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.560
 Related Searches 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.990
 so there is a portal that you have to 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.800
 opportunity to be more regular but 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:18.519
 by coincidence or not I do not know 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.620
 the two jobs I got here in 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.840
 New York was the job if I 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.060
 get by myself I went after the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.610
 companies are after you send a 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.460
 email to a million businesses that you 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.810
 either he is a friend and sometimes they are 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.880
 interview who call you 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.930
 interview directly on the phone 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.640
 So you do an interview by 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.400
 phone or you the skype interview 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.870
 and it is very important when you should 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.030
 grow the supply because one 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.460
 achieves very well at least one 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.220
 question about the stages were 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.830
 whether or not one of the internships is 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.360
 other is not paid and what is very 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.910
 hard to happen because here new 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.820
 most of the stages are not 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.640
 because they already consider 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.100
 which is a very good photo vipcomm thing 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.800
 working and having this experience in 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.840
 new york and has on your resume is already the 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.210
 enough 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.660
 I do not know I think that's what you think 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.820
 Give real life I'm not a 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.800
 expert at it I just speaking the 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:24.430

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:27.310

 I want to know in the next videos I already said 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.650
 It's no use asking questions. 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.820

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:39.040
