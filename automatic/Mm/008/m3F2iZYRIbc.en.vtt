00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
finish I use therefore see because it's

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.660 
finish I use therefore see because it's
just<00:02:17.560> no<00:02:18.560> no<00:02:18.769> you<00:02:19.129> can<00:02:19.340> see<00:02:20.739> on<00:02:21.739> his<00:02:22.099> finish<00:02:22.550> too

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
just no no you can see on his finish too

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.460 
just no no you can see on his finish too
though<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:22.849> took<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:23.360> back<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.780> spiral<00:02:24.260> tell

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
though I took you back the spiral tell

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.910 
though I took you back the spiral tell
man<00:02:24.890> egg<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.330> what<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:27.200> went<00:02:27.830> it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
man egg it is what it is I went it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.890 
man egg it is what it is I went it
through<00:02:28.099> like<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.640> don't<00:02:29.090> know<00:02:29.360> probably<00:02:29.569> two

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
through like I don't know probably two

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.600 
through like I don't know probably two
hours<00:02:29.930> just<00:02:30.500> trying<00:02:30.709> different<00:02:30.980> stuff<00:02:31.370> and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
hours just trying different stuff and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.809 
hours just trying different stuff and
this<00:02:32.620> realistically<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:34.010> way<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.400> got<00:02:34.640> it

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
this realistically the way that I got it

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.699 
this realistically the way that I got it
is<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.390> best<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:35.989> can<00:02:36.110> be<00:02:36.319> able<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.530> get

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
is the best that you can be able to get

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.460 
is the best that you can be able to get
it<00:02:36.860> because<00:02:37.849> my<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.569> previous<00:02:39.019> where<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.230> had

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
it because my the previous where I had

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.940 
it because my the previous where I had
it<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:40.310> was<00:02:40.400> like<00:02:40.549> a<00:02:40.630> 1/4<00:02:41.630> 50<00:02:42.049> cent<00:02:42.349> on<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.620> mean

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
it it was like a 1/4 50 cent on I mean

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.620 
it it was like a 1/4 50 cent on I mean
add<00:02:43.160> all<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.459> spins<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.030> twist<00:02:44.330> but<00:02:44.540> it

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
add all the spins and the twist but it

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.949 
add all the spins and the twist but it
was<00:02:44.780> still<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:44.989> 450<00:02:45.730> spiral<00:02:46.730> tap<00:02:46.940> it's<00:02:47.690> just<00:02:47.900> a

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
was still a 450 spiral tap it's just a

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.960 
was still a 450 spiral tap it's just a
front<00:02:48.170> flip<00:02:48.319> with<00:02:49.160> spins<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.760> know<00:02:49.880> I'm

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
front flip with spins you know I'm

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.640 
front flip with spins you know I'm
saying<00:02:50.180> well<00:02:50.390> rotations<00:02:50.989> in<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.079> quarter<00:02:51.410> it

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
saying well rotations in the quarter it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.770 
saying well rotations in the quarter it
was<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:51.860> whatnot<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:52.489> but<00:02:53.090> one<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.329> I<00:02:53.420> got<00:02:53.599> on

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
was and whatnot so but one that I got on

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.470 
was and whatnot so but one that I got on
here<00:02:54.730> doesn't<00:02:55.730> look<00:02:55.849> all<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.000> glamorous

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
here doesn't look all that glamorous

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.240 
here doesn't look all that glamorous
because<00:02:56.870> there's<00:02:57.079> not<00:02:57.230> really<00:02:57.560> much<00:03:00.250> options

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
because there's not really much options

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.100 
because there's not really much options
as<00:03:02.060> far<00:03:02.090> as<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.930> know<00:03:03.489> rotations<00:03:04.489> go<00:03:04.760> but<00:03:05.690> like

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
as far as you know rotations go but like

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.110 
as far as you know rotations go but like
I<00:03:06.260> said<00:03:06.319> it's<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.769> most<00:03:06.799> realistic<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.819> then

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
I said it's the most realistic and then

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.569 
I said it's the most realistic and then
