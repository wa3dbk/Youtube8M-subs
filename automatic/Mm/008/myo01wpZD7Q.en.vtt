Xbox<00:01:15.540> has<00:01:15.689> happened<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> them<00:01:16.290> about<00:01:16.799> two<00:01:17.310> or

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
Xbox has happened to them about two or

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.740 
Xbox has happened to them about two or
three<00:01:17.580> days<00:01:17.700> before<00:01:18.210> they<00:01:18.390> actually<00:01:18.509> got

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
three days before they actually got

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.810 
three days before they actually got
before<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> nap<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.590> released<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.610> I'm

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
before the nap was released so I'm

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
before the nap was released so I'm
thinking<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.570> maybe<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.170> are<00:01:22.590> getting<00:01:22.920> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
thinking that maybe we are getting it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.730 
thinking that maybe we are getting it
earlier<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> month<00:01:24.780> after<00:01:24.990> because

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
earlier but then a month after because

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.830 
earlier but then a month after because
normally<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> month<00:01:26.490> after<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.659> I'm

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
normally it's a month after so I'm

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.899 
normally it's a month after so I'm
pretty<00:01:28.350> excited<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.979> hear<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.549> official

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
pretty excited to hear the official

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.280 
pretty excited to hear the official
release<00:01:30.090> date<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:30.689> pretty<00:01:30.869> sure<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.140> heard

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
release date but I'm pretty sure I heard

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.450

that<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.770> was<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.430> 28th<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.150> 26<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.840> 27

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
that it was the 28th or 26 to 27
