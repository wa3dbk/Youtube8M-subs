back and I do have fluid and you have
the<00:01:20.060> feeling<00:01:20.390> though<00:01:20.479> that<00:01:20.510> after<00:01:20.960> this<00:01:21.920> is

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
the feeling though that after this is

the feeling though that after this is
the<00:01:22.510> fourth<00:01:23.510> match<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.020> Philippines<00:01:24.409> are

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
playing and what I just think they

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.649 
playing and what I just think they
should<00:01:27.920> have<00:01:28.130> done<00:01:28.400> better<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:29.240> sussing<00:01:29.570> out

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
should have done better in sussing out

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:30.940 
should have done better in sussing out
