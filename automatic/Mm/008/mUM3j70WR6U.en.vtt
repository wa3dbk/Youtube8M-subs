00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.190
 Hi will make about the 11th generation server family 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.169
 I will continue to love you. 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.619
 The management company monitors power consumption. 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:16.320
 It was difficult. 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.340
 This product not only monitors 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.340
 We can designate up to Hawaii camp to be cheap. 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.839
 Is this function important? 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.460
 Depending on the situation of Korean idc 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.119
 I can reduce the strategy of getting in 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.520
 The problem is that I installed the server and came to Korea. 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.370
 Some of us. 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.820
 Cloning will make purchases shut down. 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.110
 When another company's product revives, the entire system 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.240
 The story will change when it goes down. 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.310
 As a developer capable of disposing of nuclear weapons, 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.310
 It is now. 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.320
 It's my point. 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.230
 If you configure memory hard disk hdd, etc. 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.950
 Power consumption and heat generation through online 2 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.170
 to provide 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.320
 If you install a dropped data center or a new server 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.960
 It makes energy efficiency easier than traditional servers. 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.350
 It provides services that can be measured comparatively 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.710
 Virtualization performance is about that compared to traditional PowerEdge servers 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.890
 Higher 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.610
 5,500 more than Intel Xeon 5400 series 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.940
 The memory controller in the cpu, 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.780
 Memory and cpu performance has improved significantly 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 In the case of virtualization 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.630
 Make a lot of physical servers logically 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.460
 It will increase resource utilization on cpu. 

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:51.660
 In the past, I talked about Croft. 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.340
 It is born with memory and 160,000 won line generation 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 It's the most delicious and loaded with more. 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.890
 kfc man 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.700
 Coach If you have integrated your existing courier physical server as planned 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.219
 It is now. It's possible to integrate from six to bat. 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.139
 Of course, it's only a theoretical number. 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.359
 Besides, my high-class hotel challenge burned the server job. 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.519
 Now that you have spread to the converters and integrated your physical servers 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.999
 The CPU and utilization have increased, but the network bandwidth 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.019
 I did not cut it. 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.019
 In preparation for the portal, 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.039
 The US-ROK Strategic Performance Performance and Performance 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:38.089
 As you can see from the graph, if an existing product does 1,715 jobs, 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.829
 I can see now that I work more than twice as many as 30-40 years. 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:42.759
 I know. 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.439
 You can do more with less energy consumption 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.699
 Informs 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.759
 While the cost of introducing a new server is lower than before 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.309
 Opposite costs are moving in the opposite direction. 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:59.189
 Not only is there a lot of room to find operational costs, 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:02.909
 How quickly can I do my job 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.599
 Japan knows how many servers can be managed 10 times. 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.529
 That's it. 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:11.169
 In other words, how many servers can be consolidated and managed? 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:13.229
 That's the point. 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.419
 Already lpl is elected with the management console 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.909
 Representative camp is an open management system 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.909
 Integrating world-class systems management solutions. 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.679
 The management console can reduce the number of manual 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.499
 By eliminating the time and cost of cutting more strategic 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:36.129
 It can be used for 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.329
 If you listen to an explanation of the concerned experts 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.329
 I will finish the feature analysis on the server. 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.019
 It seems to be opponent 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.209
 Recent recognition 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.909
 In the series 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.939
 writing to the main 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.849
 Green Cross wine 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:54.909
 I'm hiding. 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.909
 The weapon was daring. 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.389
 On the server 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.279
 Through kimchi 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:08.200
 If you have all the railways as your main axis, 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.669
 With information 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.539
 Even if you do not blow, 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.969
 It is a gentle to see who can paint it 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.239
 Because it was excluded 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.699
 Moderate comments 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:20.229
 It was confirmed. 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.430
 So in terms of usage, the last 10 countries 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.899
 In terms of functionality 

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:27.050
 There are citizens. 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.679
 Find the features you want and refresh yourself
