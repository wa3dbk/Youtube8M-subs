00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.980
 obviously remember to throw him will be what 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.200
 either towards the tube or the bowl of 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.020
 drawer because to begin with they can scratch 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.860
 more your devils and one of 23 can 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.040
 take him in front and you have to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.570
 well the double that is the trick 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.130
 basic as far as the rails are concerned 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.410
 to make a good son and at the moment of 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.480
 match what reloads be your devil 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.370
 back or the front devil like you 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.350
 You are as you see and as a couple if you leave 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.630
 both of you to lean on your pedal or 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.790
 do not lean on just let it slip and at 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.809
 moment of that part is equal a slight 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.820
 bony but to the other side 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.879
 making sure you get the two devils 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.160
 so you do not hit the boni depends 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.110
 of the drawer that wants to climb good either 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.050
 one small one big one as long as 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.390
 in pairs and reach you devils reach 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.790
 to pass in the box well then in the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.650
 hoax me it makes me much easier to tour 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.540
 a great game of 90 degrees before that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.640
 leave the bowl and reload again then 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.740
 your foot because that's how you're going to leave you are not going to 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.030
 continue to support or anything but not what 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.369
 Recharge is a lot because you can go 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.350
 out to clarify the bowl not 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.580
 it's as much as simply matching in 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.140
 how much you want the 90 degrees 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.170
 both centering more or less at the same 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.750
 time at the time of entering simply 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.450
 is to fold your hand opened 90 degrees towards 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.340
 inside the bowl and let yourself go how 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.230
 you want to do slipping I suggest 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.150
 take the curve of the bowl 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.280
 student's moment will be the parallel 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.550
 of the wall you push your bike with your 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.830
 arms and either appointment as it is recharged 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.870
 your pedal I do not recommend it recommended that 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.570
 there was only the bike before and at the moment of 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.450
 getting in is the same 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.930
 to make the double stick a tube what 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.970
 I recommend starting in a flat tube and 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.620
 there the same as the drawer is that you 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.630
 accommodate with entering with the devil behind 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.330
 or with the devil in front nothing is that there 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.110
 it's very difficult to recharge your pedal is more 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.110
 balance issue 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.580
 a week of cyclical 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.180
 very confusing 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.840
 they went up a lot this
