the only phone that this will work with

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.700

is<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> flip<00:00:47.940> phone<00:00:48.180> you're<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.469> going

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
to be able to use the unlimited data if

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.260 
to be able to use the unlimited data if
you<00:00:52.920> really<00:00:53.340> feel<00:00:53.610> you're<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> be

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you really feel you're going to be

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.660 
you really feel you're going to be
talking<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.960> more<00:00:55.199> than<00:00:55.410> 8<00:00:55.649> hours<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.190> 20

minutes per month which is 500 minutes

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.189 
minutes per month which is 500 minutes
then<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.789> should<00:00:59.969> avoid<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.539> $50<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> month
