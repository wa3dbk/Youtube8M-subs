 from this part below 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.640
 to join the pieces in this way 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.770

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.400
 workpiece over the entire circumference to 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.709
 get to this side leaving this opening 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.350
 to fill the piece and since the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:21.990
 region we have closed then I will 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.980
 keep sewing to fill my piece and 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.980
 start decorating 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.480

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.920

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.050

 cupcakes we put 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.239
 sometimes they are very easy to apply 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.730
 only we pass the thread through the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:39.430
 and we return it equally for the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.430
