00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
system and I know that may sound like a

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.220 
system and I know that may sound like a
bullet<00:03:58.100> point<00:03:58.430> on<00:03:58.519> a<00:03:58.550> fact<00:03:58.850> sheet<00:03:59.120> but<00:03:59.840> in<00:04:00.019> this

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.300 
the game's phenomenal sense of pace
you're<00:05:05.630> never<00:05:05.990> without<00:05:06.229> something<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.890> do<00:05:07.070> and

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
you're never without something to do and

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.430 
you're never without something to do and
it's<00:05:07.700> not<00:05:07.789> a<00:05:07.849> short<00:05:08.120> game<00:05:08.330> 8<00:05:08.510> either<00:05:08.810> like<00:05:09.200> if

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
it's not a short game 8 either like if

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.920 
it's not a short game 8 either like if
you<00:05:09.560> play<00:05:09.740> it

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
you play it

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.870 
you play it
hardest<00:05:10.199> difficulty<00:05:10.699> assuming<00:05:11.699> you're<00:05:11.789> not

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
hardest difficulty assuming you're not

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.460 
hardest difficulty assuming you're not
just<00:05:12.060> rushing<00:05:12.270> through<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.930> should<00:05:13.080> probably

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
just rushing through it should probably

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.620 
just rushing through it should probably
take<00:05:13.650> around<00:05:13.860> 20<00:05:14.070> hours<00:05:14.370> to<00:05:14.610> be<00:05:14.759> so<00:05:15.180> even<00:05:15.449> with

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
take around 20 hours to be so even with

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.110 
take around 20 hours to be so even with
such<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:15.960> lengthy<00:05:16.470> single-player<00:05:17.400> campaign<00:05:17.880> I

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
such a lengthy single-player campaign I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.390 
such a lengthy single-player campaign I
still<00:05:18.810> left<00:05:19.289> my<00:05:19.470> first<00:05:19.710> playthrough<00:05:19.949> and

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
still left my first playthrough and

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.939 
still left my first playthrough and
wanted<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.060> immediately<00:05:21.690> play<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.110> again<00:05:22.289> so<00:05:22.919> I

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
wanted to immediately play it again so I

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.499 
wanted to immediately play it again so I
think<00:05:23.220> that's<00:05:23.460> a<00:05:23.580> pretty<00:05:23.729> good<00:05:23.910> sign<00:05:24.120> as<00:05:24.360> to

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
think that's a pretty good sign as to

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:25.999 
think that's a pretty good sign as to
how<00:05:24.660> how<00:05:24.960> good<00:05:25.199> this<00:05:25.320> game<00:05:25.530> actually<00:05:25.770> is

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
how how good this game actually is

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.499 
how how good this game actually is
because<00:05:26.430> there's<00:05:26.729> so<00:05:26.850> many<00:05:26.940> things<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.300> do

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
because there's so many things to do

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:28.999 
because there's so many things to do
during<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.840> gameplay<00:05:28.080> that<00:05:28.500> even<00:05:28.800> once<00:05:28.949> you

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
during the gameplay that even once you

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.040 
during the gameplay that even once you
know<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.310> whole<00:05:29.430> story<00:05:29.580> line<00:05:29.970> you<00:05:30.780> still<00:05:30.930> want

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
know the whole story line you still want

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.420 
know the whole story line you still want
to<00:05:31.080> go<00:05:31.139> through<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.650> just<00:05:31.740> check<00:05:32.070> out<00:05:32.190> what
