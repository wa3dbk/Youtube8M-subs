Hey Cookaholics, Chef Kendra here and today
we’re making something really delicious

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.309
and we’re going to make our slow cooker
do just about all the work for us. Cause we

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.259
run this kitchen. So let’s do what we do.
Let’s head to the kitchen and make it happen.

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:25.050
OK guys, let’s gear up. I love this brand
of canned tomatoes and they’re tomato paste.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.070
No, this is not an ad for these boys I just
happen to like them. Nice rich, deep flavor

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.070
in these. So this has an India type spin to
so if you like India food, which is a fantastically

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.500
delicious and complex cuisine, you’re going
to enjoy.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.760
We’ve lightly toasted our garam masala in
a dry pan for a couple of minutes. Now we’re

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.820
going to a lot of stuff to our slow cooker.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.730
We’re adding some crushed tomatoes, tomato
paste, chopped onions and garlic. Salt and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.050
pepper. Our toasted spices and give it a good
stir. Then we’re adding our chicken thighs,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.280
which are skinless, boneless and sliced into
large strips to our crock pot. Then we’re

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.890
going to stir that up really well.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.080
Of course you can use chicken breast in this
dish, it’s your kitchen do what you want.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.130
You know what this would go great with? You
don’t, we’ll I’ll tell you then. This

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.750
on point naan bread I showed ya’ll how to
make back in the day. 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720
We’re giving this its final stir before
we slap the lid on this boy and let it work

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.720
for us. Now you have choices, jack this thing
to high and it’ll be done in about 4 hours

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.720
or slide the dial to low and let it do it’s
thing for 6-8 hours.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.580
Now we’re making a cool little relish to
go with our dish, we have sliced cucumber

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.880
in this yellow bowl. We’re adding some salt,
pepper, chopped cilantro and lemon juice.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.009
Once that’s in there we’re going to stir
it up, cover it in plastic wrap and let the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.880
flavors mingle together.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.880
Yo, grab this recipe at chefkendraseasycooking.com,
you know I got you.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.920
Let’s unleash the beast. I hope my camera
survives all the goodness.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.920
Alright, the next thing we’re going to do
is pour in some heavy whipping cream and give

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.570
our masterpiece it’s final stir. Now while
