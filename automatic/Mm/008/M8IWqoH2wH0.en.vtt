00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.899
 here is jannik from android videos de 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.639
 and I want to play them there today 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.639
 introduce ross dikmen epic 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.920
 At the beginning of the game, they are here 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.590
 a stick figure drawn and one 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.510
 person you should find it is one 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.750
 friend is specified here this should 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.090
 she just sometimes and as much as at 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.920
 they should be super mario then 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.160
 People are looking for and need to get involved 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.450
 through different levels 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.100
 So they have the two 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.070
 main characters actually themselves 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.980
 created and there are just then 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.260
 to master many different levels like that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 that's tapping the outline map 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.219
 Just put them on the field 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.460
 they have not done so then 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.899
 just to start the desired level 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.140
 So you see, here's really 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.129
 also a bit of creativity required 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.930
 or they can actually 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 control your own game more or 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.119
 less as she already has the characters 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.680
 have set as you control her 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.259
 Male simply by going somewhere 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 tap and they're down here right now 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.490
 One pen can be in several others 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.939
 level there are more and more donors 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.360
 his 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.610
 in this case it is only one 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.259
 this one has a key on it 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.450
 So that means that pen 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.150
 key so you can type 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.040
 on the pen and catch my 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.119
 to draw keys so when finished 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.119
 then just hack 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.450
 and then your person can 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.170
 pick up the key and enter the lock 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.710
 bring just to open the gate so 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.329
 it's open now and 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.649
 you have to look in every level 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.590
 to hold a cave 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.200
 in addition to the access to the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.880
 next level I'll try it 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.799
 you go on okay there is one 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.630
 monster that seems to leave me here 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.910
 not through 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.230
 Okay, that means there's something on the right 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.720
 No, I have to go now 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.120
 here left pasture and here is 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.530
 again a gate that I of course 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.060
 Now open again with a key 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.769
 can 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.349
 Here on the top right they are already there 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.209
 monster the monster are allowed 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.120
 Of course not too close because 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.530
 if that happens, it can happen too 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.769
 Flintstone is when she is now 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.260
 probably the same and just see 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.970
 if that happens then they die 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.489
 I really can play in the game 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.680
 easily die partially when they enter 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.180
 thunderstorms produce what with 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.799
 other pens is also possible and 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.440
 just run into the flash 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:51.489
 then they can just die then 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.349
 I'll show you that again 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.930
 fire looks so here is it 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.670
 played fire 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.840
 the person has already been 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.459
 red highlighted it just indicated that 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.849
 I just risked dying 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.730
 would 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.489
 Up here it was such an obstacle 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.489
 It just happened because of that 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.690
 the monster has just played fire 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.799
 and thus here the construction 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.180
 collapsed and the stone is 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.810
 just fallen under the monster 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.150
 met 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.709
 So it is now death is still seeking 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.430
 a little bit but it can not do them any more 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.889
 wear 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.930
 here is ne crate look what 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.519
 in this box tunis i try 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.959
 just once with the same key 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.519
 a robot ok the robot is on here 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.919
 the page also such a tie times 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.669
 key is smooth I think if 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:44.829
 i call new key bauer then 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.720
 that should also be fusion so i am 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.419
 not the size of the artists like you 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.359
 I can see it again 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:54.549
 robot on and what happens ok moves 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:58.030
 yourself and then jump under well then well 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.709
 So that's the best one 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.069
 just by tapping the control 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.720
 Of course it is very easy 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.430
 and yes the whole world just appears in 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.449
 This comic style looks like it's all there 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.790
 am drawn 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:11.769
 then I send as a number on the blog 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.790
 on the robot and look something now 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.570
 passes a piece continues again 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.260
 I go on it again 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.320
 okay , a key is gone and that 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.990
 robot 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.500
 okay the gtc's robot in the hole 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.020
 his 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.570
 the monster has now just 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.950
 employment with the robot and there is 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.030
 just the cave entrance of 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.240
 I spoke to 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.710
 I'm now just pure and the 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.710
 I've just finished level 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.540
 it would also be the new level here 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.130
 appear 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.050
 I could be there, but I could do it 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.180
 first now think that's enough for him 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.130
 for a small insight into the game to go 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.530
 They should also be in level yet 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.140
 puzzle pieces find the some levels 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.490
 or are hidden in the levels 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.440
 Of course they are not easy 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.700
 I also have an in here 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.980
 I have the second one now 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.320
 puzzle pieces found the traffic lights but 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.130
 not yet they should of course then 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.720
 just do it at the end 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.520
 your girlfriend or your friend you 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.980
 to have painted at the beginning 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.650
 yes I really like the game so much 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.720
 good if you like so maybe 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.800
 You do not think of him as a stick man 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.590
 then you can downstairs 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.510
 go attitudes and on the drugs 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.750
 and then you can just do it here 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:36.680
 stich male neumann 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:38.900
 I just have to do something like that 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.120
 for example, and there they are 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.690
 now her new stitch munich 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.100
 created 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.040
 yes I think that's not the case 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.690
 exactly succeeded but well in the year as it 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.330
 really makes a lot of fun with the 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.000
 different pens here to play 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.220
 and yes so its world to change it 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.270
 would be nice if it were in real life too 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.400
 would give something like that 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.020
 but that is of course inherent here and 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.280
 plays but I also like it from the 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.650
 graphic works very well with the comic art 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.470
 how the whole lives like the whole world 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.700
 Thank you for being drawn 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.700
 and until the next video 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.220
 suffering means that means I can do it here 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.050
 First, a way for them to miss 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:28.680
 Weighing as you like in the beginning 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.680
 signals a caught
