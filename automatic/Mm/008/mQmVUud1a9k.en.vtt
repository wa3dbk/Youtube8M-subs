00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:13.429
 here are some brushes and honda that's the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.429
 rock and x25 or if not better 1425 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:23.369
 good here is the machine fully 4 times 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:28.349
 with so with so low the valves in 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.580
 head to unleash so a coelho game 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.810
 reserve adule contrary to the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.329
 engine operation this guy who 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.790
 contain and mix the lozÃ¨re die 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.750
 it's the same, which is a good point 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.770
 to be able to put oil of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.980
 conviction as I did directly 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.550
 when I give him ten cents 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.190
 in after all the rest by chance he 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.949
 made 50 centilitres after it's a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.270
 filter with ronnie do integrate so 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.050
 there the filter to his candid pairs 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.140
 circular and sniffs art that is 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.790
 find under the subset of interest 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.810
 compass perceive i see you tube good 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.920
 now we will start 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.330
 since it is already hot 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:20.149
 happily reach you and then if that 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:22.759
 internally spa tech so the starter in 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:29.509
 closed position open thursday in paris 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:32.110
 happened yesterday button stop to run and 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.110
 pro second start 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.400
 without writing and 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.130
 m 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.170
 the boot smoothly as one 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.420
 just saw him and then despite that 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.030
 is that this week for an engine 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.069
 of origin in motoculture is 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.540
 relatively poses on the recovery 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.010
 once it's gone it 's fine 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.500
 when he is when he has to be he will 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.489
 Marc all that's not the top 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.280
 so yeah that's terrible this term 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.510
 expects real micromotors that being 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.940
 frankly it's first of all makes me that 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.549
 good intimate photos - before fishing 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.480
 too much of a wheel coming and to the bikers 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.910
 otherwise it's a little bomb a little bit more 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.660
 high than the time activity but that 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.690
 walk harder 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.459
 it is 810 watts and it consumes less 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.170
 because there are no gas losses 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.239
 to talk by the exhaust when the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.860
 phase ii during the operation of the 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.349
 2-stroke engine that he's dropped a 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.830
 part liga would see technology 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.519
 the technology where it is 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.140
 frankly I did not think I would say 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.980
 it's lucas time but thank you 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.980
 for a culture it's top
