00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.600
 today we are going to make a pokémon but good 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.670
 with anybody I will do my pokemon 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.410
 this idea is not mine the idea comes from 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.270
 one of the videos of the magical asshole 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.460
 that actually came to me through 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.900
 a video 8 by javi creating his own 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.309
 ship mont first I recommend seeing the 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.110
 video of magical asshole so that 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.150
 see how the pokémons of today are made 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.340
 in day and second I recommend watching the video 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.680
 of happy so you can see how they should 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.600
 be the pokémons of today and said 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.550
 what we said we started with my love let's touch 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.410
 first step we made an engraving with 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.449
 the eyes closed well already done something with 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.039
 my life second step we fill in from 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.899
 of scribbles the holes so that we 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.519
 something decent the third step 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.229
 It should be color but I'm sorry 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.999
 I'm so bad coloring as the same 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:41.499
 courting a beautiful demi will be more 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:43.239
 I should have made it a computer but it's 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.979
 I do not even have a bitch any tablet 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.539
 graphic and I have no fucking idea 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.069
 how to use it and if it does not get colored in the 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.749
 real life imagine on the computer 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:51.219
 Come on, it's the plan to come and graze 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.719
 well imagine that this pokemon is 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.399
 in black and white it is worth if we put 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.839
 the tragic ones if you do me a big favor 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.609
 imagine that it is from the first game boy 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.229
 when there was nothing to color normally 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.940
 the pokemon are usually a drawing of a 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.709
 quite childish stroke that was the idea 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.420
 make it childish but in the end it has come out 

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:05.650
 quite the opposite and now surely 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.580
 when you are asking what 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.650
 aberrations 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.690
 Well, this piece of 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.610
 aberration has a mustache a goatee 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.710
 some eyebrows quite populated some eyes 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.390
 pretty well marked a bangs 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.950
 that is denoted up there and some 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.480
 scales that go from the part of 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.830
 forward of the head to the part 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.510
 back of the hump and also like 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.860
 you can see it has an ear and some 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.450
 gills from the back of the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.640
 same ear that does not make sense that 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.650
 mazda or not if it has truth 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.510
 kinds of water type but it's not kind 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.160
 electric only has one arm the 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.900
 left and because supposedly a fish 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.670
 He has ears and a support arm is looking for him 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.650
 the logic of the same as my car was a 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.270
 artificial pokémon this pokemon also 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.920
 is what I took it from me or 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.660
 this pokemon got him out trying 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.860
 cross a trout and a baby lined 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.330
 you will also wonder why he has 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.400
 one leg and one wheel to the right 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.500
 well then we go as the integral for 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.150
 parts of the fish wanted to be mechanical but 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.890
 his mother told him not putting the 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.720
 typical excuse that only such posters 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.160
 to mechanics if you wear one of my 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.170
 skirts and things for the neighborhood above 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.300
 down even though it cost you some 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.580
 he scoffed at it because his desire to be 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.320
 mechanical was greater than any other 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.420
 thing so when he did what his mother 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.130
 I challenge him to do his mother swallowed his 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.050
 words and told him hereinafter 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.820
 mechanical with such bad luck that going down 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.750
 the stairs stumbled and a ball of 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.760
 bowling fell from the sky 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.560
 I notice impotent mother saw as her 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.690
 son could not walk and could not meet 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.220
 his dream of being a mechanic so he asked 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.050
 that will install a wheel in the part 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.270
 right of your body so that your 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.950
 son can always have his dream inside 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.660
 of his body but obviously he is not 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.430
 they installed well for that is the being 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.380
 mechanic has to fix it every 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.360
 two times three because it 's point addiction 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.930
 to ass but still leads all about 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.910
 wheels 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.890
 that is why to walk you have to 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.110
 supported by a rod from atop their 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.940
 creators saw the will power of 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.920
 this little being so from that 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.630
 moment all their peers would take 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.400
 as a right leg a wheel 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.170
 dismayed and said creators 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.730
 they provide the destination bar a 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.410
 bar with the tip of a pen that 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.850
 it gives off ink and the other part has 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.620
 hung a bowling ball the two 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.000
 metaphorical consensuses is called the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.350
 destination bar because the part 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.330
 in front you can tell that at a stroke 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.130
 you can go all to shit and part 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.989
 from behind can tell you what things 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.640
 can go all to shit to the first being 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.350
 a bowling ball fell on the ground 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.120
 but to them after dropping a ball of 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.640
 bowling in the head and now it reaches the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.770
 part of because it's electric this is the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.300
 Step 4 Add a meaningless background 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.430
 due to his great disability for 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.810
 defend themselves they prayed they begged and pleaded 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.700
 to the god of war 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.800
 a method to protect yourself but you 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.349
 they were wrong and instead of praying you are god 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.090
 of the war they prayed to god of the gods 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.160
 downloads and that's why the ball of 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.319
 bowls hits an electric shock of 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.819
 jail to leg down and dark so I 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.349
 You want me to tell you this story 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.000
 inventing at tuntún and that the drawing 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.500
 is made from the scribble that I 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.790
 has left the tip of the dome 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.590
 you remember that you have that the drawing does not 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.030
 it was childish not good so you can 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.220
 see for yourself if this is a 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.870
 pokémon I am juggernaut I know that as 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.700
 this is nothing like a pokémon what 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.050
 what I've done has been pokemon hoist what I've 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.370
 caught the drawing that has come out from 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.200
 Scribble and all I've done has 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.000
 been infantilize the figure we're not going 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.680
 to stop calling him figure fifth step to 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.420
 name your pokemon and that's how it 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.410
 makes it easy by giving him a string of 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.410
 headbuttons to the keyboard 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.130
 well this has come together well to the world 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.989
 pokemon cubes perfect the pokemon comes 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.670
 from Poland and to conclude my process of 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.530
 creation infantilized the pokemon and you 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.790
 we put your own name welcome are you 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.620
 you go 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.940
 fuck is that the name is horrible better 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.560
 we leave that name as the name 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.449
 etymological and we put a nickname 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.370
 Welcome to the world that more than the type 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.750
 electrical and this stays so this 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.280
 what I've done seems a little clear 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.650
 that not the new generation for 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.650
 me neither come to dance
