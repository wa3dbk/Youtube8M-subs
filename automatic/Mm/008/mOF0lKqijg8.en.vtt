00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.180
 Six magistrates get tired love 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.860
 and a 6 more 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:00.710
 and this little one you have here is from 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.790
 rap to the brand slips I use it to 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.790
 great for pike 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.230
 I advise you to use it better 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.800
 from boat as it deepens 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.660
 a lot and it's easier to get hooked on 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.220
 the shore teques 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.700
 here has a pike bite so that 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.870
 you see the assets that he took the hook 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.870
 and it's quite effective 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.860
 in the few angelic bridges used 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.570
 with a lot of fish with him 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:39.230
 well now let's see this herb 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.320
 geological decathlon is cheap it seems 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.550
 that today of the decathlon and do not buy it 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.620
 but this gives a quantity of fish 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.350
 impressive since you get to the two 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.280
 meters two and a half meters so 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:00.340
 depth but this color is very very 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:03.470
 effective especially strawberry in strawberry and 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.369
 when the bases are somewhat hard what 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.649
 you catch snows they catch it pretty well on 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.280
 hotel was already fishing with this in a 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.630
 area that makes the class is very touched 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:22.370
 if we take four or five fish each 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.489
 and a half size back we took some 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.220
 ramp that other but we draw two bases of 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.070
 1 500 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.560
 they went very well that day we are going to do 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:38.760
 we are going to give these first so 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.760
 we have here now this gentleman 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.230
 It has the color that I love this color 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.680
 is going very well for both white and 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:52.550
 it looked like the color when it gives the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.350
 sun does a kind of flashes yes 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.780
 to show it off I have a little bit bigger 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.569
 he uses it more for the part he has 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.430
 and his bite 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.010
 is another of the young men we made 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.400
 using the other day when we are in 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.400
 White 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.950
 well again with this one of the shovel 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.900
 if the notaries is a bit has here the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.270
 hole where they have the leads and such 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:25.620
 and very much the two were very much and nothing this one 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.810
 has here that camouflages the hook emits 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.300
 many flashes by this species these 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.270
 scales in silver it has and then 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.310
 yellow a lot of color variety this is 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.840
 the best metro what deepens not 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.630
 a lot but the pikes too and they 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.870
 I really like this color sounds like you see 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:52.680
 a lot and nothing is going well enough if not 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.660
 I have no complaint about the size for 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.080
 me perfect this one you can use 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.220
 from shore not as much deepens 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:05.020
 we are going to hook 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:08.470
 and nothing because you are perfect 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.990
 I'm from the brand ra for this one too what 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.500
 what we have is decathlon looks like this 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.019
 color alburnos of the case 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.019
 the truth that we have just started 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.019
 with the deepen to a meter 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.450
 for just got to try but I think 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.560
 that dad will also have to live for 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.710
 the neighborhood 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.480
 I have tried and it is not with many fish 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.410
 but they move very well these this that 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.710
 I have not said is flunked this also 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.960
 and this also those pendin this when 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.040
 they stop it for a long time it rises to the surface 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.410
 and then when picking up it goes on like this 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.590
 is moving very abruptly and goes to 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.500
 the background does not sound less, but 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.010
 this sound attracts fish 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.230
 bigger I go I give advice that if 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.210
 I'm going down base without marshes and that 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:13.539
 are lowering assets that you give 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.780
 a little bit, do not stop for 34 seconds and 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:19.449
 you give it back because that technique 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.870
 I do I was going very very very well for 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.870
 plasmas 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.479
 We have to the registry your solo that as 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.840
 You see, it has fringes 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:36.340
 the sorrow 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:40.000
 we use it to talk sometimes and not 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:43.750
 they welcome him very well that guy this is 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.919
 rather prepared for bar for 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.320
 any predator species sported go 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.500
 lucioperca good the two for which 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.800
 It has a lot of vibration mystery 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.190
 for days with a lot 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.819
 a lot of air that the water is very 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:06.030
 cloudy and this is going to save us a 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:09.270
 lost day this color is also very 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.430
 good because very versatile is worth 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.220
 money for any day or not as 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.419
 others that goes better when the when 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.849
 sunny 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.710
 it's nicer more sunny or more 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:23.699
 dark because this is a kind of 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.849
 swim with a kind of bathrobe for 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:29.849
 the white experts and the flashes that 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:33.360
 hits the shovel and generally goes pretty 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:35.580
 well this is for bases and the fish is 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.129
 quite bigger than with that which is 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.319
 much smaller but this one too 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:43.830
 we used for the announced that he was 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:46.030
 more and it looked that more for abbas but 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.520
 enter quite 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.520
 it seems that the bleeding body by the 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.720
 These fringes have oranges but 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.690
 they go very well for predatory fish 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:01.150
 the bases draw many with these is pulled out 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:04.560
 quantity and spot basis when 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.560
 pass are very active 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.990
 It also issues as the other has 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:12.050
 the smallest ones but it emits a lot of 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:15.580
 them six look about would do it the 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.580
 camera without being seen well 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.409
 we are our lords of these 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.110
 are our masters of depth that 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:24.980
 we use mostly in all our 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.870
 fishing day 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:31.430
 and also I hope you like this video 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:35.320
 and a greeting and sign on channel one 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.320
 greeting and r7 aledo min
