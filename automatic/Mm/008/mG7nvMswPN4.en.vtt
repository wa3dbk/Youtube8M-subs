Blackbeard algae causes algae in my tank

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.800 
Blackbeard algae causes algae in my tank
with<00:01:11.039> a<00:01:11.159> co2<00:01:11.630> imbalance

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
with a co2 imbalance

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.379 
with a co2 imbalance
I<00:01:12.840> had<00:01:13.259> DIY<00:01:13.799> co2<00:01:14.130> check<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.789> video<00:01:15.029> out<00:01:15.060> right

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:15.389 
I had DIY co2 check the video out right

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:18.859 
I had DIY co2 check the video out right
here<00:01:15.779> I<00:01:15.810> had<00:01:16.229> DIY<00:01:16.709> co2<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.579> this<00:01:17.849> tank<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:18.420> when

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
here I had DIY co2 on this tank and when

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.859 
here I had DIY co2 on this tank and when
it<00:01:18.959> ran<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:20.069> co2<00:01:20.689> parts-per-million

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it ran out of the co2 parts-per-million

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.089 
it ran out of the co2 parts-per-million
the<00:01:22.799> concentrated<00:01:23.579> co2<00:01:23.999> in<00:01:24.329> my<00:01:24.539> water<00:01:25.099> went

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:26.099 
the concentrated co2 in my water went

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:27.889 
the concentrated co2 in my water went
down<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.729> triggered<00:01:27.060> black<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.539> algae

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
down and it triggered black your algae

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.370 
down and it triggered black your algae
to<00:01:28.049> grow<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.969> lot<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.779> people<00:01:30.990> try<00:01:31.109> to<00:01:31.169> kill

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
to grow so a lot of people try to kill

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.019 
to grow so a lot of people try to kill
the<00:01:31.469> stuff<00:01:31.679> you<00:01:31.889> buy<00:01:32.069> using<00:01:32.279> blackouts<00:01:32.880> is

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:33.029 
the stuff you buy using blackouts is

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:34.629 
the stuff you buy using blackouts is
when<00:01:33.209> you<00:01:33.270> turn<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.630> lights<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.169> and

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:34.639 
when you turn your lights out and

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:37.760 
when you turn your lights out and
basically<00:01:35.639> you<00:01:36.179> try<00:01:36.419> to<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.749> know<00:01:36.899> don't<00:01:37.709> let

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
basically you try to you know don't let

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.099 
basically you try to you know don't let
the<00:01:37.919> algae<00:01:38.249> photosynthesize<00:01:38.659> it's<00:01:39.659> not<00:01:39.899> going

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
the algae photosynthesize it's not going

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.519 
the algae photosynthesize it's not going
to<00:01:40.169> work<00:01:40.349> because<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:41.099> stuff<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.849> just

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:42.529 
to work because this stuff it's just

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:45.019 
to work because this stuff it's just
it's<00:01:43.529> like<00:01:43.619> cockroaches<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.369> can't<00:01:44.729> kill<00:01:44.999> it

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:45.029 
it's like cockroaches you can't kill it

it's like cockroaches you can't kill it
a<00:01:45.239> lot<00:01:46.109> of<00:01:46.139> people<00:01:46.349> will<00:01:46.679> try<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.889> do<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> lot<00:01:47.399> of

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
a lot of people will try to do a lot of

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.849 
a lot of people will try to do a lot of
water<00:01:47.729> changes<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.299> stuff<00:01:48.749> sometimes<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
water changes and stuff sometimes that

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.649 
water changes and stuff sometimes that
works<00:01:50.069> it<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.549> depends<00:01:50.819> on<00:01:50.969> how<00:01:51.090> bad<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.359> case

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
works it all depends on how bad of case

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.239 
works it all depends on how bad of case
you<00:01:51.779> got<00:01:51.929> it<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.529> said<00:01:52.739> I<00:01:52.770> got<00:01:53.039> water

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
you got it like I said I got water

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.699 
you got it like I said I got water
hyacinths<00:01:53.789> in<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.179> just<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.139> know<00:01:55.259> soak<00:01:55.529> up

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
hyacinths in here just you know soak up

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.499 
hyacinths in here just you know soak up
the<00:01:55.829> nutrients<00:01:56.249> to<00:01:56.369> hold<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> back<00:01:56.849> order

the nutrients to hold it back order

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.179 
the nutrients to hold it back order
changes<00:01:57.810> won't<00:01:58.020> kill<00:01:58.289> it<00:01:58.319> it's<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.099> to

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
changes won't kill it it's just going to

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.499 
changes won't kill it it's just going to
hold<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.549> back<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.939> really<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.419> have

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
hold it back you really have to have

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.539 
hold it back you really have to have
three<00:02:00.779> legs<00:02:00.989> to<00:02:01.109> the<00:02:01.229> tables<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.799> just

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
three legs to the tables or just

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.849 
three legs to the tables or just
completely<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.179> co2<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.109> that's<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.770> I'm

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
completely do co2 and that's what I'm

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.099 
completely do co2 and that's what I'm
about<00:02:05.039> to<00:02:05.249> do<00:02:05.429> um<00:02:05.669> you<00:02:06.539> can<00:02:06.689> treat<00:02:06.929> this

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
about to do um you can treat this

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.789 
about to do um you can treat this
through<00:02:07.409> co2<00:02:07.889> either<00:02:08.399> Glick<00:02:08.940> wit<00:02:09.119> or

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
through co2 either Glick wit or

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.740 
through co2 either Glick wit or
pressurize<00:02:10.799> or<00:02:11.039> DIY<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:12.060> trick<00:02:12.329> is<00:02:12.510> you've

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
pressurize or DIY the trick is you've

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.260 
pressurize or DIY the trick is you've
got<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.260> your<00:02:13.379> co2<00:02:13.890> at<00:02:14.010> 30<00:02:14.219> ppm<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.939> have

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
got to have your co2 at 30 ppm and have

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.420 
got to have your co2 at 30 ppm and have
