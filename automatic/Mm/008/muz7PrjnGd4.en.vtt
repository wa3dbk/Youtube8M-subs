 the ground is formed from lahedj to the church 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.690
 it's good so he does not know a little 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.020
 town 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.440
 it's a small village but there are 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.000
 cultures is better you have that 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.560

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.549
 so here we go 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:11.600
 so you'll have this little village there he 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:15.240
 is small but ok ok like that actually 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.170
 of houses and three other buildings 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:24.230
 that's not much after there is a 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:28.710
 another world where to hit lake in the terminal 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:32.400
 generation but your flaws he has to crÃ¨s 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:36.420
 the via the ten times bigger there is a 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.450
 little more stuff but the village is 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.020
 very distorted because of the good because 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.410
 that there are bumps everywhere in fact I 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.250

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.320

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.220
