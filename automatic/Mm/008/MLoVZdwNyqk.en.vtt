playing<00:02:03.330> through<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.660> game<00:02:03.930> four<00:02:04.259> times<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
playing through this game four times I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.590 
playing through this game four times I
think<00:02:05.190> I<00:02:05.340> would<00:02:05.580> know<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:05.940> I'm<00:02:06.090> doing<00:02:06.450> but

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
think I would know what I'm doing but

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.780 
think I would know what I'm doing but
apparently<00:02:07.080> something<00:02:08.070> is<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.520> wrong

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
apparently something is going wrong

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:15.240 
apparently something is going wrong
because<00:02:09.690> look<00:02:10.140> I'm<00:02:10.380> just<00:02:10.730> flying<00:02:11.730> there

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.840 

slightly<00:02:16.060> frustrating<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:18.340> likely<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.370> I

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
slightly frustrating just likely and I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.780 
slightly frustrating just likely and I
think<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.240> time<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.600> quit
