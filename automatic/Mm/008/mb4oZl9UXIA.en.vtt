00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.240
 Hello everyone and welcome back to me 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.580
 channel in today's tutorial let's see 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.120
 how to make our own belt 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.180
 for oriental dance 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.790
 before you get to work take 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.090
 paper and pencil and draw an idea of ​​what 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.590
 what do you want to have as a final result? 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.130
 once you are clear about what it is that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.210
 you want to have take a meter and measure you to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.210
 the height of the hip 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.300
 write down your measurements well because then you 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.300
 will serve to make the pattern 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.670
 I already have my paper prototype as 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.489
 well now try them and if you see that you 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.620
 It looks good perfect that you do not like 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.280
 you are left then it continues to cut a little 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.740
 once you have readjusted everything we are going to 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.770
 pass it to the web 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.149
 place your pattern on the interlining and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.149
 hold it well with pins 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.430
 now that he is well secured he takes a pen 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.870
 or a marker and draws the outline of the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.870
 pattern on interlining 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.570
 since you have it drawn cut out and 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.960
 return everything to try to see what you 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.960
 It seems 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.620
 the hardness of the interlining did not reach me 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.550
 to convince then I took filter cloth 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.910
 a little harder than normal and I went back to 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:23.900
 redo the sash to later join the two 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:26.570
 materials now that we have both 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.480
 pieces we put them one on another and 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.580
 we check that they fit perfectly if 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.330
 it's so perfect let's move on to 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.330
 next step 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.810
 now we are going to proceed to paste the two 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.599
 pieces me in my case like the fabric of the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.599
 thermos fungible the uni with the iron 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.150
 now that we have the raw sash 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.079
 return everything to try to verify that 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.079
 It's perfect for you 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.720
 since we are happy with the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.420
 result then let's proceed finally 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.670
 to the completion the first thing we're going to 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.849
 to do is to take a fabric that we have liked 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.870
 and line it up for the face we want it to 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.090
 stay forward 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.159
 hold the whole contour with pins 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.659
 then proceed to stitch it with a 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.659
 yarn of the same color as the fabric 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.580
 and if I have done it 20 must be left 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.580
 something more or less like this 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:28.240
 do not forget that you have to know him 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.240
 the inner part 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.560
 since you have the outside of the cloth 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.260
 stitched puts the rhinestones and ornaments 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.630
 you want to then put the lining 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.540
 sorry for the lighting but it is that 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.520
 made me at night put everything with 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.600
 pins and sew it with a thread of 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.600
 same color as the lining 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.340
 finally put the zippers that you 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.169
 deliver necessary so that this one 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.440
 stay on the site and do not move 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.170
 dance 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.630
 and we have already completed this is the 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.390
 final result I would love to see
