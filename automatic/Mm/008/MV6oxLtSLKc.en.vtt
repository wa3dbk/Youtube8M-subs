00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
target assassination of new Americans

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
target assassination of new Americans
because<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.759> were<00:01:53.820> doing<00:01:54.060> something<00:01:54.570> that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
because they were doing something that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.270 
because they were doing something that
we<00:01:55.619> didn't<00:01:56.100> want<00:01:56.369> him<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.409> think

the<00:02:44.560> Constitution<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.790> was<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> Obama

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
the Constitution it was the Obama

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.480 
the Constitution it was the Obama
administration<00:02:47.050> itself<00:02:47.170> who<00:02:47.980> determined

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
administration itself who determined

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.800 
administration itself who determined
that<00:02:48.580> they<00:02:48.760> were<00:02:48.790> allowed<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.360> kill<00:02:49.690> Americans

that they were allowed to kill Americans

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.990 
that they were allowed to kill Americans
if<00:02:50.290> they<00:02:50.410> saw<00:02:50.620> fit<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.459> probably<00:02:51.700> was<00:02:51.970> not

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
if they saw fit and it probably was not

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.480 
if they saw fit and it probably was not
endorsed<00:02:52.600> by<00:02:52.690> any<00:02:53.110> law<00:02:53.470> even<00:02:54.010> though<00:02:54.220> that

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
endorsed by any law even though that

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.980 
endorsed by any law even though that
would<00:02:54.640> be<00:02:54.790> weak<00:02:55.060> compared<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.900> the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
would be weak compared to the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.250 
would be weak compared to the
Constitution<00:02:56.860> but<00:02:57.870> unfortunately<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.020> will

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
Constitution but unfortunately this will

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.220 
Constitution but unfortunately this will
probably<00:02:59.560> go<00:03:00.300> unnoticed<00:03:01.300> but<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:01.959> know<00:03:02.080> one

but<00:04:14.140> what<00:04:14.380> does<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:14.680> mean<00:04:14.950> you<00:04:15.640> know<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:15.880> does

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
but what does that mean you know it does

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.550 
but what does that mean you know it does
it<00:04:16.150> doesn't<00:04:16.419> seem<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.600> have<00:04:16.780> any<00:04:16.930> meaning<00:04:17.169> and

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
it doesn't seem to have any meaning and

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.960 
it doesn't seem to have any meaning and
if<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.280> talk<00:04:18.489> about<00:04:18.519> from<00:04:19.080> 2004<00:04:20.080> to<00:04:20.430> 2015<00:04:21.430> and

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
many of those years were certainly not

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.020 
many of those years were certainly not
under<00:04:23.620> his<00:04:23.740> presidency

drone strikes in Pakistan and of course
it<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.610> tragic<00:04:30.850> when<00:04:31.150> Americans<00:04:31.660> are<00:04:31.810> killed

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.130 
involved over there in an organization
that<00:05:30.580> seems<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:31.300> fail<00:05:31.570> everything<00:05:31.870> it<00:05:32.110> does

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
that seems to fail everything it does
