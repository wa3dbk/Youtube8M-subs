 filadelfi lina fc today I had just 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.489
 want cheese cake we do the c6 is 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.350
 yes because it looks like a sweet lot 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.210
 complicated with lots of steps 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.540
 many should be used 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.680
 different accessories instead do by hand if 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.770
 you do it with the hole 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.840
 instead we are immediately very simple 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.320
 let's start immediately to walk of like ce 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.659
 we eat it 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.320
 exact then we start put the butter in 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.520
 dissolve if we put it a little without 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.760
 mix so serious easy yes because 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.080
 here you enter all the programs 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.770
 black manuals with which we play with 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.950
 manual 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.200
 because then you are a great future 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.690
 and you can do even if complicated recipes 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.190
 but in short, we who maybe sometimes do 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.780
 some ideas are missing 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.880
 we also need the recipe book 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.270
 I try also to cite fantastic e 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.210
 complete with any capacity whatsoever 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.060
 brought from appetizer to dessert if not 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.490
 you have a brilliant idea for the evening 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.490
 we will have paintings as in time that we arrive 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.490
 at home because I know about the evening 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.429
 ok the melted butter is dissolved in a manner 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.630
 perfect 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.330
 now you need cookies 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.490
 chop them first let 's put the wool not 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.050
 know which of course more like him now 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.600
 we are setting up manually 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.130
 also according to the cookbook set the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.470
 temperature he maintains a temperature 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.330
 constant and therefore also for mere 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.410
 melt the butter in a saucepan there 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:34.630
 the risk of having it burned controls 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.370
 perfectly sports temperature e 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.400
 then you can really decide which one 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.910
 temperature from 36 up to 100 are 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.910
 kitchen 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.690
 we brought to the encores very well done 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.690
 you have one or buttered and lined the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.540
 then we take effect towards the record 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.730
 believe your tend to leave the pure 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.410
 so you can whip the heavy cream 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.070
 while you crush the cookies 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.070
 I vote 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.519
 I mounted the hawk that helped her a lot 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.519

 this is the last step 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.710
 of the dough after adding the barrel 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.050
 will work one more minute and then 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.600
 we need to get in shape and then 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.600
