00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.740
 today in more than healthy dotcom we are going 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.469
 to tell you about the protein diet for 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.260
 burn fat and gain muscle first thing 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.660
 what we have to solve is what is the 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.100
 Protein diet is a protein diet is 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.200
 a diet that contains hundreds of 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.420
 protein- rich foods and in addition 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.790
 low in carbohydrates and carbohydrates 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.590
 as they are usually known in the diet 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.530
 protein as we present is not the same 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.260
 crete ducant since the dukan diet demands 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.810
 that you consume a certain type of food 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.270
 and avoid at all costs the carbohydrates something 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.920
 that we do not recommend that you do the first 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.079
 because you will end up with a rebound effect 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.000
 uncontrollable and second because the 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.730
 carbohydrates are very important for 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.059
 our organism how to help the diet 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.540
 protein to burn fat is a question 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.130
 that we are obliged to answer the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.840
 protein diet will offer us food 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.760
 rich in protein and low plasters 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.100
 as we said on the other hand we have 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.480
 to know that our organization prioritizes 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.180
 the energy sources of the next 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.939
 way first go the carbohydrates then 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.260
 the lipids what is the fat and finally 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.360
 the protein 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.040
 if we do not consume carbohydrates our 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.880
 organism will go directly to burn 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.310
 grease 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.530
 there is magic then because the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.690
 Dukan diet is harmful and our 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.940
 diet not because carbohydrates are 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.010
 really important for our 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.820
 brain for example and what does the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.850
 Dukan diet is to reduce them to zero imagine 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.410
 what happens if we do this knowing everything 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.570
 this we can really start with 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.790
 our protein diet 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.700
 since that is a list drawn up from 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.900
 zero for us and in which we will deal 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.820
 to avoid all effects 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.460
 harmful and harmful as the effect 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.750
 rebound to start with this defeat and 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.930
 here we are going to indicate that the food 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.050
 appropriate and those that you should reduce is very 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.600
 important that you follow an order on this 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.420
 kind of priorities since the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.160
 diet in these prohibited foods not 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.550
 you can consume sweets although it's something 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.800
 that you already knew frozen pastries and even 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.649
 the same rice what if you can is 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.650
 replace it with brown rice food 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.170
 that you should avoid are for example 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.680
 banana or fruit figs in the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.470
 pasta or snacks replaced by pineapple 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.250
 watermelon or papaya foods that can be 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.070
 consume the broccoli the cauliflower fish 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.390
 and meats like chicken and the payment to 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.769
 from there you can see our 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.630
 full article in which we're going to 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.600
 Develop a series of schemes and guidelines 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.330
 to follow him for one or two weeks 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.130
 the time you need a greeting and 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.489
 thank you very much for listening to us 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.489
