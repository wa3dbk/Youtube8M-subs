00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and no flaking so we'll have to put this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.610 
and no flaking so we'll have to put this
to<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.879> test<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.840> looks<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.200> taken<00:00:46.530> out

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to the test what it looks like taken out

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160 
to the test what it looks like taken out
of<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.829> packaging<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.660> purple<00:00:49.050> one

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
of the packaging this one the purple one

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.900 
of the packaging this one the purple one
is<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> upper<00:00:50.010> lashes<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.489> I'm<00:00:50.579> guessing

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
is for the upper lashes so I'm guessing

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.450 
is for the upper lashes so I'm guessing
the<00:00:51.000> ones<00:00:51.210> gonna<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.570> bigger<00:00:52.129> yeah<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.100> then

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the ones gonna be bigger yeah and then

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.910 
the ones gonna be bigger yeah and then
the<00:00:56.550> bottom<00:00:56.850> part<00:00:56.879> that's<00:00:57.390> black<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the bottom part that's black is for the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.110 
the bottom part that's black is for the
lower<00:00:59.070> lashes<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:00:59.670> guessing<00:00:59.969> somebody

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
lower lashes I'm guessing somebody

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.090 
lower lashes I'm guessing somebody
smaller<00:01:00.420> yeah<00:01:00.780> okay<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.739> whole<00:01:01.920> lot

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
smaller yeah okay it's a whole lot

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.619 
smaller yeah okay it's a whole lot
smaller<00:01:02.340> which<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.760> actually<00:01:03.210> really<00:01:03.480> nice

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
smaller which is actually really nice

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.750 
smaller which is actually really nice
because<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> hard<00:01:05.070> time<00:01:05.250> getting<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.580> my

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
because I have a hard time getting to my

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
because I have a hard time getting to my
lower<00:01:05.939> lashes<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.630> hopefully<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.500> will

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
lower lashes so hopefully this will

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.020 
lower lashes so hopefully this will
actually<00:01:07.920> make<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.100> easier<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.490> me

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:33.530 

nervous<00:01:21.979> okay

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.960 

that<00:01:34.170> actually<00:01:34.590> looks<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.760> mean

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that actually looks really good I mean

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.610 
that actually looks really good I mean
I'm<00:01:36.330> excited<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.140> second<00:01:37.470> coat

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
I'm excited to see what the second coat

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.620 
I'm excited to see what the second coat
looks<00:01:37.830> like<00:01:38.010> it<00:01:38.190> says<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:39.090> let<00:01:39.300> it<00:01:39.330> dry<00:01:39.570> too

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
looks like it says to not let it dry too

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.350 
looks like it says to not let it dry too
much<00:01:40.110> before<00:01:40.440> you<00:01:40.950> apply<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.730> second<00:01:42.090> coat<00:01:42.180> so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
much before you apply the second coat so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.340 
much before you apply the second coat so
I'm<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.510> going<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:42.690> do<00:01:42.870> this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
I'm just going to do this

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.860 
I'm just going to do this
I<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:44.160> quickly<00:01:44.490> I'm<00:01:45.150> noticing<00:01:45.480> that<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
I really quickly I'm noticing that the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.590 
I really quickly I'm noticing that the
formula<00:01:46.410> is<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.650> bit<00:01:46.980> on<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.130> drier<00:01:48.060> side<00:01:48.090> it's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
formula is a bit on the drier side it's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.260 
formula is a bit on the drier side it's
not<00:01:48.810> too<00:01:49.320> wet<00:01:49.620> it<00:01:49.950> looks<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.550> lashes<00:01:50.970> are

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
not too wet it looks like the lashes are

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.260 
not too wet it looks like the lashes are
getting<00:01:51.690> thicker<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.400> as<00:01:53.400> I'm<00:01:53.700> applying<00:01:53.910> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
getting thicker now as I'm applying the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.090 
getting thicker now as I'm applying the
second<00:01:54.690> coat<00:01:54.720> which<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.260> good<00:01:55.620> because<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
second coat which is good because the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
second coat which is good because the
first<00:01:56.280> coat<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> little<00:01:56.940> too<00:01:57.479> spidery

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
first coat was a little too spidery

lower<00:02:50.459> lash<00:02:50.760> mascara<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.470> gives<00:02:52.620> pretty

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
lower lash mascara and it gives pretty

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.770 
lower lash mascara and it gives pretty
much<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.130> same<00:02:53.280> effects<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.820> upper<00:02:54.090> lashes<00:02:54.330> I

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
medium to long lashes that are really

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.800 
medium to long lashes that are really
thin<00:03:59.580> and<00:03:59.760> fine<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.239> would<00:04:00.390> definitely

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.050 
thin and fine I would definitely
recommend<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.380> mascara<00:04:01.920> for<00:04:02.580> lashes<00:04:03.030> that

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
recommend this mascara for lashes that

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.520 
recommend this mascara for lashes that
are<00:04:03.269> smaller<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:03.840> would<00:04:03.989> recommend<00:04:04.380> this<00:04:04.470> for

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
are smaller I would recommend this for

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.590 
are smaller I would recommend this for
length<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.100> volume<00:04:05.519> it<00:04:05.940> gives<00:04:06.150> both<00:04:06.420> this

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
length and volume it gives both this

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.550 
length and volume it gives both this
mascara<00:04:07.019> would<00:04:07.380> work<00:04:07.620> for<00:04:07.860> anybody

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
to give my scarib a try again just like

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.780 
to give my scarib a try again just like
to<00:04:19.049> double-check<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.829> make<00:04:19.890> sure<00:04:20.040> that<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.669> do

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
to double-check and make sure that I do

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.110 
to double-check and make sure that I do
really<00:04:21.060> like<00:04:21.269> as<00:04:21.510> much<00:04:21.630> as<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.870> did<00:04:22.049> before<00:04:26.120> so

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
really like as much as I did before so

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.640 
really like as much as I did before so
there<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.360> go<00:04:27.390> there's<00:04:27.630> one<00:04:27.750> coat<00:04:28.110> it's<00:04:28.470> got<00:04:28.620> a

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
there we go there's one coat it's got a

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.090 
there we go there's one coat it's got a
lot<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:28.950> length<00:04:29.479> I<00:04:30.479> think<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.290> second<00:04:31.650> coat<00:04:31.860> is

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
lot of length I think the second coat is

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.250 
lot of length I think the second coat is
the<00:04:32.910> one<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.240> gives<00:04:33.390> you<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.570> volume<00:04:34.020> I

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
the one that gives you the volume I

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.409 
the one that gives you the volume I
would<00:04:34.770> say<00:04:35.100> if<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.790> are<00:04:35.910> going<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.150> do<00:04:36.240> two

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
would say if you are going to do two

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.200 
would say if you are going to do two
coats<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:36.780> this<00:04:36.960> mascara<00:04:37.790> just<00:04:38.790> make<00:04:39.000> sure<00:04:39.120> to

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
coats of this mascara just make sure to

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.480 
coats of this mascara just make sure to
really<00:04:39.450> brush<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.080> one<00:04:40.320> through<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.010> lashes

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
really brush the one through the lashes

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.670 
really brush the one through the lashes
on<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.669> second<00:04:42.150> coat<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.630> honestly<00:04:43.110> think<00:04:43.470> one

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
on the second coat I honestly think one

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.030 
on the second coat I honestly think one
coat<00:04:43.919> is<00:04:44.070> good<00:04:44.250> enough

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
coat is good enough

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.200 
coat is good enough
ashes<00:04:46.350> are<00:04:47.350> all<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.620> same<00:04:47.830> length<00:04:48.210> it's

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
ashes are all the same length it's

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.030 
ashes are all the same length it's
really<00:04:49.510> good<00:04:49.690> I<00:04:49.900> think<00:04:50.290> I<00:04:50.380> agree<00:04:50.680> with<00:04:50.890> the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
really good I think I agree with the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.890 
really good I think I agree with the
same<00:04:51.280> statement<00:04:51.880> that<00:04:52.150> I<00:04:52.180> made<00:04:52.420> last<00:04:52.660> night
