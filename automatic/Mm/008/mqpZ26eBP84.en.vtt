wildstar wildstar's a pretty different

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.210 
wildstar wildstar's a pretty different
game<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.630> most<00:01:39.810> MMOs<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.100> your

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
game for most MMOs so get in your

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.590 
game for most MMOs so get in your
comfort<00:01:41.369> zone<00:01:41.700> try<00:01:41.939> stuff<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.299> haven't<00:01:42.420> tried

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.499 
comfort zone try stuff you haven't tried
before<00:01:43.159> for<00:01:44.159> example<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.700> tried<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.270> range

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
before for example I tried out range

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
before for example I tried out range
classes<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.079> really<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> engineer<00:01:47.100> class

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
classes I really like the engineer class

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.520 
classes I really like the engineer class
the<00:01:47.610> engineer<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> class<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.720> i<00:01:48.930> didn't<00:01:49.380> i

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the engineer is a class that i didn't i

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.260 
the engineer is a class that i didn't i
didn't<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:49.770> i'd<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.700> i<00:01:50.759> tried<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> out

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
didn't think i'd like but i tried it out

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
turns out i really like it and it's a

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
turns out i really like it and it's a
very<00:01:53.310> strong<00:01:54.149> candidate<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.840> me<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.140> make<00:01:55.320> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
very strong candidate for me to make it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.550 
very strong candidate for me to make it
all<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.799> an<00:01:56.040> engineer<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.079> try<00:01:58.079> some<00:01:58.259> stuff<00:01:58.409> out

a<00:02:58.170> lot<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.560> both<00:02:59.120> housing<00:03:00.120> as<00:03:00.270> well<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.750> no<00:03:00.870> I

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
a lot of both housing as well and no I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.780 
a lot of both housing as well and no I
think<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.560> think<00:03:01.860> for<00:03:01.980> most<00:03:02.100> primary<00:03:02.370> likes<00:03:02.700> the

think I think for most primary likes the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.530 
think I think for most primary likes the
housing<00:03:03.090> but<00:03:03.260> still<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.740> don't<00:03:05.490> be<00:03:05.820> just<00:03:06.270> one

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
housing but still just don't be just one

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.870 
housing but still just don't be just one

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
thing I never understood that now on to

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.240 
thing I never understood that now on to
my<00:03:09.000> next<00:03:09.030> point<00:03:09.350> wildstar<00:03:10.350> is<00:03:10.560> very<00:03:10.890> much<00:03:11.190> a

my next point wildstar is very much a

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.610 
my next point wildstar is very much a
traditional<00:03:11.910> MMO<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.870> sense<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.260> things

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
traditional MMO in the sense that things

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.980
