blogging<00:00:46.319> but<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:46.800> had<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.069> VCR<00:00:48.920> 68<00:00:49.969> SR<00:00:50.969> 68<00:00:51.389> and

blogging but they had a VCR 68 SR 68 and

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.259 
blogging but they had a VCR 68 SR 68 and
so<00:00:52.769> I<00:00:52.800> said<00:00:53.039> well<00:00:53.219> why<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.879> this

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
so I said well why not because this

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.149 
so I said well why not because this
little<00:00:54.780> device<00:00:54.899> has<00:00:55.289> something<00:00:55.679> here<00:00:55.920> which

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
little device has something here which

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.090 
little device has something here which
really<00:00:56.879> surprised<00:00:57.329> me<00:00:57.359> it's<00:00:57.659> a<00:00:57.920> 2000<00:00:58.920> times

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
really surprised me it's a 2000 times

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
really surprised me it's a 2000 times
digital<00:00:59.670> zoom<00:01:00.049> actually<00:01:01.049> the<00:01:01.229> I<00:01:01.409> think

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
digital zoom actually the I think

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.070 
digital zoom actually the I think
digital<00:01:01.799> zooms<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.639> a<00:01:02.909> bit<00:01:03.479> far-fetched<00:01:03.659> but

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
digital zooms is a bit far-fetched but

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.980 
digital zooms is a bit far-fetched but
the<00:01:04.589> optical<00:01:05.190> zoom<00:01:05.220> itself<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.180> set<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.570> 60

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the optical zoom itself is set at 60

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.609 
the optical zoom itself is set at 60
times<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.340> might<00:01:08.640> find<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.420> use<00:01:10.289> for

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
times so you might find that of use for

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.330 
times so you might find that of use for
spying<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.759> some<00:01:12.119> other<00:01:12.590> indiscreet<00:01:13.590> video

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
the 60 times optical zoom which seems

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.890 
the 60 times optical zoom which seems
quite<00:04:58.810> incredible<00:04:59.320> to<00:05:00.270> be<00:05:01.270> able<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.480> record

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
quite incredible to be able to record

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.650 
quite incredible to be able to record
something<00:05:02.320> so<00:05:02.500> far<00:05:02.770> away<00:05:03.120> not<00:05:04.120> sure<00:05:04.300> it's<00:05:04.510> now

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
something so far away not sure it's now

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.730 
something so far away not sure it's now
more<00:05:04.900> visible<00:05:05.410> here<00:05:05.650> on<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.120> LCD

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
then you can see we get pretty darn

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.810 
then you can see we get pretty darn
