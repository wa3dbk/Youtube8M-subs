00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 this morning on the epic server 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.830
 free a few people came 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.050
 visit the famous megan and 244 the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.950
 famous star has agreed to give 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.500
 signings 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.000
 you can see here a line of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.520
 people are patiently lining up 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.100
 to receive CDs or optionally 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.990
 crime strokes the young neo range and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.269
 10 144 agreed to give an interview 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.560
 but it's true that and youtube hours 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.619
 it's a job quite a lot 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.149
 difficult when you think about it because 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.920
 it is true that it is hard anyway 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.320
 to get up already every morning is true 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.149
 because you have to take that into account 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.399
 it's also very hard for me sometimes 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.200
 to launch a software to film you 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.780
 see it succeeds like that it's very 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.100
 hard to launch and film my game it's 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.899
 true it's frankly I have a lot of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.280
 badly but I think the worst is for 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.600
 the scenario I'm hungry because it's 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.969
 true that even so it's difficult to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.430
 take the idea of ​​a game and the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.870
 to reproduce on minecraft is identical 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.370
 these hardbacks and believe me that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.449
 it's not done at all for homes 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.260
 for the chochottes we could say 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.180
 in jargon 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.619
 frankly it's really a job that 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.299
 I find a lot difficult 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.650
 so here it is false fake king of 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.790
 table must be here I have a lot of 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 hour field so so I can 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.210
 to affirm that it is a quiet craft 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.500
 for me but it's true that being 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.479
 youtuber is not it's not 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.880
 not given to everyone because already 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.290
 there are plenty of people who are sure 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.450
 just here I mean because 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.159
 that's how it is and it's true that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.170
 I 'm here I have a lot of 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.400

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.759
 well seen there a phenomenal girl who 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.829

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.530
 really very difficult so here's by 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.909
 against now if we could stop 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.409
