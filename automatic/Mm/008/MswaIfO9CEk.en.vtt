we're gonna release the game the game is

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.940 
we're gonna release the game the game is
really<00:00:48.000> interesting<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:49.440> should<00:00:49.800> be

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
really interesting because it should be

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.799 
really interesting because it should be
beautiful<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.390> isn't<00:00:51.690> beautiful

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
beautiful I think if it isn't beautiful

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.220 
beautiful I think if it isn't beautiful
it<00:00:52.530> would<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.360> even<00:00:54.840> me

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it would you know not even me

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.380 
it would you know not even me
expectation<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.430> got<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.730> fun<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
expectation but it's got to be fun and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.860 
expectation but it's got to be fun and
you<00:00:58.170> know<00:00:58.289> that's<00:00:58.500> where<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.879> experience<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
you know that's where the experience of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.590 
you know that's where the experience of
being<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.530> butterfly<00:01:02.100> making<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.850> fun<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
being a butterfly making that fun and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.990 
being a butterfly making that fun and
enduring<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> gameplay<00:01:05.070> mechanic<00:01:05.610> i<00:01:05.760> think

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
enduring as a gameplay mechanic i think

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.760 
enduring as a gameplay mechanic i think
is<00:01:06.119> our<00:01:06.270> biggest<00:01:06.510> challenge<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.260> we've

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
is our biggest challenge but we've

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.800 
is our biggest challenge but we've
experimented<00:01:08.189> enough<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:11.330> have<00:01:12.330> confidence

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
experimented enough to have confidence

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.920 
experimented enough to have confidence
that<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.530> game<00:01:13.740> when<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.400> polished<00:01:15.390> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that the game when it's polished and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.620 
that the game when it's polished and
fully<00:01:16.680> procedural<00:01:17.369> world<00:01:17.580> i<00:01:17.850> mean<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.180> it's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
fully procedural world i mean it's it's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.140 
fully procedural world i mean it's it's
generative<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.830> sense<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.250> everything

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
generative in the sense that everything

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.530 
generative in the sense that everything
you<00:01:21.450> interact<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.049> every<00:01:22.439> choice<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.920> make

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
you interact with every choice you make

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
you interact with every choice you make
really<00:01:24.540> shapes<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.140> world<00:01:25.350> around<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
really shapes the world around you you

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.240 
really shapes the world around you you
know<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> real<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> whole<00:01:27.270> chaos<00:01:27.479> theory

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
know the real the whole chaos theory

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.620 
know the real the whole chaos theory
idea<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.000> flutter<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
idea that you know the flutter of a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.450 
idea that you know the flutter of a
butterfly<00:01:31.140> wing<00:01:31.380> caused<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> hurricane<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
butterfly wing caused a hurricane and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.870 
butterfly wing caused a hurricane and
it's<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.680> it's<00:01:34.680> interesting<00:01:35.040> because<00:01:35.400> we've

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
it's a it's interesting because we've

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.080 
it's a it's interesting because we've
gotten<00:01:36.210> far<00:01:36.479> enough<00:01:36.509> along<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:38.220> realize<00:01:38.610> that

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
gotten far enough along so realize that

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.120 
gotten far enough along so realize that
we're<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.140> able<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.590> pull<00:01:40.829> something

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
we're going to be able to pull something

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.609 
we're going to be able to pull something
fully<00:01:41.640> generative<00:01:42.329> off<00:01:42.600> where<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.380> take

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
fully generative off where you take

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.620 
fully generative off where you take
butterflies<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.759> pending<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.360> which

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
butterflies and pending on which

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.319 
butterflies and pending on which
butterflies<00:01:46.140> made<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.130> what<00:01:47.610> flowers<00:01:48.149> they

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
butterflies made and what flowers they

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.990 
butterflies made and what flowers they
interact<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:49.490> dictates<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:50.700> predators

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
interact with dictates what predators

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.480 
interact with dictates what predators
show<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.110> what<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.189> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
show up and what you have to do to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.030 
show up and what you have to do to
survive<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.030> Predators<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.840> dictates<00:01:55.740> you

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
survive the Predators and dictates you

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.550 
survive the Predators and dictates you
know<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.369> flowers<00:01:56.850> appear<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.689> then<00:01:58.439> we

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
know what flowers appear and then we

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.550 
know what flowers appear and then we
throw<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:58.950> mixing<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.490> there<00:01:59.670> by<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.149> know

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
throw some mixing in there by you know

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.080 
throw some mixing in there by you know
occasionally<00:02:01.560> they'll<00:02:01.950> be<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.460> butterfly<00:02:02.820> just

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
occasionally they'll be a butterfly just

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.860 
occasionally they'll be a butterfly just
arrives<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.200> your<00:02:04.350> island

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
arrives on your island

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.560 
arrives on your island
then<00:02:05.110> if<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:06.430> might<00:02:06.670> even<00:02:06.700> see<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.240> golden

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
then if you might even see the golden

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.570 
then if you might even see the golden
butterfly<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.560> know<00:02:08.680> and<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.190> have<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.430> try

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
butterfly you know and you have to try

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.190 
butterfly you know and you have to try
them<00:02:09.729> if<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.210> don't<00:02:10.240> mate<00:02:10.540> with<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:10.990> kind

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
them if you don't mate with it you kind

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.380 
them if you don't mate with it you kind
of<00:02:11.260> lose<00:02:11.790> lose<00:02:12.790> its<00:02:13.000> genes<00:02:13.390> or<00:02:14.020> something
