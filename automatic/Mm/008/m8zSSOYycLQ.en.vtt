00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
on tour on my own this summer and our

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.000 
on tour on my own this summer and our
teams<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:50.219> kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.809> locked<00:00:51.809> arms<00:00:52.500> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
teams just kind of like locked arms and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010 
teams just kind of like locked arms and
thought<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.340> it'd<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> good<00:00:54.180> combination

and<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.010> similar<00:00:56.309> fan<00:00:56.550> bases<00:00:56.789> right

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and we we have similar fan bases right

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.310 
and we we have similar fan bases right
now<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.539> thought<00:00:57.690> why<00:00:57.809> not<00:00:57.840> make<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> an

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
now so we thought why not make it an

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.860 
now so we thought why not make it an
even<00:00:58.469> bigger<00:00:58.770> thing<00:00:59.489> just<00:01:00.449> make<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.780> an

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
even bigger thing just make it like an

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.670 
even bigger thing just make it like an
explosion<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.800> Awesomeness<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.530> that<00:01:04.530> was
