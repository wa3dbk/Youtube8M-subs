three wheeler two wheeler no this is
never<00:00:58.440> running<00:00:58.680> what<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> got<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.870> had<00:01:00.870> my

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
never running what I got it I had my

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.900 
never running what I got it I had my
suspicions<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> guy<00:01:02.160> couldn't<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
suspicions that the guy couldn't get it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.190 
suspicions that the guy couldn't get it
running<00:01:03.239> after<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.600> rebuild<00:01:05.659> well<00:01:06.659> why<00:01:06.930> did<00:01:07.110> he

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
running after a rebuild well why did he

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.899 
running after a rebuild well why did he
rebuild<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.770> maybe<00:01:08.189> there<00:01:08.369> was<00:01:08.490> an<00:01:08.580> issue<00:01:08.700> at

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
rebuild it maybe there was an issue at

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.270 
rebuild it maybe there was an issue at
that<00:01:08.970> point<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.920> mean<00:01:10.920> we've<00:01:11.040> changed

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that point so I mean we've changed

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.920 
that point so I mean we've changed
everything<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:12.000> there's<00:01:12.390> some<00:01:12.450> wiring

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
everything I see there's some wiring

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.109 
everything I see there's some wiring
things<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.010> some<00:01:14.490> he<00:01:14.760> soldered

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
things going on here some he soldered

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.160 
things going on here some he soldered
some<00:01:15.299> wires<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.780> 10<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.409> 15<00:01:16.770> years<00:01:16.799> ago<00:01:18.170> two

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
some wires up 10 to 15 years ago two

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.640 
some wires up 10 to 15 years ago two
different<00:01:19.530> carbs<00:01:20.630> rebuild<00:01:21.630> carbs<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.439> mean

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
different carbs rebuild carbs I mean

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.060 
different carbs rebuild carbs I mean
I've<00:01:22.860> gone<00:01:23.070> through<00:01:23.130> everything<00:01:25.070> but

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
I've gone through everything but

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.830 
I've gone through everything but
intermittent<00:01:26.810> intermittent<00:01:28.939> fuel<00:01:29.939> tank<00:01:30.240> full

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
intermittent intermittent fuel tank full

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.569 
intermittent intermittent fuel tank full
of<00:01:30.900> crud<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> cleaned<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.680> out<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.040> mean<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> whole

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
of crud I cleaned it out I mean a whole

of crud I cleaned it out I mean a whole
bunch<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> stuff<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.240> anyway<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:34.320> checked<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
bunch of stuff so anyway we checked the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.620 
bunch of stuff so anyway we checked the
stator<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.990> toast<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:38.299> but<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.390> was<00:01:39.420> hit

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
stator and it's toast so but it was hit

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.020 
stator and it's toast so but it was hit
and<00:01:39.750> miss<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.259> kind<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> line<00:01:41.040> but

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and miss it's kind of on the line but

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.219 
and miss it's kind of on the line but
we're<00:01:42.180> gonna<00:01:42.299> replace<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.689> that's<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> last

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
we're gonna replace it that's the last

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.080 
we're gonna replace it that's the last
thing<00:01:43.530> there's<00:01:43.799> nothing<00:01:44.040> else<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.490> all<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
thing there's nothing else to do all the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.399 
thing there's nothing else to do all the
wiring<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.450> good<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> kill<00:01:45.899> switch<00:01:46.110> isn't

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
wiring is good the kill switch isn't

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.990 
wiring is good the kill switch isn't
there's<00:01:46.619> no<00:01:46.740> problem<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.850> we've

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
there's no problem with that so we've
