you a video on desk organization and
these<00:00:10.050> are<00:00:10.200> just<00:00:10.320> some<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.530> my<00:00:10.830> ideas<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.610> lot<00:00:12.210> of

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
these are just some of my ideas a lot of

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.570 
these are just some of my ideas a lot of
people<00:00:12.389> request<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.410> video<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.519> I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
people request to this video and so I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.400 
people request to this video and so I
thought<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.790> would<00:00:14.880> do<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.420> all<00:00:15.570> so

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
thought I would do it for you all so

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.410 
thought I would do it for you all so
starting<00:00:16.740> off<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.160> just<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.580> these<00:00:17.730> placemats

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
starting off I just have these placemats

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.970 
starting off I just have these placemats
and<00:00:18.690> they<00:00:18.869> got<00:00:19.020> these<00:00:19.199> from<00:00:19.350> target<00:00:19.800> they<00:00:19.920> were

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
and they got these from target they were

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.310 
and they got these from target they were
really<00:00:20.340> inexpensive<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.900> really<00:00:22.199> nice

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
really inexpensive and it's really nice

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
really inexpensive and it's really nice
because<00:00:22.590> they<00:00:22.859> protect<00:00:23.250> my<00:00:23.490> desk<00:00:24.119> from

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
because they protect my desk from

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.259 
because they protect my desk from
getting<00:00:24.810> dirty<00:00:24.990> since<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:25.680> white<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.279> I

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
getting dirty since it's white and I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.550 
getting dirty since it's white and I
just<00:00:27.480> think<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.720> adds<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.199> really<00:00:28.410> nice

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
just think it adds just a really nice

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.580 
just think it adds just a really nice
look<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.390> binders<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.140> top<00:00:31.410> of

look I like to have my binders on top of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.080 
look I like to have my binders on top of
my<00:00:31.740> desk<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.340> they're<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.790> nice<00:00:33.030> and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
my desk so that they're really nice and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.319 
my desk so that they're really nice and
easy<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.690> use<00:00:33.840> because<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.700> need<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.850> grab<00:00:36.000> them

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
easy to use because I need to grab them

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.209 
easy to use because I need to grab them
in<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> morning<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:37.140> school<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.649> stuff<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
in the morning for school and stuff I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.700 
in the morning for school and stuff I
like<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.090> keep<00:00:39.270> my<00:00:39.329> writing<00:00:39.870> stuff<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.379> here

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
like to keep my writing stuff in here

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.799 
like to keep my writing stuff in here
rather<00:00:40.920> than<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.510> you're

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
rather than here because if you're

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.080 
rather than here because if you're
sitting<00:00:43.230> down<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.789> runs

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
sitting down here then this like runs

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.990 
sitting down here then this like runs
into<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:45.989> hard<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.530> things<00:00:46.710> out

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
into you and it's hard to get things out

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.700 
into you and it's hard to get things out
so<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.030> love<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> put<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.870> my<00:00:49.050> pens<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so I love to put all of my pens and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
so I love to put all of my pens and
pencils<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:50.789> well<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.149> some<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
pencils in here as well as some of the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.060 
pencils in here as well as some of the
things<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.500> use<00:00:52.710> more<00:00:52.980> often<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.770> I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
things that I use more often so I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.950 
things that I use more often so I
recommend<00:00:56.399> putting<00:00:56.910> things<00:00:57.270> into<00:00:57.449> sections

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
recommend putting things into sections

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.709 
recommend putting things into sections
and<00:00:58.109> getting<00:00:58.710> them<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.090> know<00:01:00.210> organized

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and getting them as you know organized

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.479 
and getting them as you know organized
as<00:01:01.050> possible<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> little

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
