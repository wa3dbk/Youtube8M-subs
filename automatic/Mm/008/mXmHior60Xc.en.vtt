00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
was painted back in the 80s so it is an

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.910 
was painted back in the 80s so it is an
older<00:01:11.280> paint<00:01:11.700> job<00:01:12.260> he<00:01:13.260> did<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
older paint job he did it just as a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.399 
older paint job he did it just as a
driver<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.970> there's<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.600> other<00:01:15.720> stone<00:01:16.080> chips

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
driver so there's the other stone chips

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.560 
driver so there's the other stone chips
and<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> certainly<00:01:17.520> would<00:01:17.820> benefit<00:01:18.210> probably

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and it certainly would benefit probably

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.170 
and it certainly would benefit probably
from<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> wet<00:01:18.960> sand<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.350> buff<00:01:19.909> been<00:01:20.909> garaged

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
from a wet sand in a buff been garaged

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
from a wet sand in a buff been garaged
most<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> time<00:01:21.720> he's<00:01:21.990> had<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> good

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
most the time he's had it so it's a good

works nice I mean you can probably see
in<00:02:01.570> there<00:02:01.750> hopefully<00:02:01.929> through<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.229> camera

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
in there hopefully through the camera

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.260 
in there hopefully through the camera
that<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.799> clockworks<00:02:03.399> nice<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.970> heater

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
that the clockworks nice the heater

which<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.470> kind<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.040> interesting<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:13.330> that

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
which is kind of interesting but that

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.910 
which is kind of interesting but that
was<00:02:13.569> more<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.840> like<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.049> dealer<00:02:14.440> add<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.890> a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
was more of like a dealer add not a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.440 
was more of like a dealer add not a
factory<00:02:15.430> option<00:02:16.799> touch<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.980> key<00:02:18.160> 455<00:02:19.120> fires

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
factory option touch the key 455 fires

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.710 
factory option touch the key 455 fires
right<00:02:19.780> up<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:21.459> actually<00:02:21.790> pegs<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.480> oil

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
right up it actually pegs the oil

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.660 
right up it actually pegs the oil
pressure<00:02:23.019> gauge<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.650> basically<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.220> runs<00:02:24.459> it

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
pressure gauge it basically just runs it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.910 
pressure gauge it basically just runs it
up<00:02:24.790> but<00:02:25.660> once<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.930> warms<00:02:26.080> up<00:02:26.410> then<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.709> comes

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
up but once it warms up then it comes

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.979 
up but once it warms up then it comes
down<00:02:27.160> but<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.580> still<00:02:27.760> maintains<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.480> very<00:02:28.750> high

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
down but it still maintains it very high

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.770 
down but it still maintains it very high
it's<00:02:29.799> showing<00:02:30.239> 75,000<00:02:31.239> miles<00:02:31.390> on<00:02:31.630> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
it's showing 75,000 miles on the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.550 
it's showing 75,000 miles on the
odometer<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:33.209> have<00:02:34.209> no<00:02:34.420> paperwork<00:02:34.900> as<00:02:35.290> far<00:02:35.470> as

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
odometer I have no paperwork as far as

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.740 
odometer I have no paperwork as far as
records<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.280> suggest<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.269> is<00:02:37.450> stock

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
records to suggest that that is stock

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.690 
records to suggest that that is stock
but<00:02:38.620> if<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.799> look<00:02:39.040> at<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.220> car<00:02:39.489> and

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
but if you look at the car and

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.830 
but if you look at the car and
everything<00:02:39.880> in<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.420> would<00:02:40.540> certainly<00:02:40.660> make

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
everything in it it would certainly make

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.390 
everything in it it would certainly make
a<00:02:40.989> good<00:02:41.200> case<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.769> like<00:02:41.830> everything<00:02:42.130> from

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
a good case just like everything from

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.190 
a good case just like everything from
where<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.880> pedals<00:02:43.269> how<00:02:43.870> nice<00:02:44.079> the

where on the pedals how nice the

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.110 
where on the pedals how nice the
