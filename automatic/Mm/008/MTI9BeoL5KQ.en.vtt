 the video for paca lasts 3 4 it's gone 

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:51.419
 I simply start by clearing 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:53.310
 my face is strapped my hair with 

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:55.430
 a clip and then I apply my cream 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.560
 moisturizing that also serves me as a base 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.960
 then place in the foundation so 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.970
 I use as a rule pump 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.800
 my foundation that I spread over 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.300
 the entirety of my face in 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.770
 putting a little more on areas where 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.770
 I feel I need it the most 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.350
 can I fade everything with 7 and pons 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.060
 from cheryl technics girls this 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.560
 sponge is a real favorite 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.600
 for me she is stopped 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.820
 excellently well the material leaves you 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.680
 a very natural and very bright finish 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.950
 I recommend girls to 1000 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.950
 % 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.760
 once the foundation fades up 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.770
 to the eyebrows here again the wires is for 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.390
 me a cable lover step I like having 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.340
 beautiful eyebrows I think it 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.380
 exchange is considering so what am I doing 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.180
 is that I simply fill 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.550
 empty of my wizards with a pencil 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.600
 to have a slightly more full effect 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.600
 we'll say that like that 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.860
 when I finished I stopped my head 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.360
 with my team with my group i on 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.490
 so share for a much more effect 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.020
 natural eyebrows eyebrows 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.300
 it's really very very important for 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.970
 me so I continue with my eyebrows 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.440
 in Africa below a council 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.240
 hours slightly clearer than my 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.200
 carnation to make them really good 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.200
 come out of my face 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.079
 once I'm done I apply a 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.780
 anti dark circles under the eyes but also 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.519
 on the ridge of my nose on the hollow of 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.439
 my lip and on my chin to bring 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.420
 to my face a little more light 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.829
 that's also why my anti ca is 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.829
 slightly lighter than my skin tone 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.430
 click of course gestamp all with 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.430
 the sharp side of my sponge 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.919
 I do not forget to apply 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.919
 on my eyelids to unify them 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.889
 then I matify everything with the 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.020
 hd powder from at make up for ever 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.999
 so I have mixed skin you do not know 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.679
 not so I tell you and I have a lot 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:59.080
 tendency to shine at the level of the area 

00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:00.789
 t ie from the bottom of the art is to 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.189
 my idea of ​​my chin that's why 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.470
 I apply the translucent powder on 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.060
 season 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.250
 then for the rest of my face 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.470
 I use the mineral to jean philippe de 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.390
 at mac and bat also serve me 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.390
 add any demarcation 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.490
 we 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.889
 Oh 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.440
 at this point I leave my account or 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.960
 required to make me a light 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.550
 confused I'm going to apply the powder 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.870
 bright on all areas where I 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.870
 want to bring light 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.820
 but 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.710
 then the darker lightning in the hollow 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.810
 from my cheeks and recovering to give 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.810
 a little more dimension in a face 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:02.139
 I try to make sure that my 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.139
 account on the island remains quite subtle 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.320
 then bluff today I have 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.820
 decided to use an orange blush 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.800
 besides these two beaches that I use 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.780
 most often I think it's a 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.850
 bloch color that goes very very well 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.510
 c is basically giving immediately 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.510
 not us 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.960
 and to finish with my complexion I hydrate 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:28.140
 muller that's what it gives to my 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.140
 dyed 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.750
 I always finish my makeup with 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.639
 my line of eyeliner was training north I 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.130
 believe it's not me so I'm 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.060
 make a line of eye liner quite thick and 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.800
 that's what will constitute 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:05.860
 mainly my eye makeup 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:07.630
 I will not do anything else next 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.300
 Mount up red lipstick 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.930
 so you had to understand it over 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.789
 videos 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.530
 I really like red 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:15.669
 lips in red so what am I doing 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.770
 it is that I make my lip contour 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:19.780
 then I apply my lipstick one 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.060
 this is a lip anchor from 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.340
 sephora whom I fell in love with 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.440
 the girls I will talk to you again very 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:34.539
 certainly favorites I love him 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:36.840
 of love and finally a little bit of 

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:36.840
 maka 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.540
 that's what gives my makeup 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.190
 in the end the girls it's really the 

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.450
 makeup that I wear everyday 

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.470
 every day it's a makeup that 

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.900
 I like it a lot because I find it 

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.300
 quite simple and fast enough to achieve 

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.410
 I hope this video will have you more 

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.710

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.450
 kisses 

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.850
 I really enjoyed myself 

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:09.290

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.290
