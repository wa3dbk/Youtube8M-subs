00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
 attention deficit disorder 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.700
 a different vision 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.029
 we have to soon 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.590
 a maelstrom of attention deficit disorder diagnoses 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.179
 these diagnoses are based on a test 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.480
 that just look at them behavior 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.519
 if there is any physical or emotional cause 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.419
 Juan Bastos 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.810
 many and different causes 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.300
 why the child can show 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.630
 distraction 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.970
 impulsiveness 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.730
 and interactivity 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.730
 which are the main symptoms of this disorder 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.920
 for example 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.780
 if the child took a lot of sugar 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.890
 or caffeine 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.300
 they placed the evil 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.460
 yes it draws attention 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.760
 if you have sleep disorders 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.970
 they are still wrong 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.540
 if he does not listen correctly 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.700
 Or simply 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 if he is a spoiled spoiled child 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.690
 may show the same symptoms as the so-called disorder but 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 attention deficiencies 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.490
 usually 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.170
 most of these children 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.140
 can concentrate on something that interests them 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
 and they do it in a profound way 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.090
 that is to say 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.010
 that when you focus and concentrate on tasks that do not interest you 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.230
 It is said that 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.230
 who has attention deficit disorders 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.250
 what's going on 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.310
 that only suffer this so-called pathology 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.010
 at certain times and these moments just happen 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
 when something is not interested 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.760
 because of this 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.500
 Many children of ages that can be up to three years old 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.970
 they are medicated with illegal drugs 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.470
 but they do not stop being drugs 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.470
 and these are of the amphetamine type 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.330
 I met a 10 year old girl 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.780
 which had been mythical 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.680
 and its appearance although of tranquility 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.070
 I transmitted it to the same energy 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.290
 kelati a person currently works and canceled 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.189
 and yesterday from chicago 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:13.549
 at five years 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.329
 because he was aggressive 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.689
 and they had to take her out of school 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.689
 because due to the side effects of the medication 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.889
 had turned 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.879
 again aggressive 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.879
 in many of the schools currently 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.249
 there he a Mexican boy 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:33.929
 many houses 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.079
 and many educators already demand 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.789
 that in their classrooms 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.759
 I bite the children 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.349
 so that they are 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.450
 like children 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.350
 they are socially annoying 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.799
 they are owed 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.590
 look around you the consequences of what you did and the 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.970
 heroin 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.229
 cocaine 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.229
 and what he is doing with many members of society 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.590
 the medication given to these children is not much better 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.659
 children become addicted to these drugs 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.979
 and in this way 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.979
 the door opens future actions 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.849
 we love us 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.099
 that it is very difficult to help children 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.389
 but it is not so 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.659
 and is learn by imitation and this society 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.659
 it goes to 150 kilometers per hour 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.000
 if society changes 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.909
 children change 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.959
 and we adults 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.959
 we are the ones who have to do the steps 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:37.720
 exist 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.680
 since long ago natural alternatives that can be used 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.179
 as for example the feeding 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:46.719
 the color of the skin 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.409
 music therapy 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.069
 and much more 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.279
 in which you can easily start the text in question 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:56.429
 we do a course 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.179
 for all the people who love each other 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:00.919
 icir and have 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.869
 simple and natural resources 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.869
 here the children are balanced sets 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.149
 I wait for you 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.149
 The Campus 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:12.689
 to work them 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.509
 a greeting with love 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.109
