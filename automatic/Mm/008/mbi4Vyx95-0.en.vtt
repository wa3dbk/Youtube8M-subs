00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.170
 hi friends and welcome to a 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.529
 new video to take a piece with 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.240
 piano shooting is easy point fr we will see 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.789
 the third part of the piece beautiful 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.199
 misfortune of emmanuel moire this time 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.900
 we see what the rhythmic way 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.220
 much more complicated so here so 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.510
 you really do not get out of it 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.240
 start making the video before 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.009
 whose who is here if you come across 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.480
 by chance and ben you also have the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.399
 couple is we could learn here 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.059
 here and ben you have everything he 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.200
 we have to be right now for 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.120
 see what all you need to know 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.860
 to make the chorus it's gone 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.539
 so for this chorus we will start 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.820
 by a first part we will learn 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.190
 the melodies and then we will stick to them 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.550
 agreements over always at the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.050
 right hand for to really try 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.730
 to understand how these 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.790
 little melodies that we will do 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.589
 so how does it work we have our 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.050
 first four agreements we have our if 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.149
 flat minor ground 6 the back and the d 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.860
 minor on these four chords there we go 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.190
 make a little melody that is going to be 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.500
 based on remy family that we will do 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.130
 with fingers 3 4 5 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.440
 so we're going to make an enemy family remy 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.390
 family one is always sure of eight 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.840
 shots and we'll do the eight shots 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.270
 like that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.950
 this little melody is playing on the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.050
 so flat the minor ground if it's the d 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.230
 minor on the back we will trade our 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.540
 network for that to be fairer 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.150
 so what are we going to do on 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.300
 so flat we will do family remy 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:50.280
 rebih family the minor soil the same 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:53.900
 thing the back with a back 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.900
 and would have him again priest 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.110
 what is going to do the left hand she is going 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.119
 to do for pom pom pom the same octave 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.829
 that we saw in the simple part of 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.829
 chorus so we will do 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.130
 m 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.069
 case of course twice in a row but 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.170
 it's not rich enough yet 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.790
 so we go now and add a 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.790
 little bit the agreements we go there 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.450
 how to add the chords to this 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.510
 little melody down it's very simple 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.460
 will complete the little melody by the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.200
 notes in quotation marks missing from this 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.060
 agree that is to say that this melody 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.130
 for a flat, we already have our queen 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.140
 in the past, we are missing the B flat 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.850
 so we go for all the notes of 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.990
 the melody pressed with the thumb on the 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.990
 so flat we will do so 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.200
 for the floor the same with a floor 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.120
 for the back eh ben we already have back and me 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.560
 we miss the soil 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.950
 we already have it under the thumb so we're going 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.950
 do this 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.050
 and to lure we will put the thumb 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.970
 on the there we will recover their is under 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.970
 our third and the way it has already 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.220
 that's what will give with the hand 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.220
 left 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.610
 Oh 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.610
 Oh 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.720
 Oh 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.330
 good 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.690
 of course in a loop so here we have seen the 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.180
 beginning 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.110
 now we will see the second part 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.110
 the chorus is gone 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.660
 so we'll see now so the 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.069
 melody to do for the second part 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:51.640
 so we're going to make the soil so bad 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:57.410
 ground family after the ground fa mi mi fa 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:05.870
 so I would have them so flat on the ground 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:09.319
 fa mi soil fa mi soil fa mi mi mi fa 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.560
 ray and after we go back on the B flat 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.260
 the only way but we stop 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.000
 So here we have seen this little melody 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.940
 to you for the work already 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.870
 integrate it to know it 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.060
 we will now add the notes 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.280
 to make the agreement then at the same time 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.440
 only for the 6b booba for minor soil 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.970
 this base of B flat we will use 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.850
 their and at the same time as the melody 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:36.680
 so we'll do like this next for 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.300
 the half daubasse part we go on the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.300
 do with a 2nd time 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:51.330
 for the part in D minor we're going 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:53.160
 use theirs and for the minor do bwv 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.700
 the d minor back base we will use 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.700
 a back 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.110
 and then we do it again alone 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.560
 minors 7 is also grounded and have 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.300
 finished the last two on the chords 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.000
 but that's not all it will take in 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.560
 more alternate with a note for the 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.710
 first it's going to be so flat so we 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.710
 go do 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.030
 I make them the two agreements the 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.450
 two notes flat story and we do 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.740
 flat down the nas their and here I go there 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.950
 arrive 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:34.310
 so we make the story flat so flat 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.600
 their and a16 flat the re sol 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:41.360
 Yes 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.360
 after for the back we push on the ground 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.530
 for their husbands on the 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.279
 for the remunerated base of back we're going 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:02.729
 put a thumb on the floor it sounds 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:04.680
 better or 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.599
 for again the G minor this base 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.599
 in the cinema we come back to the same thing 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:16.629
 and then we'll do our 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:18.249
 suck 4 and our A major here and 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.370
 well now we'll see that with one to 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:20.370
 left 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.490
 we will see as much of what to do 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.939
 right is the left hand so that's fine 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.939
 give this 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.330
 for the 'dow' base two friends 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.690
 for the minor D 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.840
 the following agreement 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.930
 we also recall the modes 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.360
 and then we will do by women parma 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.660
 women women five shots in the hand 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.250
 left 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.200
 octave together well powerful and after 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.000
 we end up with a D minor 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.310
 so that's a little bit complicated 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.290
 it's up to you to try to find all 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.510
 your little tricks to watch the 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.730
 video to have everything of course we're going 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.490
 see the slow and fast demos that 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.500
 appears here to be able and well 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.930
 work at the same time as me but 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.390
 you have everything to do the piece 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.470
 that's it and well, as I always say it's 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.890
 to you work well 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.890
 ciao 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.530
 slaughterhouse
