00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
like part 110 for the idea is something

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.560 
like part 110 for the idea is something
like<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.440> something<00:00:17.130> like<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:18.000> today

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
like that something like that but today

objective<00:00:24.269> gameplay<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.900> thought<00:00:25.650> team

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
objective gameplay I thought team

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.529 
objective gameplay I thought team
deathmatch<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.000> go<00:00:27.119> back<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539

but they don't really need them let's
move<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> objective<00:00:52.260> kill<00:00:52.710> shrieks

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
move on to the objective kill shrieks

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.569 
move on to the objective kill shrieks
that<00:00:53.719> that<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> thought<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.980> right<00:00:56.460> off<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that that I thought up so right off the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.250 
that that I thought up so right off the
bat<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.090> thought<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.809> make<00:00:58.050> them

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
bat I thought I would make them

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.889 
bat I thought I would make them
stackable<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.430> beats<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.149> gameplay<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
stackable this beats up the gameplay and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
stackable this beats up the gameplay and
the<00:01:01.140> non<00:01:01.289> stackable<00:01:01.829> scale<00:01:02.190> creaks<00:01:02.219> like

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the non stackable scale creaks like

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.520 
the non stackable scale creaks like
we've<00:01:02.699> seen<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:03.000> black<00:01:03.180> ops<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:04.080> addition<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
we've seen in black ops in addition to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500 
we've seen in black ops in addition to
ghosts<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.549> slow<00:01:05.850> down<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> gameplay

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
ghosts it really slow down the gameplay

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.730 
ghosts it really slow down the gameplay
and<00:01:06.720> made<00:01:06.840> everybody<00:01:07.229> camp<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and made everybody camp for the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.350 
and made everybody camp for the
killstreaks<00:01:09.799> also<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.210> because<00:01:12.210> they're

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
killstreaks also in because they're

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.539 
killstreaks also in because they're
stackable<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> make<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.520> that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
stackable is going to make it so that

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.130 
stackable is going to make it so that
you<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> certain<00:01:15.840> number<00:01:15.869> of

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
could be faster objective cap I don't

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.730

know<00:03:39.300> what<00:03:39.450> you'd<00:03:39.600> call<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:40.020> may<00:03:40.230> be<00:03:40.290> like

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.130 

eet<00:03:43.740> I<00:03:44.070> don't<00:03:44.610> know<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.910> cup<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.360> don't<00:03:45.990> really

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
eet I don't know that cup I don't really

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.190 
eet I don't know that cup I don't really
know<00:03:47.209> probably<00:03:48.209> come<00:03:48.420> about<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.720> name<00:03:48.900> later

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
know probably come about the name later

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.070 
know probably come about the name later
but<00:03:49.740> it's<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.220> my<00:03:50.370> idea<00:03:50.490> for<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.420> it'll

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
but it's just my idea for it that it'll

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.510 
but it's just my idea for it that it'll
probably<00:03:52.320> make<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.620> capture<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.190> just<00:03:53.430> a

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
probably make you capture it just a

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.520 
probably make you capture it just a
little<00:03:53.550> bit<00:03:53.820> faster<00:03:54.030> like<00:03:54.360> maybe<00:03:54.570> 1.5<00:03:54.900> times

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
little bit faster like maybe 1.5 times

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.949 
little bit faster like maybe 1.5 times
faster<00:03:56.120> this<00:03:57.120> makes<00:03:57.360> us<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:57.750> right

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
faster this makes us so that right

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.630 
faster this makes us so that right
before<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.350> hit<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.560> objective<00:03:59.280> capture

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
they're all running around the map so

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.750 
they're all running around the map so
it's<00:04:52.380> kind<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.590> like<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:52.800> decoy<00:04:53.280> grenade<00:04:53.610> but

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
it's kind of like a decoy grenade but

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.000

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
and it's going to drop a lot more bombs

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.590 
and it's going to drop a lot more bombs
like<00:05:35.370> pretty<00:05:35.700> much<00:05:35.790> you<00:05:36.030> can<00:05:36.210> cover<00:05:36.390> the<00:05:36.570> whole

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
like pretty much you can cover the whole

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.469 
like pretty much you can cover the whole
map<00:05:37.080> like<00:05:37.380> i'm<00:05:38.100> talking<00:05:38.280> like<00:05:38.460> derail<00:05:39.180> sighs

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.960

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
like a horizontal across that whole

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.060 
like a horizontal across that whole
thing<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.450> then<00:05:43.229> another<00:05:43.320> eight<00:05:43.740> kill<00:05:43.950> she

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
thing and then another eight kill she

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.860 
thing and then another eight kill she
could<00:05:44.220> be<00:05:44.310> the<00:05:44.430> EMP<00:05:45.000> from<00:05:45.210> modern<00:05:45.450> warfare<00:05:45.570> 2

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
could be the EMP from modern warfare 2

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.469 
could be the EMP from modern warfare 2
now<00:05:46.590> this<00:05:46.710> was<00:05:46.890> a<00:05:46.919> good<00:05:47.160> kill<00:05:47.400> streak<00:05:47.669> in

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
now this was a good kill streak in

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.240 
now this was a good kill streak in
modern<00:05:48.720> warfare<00:05:48.870> 2<00:05:49.080> but<00:05:49.350> however<00:05:49.530> it<00:05:49.919> seemed

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
modern warfare 2 but however it seemed

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.340 
modern warfare 2 but however it seemed
kind<00:05:50.580> of<00:05:50.669> worthless<00:05:50.990> for<00:05:51.990> where<00:05:52.140> it<00:05:52.260> was

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
kind of worthless for where it was

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.430 
kind of worthless for where it was
placed<00:05:52.500> on<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:52.890> 15<00:05:53.220> killstreak<00:05:53.669> because<00:05:54.440> if

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
placed on the 15 killstreak because if

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.140 
placed on the 15 killstreak because if
you<00:05:55.620> could<00:05:55.770> get<00:05:55.979> a<00:05:56.010> 15<00:05:56.400> kill<00:05:56.640> streak<00:05:56.880> it's

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
you could get a 15 kill streak it's

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.360 
you could get a 15 kill streak it's
pretty<00:05:57.510> much<00:05:57.720> useless<00:05:58.050> because<00:05:58.380> if<00:05:58.830> you<00:05:59.010> are

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
pretty much useless because if you are

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.250 
pretty much useless because if you are
getting<00:05:59.520> 15<00:06:00.030> kill<00:06:00.210> shake<00:06:00.419> you're<00:06:01.020> pretty<00:06:01.200> much

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
getting 15 kill shake you're pretty much
