on the B string and I'm using those two
things<00:03:47.860> that<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.130> find<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.430> easier<00:03:48.730> it's

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
things that I find the easier it's

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.930 
things that I find the easier it's
easier<00:03:49.090> for<00:03:49.420> me<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.570> do<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:49.930> way<00:03:50.340> so<00:03:51.340> do<00:03:51.790> this

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
easier for me to do that way so do this

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
easier for me to do that way so do this
slowly<00:03:56.760> there's<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.820> couple<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.240> slides<00:03:58.630> in

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
slowly there's a couple of slides in

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
keeping the same shape and then slide on

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.010 
keeping the same shape and then slide on
the<00:04:11.710> last<00:04:11.920> my<00:04:12.250> last<00:04:12.430> better<00:04:12.760> phrase<00:04:13.180> okay<00:04:13.960> so

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
the last my last better phrase okay so

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.100 
the last my last better phrase okay so
it<00:04:14.170> does<00:04:14.350> not<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:15.270> that's<00:04:16.270> the<00:04:16.390> main<00:04:16.570> bit<00:04:16.840> and

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
it does not and that's the main bit and

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.020 
it does not and that's the main bit and
there's<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.320> slight<00:04:17.590> variation<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.430> it<00:04:18.580> so<00:04:18.970> it

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
there's a slight variation to it so it

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:30.360 
there's a slight variation to it so it
does<00:04:19.150> that<00:04:19.330> two<00:04:19.510> times<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:25.360> variation<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:29.370> so

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
does that two times the variation is so

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.160 
does that two times the variation is so
I'm<00:04:30.430> hammering<00:04:30.730> on<00:04:30.940> my<00:04:31.210> little<00:04:31.420> finger<00:04:31.690> and

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
I'm hammering on my little finger and

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.390 
I'm hammering on my little finger and
that's<00:04:32.440> going<00:04:32.650> across<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.980> G<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.370> B

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
that's going across the G and the B

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.990 
that's going across the G and the B
strings<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.150> thirteenth<00:04:34.810> fret<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.820> that's

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
strings of the thirteenth fret so that's

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.880 
strings of the thirteenth fret so that's
that's<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.600> variation<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.380> then<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.770> goes

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
that's the variation and then it goes

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:49.380 
that's the variation and then it goes
back<00:04:41.920> to<00:04:42.490> doing<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:44.770> normal<00:04:45.130> one<00:04:47.880> okay<00:04:48.880> so

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
back to doing the normal one okay so

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.230 
back to doing the normal one okay so
I'll<00:04:49.990> try<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.260> play<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.620> again<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.240> any

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
I'll try to play that again and any

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:02.580 
I'll try to play that again and any

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.930 

okay<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:03.650> I'm<00:05:03.770> just<00:05:03.830> doing<00:05:04.040> downstrokes<00:05:04.760> with

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
okay so I'm just doing downstrokes with

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.660 
okay so I'm just doing downstrokes with
that<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:06.290> that's<00:05:06.650> that's<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.370> other<00:05:07.460> guitar

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
that and that's that's the other guitar

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.910 
that and that's that's the other guitar
part<00:05:08.180> it's<00:05:08.810> amazing<00:05:09.170> how<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.320> two<00:05:09.410> guitar

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920

parts<00:05:10.250> work<00:05:10.690> work<00:05:11.690> together<00:05:11.930> now<00:05:12.290> hopefully

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
parts work work together now hopefully

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.770 
parts work work together now hopefully
that<00:05:12.770> gives<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.220> enough<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:14.030> get<00:05:14.210> started<00:05:14.660> or
