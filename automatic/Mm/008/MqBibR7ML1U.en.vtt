00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 thanks to all who watch my videos and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.610
 they comment on them thank you for 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.920
 share it if nobody tells you a look 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.199
 I think it's very easy to do but 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.940
 it 's easy, it's something that we all 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.920
 it takes to happen located that suddenly 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.600
 you have some commitment in the night you go 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.070
 coming from work you want to see 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.019
 gorgeous but does not have a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.359
 member to do it is the tutorial 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.039
 indicated so you know what to do as 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.830
 a month ago what is very fast without 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.290
 problems that you are wrong or not 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.260
 have time to do that 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.790
 use of Scandinavian partner of 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.680
 first makeup spray 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.130
 everything is to do fast then 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.930
 This is very quick and easy to apply 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.700
 now I'm going to mix two makeups I'm going 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.970
 to use one completely mate and mike 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.980
 leigh de ahuatlán and its in mural or mix 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.980
 of the two will give me a matte finish 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:08.530
 and a little gloss now of concealer 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.530
 use of more problems in increase 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.799
 now I will explain from without more eyes 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.470
 and I'm going to use the marx shadow duo 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.750
 sanity I'm going to use this first with 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.080
 a plan brush as if it were the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.080
 black 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.650
 and subtly 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.130
 I'm going to outline my eyes 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.060
 it does not have to be perfect the joke is 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.060
 frame the look very well with this 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.569
 shadow obviously simulating that it is a 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.569
 eyeliner 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.610
 i 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.080
 just apply it on the mobile eyelid 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.510
 you can see that right where 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.270
 come this part I finished applying the 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.120
 shadow now comes not fun with a 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.630
 brush to blur one like 217 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.520
 others I will use the color more 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.760
 clarito and what I'm going to do 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.980
 mainly right now is to erase all 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.190
 the errors right on the edge where 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.920
 stop applying the dark shadow 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.720
 I continue applying color where there was 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.090
 dark color but now I'm starting 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.340
 with a clearer one and I will give strokes 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.260
 ascending 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.440
 from one place to another to start 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.519
 blur that color and convert this 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.519
 shadow in a shadow 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.840
 i 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.840
 yes 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.460
 with realizing that you only use only 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.790
 remember once with this same 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:53.489
 can blur come and go to make 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.489
 a shadow completely blurred 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.349
 when I get to the top 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.690
 what you should do is apply a lot 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.700
 less pressure besides we already have 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.250
 a little color and that's always going to 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.020
 help give us a lot of cardio but 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.829
 when this part arrived it barely touched 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.769
 and that helps me to blur it 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.270
 and lose all traces of spots 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.639
 there 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.729
 and 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.729
 Y 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.960
 now I stay in the front line of 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.960
 my eyes from below 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.020
 and here when it reaches the edge of your 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.500
 eye remember to always go towards your eyebrows 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.720
 or to be a practically straight line 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.400
 and immediately connects with what 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.530
 you had previously done something of the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.660
 that I love this look besides 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.250
 which makes it very fast and easy to do 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.350
 is that we are not using any 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.450
 eyeliner and in particular we are 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.680
 using a black eyeliner that 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.210
 inhibited when you speak an eyeliner 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.580
 black that when you practice mascara 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.440
 always the darkest is going to be the 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.200
 eyeliner when I in Chinese my 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.180
 eyelashes and I apply mascara the only black 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.730
 that we have in our eyes is the eyelashes 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.590
 which means that they will look much the 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.400
 eyelashes and they are going to have a very 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.650
 important in the look yes 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.050
 make the shadows stop being noticed 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.710
 and the lashes stop noticing right now 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.710
 they will see the difference 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.880
 one eye 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.760
 with mascara and the other if immediately 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.960
 they will notice how much more is already seen 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.850
 marked all he 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.039
 I think that here you can notice not only 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.680
 how my eyes opened much more but 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.780
 as it makes that effect even more smoky the 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.729
 have the black lashes and the rest of 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.310
 the shadows in a cafe although it was a 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.289
 very dark coffee is a coffee is not black 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.160
 then that is always going to make it 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:02.970
 notice the difference and look at everything or 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.740
 be the mascara the shadow all on your part 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.349
 now to paint a very fast eyebrow 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.349
 I'll use a very light shade I 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.150
 to use which of mac and a brush not so 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:15.479
 delgadito that can be used to 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:19.849
 blur something what is brush is going 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.849
 to help is to make a uniform stroke 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.389
 and finish super fast to paint my 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.480
 eyebrows the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.700
 fill in the holes 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.850
 let's say I'm shading a bit my 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.850
 eyebrows 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.240
 and since it's so clear, it does not matter that much 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.639
 how accurate I am 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.880
 Now suddenly I will use Pixie to 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.460
 place in touch and my fan brush 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.780
 make up forever I like it because 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.780
 it came in super fast 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.260
 and I'm not going to give a contrast to 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.740
 rest of my face that is very quality 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:04.330
 I'm going to use the 560 de l'oréal between rosa 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.330
 and with a little purple 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.220
 here is a smoke is already super easy to 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:12.139
 make perfect for when you're at 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.240
