00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
something that everybody's learned in

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.780 
something that everybody's learned in
school<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:34.450> incorrect

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.290 
the lines remember this little trick
there's<00:00:46.150> my<00:00:46.420> cute<00:00:47.220> well<00:00:48.220> that<00:00:48.699> is<00:00:48.850> incorrect

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
there's my cute well that is incorrect

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:59.210 
there's my cute well that is incorrect
and<00:00:49.809> here's<00:00:50.080> why<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:53.710> my<00:00:53.860> lovely<00:00:54.040> cube<00:00:54.430> here

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.060 

if<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.910> facing<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.630> just<00:01:01.470> like<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> picture

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
if it's facing you just like the picture

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.790 
if it's facing you just like the picture
here<00:01:02.280> perfect<00:01:02.880> square<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> front<00:01:03.800> you

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
here perfect square in the front you

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.360 
here perfect square in the front you
can't<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.580> sides<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.210> top<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.370> so

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
can't see the sides and top can you so

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.590 
can't see the sides and top can you so
this<00:01:08.640> square<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.330> would<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.620> have<00:01:10.740> been

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
this square here would have to have been

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.230 
this square here would have to have been
stretched<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.680> side<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.120> be

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
stretched to the side so it would be

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.290 
stretched to the side so it would be
crooked<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.229> acute<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:18.150> we're

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
crooked it would not be acute so we're

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.420 
crooked it would not be acute so we're
gonna<00:01:18.390> draw<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> real<00:01:18.990> Q<00:01:19.260> and<00:01:19.979> we're<00:01:20.070> gonna<00:01:20.190> draw

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
gonna draw a real Q and we're gonna draw

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.130 
gonna draw a real Q and we're gonna draw
it<00:01:21.800> from<00:01:22.800> this<00:01:22.950> angle<00:01:23.240> where<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.660> two

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
it from this angle where we can see two

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.520 
it from this angle where we can see two
sides<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.970> top<00:01:27.150> again<00:01:27.720> analytical<00:01:28.380> line

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
sides and the top again analytical line

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.859 
sides and the top again analytical line
drawing<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> start<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.300> is<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
drawing so I'm going to start with is a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
drawing so I'm going to start with is a
straight<00:01:31.229> line<00:01:31.410> up<00:01:31.649> and<00:01:31.860> down<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> very

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
straight line up and down for the very

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.279 
straight line up and down for the very
front<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.410> cube<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:35.660> so<00:01:36.660> below<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
front of the cube here so below the

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.520 
front of the cube here so below the
middle<00:01:37.440> of<00:01:37.619> my<00:01:37.800> paper<00:01:39.080> so<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.289> room<00:01:40.500> for

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
middle of my paper so I have room for

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.790 
middle of my paper so I have room for
that<00:01:40.860> top<00:01:41.750> I'm<00:01:42.750> gonna<00:01:42.899> draw<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.649> down

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
that top I'm gonna draw up and down

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.900 
that top I'm gonna draw up and down
lightly<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> line<00:01:45.539> shows<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.759> all<00:01:47.759> right

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
lightly so the line shows up all right

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.420 
lightly so the line shows up all right
now<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.450> take<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.660> look<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:48.990> my<00:01:49.110> cube<00:01:49.440> I<00:01:49.680> can

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
now if I take a look at my cube I can

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.210 
now if I take a look at my cube I can
see<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> sides<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.690> on<00:01:52.039> upward<00:01:53.039> angle

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
see the sides are going on upward angle

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.249 
see the sides are going on upward angle
see<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:55.940> slight<00:01:56.940> upward<00:01:57.509> angle<00:01:57.690> it's<00:01:58.020> kind

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
see that slight upward angle it's kind

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.070 
see that slight upward angle it's kind
of<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.470> an<00:01:58.619> arrow<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.399> flat<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.539> hit<00:02:00.750> not

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
of like an arrow a flat if it's hit not

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.010 
of like an arrow a flat if it's hit not
pointy<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:03.119> stop<00:02:04.050> when<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:04.410> shows<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:06.020> back

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
pointy and stop when it shows up back

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.490 
pointy and stop when it shows up back
and<00:02:07.319> forth<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.060> flat<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.500> now

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and forth so I have that flat out now

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.520 
and forth so I have that flat out now
the<00:02:10.590> thing<00:02:10.830> about<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.069> cube<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.990> this<00:02:12.990> line<00:02:13.290> is

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the thing about a cube is this line is

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.370 
the thing about a cube is this line is
parallel<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:15.000> line<00:02:15.060> parallel<00:02:15.990> in<00:02:16.230> other

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
parallel to this line parallel in other

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.110 
parallel to this line parallel in other
words<00:02:16.560> if<00:02:16.800> they<00:02:16.980> were<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.190> go<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.459> forever<00:02:17.700> they

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
words if they were to go on forever they

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.510 
words if they were to go on forever they
would<00:02:18.270> never<00:02:18.420> cross<00:02:18.950> exactly<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.069> same<00:02:20.310> angle

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
would never cross exactly the same angle

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.780 
would never cross exactly the same angle
from<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.900> here<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:23.190> now<00:02:23.340> I'm<00:02:23.459> gonna<00:02:23.580> look

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
from here to here so now I'm gonna look

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.880 
from here to here so now I'm gonna look
at<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.090> angle<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.319> helps<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.709> take

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
at this angle and if it helps to take

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.970 
at this angle and if it helps to take
your<00:02:26.069> pencil<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:27.260> drag<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.440> up<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.620> just

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
your pencil and drag it up and just

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.670 
your pencil and drag it up and just
visualize<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.819> angle<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:33.680> back

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
visualize that angle you do that back

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.830 
visualize that angle you do that back
and<00:02:34.860> forth<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.370> back<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.610> forth<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.690> can

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
and forth and back and forth you can

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.420 
and forth and back and forth you can
always<00:02:36.989> make<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.290> lines<00:02:37.590> longer<00:02:38.010> than<00:02:38.280> you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
always make the lines longer than you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.089 
always make the lines longer than you
think<00:02:38.610> they<00:02:38.819> should<00:02:38.849> be<00:02:39.120> okay<00:02:40.080> because<00:02:40.950> we

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
think they should be okay because we

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.940 
think they should be okay because we
don't<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.430> where<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.090> ends<00:02:42.330> yet<00:02:42.860> now<00:02:43.860> I'm

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
don't know where it ends yet now I'm

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.949 
don't know where it ends yet now I'm
gonna<00:02:44.040> do<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> same<00:02:44.610> thing<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.510> other<00:02:45.540> side

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
gonna do the same thing the other side

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.199 
gonna do the same thing the other side
back<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.349> forth<00:02:46.830> back<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.190> forth<00:02:47.430> before

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
I'm gonna draw these two sides here and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.010 
I'm gonna draw these two sides here and
here<00:02:55.110> which<00:02:56.099> are<00:02:56.520> parallel<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.959> line

okay

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
okay

that to make it easy you can look at the

side of your paper make it parallel with
that<00:03:15.710> because<00:03:15.950> we're<00:03:16.220> drawing<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.640> straight

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
that because we're drawing it straight

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.110 
that because we're drawing it straight
up<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.720> down<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:19.100> you'll<00:03:19.220> see<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:19.580> line<00:03:19.820> was

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
up and down and you'll see this line was

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.540 
up and down and you'll see this line was
a<00:03:20.150> little<00:03:20.420> longer<00:03:20.630> here<00:03:21.020> I<00:03:21.230> didn't<00:03:22.160> go<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
a little longer here I didn't go to the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.740 
a little longer here I didn't go to the

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
end of the line or it would have been

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.720 
end of the line or it would have been
this<00:03:23.960> angle<00:03:24.440> which<00:03:24.620> would<00:03:24.770> be<00:03:24.890> incorrect

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
this angle which would be incorrect

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.250 
this angle which would be incorrect
you<00:03:25.910> want<00:03:26.090> this<00:03:26.210> one<00:03:27.070> same<00:03:28.070> over<00:03:28.640> here

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
you want this one same over here

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.600 
you want this one same over here
straight<00:03:30.260> up<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.590> down<00:03:30.770> and<00:03:31.100> again<00:03:31.280> using

straight up and down and again using

straight up and down and again using
this<00:03:31.730> side<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.240> paper<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:33.560> get<00:03:33.680> parallel

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
this side of the paper you get parallel

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.640 
this side of the paper you get parallel
or<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.210> can<00:03:35.540> take<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.840> from<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.110> center<00:03:36.350> and

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
or I can take it from the center and

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.210 
or I can take it from the center and
drag<00:03:36.830> my<00:03:37.010> pencil<00:03:37.400> up<00:03:37.490> and<00:03:37.730> visualize<00:03:38.740> down<00:03:39.740> up

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
drag my pencil up and visualize down up

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.120 
drag my pencil up and visualize down up
down<00:03:40.520> till<00:03:40.820> it<00:03:40.880> shows<00:03:41.090> up<00:03:41.330> and<00:03:41.540> stop<00:03:42.070> now<00:03:43.070> the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
down till it shows up and stop now the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.840 
down till it shows up and stop now the
trick<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.460> the<00:03:43.730> top<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.410> this<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:46.370> parallel

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
trick to the top is this is parallel

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.170 
trick to the top is this is parallel
with<00:03:47.330> this<00:03:48.050> across<00:03:48.620> from<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.700> can<00:03:49.970> take

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
with this across from it so I can take

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.410 
with this across from it so I can take
this<00:03:50.420> angle<00:03:50.840> pull<00:03:51.470> across<00:03:52.090> visualize<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.240> from

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
this angle pull across visualize it from

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.920 
this angle pull across visualize it from
the<00:03:53.540> corner<00:03:54.010> which<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.100> here

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.350 

and<00:03:58.349> draw<00:03:58.560> back<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.099> forth<00:03:59.400> until<00:03:59.849> it<00:04:00.150> shows

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
and draw back and forth until it shows

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.250 
and draw back and forth until it shows
up<00:04:01.489> and<00:04:02.489> stop<00:04:02.790> now<00:04:03.450> again<00:04:03.720> if<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.989> was<00:04:04.110> to

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
up and stop now again if I was to

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.509 
up and stop now again if I was to
connect<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.680> end<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.010> line<00:04:05.190> with<00:04:05.370> this

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
connect the end of the line with this

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.940 
connect the end of the line with this
corner<00:04:05.940> would<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.049> be<00:04:07.200> parallel<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.890> this

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
corner would that be parallel to this

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.780 
corner would that be parallel to this
line<00:04:08.069> here

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
line here

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.680 
line here
yeah<00:04:09.330> wrong<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.500> want<00:04:11.129> it<00:04:11.190> parallel<00:04:11.670> so<00:04:12.569> I'm

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
yeah wrong I want it parallel so I'm

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.420 
yeah wrong I want it parallel so I'm
gonna<00:04:12.900> slide<00:04:13.200> my<00:04:13.230> pencil<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.370> corner<00:04:14.819> here

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
gonna slide my pencil to the corner here

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.150 
gonna slide my pencil to the corner here
visualize<00:04:17.430> its<00:04:18.120> parallel<00:04:18.739> y'all<00:04:19.739> back<00:04:19.949> and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
visualize its parallel y'all back and

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.790 
visualize its parallel y'all back and
forth<00:04:20.660> all<00:04:21.660> right<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.109> now<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.260> have<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.530> light

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
forth all right so now I have a light

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.219 
forth all right so now I have a light
cube<00:04:23.300> now<00:04:24.300> I'm<00:04:24.630> gonna<00:04:24.780> change<00:04:25.050> it

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
cube now I'm gonna change it

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.830 
cube now I'm gonna change it
analytically<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.940> line<00:04:27.210> here<00:04:27.540> is<00:04:27.690> the

analytically the line here is the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.060 
analytically the line here is the
closest<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:30.090> first<00:04:30.389> line<00:04:30.600> we<00:04:30.780> did

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
closest to you the first line we did

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.590 
closest to you the first line we did
this<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:32.280> easy<00:04:32.490> I'm<00:04:32.729> just<00:04:32.910> gonna<00:04:33.030> draw<00:04:33.270> up<00:04:33.300> and

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
this is easy I'm just gonna draw up and

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.689 
this is easy I'm just gonna draw up and
down<00:04:35.150> draw<00:04:36.150> up<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.449> down<00:04:36.570> until<00:04:36.780> it's<00:04:37.050> dark

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.600 

these<00:04:41.699> lines<00:04:42.000> are<00:04:42.240> medium<00:04:42.919> right<00:04:43.919> because

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
these lines are medium right because

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.480 
these lines are medium right because
they're<00:04:44.760> halfway<00:04:45.620> from<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.830> front<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.460> the

back<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.090> this<00:04:48.150> would<00:04:48.360> be<00:04:48.449> a<00:04:48.479> medium<00:04:48.720> on<00:04:49.080> both

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
back so this would be a medium on both

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.219 
back so this would be a medium on both
sides<00:04:50.000> draw<00:04:51.000> up<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.419> down<00:04:51.600> until<00:04:51.960> it's<00:04:52.260> medium

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
sides draw up and down until it's medium

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:02.570 
sides draw up and down until it's medium
stop<00:04:56.030> it's<00:04:57.030> medium<00:04:58.669> stop<00:05:00.050> all<00:05:01.050> right<00:05:01.229> now<00:05:02.190> the

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
stop it's medium stop all right now the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.440 
stop it's medium stop all right now the
very<00:05:02.789> back<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.860> lightest<00:05:05.280> now<00:05:06.090> remember

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
very back is the lightest now remember

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.150 
very back is the lightest now remember
we're<00:05:06.630> doing<00:05:06.840> this<00:05:06.960> as<00:05:07.139> if<00:05:07.289> it's<00:05:07.470> glass<00:05:07.710> so

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
we're doing this as if it's glass so

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.320 
we're doing this as if it's glass so
what<00:05:08.310> I<00:05:08.340> want<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.610> do<00:05:08.729> is<00:05:08.880> from<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.150> back

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
what I want to do is from the back

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.240 
what I want to do is from the back
corner<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:09.930> want<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.680> draw<00:05:10.860> another<00:05:11.010> line

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
corner I want to draw another line

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.799 
corner I want to draw another line
straight<00:05:11.789> down<00:05:12.470> it's<00:05:13.470> light

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:16.809 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:18.969 

now<00:05:17.809> I<00:05:17.899> want<00:05:18.169> to<00:05:18.229> draw<00:05:18.379> a<00:05:18.409> line<00:05:18.559> from<00:05:18.619> this

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
now I want to draw a line from this

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.760 
now I want to draw a line from this
corner<00:05:19.339> that's<00:05:20.270> gonna<00:05:20.419> be<00:05:20.569> parallel<00:05:21.050> with

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
corner that's gonna be parallel with

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.759 
corner that's gonna be parallel with
this<00:05:21.919> side<00:05:24.099> it's<00:05:25.099> like<00:05:26.110> see<00:05:27.110> what's<00:05:27.289> happening

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:27.769 
this side it's like see what's happening

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:31.119 
this side it's like see what's happening
now<00:05:28.509> I<00:05:29.509> need<00:05:29.749> y'all<00:05:29.929> from<00:05:30.169> this<00:05:30.319> corner<00:05:30.709> a<00:05:30.860> line

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
now I need y'all from this corner a line

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.309 
now I need y'all from this corner a line
that<00:05:31.369> is<00:05:31.459> parallel<00:05:31.669> with<00:05:32.209> this<00:05:32.330> one<00:05:32.569> in<00:05:32.719> front

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.929 

it's<00:05:36.319> a<00:05:36.379> perfect<00:05:36.830> cube<00:05:37.129> everything<00:05:37.459> should

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:37.939 
it's a perfect cube everything should

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.639 
it's a perfect cube everything should
kind<00:05:38.149> of<00:05:38.269> merge<00:05:38.419> the<00:05:38.779> center<00:05:39.110> there<00:05:39.669> see<00:05:40.669> that

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:41.649 
kind of merge the center there see that

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:45.489 
kind of merge the center there see that
okay<00:05:42.879> now<00:05:43.879> remember<00:05:44.059> this<00:05:44.330> is<00:05:44.539> medium<00:05:44.869> dark

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:45.499 
okay now remember this is medium dark

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:49.839 
okay now remember this is medium dark
medium<00:05:46.279> this<00:05:46.819> one<00:05:46.999> stays<00:05:47.269> light<00:05:47.889> now<00:05:48.889> what<00:05:49.819> I

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
medium this one stays light now what I

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.329 
medium this one stays light now what I
need<00:05:50.089> to<00:05:50.240> do<00:05:50.449> is<00:05:50.779> take<00:05:51.019> this<00:05:51.439> line<00:05:51.800> here<00:05:52.129> from

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:52.339 
need to do is take this line here from

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.009 
need to do is take this line here from
medium<00:05:52.669> to<00:05:52.699> the<00:05:52.999> dark<00:05:53.269> and<00:05:53.539> it<00:05:53.599> has<00:05:53.719> to<00:05:53.869> get

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:54.019 
medium to the dark and it has to get

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:56.649 
medium to the dark and it has to get
gradually<00:05:54.559> medium<00:05:55.099> to<00:05:55.249> dark<00:05:55.659> gradually

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
gradually medium to dark gradually

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.919 
gradually medium to dark gradually
medium<00:05:57.019> to<00:05:57.199> dark<00:05:57.490> medium<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.699> dark<00:05:58.939> medium<00:05:59.779> to

00:05:59.919 --> 00:05:59.929 
medium to dark medium to dark medium to

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:01.989 
medium to dark medium to dark medium to
dark<00:06:00.169> and<00:06:00.499> here's<00:06:01.069> how<00:06:01.219> I<00:06:01.249> do<00:06:01.399> that<00:06:01.729> remember

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:01.999 
dark and here's how I do that remember

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:03.399 
dark and here's how I do that remember
the<00:06:02.119> rocking<00:06:02.509> motion<00:06:02.539> we<00:06:02.990> did<00:06:03.199> with<00:06:03.349> the

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
the rocking motion we did with the

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.279 
the rocking motion we did with the
cylinders<00:06:03.889> and<00:06:04.209> shorter<00:06:05.209> and<00:06:05.360> shorter<00:06:05.389> well

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
cylinders and shorter and shorter well

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.379 
cylinders and shorter and shorter well
this<00:06:06.409> is<00:06:06.559> a<00:06:06.619> similar<00:06:07.069> technique<00:06:07.519> I'm<00:06:08.119> going<00:06:08.209> to

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
this is a similar technique I'm going to

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.019 
this is a similar technique I'm going to
go<00:06:08.479> back<00:06:08.839> and<00:06:09.079> forth<00:06:09.349> and<00:06:10.129> get<00:06:10.309> shorter<00:06:10.849> and

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.029 
go back and forth and get shorter and

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:14.309 
go back and forth and get shorter and
shorter<00:06:11.089> and<00:06:11.929> shorter<00:06:12.039> to<00:06:13.039> the<00:06:13.369> dark<00:06:13.610> pitch

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
shorter and shorter to the dark pitch

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:26.080 
shorter and shorter to the dark pitch
stop<00:06:15.369> do<00:06:16.369> it<00:06:16.489> again<00:06:18.579> stop

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.230 

with<00:06:26.840> every<00:06:27.110> line<00:06:27.290> here<00:06:27.680> I<00:06:27.950> move<00:06:28.790> kind<00:06:29.090> of

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
with every line here I move kind of

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.000 
with every line here I move kind of
quick<00:06:29.480> so<00:06:29.780> if<00:06:29.900> the<00:06:30.020> video<00:06:30.140> isn't<00:06:30.650> too<00:06:30.770> long

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
quick so if the video isn't too long

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.200 
quick so if the video isn't too long
here<00:06:31.400> I<00:06:31.900> think<00:06:32.900> we<00:06:32.990> get<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.170> gist<00:06:33.970> I'm<00:06:34.970> gonna

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
here I think we get the gist I'm gonna

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.070 
here I think we get the gist I'm gonna
stop<00:06:35.620> and<00:06:36.620> gradually<00:06:37.400> shorter<00:06:37.910> shorter<00:06:38.540> as

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
stop and gradually shorter shorter as

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.600 
stop and gradually shorter shorter as
I'm<00:06:39.290> getting<00:06:39.530> the<00:06:39.650> dark<00:06:39.890> side

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
I'm getting the dark side

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:55.960 
I'm getting the dark side
stop<00:06:41.410> do<00:06:42.410> the<00:06:42.530> same<00:06:42.770> with<00:06:42.950> this<00:06:43.100> one<00:06:43.160> here<00:06:54.970> and

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
stop do the same with this one here and

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:02.590 
stop do the same with this one here and
this<00:06:56.270> one<00:07:00.490> and<00:07:01.490> this<00:07:01.640> should<00:07:01.850> start<00:07:02.180> bringing

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
this one and this should start bringing

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.130 
this one and this should start bringing
out<00:07:02.780> what<00:07:03.470> is<00:07:03.620> the<00:07:03.770> front<00:07:04.360> as<00:07:05.360> opposed<00:07:05.870> to<00:07:05.960> the

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.140 
out what is the front as opposed to the

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:15.370 
out what is the front as opposed to the
back<00:07:09.100> three-dimension<00:07:13.000> okay<00:07:14.030> now<00:07:15.020> the<00:07:15.080> same

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
back three-dimension okay now the same

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.690 
back three-dimension okay now the same
thing<00:07:15.410> is<00:07:15.680> gonna<00:07:15.770> happen<00:07:15.890> with<00:07:16.370> the<00:07:16.490> back

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:16.700 
thing is gonna happen with the back

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.770 
thing is gonna happen with the back
going<00:07:17.360> from<00:07:17.720> this<00:07:17.900> light<00:07:18.760> to<00:07:19.760> a<00:07:19.790> medium<00:07:20.270> so

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780 
going from this light to a medium so

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.300 
going from this light to a medium so
this<00:07:20.900> is<00:07:21.050> only<00:07:21.170> takes<00:07:21.470> a<00:07:21.590> couple<00:07:21.620> of<00:07:22.010> strokes

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:22.310 
this is only takes a couple of strokes

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.700 
this is only takes a couple of strokes
back<00:07:23.210> and<00:07:23.480> forth<00:07:23.690> back<00:07:23.990> and<00:07:24.020> forth<00:07:24.230> back<00:07:24.530> and
