Wayne's took out the wheels changed the
back<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.500> make<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.880> on

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
back just a little bit to make it on

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
back just a little bit to make it on
into<00:01:09.689> these<00:01:09.869> fitting<00:01:10.409> things<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> yeah<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.560> so

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
into these fitting things so yeah and so

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
into these fitting things so yeah and so
yeah<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.250> transformation<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.000> same

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
yeah and the transformation is the same

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.179 
yeah and the transformation is the same
exact<00:01:15.689> thing<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:15.930> there's<00:01:16.500> only<00:01:16.830> one

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
exact thing but there's only one

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.950 
exact thing but there's only one
difference<00:01:17.460> which<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.939> wings<00:01:18.270> which<00:01:18.780> I'll

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
difference which is the wings which I'll

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.899 
difference which is the wings which I'll
get<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.770> after<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.280> everything

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
get to that but after that everything

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
get to that but after that everything
else<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> same<00:01:21.479> except<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.590> this

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
else is the same except for this this

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.490 
else is the same except for this this
window<00:01:23.430> thing<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.000> eat<00:01:24.030> has<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> hinge<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
window thing you eat has a hinge so you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
window thing you eat has a hinge so you
could<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.430> way<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:27.030> won't<00:01:27.180> mess

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
could do that so that way it won't mess

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
could do that so that way it won't mess
up<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.439> because<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> only<00:01:29.460> thing

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
up it's because that was the only thing

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.030 
up it's because that was the only thing
supporting<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.360> was<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.720> wanted<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.710> this

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
supporting it I was I wanted that this

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.719 
supporting it I was I wanted that this
part<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.579> support<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:34.560> leg<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.100> that's<00:01:35.460> so

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
part to support the the leg so that's so

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
part to support the the leg so that's so
that's<00:01:35.880> why<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.420> boot<00:01:36.689> down<00:01:36.920> so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that's why I have this boot down so

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.190 
that's why I have this boot down so
there's<00:01:38.759> nothing<00:01:39.030> much<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.509> say<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:39.960> this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
there's nothing much to say about this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.039

flying<00:02:02.939> cars<00:02:06.049> so<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> transform<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.979> what

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
flying cars so to transform this what

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.880 
flying cars so to transform this what
we're<00:02:08.729> gonna<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:09.179> straighten<00:02:10.020> out<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.410> wings

that

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.339 
that
once<00:02:54.849> you're<00:02:54.970> done<00:02:55.120> here<00:02:55.419> you<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.989> jet<00:02:56.200> V

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
once you're done here you have the jet V

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.289 
once you're done here you have the jet V
countenance<00:02:56.859> robot<00:02:57.250> mode<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:57.939> see<00:02:58.090> all

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
countenance robot mode you can see all

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.569 
countenance robot mode you can see all
these<00:02:58.629> you<00:02:59.139> can<00:02:59.290> see<00:02:59.409> like<00:02:59.650> basically<00:03:00.280> minor

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
these you can see like basically minor

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.670 
these you can see like basically minor
changes<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.959> just<00:03:02.139> that<00:03:02.260> he<00:03:02.349> doesn't<00:03:02.379> have
