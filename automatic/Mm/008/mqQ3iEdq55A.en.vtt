were more consoles for sale I think

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.319 
were more consoles for sale I think
because<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.860> rare<00:01:32.220> these<00:01:32.700> consoles<00:01:33.119> are

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
because it's so rare these consoles are

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.240 
because it's so rare these consoles are
out<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.720> now<00:01:33.750> that's<00:01:34.619> why<00:01:34.770> these<00:01:34.829> robberies

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
