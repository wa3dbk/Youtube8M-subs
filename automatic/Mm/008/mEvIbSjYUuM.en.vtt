00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 
like the steam coming out of the pot and

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.750 
like the steam coming out of the pot and
shanna<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.280> well<00:03:30.239> spirit<00:03:31.400> it's<00:03:32.400> always<00:03:32.700> very

difficult<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.450> describe<00:03:33.900> my<00:03:34.560> teacher<00:03:34.769> would

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
difficult to describe my teacher would

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.679 
difficult to describe my teacher would
say<00:03:35.129> it's<00:03:35.280> related<00:03:35.939> to<00:03:36.329> war<00:03:37.200> or<00:03:37.469> nothingness<00:03:38.340> a

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:38.689 
say it's related to war or nothingness a

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:44.420 
say it's related to war or nothingness a
if<00:03:39.689> we<00:03:40.230> can<00:03:40.700> describe<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:41.969> it's<00:03:42.239> not<00:03:42.719> it<00:03:43.430> yea

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
if we can describe it it's not it yea

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.220 
if we can describe it it's not it yea
woe<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:45.000> nothingness<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:48.060> we<00:03:48.269> have<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
woe is nothingness so we have the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.920 
woe is nothingness so we have the
material<00:03:50.000> let's<00:03:51.000> take<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.450> example<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.900> have

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
material let's take the example I have

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.589 
material let's take the example I have
the<00:03:52.170> material<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.159> the<00:03:53.519> water<00:03:53.790> round<00:03:54.359> the

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
the material of the the water round the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:01.399 
the material of the the water round the
rice<00:03:55.069> it's<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.909> water<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.329> obviously<00:03:59.659> G<00:04:00.659> its

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
rice it's the water is obviously G its

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.949 
rice it's the water is obviously G its
material<00:04:02.069> now<00:04:03.030> when<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.329> water<00:04:03.540> becomes

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
material now when the water becomes

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.080 
material now when the water becomes
steam<00:04:04.349> it's<00:04:04.620> no<00:04:04.799> longer<00:04:05.010> water<00:04:05.400> but<00:04:05.909> it's

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
steam it's no longer water but it's

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.559 
steam it's no longer water but it's
there<00:04:08.060> so<00:04:09.060> it's<00:04:09.269> not<00:04:09.540> shun<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.919> it's<00:04:11.099> cheap

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
there so it's not shun so it's cheap

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.330 
there so it's not shun so it's cheap
when<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.689> water<00:04:12.870> continues<00:04:13.409> further<00:04:14.069> and

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
when the water continues further and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.310 
when the water continues further and
further<00:04:14.489> we<00:04:14.969> can<00:04:15.150> say<00:04:15.359> it's<00:04:15.510> chi<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.079> then

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
further we can say it's chi and then

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.560 
further we can say it's chi and then
suddenly<00:04:16.680> we<00:04:16.859> can't<00:04:17.099> find<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.579> anymore<00:04:17.820> then

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
suddenly we can't find it anymore then

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.080 
suddenly we can't find it anymore then
we<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.840> say<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.019> she<00:04:19.349> has<00:04:19.500> become<00:04:20.009> Shen<00:04:20.340> it's

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
we can say that she has become Shen it's

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.939 
we can say that she has become Shen it's
no<00:04:21.329> longer<00:04:21.509> there<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:23.509> then<00:04:24.509> at<00:04:24.660> some<00:04:24.840> point

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
no longer there and then at some point

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.420 
no longer there and then at some point
we<00:04:25.949> find<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.460> reappearing<00:04:27.449> on<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:28.289> window<00:04:28.680> and

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
we find it reappearing on the window and

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.460 
we find it reappearing on the window and
the<00:04:29.550> cold<00:04:29.789> surface<00:04:30.270> as<00:04:30.949> a<00:04:31.949> geniune<00:04:32.940> again<00:04:33.470> so

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
the cold surface as a geniune again so

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.339 
the cold surface as a geniune again so
it's<00:04:34.590> very<00:04:34.710> much<00:04:34.949> like<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.599> my<00:04:36.599> teacher<00:04:37.050> very

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
it's very much like a my teacher very

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.670 
it's very much like a my teacher very
much<00:04:37.500> explained<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.190> like<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.510> cycle<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:40.560> we

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
much explained it like a cycle so we

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.450 
much explained it like a cycle so we
have<00:04:40.889> obviously<00:04:41.669> we<00:04:41.880> have<00:04:42.800> this<00:04:43.800> gene<00:04:44.039> chichen

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
have obviously we have this gene chichen

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.129 
have obviously we have this gene chichen
it's<00:04:44.760> a<00:04:44.820> very<00:04:45.060> simple<00:04:45.330> very<00:04:46.220> simple<00:04:47.220> idea<00:04:48.139> my

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139

next level and say okay well if you have

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.740 
next level and say okay well if you have
Jing<00:04:52.800> then<00:04:53.099> you<00:04:53.250> have<00:04:53.460> obviously<00:04:54.389> you<00:04:54.570> have

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
which is very much more of a sensational

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.879 
which is very much more of a sensational
part<00:05:12.210> it's<00:05:12.539> much<00:05:12.690> more<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.020> sicknesses<00:05:13.560> or

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
part it's much more the sicknesses or

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.850 
part it's much more the sicknesses or
really<00:05:14.460> really<00:05:15.150> horrible<00:05:15.810> stuff<00:05:16.349> actually

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:27.439 

and<00:05:21.770> but<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.919> more<00:05:24.020> finer<00:05:25.669> energies<00:05:26.669> is<00:05:26.970> more

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
and but the more finer energies is more

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.980 
and but the more finer energies is more
difficult<00:05:27.570> to<00:05:27.960> feel<00:05:28.909> and<00:05:29.909> that<00:05:30.150> we<00:05:30.419> may<00:05:30.930> be

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
difficult to feel and that we may be

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.540 
difficult to feel and that we may be
cool<00:05:31.320> more<00:05:31.680> like<00:05:31.830> chichi<00:05:32.400> yeah<00:05:33.240> and<00:05:34.550> shan

cool more like chichi yeah and shan
cheese<00:05:35.849> it's<00:05:36.719> very<00:05:37.020> fine<00:05:37.740> almost

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
cheese it's very fine almost
