00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
think about that is it is the purpose of

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.349 
think about that is it is the purpose of
a<00:03:57.420> chil<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.950> get<00:03:59.130> your<00:03:59.310> money<00:03:59.639> I<00:03:59.910> don't<00:04:00.239> know

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
a chil to get your money I don't know

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.479 
a chil to get your money I don't know
you<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.900> weigh<00:04:01.079> in<00:04:01.260> on<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.560> comments<00:04:02.040> section

you can weigh in on the comments section
I<00:04:02.700> don't<00:04:03.540> really<00:04:03.660> think<00:04:03.780> they're<00:04:04.230> vital<00:04:04.769> I

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
I don't really think they're vital I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.759 
I don't really think they're vital I
mean<00:04:05.190> if<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:06.000> knife<00:04:06.299> did<00:04:06.599> not<00:04:06.810> have<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.019> chil<00:04:07.440> I

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
mean if this knife did not have a chil I

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.400 
mean if this knife did not have a chil I
still<00:04:08.730> would<00:04:08.880> have<00:04:08.910> purchased<00:04:09.419> a<00:04:09.540> knife<00:04:09.780> so

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
still would have purchased a knife so

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.650 
still would have purchased a knife so
that<00:04:10.680> pretty<00:04:10.950> much<00:04:11.069> yeah<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:12.150> mean<00:04:12.329> it's<00:04:12.389> not

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
that pretty much yeah I mean it's not

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.920 
that pretty much yeah I mean it's not
vital<00:04:13.190> not<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.370> me<00:04:14.519> not<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.299> case<00:04:15.630> I

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
vital not to me not in like this case I

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.710 
vital not to me not in like this case I
think<00:04:16.650> there's<00:04:17.130> kind<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.579> contradiction<00:04:18.269> to

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
think there's kind of a contradiction to

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.850 
think there's kind of a contradiction to
Choi's<00:04:19.169> because<00:04:20.359> major<00:04:21.359> drawback<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.440> trial

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
Choi's because major drawback of a trial

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.400 
Choi's because major drawback of a trial
is<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.940> you're<00:04:24.210> taking<00:04:24.750> edge<00:04:25.500> lengths

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
is that you're taking edge lengths

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.790 
is that you're taking edge lengths
a<00:04:26.440> way<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:27.610> make<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.090> choice<00:04:28.500> now<00:04:29.500> in<00:04:29.710> a

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
a way to make the choice now in a

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.860 
a way to make the choice now in a
smaller<00:04:30.160> knife<00:04:30.490> you're<00:04:31.300> going<00:04:31.480> to<00:04:31.540> miss<00:04:31.810> that

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
smaller knife you're going to miss that

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.970 
smaller knife you're going to miss that
edge<00:04:32.380> length<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:33.130> lot<00:04:33.850> more<00:04:34.180> than<00:04:35.170> in<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.500> longer

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
edge length a lot more than in a longer

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.550 
edge length a lot more than in a longer
knife<00:04:36.220> right<00:04:36.610> like<00:04:36.940> if<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:37.750> have<00:04:37.900> nine<00:04:38.170> inches

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
knife right like if you have nine inches

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.890 
knife right like if you have nine inches
of<00:04:38.740> edge<00:04:38.920> who<00:04:39.340> cares<00:04:39.670> about<00:04:39.910> this<00:04:40.240> last<00:04:40.540> inch

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
of edge who cares about this last inch

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.780 
of edge who cares about this last inch
of<00:04:41.140> coil<00:04:41.530> that's<00:04:41.770> not<00:04:42.130> you're<00:04:42.370> not<00:04:42.400> going<00:04:42.670> to

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
of coil that's not you're not going to

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.970 
of coil that's not you're not going to
miss<00:04:43.120> you're<00:04:43.660> not<00:04:43.810> going<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.080> need<00:04:44.350> that<00:04:44.590> like

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
miss you're not going to need that like

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.840 
miss you're not going to need that like
10<00:04:45.400> inch<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:46.470> blade<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:48.100> know<00:04:48.190> sharpened

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
10 inch of blade you know sharpened

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.650 
10 inch of blade you know sharpened
blade<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:51.550> you're<00:04:51.700> going<00:04:51.820> to<00:04:51.880> miss<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.150> edge

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
blade so you're going to miss that edge

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.060 
blade so you're going to miss that edge
length<00:04:53.020> less<00:04:53.530> on<00:04:53.920> a<00:04:53.950> long<00:04:54.250> blade<00:04:54.630> but<00:04:55.630> on<00:04:55.990> a

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
length less on a long blade but on a

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.430 
length less on a long blade but on a
long<00:04:57.070> blade<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.850> choil<00:04:58.150> helps<00:04:58.660> less<00:04:58.900> also<00:04:59.410> i

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
long blade the choil helps less also i

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.100 
long blade the choil helps less also i
think<00:04:59.620> because<00:05:00.160> like<00:05:00.490> i<00:05:00.640> said<00:05:00.900> it's<00:05:01.900> such<00:05:02.080> a

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
think because like i said it's such a

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.860 
think because like i said it's such a
large<00:05:02.470> blade<00:05:02.830> choil<00:05:03.400> or<00:05:03.610> not<00:05:03.820> are<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.720> really

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
large blade choil or not are you really

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.950 
large blade choil or not are you really
going<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.110> be<00:05:05.200> doing<00:05:05.380> fine<00:05:05.830> surgery<00:05:06.630> with<00:05:07.630> a<00:05:07.660> 9

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
going to be doing fine surgery with a 9

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.990 
going to be doing fine surgery with a 9
or<00:05:07.990> 10<00:05:08.290> inch<00:05:08.500> blade<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:09.100> know<00:05:09.220> Charlie<00:05:09.250> or<00:05:09.760> not

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
or 10 inch blade you know Charlie or not

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.050 
or 10 inch blade you know Charlie or not
so<00:05:10.810> yeah<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.080> think<00:05:11.550> that's<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.730> contradiction

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
so yeah I think that's the contradiction

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.380 
so yeah I think that's the contradiction
with<00:05:13.600> choice<00:05:13.870> for<00:05:14.290> me<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:15.310> row<00:05:15.760> makes<00:05:16.120> more

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
with choice for me that row makes more

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.960 
with choice for me that row makes more
sense<00:05:16.690> on<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:16.960> shorter<00:05:17.650> blade<00:05:17.920> but<00:05:18.610> those<00:05:18.790> are

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
sense on a shorter blade but those are

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.520 
sense on a shorter blade but those are
precisely<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.780> length<00:05:20.020> that<00:05:20.200> you're<00:05:20.350> going

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
precisely the length that you're going

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.680 
precisely the length that you're going
to<00:05:20.590> miss<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.370> edge<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:22.030> that<00:05:22.180> brings<00:05:22.420> us<00:05:22.660> to

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
to miss the edge and that brings us to

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.600 
to miss the edge and that brings us to
the<00:05:23.020> intermediate<00:05:23.770> length<00:05:24.010> blade<00:05:24.340> like<00:05:24.580> a

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
the intermediate length blade like a

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.870 
the intermediate length blade like a
mid-length<00:05:25.150> blade<00:05:26.250> maybe<00:05:27.250> that's<00:05:27.580> where

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
mid-length blade maybe that's where

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.930 
mid-length blade maybe that's where
choice<00:05:28.260> should<00:05:29.260> fit<00:05:29.560> in<00:05:29.770> you<00:05:30.400> know<00:05:30.520> I<00:05:30.550> mean

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
choice should fit in you know I mean

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.450 
choice should fit in you know I mean
what<00:05:31.630> do<00:05:31.720> you<00:05:31.780> think<00:05:32.290> in<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.560> comments

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
where you really like the toil and if

where you really like the toil and if
anyone<00:05:53.560> thinks<00:05:53.800> that<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.130> trial<00:05:54.460> is<00:05:54.730> vital<00:05:55.300> to

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
anyone thinks that the trial is vital to

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.540 
anyone thinks that the trial is vital to
a<00:05:55.540> certain<00:05:55.930> type<00:05:56.110> of<00:05:56.140> knife<00:05:56.440> you<00:05:57.130> can<00:05:57.160> say<00:05:57.520> that

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
a certain type of knife you can say that

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.130 
a certain type of knife you can say that
to<00:05:57.970> all<00:05:58.000> right<00:05:58.300> fight<00:05:58.600> it<00:05:58.750> out<00:05:58.870> in<00:05:58.930> the
