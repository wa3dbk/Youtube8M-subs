the best way I could do that was

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.590 
the best way I could do that was
actually<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.520> make<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> lot<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> money<00:00:33.120> quickly

fact the decay on the outside and the
Soviet<00:00:54.390> Union<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:54.960> pretty<00:00:55.680> much<00:00:55.890> mirroring

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
Soviet Union was pretty much mirroring

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.729 
Soviet Union was pretty much mirroring
what<00:00:56.550> had<00:00:56.940> happened<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> me<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.809> inside<00:00:58.440> my

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
what had happened to me and inside my

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.340 
what had happened to me and inside my
head<00:00:59.100> my<00:00:59.370> behavior<00:00:59.940> patterns<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.170> way<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
head my behavior patterns and the way I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.250 
head my behavior patterns and the way I
was<00:01:01.590> thinking<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> stumbled<00:01:03.690> out<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.899> Russia

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
was thinking so I stumbled out of Russia

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.789 
was thinking so I stumbled out of Russia
not<00:01:04.799> long<00:01:05.010> after<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:06.020> was<00:01:07.020> diagnosed<00:01:07.350> with

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
not long after that I was diagnosed with

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.340 
not long after that I was diagnosed with
a<00:01:07.860> tumor<00:01:08.369> inside<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.939> head<00:01:09.240> my<00:01:09.900> marriage

a tumor inside my head my marriage
failed<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:11.580> quickly<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.090> realized<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.840> I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
failed very quickly I realized that I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.590 
failed very quickly I realized that I
was<00:01:13.170> incapable<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:14.610> establishing

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
was incapable of actually establishing

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.560 
was incapable of actually establishing
or<00:01:15.780> sustaining<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.680> loving<00:01:17.369> relationship<00:01:17.570> and

or sustaining a loving relationship and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.499 
or sustaining a loving relationship and
for<00:01:19.140> me<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.740> real<00:01:19.979> low<00:01:20.310> point<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
for me that was a real low point and I

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.870 
for me that was a real low point and I
realized<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.200> had<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:22.979> serious

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
realized I really had to get serious

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.560 
realized I really had to get serious
about<00:01:24.290> finding<00:01:25.290> peace<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
bizarre things for me it was such an

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.030 
bizarre things for me it was such an
unlikely<00:01:30.060> thing<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.689> learned<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> meditate<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
