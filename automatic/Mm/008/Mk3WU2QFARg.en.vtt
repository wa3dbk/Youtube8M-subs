00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.429
 hello everyone welcome once again to 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.440
 weather info tv and we come to the end of 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.540
 this week that will be the last end of 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.219
 week of the month of July and for all 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.470
 those who were a little tired of 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.450
 the low temperatures of the good cold 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.090
 I bring you very good news because in 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.760
 all the north and center of the country 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.800
 peak will gradually rise the 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.930
 Evenings will be really nice 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.670
 we will also have days in full sun 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.890
 with some cloudiness during the day 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.480
 Sunday in the center of the country 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.280
 I recommend going out for a walk to 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.140
 walk and enjoy activities at 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.329
 outdoors because those temperatures are 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.429
 a little atypical for this time of year 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.440
 and a little weird for winter without 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.510
 However, in the Patagonian region 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.760
 environment to follow in stable some 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.489
 showers and snowfall in the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.019
 southernmost point of our country but 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.030
 let's see now if more in detail as 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.710

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.229
 the different regions of our country 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.979
 beginning as always by the north of 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:01.359
 coast 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.360

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.360
 missions and temperatures really 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.310
 very high 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.380
