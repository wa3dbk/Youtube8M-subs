is easier if you're working from
something<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.890> something

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
something and you have something

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.090 
something and you have something
specifically<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.180> inspired<00:01:21.720> from<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.740> next

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
specifically to be inspired from so next

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.210 
kind of like a canvas to kind of like
gab<00:01:32.880> my<00:01:33.060> brush<00:01:33.360> onto<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.500> basically<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.040> trick

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
gab my brush onto so basically the trick

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.740 
gab my brush onto so basically the trick
with<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.939> want<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.450> faded

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
with this is that you want to have faded

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
with this is that you want to have faded
colors<00:01:37.259> starting<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.310> kind

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
colors starting out and then just kind

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.730 
colors starting out and then just kind
of<00:01:38.700> work<00:01:38.880> stronger<00:01:39.450> colors<00:01:39.840> into<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> center

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
of work stronger colors into the center

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.200 
of work stronger colors into the center
if<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.369> trouble<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> paint

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
if you have trouble with the paint

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.030 
if you have trouble with the paint
sticking<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.869> recommend<00:01:43.350> starting<00:01:43.619> off<00:01:43.890> with

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
sticking I recommend starting off with

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.980 
sticking I recommend starting off with
your<00:01:44.250> EOS<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.880> rubbing<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.360> sandpaper<00:01:45.840> on

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
your EOS and rubbing some sandpaper on

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.740 
your EOS and rubbing some sandpaper on
it<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.920> helped<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.460> paint<00:01:48.000> stick<00:01:48.329> so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it because that helped my paint stick so

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.330 
it because that helped my paint stick so
much<00:01:48.960> better<00:01:49.170> than<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.470> was<00:01:49.590> originally

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
much better than it was originally

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.910 
much better than it was originally
so<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:50.970> faded<00:01:51.540> some<00:01:51.750> pink<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> blue<00:01:52.409> into<00:01:52.799> each

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
so I faded some pink and blue into each

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.649 
so I faded some pink and blue into each
other<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.880> finally<00:01:54.210> after<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.570> have

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
other and then finally after you have

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.179 
other and then finally after you have
that<00:01:54.780> base<00:01:55.020> color<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.590> go<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.040> add

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that base color you can go in and add

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.920 
that base color you can go in and add
lighter<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.969> white<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.719> start

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
lighter like white and just start

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
lighter like white and just start
blending<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.579> I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
blending that and as you can see I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.120 
blending that and as you can see I
painted<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> fifth-grader<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.619> use<00:02:01.920> my

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
painted like a fifth-grader and use my

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.889 
painted like a fifth-grader and use my
fingertips<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.969> actually<00:02:03.479> worked<00:02:03.659> really

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
fingertips but it actually worked really

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
fingertips but it actually worked really
well<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.439> once<00:02:05.250> you've<00:02:05.430> added<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.119> white

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
well so once you've added in the white

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.819 
well so once you've added in the white
you<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.689> kind<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.140> continue<00:02:07.649> to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
you can kind of just like continue to

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.620 
you can kind of just like continue to
detail<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.399> and

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
detail it and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.600 
detail it and
certain<00:02:08.900> places<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.500> then<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.070> can<00:02:10.190> take<00:02:10.400> a

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
certain places and then you can take a

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.610 
certain places and then you can take a
toothbrush<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.510> just<00:02:11.570> kind<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.900> like<00:02:12.110> click

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
toothbrush and just kind of like click

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.620 
toothbrush and just kind of like click
the<00:02:12.800> color<00:02:13.010> on<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.820> black<00:02:14.120> part<00:02:14.420> and

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
the color on to the black part and

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.360 
the color on to the black part and
that'll<00:02:14.870> create<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.410> illusion<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.980> stars

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
that'll create the illusion of stars

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.830 
that'll create the illusion of stars
this<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.940> finished<00:02:17.210> product<00:02:17.480> obviously

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
this is the finished product obviously

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.050 
this is the finished product obviously
it's<00:02:18.380> not<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.590> most<00:02:18.830> perfect<00:02:19.100> galaxy<00:02:19.790> ever

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
it's not the most perfect galaxy ever

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.930 
it's not the most perfect galaxy ever
but<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.480> think<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.900> turned<00:02:21.080> out<00:02:21.170> pretty<00:02:21.230> cool<00:02:21.940> so

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
but I think it turned out pretty cool so

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.610 
but I think it turned out pretty cool so
now<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.150> we<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.630> outside<00:02:24.050> design<00:02:24.410> done

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
now that we have the outside design done

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.410 
now that we have the outside design done
we<00:02:24.770> can<00:02:24.920> go<00:02:25.040> ahead<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.400> start<00:02:25.940> with<00:02:26.180> actually

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
we can go ahead and start with actually

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.360 
we can go ahead and start with actually
creating<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.320> lip<00:02:27.530> balm<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:27.770> you're<00:02:28.190> going<00:02:28.310> to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
creating the lip balm so you're going to

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.820 
creating the lip balm so you're going to
need<00:02:28.520> beeswax<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.330> coconut<00:02:29.900> oil<00:02:30.050> I<00:02:30.320> found

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
need beeswax and coconut oil I found

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.710 
need beeswax and coconut oil I found
both<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.130> these<00:02:31.220> at<00:02:31.430> Walmart<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.090> then<00:02:32.450> I

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
both of these at Walmart and then I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.210 
both of these at Walmart and then I
picked<00:02:33.170> up<00:02:33.290> some<00:02:33.470> food<00:02:33.500> coloring<00:02:34.010> but<00:02:34.130> it

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
picked up some food coloring but it

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.040 
picked up some food coloring but it
actually<00:02:34.340> did<00:02:34.700> not<00:02:34.940> work<00:02:35.330> very<00:02:35.570> well<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.020> I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
actually did not work very well so I

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.440 
actually did not work very well so I
ended<00:02:36.320> up<00:02:36.440> using<00:02:36.620> lipsticks<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.580> keep<00:02:38.210> that<00:02:38.390> in

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
ended up using lipsticks so keep that in

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.290 
ended up using lipsticks so keep that in
mind<00:02:38.630> for<00:02:39.080> later<00:02:39.320> I<00:02:39.800> ended<00:02:40.310> up<00:02:40.460> using<00:02:40.760> also<00:02:41.270> a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
mind for later I ended up using also a

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.910 
mind for later I ended up using also a
bigger<00:02:41.720> recipe<00:02:42.290> than<00:02:42.500> what<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.650> originally

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
bigger recipe than what I originally

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.370 
bigger recipe than what I originally
filmed<00:02:43.550> instead<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.150> used<00:02:44.420> two<00:02:44.720> tablespoons<00:02:45.260> of

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
filmed instead I used two tablespoons of

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.740 
filmed instead I used two tablespoons of
beeswax<00:02:45.860> four<00:02:46.430> tablespoons<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.150> coconut<00:02:47.360> oil

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
beeswax four tablespoons of coconut oil

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.620 
beeswax four tablespoons of coconut oil
and<00:02:48.050> then<00:02:48.650> half<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.130> tablespoon<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.910> olive<00:02:50.300> oil

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
and then half a tablespoon of olive oil

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.510 
and then half a tablespoon of olive oil
I<00:02:50.960> find<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.530> using<00:02:51.680> more<00:02:52.070> just<00:02:52.310> kind<00:02:52.430> of

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
I find that using more just kind of

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.800 
I find that using more just kind of
works<00:02:52.760> better<00:02:53.000> because<00:02:53.450> it's<00:02:53.660> really

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
works better because it's really

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.540 
works better because it's really
time-sensitive<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.860> sometimes<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.280> can<00:02:55.400> be<00:02:55.430> a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
time-sensitive and sometimes it can be a

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.400 
time-sensitive and sometimes it can be a
little<00:02:55.700> bit<00:02:55.880> stressful<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:56.690> if<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.080> more

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
little bit stressful so if you have more

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.620 
little bit stressful so if you have more
of<00:02:57.440> this<00:02:57.860> like<00:02:58.070> solution<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.180> we<00:02:59.300> create

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
of this like solution that we create

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.540 
of this like solution that we create
then<00:02:59.930> it's<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.410> not<00:03:00.680> as<00:03:00.920> stressful<00:03:01.250> when

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
then it's just not as stressful when

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.280 
then it's just not as stressful when
you're<00:03:01.670> working<00:03:01.970> with<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.480> separated

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
you're working with it so I separated

you're working with it so I separated
and<00:03:03.470> made<00:03:03.710> two<00:03:04.010> solutions<00:03:04.580> one<00:03:04.880> with<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
and made two solutions one with the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.520 
and made two solutions one with the
lipstick<00:03:05.540> color<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.080> one<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.410> was

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
lipstick color and the one that was

lipstick color and the one that was
plain<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.160> then<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.280> just<00:03:07.460> kind<00:03:07.640> of<00:03:07.700> swirled

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
plain and then I just kind of swirled

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.580 
plain and then I just kind of swirled
them<00:03:08.120> together<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.690> toothpick<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.350> kind<00:03:09.560> of

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
them together the toothpick to kind of

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.280 
them together the toothpick to kind of
create<00:03:09.770> like<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:10.160> marbled<00:03:11.000> galaxy<00:03:11.540> effect<00:03:12.050> and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290
