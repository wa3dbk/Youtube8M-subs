00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
we've got to go and do a homology class

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.629 
we've got to go and do a homology class
which<00:05:02.720> we<00:05:02.900> have<00:05:03.139> because<00:05:03.500> it's<00:05:03.650> belt<00:05:06.639> of

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
which we have because it's belt of

to her before basically to get through

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:22.149 
to her before basically to get through
history<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:16.190> blocks<00:05:16.699> at<00:05:16.849> the<00:05:16.880> price<00:05:18.250> I<00:05:21.159> don't

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
history the blocks at the price I don't

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.620 
history the blocks at the price I don't
say<00:05:22.370> no<00:05:22.580> notice<00:05:22.909> that<00:05:23.000> we've<00:05:23.150> got<00:05:23.180> different

okay<00:06:06.580> okay<00:06:07.580> it's<00:06:08.060> like<00:06:08.210> charms<00:06:08.600> class<00:06:08.870> but

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
okay okay it's like charms class but

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.830 
okay okay it's like charms class but
slightly<00:06:09.530> different<00:06:09.940> believer<00:06:10.940> it's<00:06:11.480> one<00:06:11.750> of

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
slightly different believer it's one of

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.740 
slightly different believer it's one of
those<00:06:11.960> triangles<00:06:12.530> called<00:06:13.490> X<00:06:13.760> square<00:06:14.630> X<00:06:16.750> you

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
those triangles called X square X you

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.050 
those triangles called X square X you
got<00:06:17.930> three<00:06:18.230> times<00:06:18.560> and<00:06:19.010> you<00:06:19.610> complete<00:06:19.940> the

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
got three times and you complete the

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:34.990 
got three times and you complete the
first<00:06:20.240> part<00:06:20.600> yes<00:06:33.010> okay<00:06:34.010> this<00:06:34.250> one<00:06:34.460> Square

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
first part yes okay this one Square

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.480 
first part yes okay this one Square
Circle<00:06:35.690> Square<00:06:36.190> Circle

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
Circle Square Circle

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.690 
Circle Square Circle
I<00:06:38.710> don't<00:06:39.710> even<00:06:39.800> have<00:06:39.920> to<00:06:40.070> use<00:06:40.190> the<00:06:40.310> X<00:06:40.430> button

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
I don't even have to use the X button

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:53.790 
I don't even have to use the X button
it's<00:06:41.240> quite<00:06:41.480> simple

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.510 

I<00:06:56.440> say<00:06:57.440> out<00:06:57.560> of<00:06:57.590> all<00:06:57.800> the<00:06:57.980> spells<00:06:58.220> that<00:06:58.340> you

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
I say out of all the spells that you

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.400 
I say out of all the spells that you
learned<00:06:58.760> during<00:06:59.030> the<00:06:59.180> game<00:06:59.360> problem<00:06:59.780> depend

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
learned during the game problem depend

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:22.140 
learned during the game problem depend
oh<00:07:00.590> this<00:07:01.310> one's<00:07:01.580> the<00:07:01.760> most<00:07:01.880> difficult<00:07:02.480> to<00:07:02.660> use

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.910 

so<00:07:23.150> you<00:07:23.630> see<00:07:23.780> a<00:07:23.810> green<00:07:23.990> Sparkle<00:07:24.500> button<00:07:24.800> object

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:24.920 
so you see a green Sparkle button object

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.280 
so you see a green Sparkle button object
using<00:07:25.520> send<00:07:25.700> yo<00:07:25.910> you<00:07:26.510> have<00:07:26.660> to<00:07:26.870> press<00:07:27.170> the

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.290 
using send yo you have to press the

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.790 
using send yo you have to press the
symbols<00:07:27.680> that<00:07:27.830> go<00:07:27.890> through<00:07:28.370> the<00:07:28.520> video

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 
symbols that go through the video

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:38.950 
symbols that go through the video
it's<00:07:30.800> being<00:07:31.010> interesting<00:07:36.280> now<00:07:37.780> head<00:07:38.780> outside

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 
it's being interesting now head outside

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.350 
it's being interesting now head outside
and<00:07:39.260> head<00:07:39.620> to<00:07:39.800> our<00:07:39.830> left

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
and head to our left

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:48.090 
and head to our left
seems<00:07:41.360> like<00:07:41.480> on<00:07:41.660> here<00:07:41.840> but<00:07:42.020> rich<00:07:42.500> training

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:48.100 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.950 

okay<00:07:49.100> so<00:07:49.160> go<00:07:52.150> they<00:07:53.150> want<00:07:53.330> lee<00:07:53.540> at<00:07:53.600> the<00:07:53.630> next

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 
okay so go they want lee at the next

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.080 
okay so go they want lee at the next
part<00:07:54.230> to<00:07:54.560> come<00:07:54.770> back<00:07:54.950> to<00:07:55.070> the<00:07:55.160> next<00:07:55.400> part<00:07:55.700> which

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.090 
part to come back to the next part which

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.010 
part to come back to the next part which
I<00:07:56.870> do<00:07:57.020> glitch<00:07:57.440> training
