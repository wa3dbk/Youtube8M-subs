00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello it's alexander today I 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.120
 here for a new video on the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.710
 strong be so it's always the same 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.759
 those he is in a in the mode 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.679
 normal I believe so if you know 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.870
 I know this mode is that it is 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.080
 done and ba you can tell me in the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.420
 comments of course against what is 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.480
 what you have I had already done there the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.609
 test not the princess so here after my 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 like to wake him up 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:40.110
 So that's lost serbia I do not know 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.739
 why but I thought the elite 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.860
 pilots and the stuff but it's not 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.950
 the case so here is when you see it 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.750
 is a little crazy which my pleasure they 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.500
 are like that the eyes I do not know 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.449
 this mode 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.850
 I think it was like that when I 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.739
 open a christmas I know more but hey 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.420
 do not care a low blow I would like when 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.070
 even well this Tuesday is not the most 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.600
 important 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.899
 So here is the Serbian he is still the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.409
 even 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.420
 except that there is not the same personality 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:15.509
 so it's natural that always the same 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.659
 color but yes so will do some 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.330
 things like that he's going to laugh all that's 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.450
 so with me sometimes so here we can 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.189
 do it this turn that of ceva the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.090
 tail he can do p -o 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.090
 this role 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.400
 I feel better my chances of agreeing 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.430
 on anything without the agreement 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:51.500
 preliminary must therefore we can do 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:53.910
 hugs sometimes yes 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.530
 so I actually noticed our fabrics 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.960
 say do not interrupt 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.610
 while what does she do early by 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.479
 example if it does not laugh and you must not 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.780
 give him something to eat 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:13.500
 the six actually look no need I 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:16.190
 do this there they laugh and philippe 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.550
 Sella he will not answer me to the caresses 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.870
 thomas says look if the fact there the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.489
 ditches and there I can immediately but 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.110
 to give food while he laughs or 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.670
 how to compare however that they sort 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.410
 while he tries no matter 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.170
 here's one 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:39.920
 so if we hold the linen linens he 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:45.690
 fart does not convey three to black okay 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.989
 so it's a pity actually not firm and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.400
 his consorts the mechanism so we do 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.570
 it's not very very nice to 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.430
 to caress actually good here is the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.380
 voice recognition against you me 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.160
 tell how she operated what 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:07.910
 so I printed some leaves 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:15.950
 attention justin vabers sitting 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:18.610

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.650
 two french to do doe 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:26.900
 that's all the evils 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:34.190
 I tried viriat world for example from 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:40.370
 case I allocate ourselves to read in feast 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.900
 we do not know then if there is 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.640
 people who know how to play 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.400
 hide cache or stuff like that with 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.670
 told him but I never did 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:55.730
 once to do that now him 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.690
 saying I defend shia labeouf the one to 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.630

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:13.610

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.950

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.600
