00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
that's my beast I'll make another video

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.050 
that's my beast I'll make another video
without<00:03:12.990> all<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.470> specs<00:03:15.650> Zelman<00:03:17.060> fan

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
without all the specs Zelman fan

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.040 
without all the specs Zelman fan
controller<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:20.190> sky<00:03:20.640> server<00:03:23.630> you<00:03:24.630> can<00:03:24.660> see

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
controller and a sky server you can see

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.300 
controller and a sky server you can see
the<00:03:25.880> cooling<00:03:26.880> temps<00:03:27.300> there<00:03:27.620> 36.6<00:03:28.620> on<00:03:28.890> one<00:03:29.100> loop

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
the cooling temps there 36.6 on one loop

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.680 
the cooling temps there 36.6 on one loop
and<00:03:29.690> 6.6<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.960> other<00:03:34.340> every<00:03:35.340> attempts<00:03:35.790> 35

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
and 6.6 on the other every attempts 35

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.300 
and 6.6 on the other every attempts 35
degrees<00:03:37.110> mind<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:38.640> that's<00:03:38.880> pretty<00:03:39.120> good
