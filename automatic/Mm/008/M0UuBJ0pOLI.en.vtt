probably<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.810> dark<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:19.859> see<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
probably in the dark so you can see the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.279 
probably in the dark so you can see the
interface<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.609> little<00:00:20.850> bit<00:00:21.060> better<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:22.080> does

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
interface a little bit better this does

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.720 
interface a little bit better this does
have<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> shiny<00:00:23.029> and<00:00:24.029> reflective<00:00:24.449> screen<00:00:25.730> and

have a shiny and reflective screen and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.470 
have a shiny and reflective screen and
with<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> light<00:00:27.960> where<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.070> room

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
with the light where it is in this room

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
with the light where it is in this room
you're<00:00:30.480> always<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> reflection

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
you're always going to see a reflection

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.370 
you're always going to see a reflection
of<00:00:31.830> almost<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> mirror<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> camera

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
of almost like a mirror of the camera

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.479 
of almost like a mirror of the camera
that's<00:00:34.530> because<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.890> camera<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.340> good

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
that's because this camera is good

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.889 
that's because this camera is good
enough<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:36.239> not<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> bother<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.870> eye

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that much normally if you're looking at

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.240 
that much normally if you're looking at
the<00:00:40.469> player<00:00:40.910> but<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> camera<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the player but a camera it's going to to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.029 
the player but a camera it's going to to
really<00:00:44.550> bother<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:46.200> we're<00:00:46.680> gonna<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:46.980> ahead

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
really bother so we're gonna go ahead

can<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.659> basic<00:01:15.659> interface<00:01:15.990> I've

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
can see the basic interface I've

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.679 
can see the basic interface I've
actually<00:01:16.439> got<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> smaller<00:01:17.689> version

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
actually got it on the smaller version

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.050 
actually got it on the smaller version
of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> interface<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.640> large<00:01:21.180> icon

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
of the interface there is a large icon

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.319 
of the interface there is a large icon
way<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.750> looking<00:01:25.259> at<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> interface<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:26.100> well

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.609 

the<00:01:30.329> first<00:01:30.540> thing<00:01:30.720> new<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.049> course<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.439> play

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
the first thing new of course is play

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.490

the<00:02:54.930> contrast<00:02:55.710> and<00:02:56.069> brightness<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:57.600> actually

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
the contrast and brightness is actually

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.670 
the contrast and brightness is actually
very<00:02:58.110> good<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.670> player

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.619 

I've<00:03:06.340> seen<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.549> lot<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.849> screens<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.420> don't

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
taste of what a movie looks like so I'm

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.369 
taste of what a movie looks like so I'm

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
going to go ahead and stop that and then

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.970 
going to go ahead and stop that and then
we're<00:03:51.560> gonna<00:03:51.680> go<00:03:51.890> back<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:56.379> perhaps<00:03:57.379> playing

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
we're gonna go back to perhaps playing

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.539 
we're gonna go back to perhaps playing
music<00:03:58.730> let's<00:03:59.239> say<00:03:59.450> we'll<00:04:00.349> go<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.500> music

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:17.640 

my<00:04:04.549> daughter<00:04:04.790> owns<00:04:05.060> this<00:04:05.269> player<00:04:05.569> now<00:04:05.810> so

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:44.330 

so<00:04:18.650> this<00:04:18.829> is<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.250> mp3<00:04:20.090> player

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.960 

you<00:04:45.340> notice<00:04:45.670> that<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.030> supports<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.850> idea<00:04:48.850> of

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
you notice that it supports the idea of

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:56.100 
you notice that it supports the idea of
an<00:04:49.090> equalizer<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:51.060> has<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.330> album<00:04:52.840> art<00:04:55.110> it

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
an equalizer and has the album art it

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.160 
an equalizer and has the album art it
also<00:04:56.320> has<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:57.010> ability<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.570> have<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:58.600> bass
