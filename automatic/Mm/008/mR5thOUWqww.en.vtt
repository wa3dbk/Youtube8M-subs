I'm<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.430> through<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.879> mean<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.329> had<00:01:03.570> chemo

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
I'm going through it I mean I had chemo

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.230 
I'm going through it I mean I had chemo
last<00:01:04.320> Monday<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> mean<00:01:05.309> I'm<00:01:05.489> literally<00:01:05.970> in

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
last Monday so I mean I'm literally in

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.670 
last Monday so I mean I'm literally in
the<00:01:06.390> middle<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.140> through<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.530> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the middle of it going through it I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.530 
the middle of it going through it I
think<00:01:08.159> that's<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.430> powerful<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
think that's really powerful for for

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.149 
think that's really powerful for for
patients<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> kind<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.590> me<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.040> my

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
patients to kind of see me and see my

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.399 
patients to kind of see me and see my
example<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.790> sort<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> learn<00:01:12.150> from<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.659> so

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
example and sort of learn from it and so

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.960 
example and sort of learn from it and so
when<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> realized<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.700> was<00:01:14.820> actually

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
when I realized that I was actually

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.550 
when I realized that I was actually
helping<00:01:15.270> people<00:01:15.689> by<00:01:15.840> sharing<00:01:15.900> my<00:01:16.170> story<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
helping people by sharing my story I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.710 
helping people by sharing my story I
thought<00:01:16.799> why<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.310> make<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> even<00:01:18.030> bigger<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
thought why not make it even bigger so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.450 
thought why not make it even bigger so
in<00:01:18.990> September<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> last<00:01:19.770> year<00:01:19.979> basically<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
in September of last year basically a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.210 
in September of last year basically a
year<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.840> date<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.140> my<00:01:22.259> diagnosis<00:01:22.920> when

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
year to the date of my diagnosis when

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.969 
year to the date of my diagnosis when
fifteen<00:01:23.970> percent<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.840> people<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.619> survived

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
fifteen percent of people have survived

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.370 
fifteen percent of people have survived
at<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.310> point<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.700> definitely<00:01:27.659> long<00:01:28.140> odds

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
at that point so definitely long odds

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.920 
at that point so definitely long odds
about<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.770> year<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.670> diagnosis<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.659> launched

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
about a year to my diagnosis we launched

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.719 
about a year to my diagnosis we launched
the<00:01:31.020> Wonder<00:01:31.259> glow<00:01:31.380> foundation<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.640> have
