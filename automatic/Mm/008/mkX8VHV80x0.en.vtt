because<00:01:53.000> his<00:01:53.180> pedal<00:01:53.510> is<00:01:53.660> probably<00:01:54.050> like<00:01:54.260> a

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
because his pedal is probably like a

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.910 
because his pedal is probably like a
foot<00:01:54.590> travel

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
foot travel

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.800 
foot travel
not<00:01:56.280> too<00:01:56.430> bad

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.270 

when<00:02:03.230> it<00:02:03.320> dries<00:02:03.500> really<00:02:03.770> good<00:02:03.980> I<00:02:04.010> think<00:02:04.220> the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
when it dries really good I think the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.180 
when it dries really good I think the
front<00:02:04.460> wheels<00:02:04.670> are<00:02:04.850> out<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:04.970> balance<00:02:05.330> do

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
front wheels are out of balance do

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.119 
front wheels are out of balance do
look<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.280> 4th<00:02:09.120> gear<00:02:09.390> I'm<00:02:09.570> threading<00:02:09.900> the<00:02:10.140> gear

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
look at 4th gear I'm threading the gear

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.800 
look at 4th gear I'm threading the gear
we're<00:02:12.760> gonna<00:02:12.879> put<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.090> heater<00:02:13.299> core<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.659> this

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
we're gonna put a heater core in this

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.980 
we're gonna put a heater core in this
pig<00:02:14.049> then<00:02:14.319> soon

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990
