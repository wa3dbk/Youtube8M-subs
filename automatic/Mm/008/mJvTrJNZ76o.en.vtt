player I really got was a brand new in
my<00:03:21.790> opinion<00:03:22.030> he<00:03:22.300> is<00:03:22.330> in<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.570> best<00:03:22.690> player<00:03:22.930> but

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
my opinion he is in the best player but

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.810 
my opinion he is in the best player but
he's<00:03:23.200> 76<00:03:23.620> place<00:03:23.830> centre-back<00:03:24.220> Brazilian<00:03:24.700> as

pretty<00:03:30.130> awesome<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:31.600> course<00:03:31.660> I'm<00:03:32.020> not

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
pretty awesome and of course I'm not

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.660 
pretty awesome and of course I'm not
going<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.380> discard<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.739> Stoke<00:03:32.950> kit<00:03:33.220> because

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
going to discard the Stoke kit because

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.400 
going to discard the Stoke kit because
everyone<00:03:34.300> out<00:03:34.420> there<00:03:34.540> was<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.780> troll<00:03:35.110> who

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
everyone out there was a troll who

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.500 
everyone out there was a troll who
disguise<00:03:35.770> for<00:03:35.950> Stoke<00:03:36.310> kick<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:37.120> I'm<00:03:37.330> going<00:03:37.450> to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
disguise for Stoke kick and I'm going to

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.479 
disguise for Stoke kick and I'm going to
get<00:03:37.600> around<00:03:37.720> about<00:03:37.900> 425<00:03:38.590> k<00:03:38.890> coins<00:03:39.190> back<00:03:39.310> from

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
that pack and then I think this can be a

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.530 
that pack and then I think this can be a
one<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.459> last<00:03:42.580> two<00:03:42.760> packs<00:03:42.970> which<00:03:43.209> can<00:03:43.390> be<00:03:43.510> a
