beginning<00:00:58.160> math<00:00:58.370> skills<00:00:59.230> so<00:01:00.230> I<00:01:00.680> had<00:01:00.920> a<00:01:00.950> sound

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
beginning math skills so I had a sound

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.890 
beginning math skills so I had a sound
turned<00:01:01.550> off<00:01:01.700> now<00:01:02.240> I'll<00:01:02.420> turn<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:02.660> on<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:02.810> little

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
turned off now I'll turn it on a little

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.570 
turned off now I'll turn it on a little
bit<00:01:02.990> later<00:01:03.140> but<00:01:03.380> that's<00:01:03.860> if<00:01:04.129> there's<00:01:04.369> only<00:01:04.430> one

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
bit later but that's if there's only one

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.630 
bit later but that's if there's only one
fault<00:01:04.970> with<00:01:05.119> this<00:01:05.239> app<00:01:05.479> it's<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:07.310> music

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
fault with this app it's that the music

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.520 
fault with this app it's that the music
and<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.240> voice<00:01:08.390> is<00:01:08.780> kind<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.080> annoying<00:01:09.260> you

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
and the voice is kind of annoying you

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.870 
and the voice is kind of annoying you
have<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.770> option<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.100> turn<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.430> music<00:01:10.490> off

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
have the option to turn the music off

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.180 
have the option to turn the music off
but<00:01:11.360> even<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.110> voice<00:01:12.260> to<00:01:12.500> me<00:01:12.590> is<00:01:12.680> kind<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.010> I

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
but even the voice to me is kind of I

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.370 
but even the voice to me is kind of I
don't<00:01:13.370> know<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:14.600> it's<00:01:14.960> pretty<00:01:15.170> much

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
don't know so it's pretty much

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.530 
don't know so it's pretty much
self-explanatory<00:01:15.620> for<00:01:16.430> some<00:01:16.610> children<00:01:17.060> they

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
self-explanatory for some children they

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.120 
self-explanatory for some children they
also<00:01:17.690> give<00:01:17.930> written<00:01:18.170> cues<00:01:18.500> here<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:18.830> what<00:01:19.040> to

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
also give written cues here is what to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.780 
also give written cues here is what to
do<00:01:19.280> this<00:01:19.550> is<00:01:19.610> fill<00:01:19.940> in<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.180> missing<00:01:20.470> numbers

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
do this is fill in the missing numbers

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.770 
do this is fill in the missing numbers
see<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:22.850> would<00:01:23.000> have<00:01:23.150> to<00:01:23.240> find<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.510> missing

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
see it would have to find the missing

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.660 
see it would have to find the missing
number<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.260> you<00:01:24.380> would<00:01:24.470> drag<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.770> up<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.310> once

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
number and you would drag it up and once

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.370 
number and you would drag it up and once
you've<00:01:25.790> done<00:01:25.910> that<00:01:25.970> correctly<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:27.080> will<00:01:27.260> go

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
you've done that correctly it will go

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.260 
you've done that correctly it will go
he'll<00:01:27.710> do<00:01:27.800> a<00:01:27.830> little<00:01:28.040> flip<00:01:28.220> or<00:01:28.580> something<00:01:29.030> at

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
he'll do a little flip or something at

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.530 
he'll do a little flip or something at
the<00:01:29.420> end<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:30.070> once<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.700> done<00:01:31.820> it'll<00:01:32.360> go

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
the end and once this is done it'll go

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.760 
the end and once this is done it'll go
to<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.750> different<00:01:33.020> question<00:01:33.170> on<00:01:33.560> here<00:01:35.770> this

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
to a different question on here this

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.490 
to a different question on here this
will<00:01:36.890> be<00:01:36.980> an<00:01:37.070> addition<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.580> looks<00:01:37.730> like<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.690> it

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
will be an addition it looks like so it

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.110 
will be an addition it looks like so it
did<00:01:39.680> one<00:01:39.890> star<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.370> brought<00:01:40.520> another<00:01:40.790> star

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
did one star and it brought another star

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.090 
did one star and it brought another star
so<00:01:41.480> in<00:01:41.750> case<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.110> didn't<00:01:42.320> couldn't<00:01:42.770> do<00:01:42.920> this

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
so in case it didn't couldn't do this

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.760 
so in case it didn't couldn't do this
they<00:01:43.370> could<00:01:43.520> maybe<00:01:43.670> count<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.930> stars<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:45.470> here

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
they could maybe count the stars on here

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.050 
they could maybe count the stars on here
and<00:01:46.040> they<00:01:46.159> went<00:01:46.310> again<00:01:46.520> they<00:01:46.640> would<00:01:46.729> just<00:01:46.850> drag

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
and they went again they would just drag

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.260 
and they went again they would just drag
the<00:01:47.300> correct<00:01:47.540> answer<00:01:47.960> on<00:01:48.200> here<00:01:52.210> let's<00:01:53.210> just

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
the correct answer on here let's just

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.450 
the correct answer on here let's just
find<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.750> shape<00:01:53.990> with<00:01:54.229> four<00:01:54.500> sides<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.280> then

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
find the shape with four sides so then

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.969 
find the shape with four sides so then
they'd<00:01:55.580> have<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.909> count<00:01:56.120> size<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:57.799> then

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
they'd have to count size and then

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.110 
they'd have to count size and then
they'd<00:01:58.100> have<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.340> pick<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.610> correct<00:01:58.760> shape

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
they'd have to pick the correct shape

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.210 
they'd have to pick the correct shape
but<00:01:59.870> it<00:01:59.960> kind<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.200> alternates<00:02:00.680> between<00:02:00.770> the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
but it kind of alternates between the

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.640 
but it kind of alternates between the
sequencing<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.150> addition<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.440> don't<00:02:03.590> get

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
sequencing and addition so you don't get

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.710 
sequencing and addition so you don't get
a<00:02:03.710> black<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.220> audition<00:02:04.940> or<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.120> black<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.570> one

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
a black of audition or a black of one

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.289 
a black of audition or a black of one
thing<00:02:05.900> in<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:06.080> row<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.530> keeps<00:02:06.650> children<00:02:06.950> more

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
thing in a row so it keeps children more

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.730 
thing in a row so it keeps children more
interested<00:02:08.299> and<00:02:08.330> more<00:02:08.539> engaged<00:02:09.319> with<00:02:09.590> this

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
interested and more engaged with this

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.300 
interested and more engaged with this
app<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:11.290> you'll<00:02:12.290> also<00:02:12.470> get<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.800> little<00:02:13.100> this<00:02:13.250> is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
app and you'll also get a little this is

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.380 
app and you'll also get a little this is
one<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.550> our<00:02:13.670> favorites<00:02:14.000> too<00:02:14.090> there's<00:02:14.270> also

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
one of our favorites too there's also

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.320 
one of our favorites too there's also
like<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.569> number<00:02:14.810> trace

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
like a number trace

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.300 
like a number trace
in<00:02:15.420> here<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:16.590> also<00:02:16.740> get<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> little<00:02:17.100> reward

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
in here you also get a little reward

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.610 
in here you also get a little reward
that<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:18.060> put<00:02:18.210> into<00:02:18.330> aquarium<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.530> I

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
that you can put into aquarium and I

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.480 
that you can put into aquarium and I
don't<00:02:19.680> go<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.190> far<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.580> here<00:02:20.730> today<00:02:21.060> but<00:02:22.490> okay

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
don't go that far in here today but okay

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.860 
don't go that far in here today but okay
and<00:02:23.580> I'm<00:02:23.790> upside<00:02:24.090> down<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.690> make<00:02:24.840> a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
and I'm upside down so if I make a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.760 
and I'm upside down so if I make a
mistake<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.590> don't<00:02:26.130> think<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.370> will<00:02:26.550> go<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:28.590> then

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
mistake I don't think I will go and then

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.470 
mistake I don't think I will go and then
the<00:02:28.860> turtle<00:02:29.460> trace<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.850> go<00:02:29.970> through<00:02:30.180> all<00:02:30.300> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
the turtle trace that go through all the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.170 
the turtle trace that go through all the
numbers<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.140> here<00:02:31.500> as<00:02:31.710> well<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.670> I'm<00:02:32.760> for<00:02:33.060> this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
numbers on here as well so I'm for this

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.580 
numbers on here as well so I'm for this
next<00:02:33.420> batch<00:02:33.600> I'm<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.960> turn<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.380> sound

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
next batch I'm going to turn the sound

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.900 
next batch I'm going to turn the sound
up<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.980> think<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.490> can<00:02:35.580> hear<00:02:35.730> what<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
up I think so you can hear what the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.270 
up I think so you can hear what the
sound<00:02:36.620> sounds<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.800> didn't<00:02:38.040> turn<00:02:38.160> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
sound sounds like I didn't turn the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.440 
sound sounds like I didn't turn the
music<00:02:38.370> off<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:38.880> you'll<00:02:39.030> hear<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> music<00:02:39.300> too

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.460 

another<00:02:48.450> thing<00:02:48.600> hard<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.810> look<00:02:48.900> down<00:02:49.110> here<00:02:49.350> and

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
another thing hard to look down here and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.530 
another thing hard to look down here and
try<00:02:49.620> throughout<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.910> know<00:02:51.030> what's<00:02:51.420> gonna

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
try throughout you know what's gonna

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.360 
try throughout you know what's gonna
come<00:02:51.630> after<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.200> it's<00:02:52.680> going<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.980> be<00:02:53.070> the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
come after that it's going to be the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:04.760 
come after that it's going to be the
jellyfish<00:03:03.020> alright<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.200> did<00:03:04.320> make<00:03:04.440> as<00:03:04.560> far

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
jellyfish alright so it did make as far

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.890 
jellyfish alright so it did make as far
as<00:03:04.860> aquarium<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.090> pick<00:03:06.300> out<00:03:06.390> one<00:03:06.780> of

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
as aquarium you can pick out one of

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.120 
as aquarium you can pick out one of
three<00:03:07.110> things<00:03:07.350> here<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.709> build<00:03:07.860> you're<00:03:08.040> gonna

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
three things here to build you're gonna

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.860 
three things here to build you're gonna
build<00:03:08.370> an<00:03:08.490> aquarium<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.360> just<00:03:09.570> pick<00:03:09.690> up<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
build an aquarium so just pick up the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.440 
build an aquarium so just pick up the
striped<00:03:10.110> fish<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.700> then<00:03:17.850> I'll<00:03:18.209> start<00:03:18.360> with

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
striped fish and then I'll start with

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:29.540 
striped fish and then I'll start with
the<00:03:18.540> next<00:03:18.750> series<00:03:18.990> a<00:03:19.020> question<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:29.190> they<00:03:29.370> got

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
the next series a question so they got

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.190 
the next series a question so they got
the<00:03:29.730> worth<00:03:29.850> got<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.300> more<00:03:30.450> most<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.080> and

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
the worth got the more most in it and

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.460 
the worth got the more most in it and
then<00:03:31.290> we'll<00:03:31.410> do<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.530> one<00:03:32.959> but<00:03:33.959> overall<00:03:34.350> I

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
then we'll do that one but overall I

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.560 
then we'll do that one but overall I
really<00:03:34.890> feel<00:03:35.160> for<00:03:35.190> $0.99<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.540> a

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
really feel for $0.99 this is this is a

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.790 
really feel for $0.99 this is this is a
great<00:03:36.840> app<00:03:37.050> we're<00:03:37.230> just<00:03:37.380> starting<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.650> get

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
great app we're just starting to get

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.790 
great app we're just starting to get
some<00:03:37.860> basic<00:03:39.200> computers<00:03:40.200> were<00:03:40.320> in<00:03:40.410> classrooms

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
some basic computers were in classrooms

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.949 
some basic computers were in classrooms
for<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.010> while<00:03:41.190> but<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.550> think<00:03:41.670> iPads<00:03:42.540> are<00:03:42.690> coming

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
for a while but I think iPads are coming

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.449 
for a while but I think iPads are coming
in<00:03:43.080> more<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.800> there's<00:03:43.950> really<00:03:44.250> just

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
in more to it and there's really just

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.490 
in more to it and there's really just
some<00:03:44.580> wonderful<00:03:45.030> early<00:03:45.750> education<00:03:46.290> games

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
some wonderful early education games

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.990 
some wonderful early education games
they<00:03:46.650> should<00:03:46.800> never<00:03:46.950> take<00:03:47.250> place<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.700> course

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
they should never take place of course

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.490 
they should never take place of course
of<00:03:48.209> hands-on<00:03:48.630> learning<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.230> social

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
of hands-on learning and social

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.040 
of hands-on learning and social
interaction<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:50.430> maybe<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.420> five<00:03:51.690> or<00:03:51.900> ten

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
interaction but maybe for five or ten

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.600 
interaction but maybe for five or ten
minutes<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.769> know<00:03:52.890> at<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.190> special<00:03:53.580> time

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
minutes you know at a special time
