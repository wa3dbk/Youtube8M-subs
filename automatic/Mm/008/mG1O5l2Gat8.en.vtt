Archer move around when you're drawing
your<00:01:54.929> boat<00:01:55.200> because<00:01:55.469> generally<00:01:56.249> that<00:01:56.369> makes

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
your boat because generally that makes

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.580 
your boat because generally that makes
it<00:01:56.759> harder<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.600> them<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.749> hit<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.229> faster

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it harder for them to hit you and faster

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.219 
it harder for them to hit you and faster
for<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.890> draw<00:01:59.069> your<00:01:59.100> bow<00:01:59.899> in<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> sense

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
for you to draw your bow in the sense

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.749 
for you to draw your bow in the sense
that<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.920> harder<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.249> them<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> hit

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that like it's harder for them to hit

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.239 
that like it's harder for them to hit
you<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.359> you're<00:02:04.109> getting<00:02:04.409> more<00:02:04.530> shots<00:02:04.829> into

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
you so you're getting more shots into

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:06.980 
you so you're getting more shots into

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
is that you want to try to pick off the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.050

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
because they're usually the easiest to

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.610

hit on people who have shields are of
course<00:02:58.770> harder<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.190> hit<00:02:59.310> they<00:02:59.490> have<00:02:59.580> shield<00:02:59.820> on

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
course harder to hit they have shield on

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.940 
course harder to hit they have shield on
as<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.990> can<00:03:01.140> see<00:03:01.290> here<00:03:01.470> actually<00:03:01.620> my

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
as you can see here actually my

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.130 
as you can see here actually my
proficiency<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.580> only<00:03:02.730> about<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.360> 100<00:03:04.050> I

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
proficiency is only about like 100 I

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.340 
proficiency is only about like 100 I
think<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.580> it's<00:03:05.580> very<00:03:06.030> hard<00:03:06.480> for<00:03:06.720> me<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.230> be

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
think and it's very hard for me to be

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.780 
think and it's very hard for me to be
able<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.710> hit<00:03:08.040> any<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.340> these<00:03:08.430> guys<00:03:08.640> even

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
able to hit any of these guys even

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.180 
able to hit any of these guys even
though<00:03:09.000> they're<00:03:09.240> all<00:03:09.270> in<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.810> cluster<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.920> of

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
though they're all in the cluster so of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.520 
though they're all in the cluster so of
that<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.880> why<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.060> stress<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.080> have<00:03:13.110> to
