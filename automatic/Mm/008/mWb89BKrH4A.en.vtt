00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.670
 not ever really others or that 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.930
 I won ok and the day as it 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.980
 on it we are under the same 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.559
 conditions driven the equivalent 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.690
 Cars and I risked my life 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.670
 for the title and that's not exactly 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.810
 the reason why we drive and die 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.180
 to look into the face and to him 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.279
 outwit 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.849
 that has something as well as we do 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.159
 scent 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.260
 he has a simple feeling of one 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.070
 Trust in the people 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.130
 that made me damn it 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.060
 she made fun of her over 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.060
 forgiveness and love 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.489
 i beat that out i 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.219
 she thought it was not her 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.079
 she was wonderful it is for the 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.820
 Government officials illegal the identity 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.129
 to increase an undercover agent 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.539
 The first begins today 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.449
 phase of an unprecedented 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.129
 technological development we have 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.739
 planets in the so-called habitable 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.360
 zones have such planets 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.400
 to remove a similar one in the relationship 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.020
 our sun we to ours if you 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.790
 it is too far away from your sun 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.680
 too cold they are too close it is too 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.570
 hot but an earth-like planet 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.869
 the distance is just right 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.130
 perfect conditions for a possible life 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.140
 and finally we have a planet 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.000
 behind the correct distance too 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.729
 his sun has increased by water 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.320
 own and the appropriate mass around one 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.350
 to carry atmosphere 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.270
 By now he owns almost all casinos 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.729
 and models from here to there where they us 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.320
 he boasted to alexander that 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.940
 he would have killed every man with that 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.340
 his wife had slept before she 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.680
 met him and when he realized how 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.680
 many of them had killed her as well 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.350
 We have about a year ago 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.200
 starting the outer sections too 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.009
 We have these numbers to research 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.160
 found walls 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.950
 section one to eight as that 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.720
 works like this every night changed it 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.170
 itself and a new section becomes 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.510
 open 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.290
 That means today was the sixth descent 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.590
 open and tomorrow section 4 then 83 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.780
 the sequence is always the same, my 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.150
 whole life long started from the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.820
 elementary school right up to the moment when 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.549
 I've always been outgoing 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.950
 spanked ridiculed mocked 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.450
 and excluded from everything because of me 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:42.560
 I was born that way because I was born 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.120
 always men you found attractive 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.390
 have no idea how damn power 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.959
 You have to feel like powerless 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.000
 I felt in highschool thought 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.049
 I constantly hide you I had 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.100
 fear that people are the truth 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.100
 would find out 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.800
 i even had girlfriends and had 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.320
 sex with this girl just so 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.890
 so that everyone thought next hetero and 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.680
 I am normal 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.450
 it works so you let the opponent 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.920
 upper hand 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:24.470
 and then he is running out of time 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.290
 because he only knew 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.770
 seconds and the other one thinks 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.070
 will all end up just yours 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.070
 Clock 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.490
 forget to pay attention to your power 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.960
 just a bike ride down to the beach 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.810
 with this guy from the wedding celebration 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:50.030
 Strangely enough, one immediately 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:53.140
 are the best craftsmen the the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.080
 world has ever known lost 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.209
 finger links and even her life as 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.380
 They carved these magnificent pillars 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:06.890
 and they all have sacrificed themselves willingly 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.709
 for I can assure you that 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.970
 opulence and versatility of this 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.609
 chandelier is equaled only 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.500
 in nobility palaces 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.730
 So listen, I thought I was holding on 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.930
 rather out because we are friends and 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.390
 because it's your thing alone 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.880
 Now I have to burst the bomb 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.150
 I'm just saying thank god you're sitting 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.190
 Charlie is excusing mega langweiler 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.800
 all tear the maul you use 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.520
 Nobody says what first spitman it is 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.230
 the hell 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.260
 only 20 seconds with this 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.640
 langweiler to talk and something else you have 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.840
 always the impression as if he still something 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.030
 would look better 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.880
 I'm sorry that story you gave me 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.720
 told about the man of the flowers 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.380
 for the venus I have that wrong 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.380
 Roger that 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.740
 I thought you were the venus and me 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.740
 the wolverine 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:07.620
 but you are probably there as I am 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.879
 only the idiot was inserted 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.159
 worst of all is that I have it 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.740
 need to know 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.729
 so it's just like it said 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.370
 every month the box is sent 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.939
 Newcomer on but one had to 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.849
 be the first 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:25.169
 Clearly somebody has to do all of yours 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:32.080
 spend month on the clearing alone 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:33.819
 and that certainly was not easy but it 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.169
 then the other guys came after the run 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:39.999
 others who understood that is that 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.999
 most important that we all here 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:46.469
 go together 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:46.469
 because we are all stuck in here
