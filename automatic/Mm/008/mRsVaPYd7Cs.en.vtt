has<00:01:55.520> leaked<00:01:55.880> here<00:01:56.179> but<00:01:56.359> it<00:01:56.450> ran<00:01:56.689> all<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.049> way

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
has leaked here but it ran all the way

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.769 
has leaked here but it ran all the way
down<00:01:57.469> the<00:01:57.709> garage<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:58.969> we're<00:01:59.389> going<00:01:59.509> to<00:01:59.569> take

00:01:59.769 --> 00:01:59.779 
down the garage and we're going to take

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.239 
down the garage and we're going to take
a<00:01:59.810> look<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.200> see<00:02:00.380> if<00:02:00.469> we<00:02:00.560> can't<00:02:00.829> do<00:02:00.979> something

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
a look and see if we can't do something

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:05.319 
a look and see if we can't do something
about<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.729> as<00:02:01.880> well<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.670> last<00:02:04.819> area

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329

grinding<00:02:49.980> pad<00:02:50.459> on<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.730> I'm<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.180> use<00:02:51.239> that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
grinding pad on it I'm going to use that

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.600

to<00:02:51.810> rough<00:02:52.650> up<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.980> surface<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.610> concrete

to rough up the surface of the concrete

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.190 
to rough up the surface of the concrete
rather<00:02:56.610> than<00:02:56.880> acid<00:02:57.330> etch<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.660> or<00:02:57.780> something

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
rather than acid etch it or something

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.290 
rather than acid etch it or something
like<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.920> way<00:02:59.610> we<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.880> get<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.060> good

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
like that that way we can get a good

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.850 
like that that way we can get a good
bite<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.019> good<00:03:01.200> profile<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.769> the

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
concrete's that the new material will

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.340 
concrete's that the new material will
stick<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:03.989> well<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.440> that's<00:03:05.250> what<00:03:05.580> this

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
stick to it well and that's what this

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.660 
stick to it well and that's what this
little<00:03:07.350> hand<00:03:07.650> palm<00:03:07.860> sander<00:03:08.130> would<00:03:08.400> be<00:03:08.519> good

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
little hand palm sander would be good

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.440 
little hand palm sander would be good
for<00:03:08.880> too<00:03:09.120> as<00:03:09.330> well<00:03:10.640> now<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.819> show<00:03:12.120> some

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
for too as well now I do show some

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.150 
for too as well now I do show some
spikes<00:03:12.780> shoes<00:03:13.110> but<00:03:13.380> our<00:03:13.530> job<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:14.010> we're

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
spikes shoes but our job that we're

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.870 
spikes shoes but our job that we're
using<00:03:14.370> today<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:15.440> quite<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.590> small<00:03:17.100> area<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:17.850> I

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
using today is quite a small area so I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.880 
using today is quite a small area so I
don't<00:03:18.120> anticipate<00:03:18.420> having<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.230> walk<00:03:19.470> over<00:03:19.860> it

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
don't anticipate having to walk over it

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.940 
don't anticipate having to walk over it
when<00:03:20.250> once<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.790> well<00:03:21.150> I'm<00:03:21.269> doing<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:21.989> we

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
when once I well I'm doing it so we

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.380 
when once I well I'm doing it so we
probably<00:03:23.130> won't<00:03:23.459> be<00:03:23.579> using<00:03:23.910> those<00:03:24.060> at<00:03:24.269> all

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
probably won't be using those at all

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.569 
probably won't be using those at all
today<00:03:24.600> I'm<00:03:25.350> going<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.590> need<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.739> shot<00:03:26.010> back<00:03:26.310> to

today I'm going to need a shot back to

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.500 
today I'm going to need a shot back to
suck<00:03:27.060> up<00:03:27.209> some<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.570> dust<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.989> mess<00:03:28.260> and

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
suck up some of the dust and mess and

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.479 
suck up some of the dust and mess and
scrapers<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.540> paintbrushes<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.769> don't

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.120

recommend<00:03:32.820> this<00:03:33.180> foam<00:03:33.420> type<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.930> brush<00:03:34.260> most

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
recommend this foam type of brush most

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.590

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
of the materials that we'll be using

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.479 
of the materials that we'll be using
will<00:03:36.930> probably<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.440> eat<00:03:37.950> right<00:03:38.220> through

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
will probably just eat right through

knife<00:06:36.020> one<00:06:37.020> additional<00:06:37.560> thing<00:06:37.800> where<00:06:38.159> this

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
knife one additional thing where this

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.540 
knife one additional thing where this
expansion<00:06:38.760> joint<00:06:39.210> was<00:06:39.419> along<00:06:39.720> the<00:06:39.900> edge<00:06:40.550> went

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
expansion joint was along the edge went

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.880 
expansion joint was along the edge went
ahead<00:06:41.610> and<00:06:41.880> filled<00:06:42.270> it<00:06:42.539> first<00:06:42.990> with<00:06:43.620> a

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
ahead and filled it first with a

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.810 
ahead and filled it first with a
flexible<00:06:44.820> concrete<00:06:45.710> caulk<00:06:46.710> basically<00:06:47.610> that

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
flexible concrete caulk basically that

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.649 
flexible concrete caulk basically that
feels<00:06:48.060> that's<00:06:48.360> a<00:06:48.599> crack<00:06:48.870> filler<00:06:49.140> for<00:06:50.659> concrete

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:51.659 
feels that's a crack filler for concrete

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:54.350 
feels that's a crack filler for concrete
and<00:06:51.810> so<00:06:52.320> I<00:06:52.349> went<00:06:52.560> ahead<00:06:52.620> and<00:06:52.770> I<00:06:52.919> pre<00:06:53.729> filled<00:06:54.090> X

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
and so I went ahead and I pre filled X

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.930 
and so I went ahead and I pre filled X
or<00:06:54.539> some<00:06:54.780> pretty<00:06:54.960> big<00:06:55.200> holes<00:06:55.500> in<00:06:55.800> here<00:06:56.099> along

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.770 
along this edge we're going to take a
grinder<00:07:07.590> to<00:07:07.740> it<00:07:07.860> and<00:07:08.180> just<00:07:09.180> grind<00:07:09.360> it<00:07:09.539> smooth
