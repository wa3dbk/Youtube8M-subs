00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello girls and well today in 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.440
 makes a video to thank high 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.370
 lesse and our subscribers on youtube 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.610
 in fact she had done a competition 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.540
 sort of contest on his chain ya not 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 very long ago there is about the size 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.630
 human and in fact propose several 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.160
 products is actually at the city is 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.449
 given as a gift to those who put 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.820
 comments under the video 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.890
 I loved a comment like that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.099
 for fun what power has ever been 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.850
 won and she has drawn me so in 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.940
 did it was under the name of jim at 78 which 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.489
 is finally that I use on another 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.410
 channel but has no video 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.230
 so here it is and I will introduce you to a 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.710
 little bit what I won 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:55.320
 so that's all that it serves me I 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.480
 I'm pretty happy because it's the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.920
 first time I will not participate 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.410
 that I participate but that I win a 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.390
 contest like that draws what he 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.260
 was rather rather surprised because I 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.260
 did not expect it at all so in fact 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:16.220
 must introduce him a little bit more 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:18.440
 so already that's a base for 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:26.300
 eyelids what for before putting the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:29.360
 eyeshadow you put it here it 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.610
 is also a shimmering face the wii 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.590
 to fade out illuminating complexion 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.600
 what you put it you can put 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.780
 you want on the cheeks on the lips 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.410
 on the eyelids and in fact it is of 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.000
 the color golden beach 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.510
 no I do not know if you can see a 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.590
 little bit the color I'm going to open it 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:57.650
 so it's a little bit golden 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.130
 what with small glitters to it's 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.130
 pretty pretty 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:17.030
 so here I hope you see when 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.030
 even 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:30.269
 so it's like that otherwise there was the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.220
 Eyeshadow palette is stupid 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.870
 that I already had but damien actually 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.870
 pretty broken so that suddenly 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:43.049
 arrange me that I'm doing a new 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.700
 palette here is rather I read that it is 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.940
 rather flip flops that are neutral what 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.230
 for a 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.120
 for everyday makeup 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.000
 so that's about that I have 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.060

 content

 so that was just to tell you 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.110
 that today I did not do much 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.910
 so there on my hair it's a small 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.880
 bun that we quickly did what I have 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:05.350
 facts are more veiled then my 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:09.430
 hair are near huy there actually I 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:13.000
 a little cheat because in fact this 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.020
 weekend I had to go out is actually 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.269
 as you know the week before 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.160
 I had Alice and my hair and this 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.410
 weekend actually raising them with 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.490
 hence my big soft garnet shampoo 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.110
 moisturizer I actually did after 1 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.360
 as usual I did a care 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.490
 deep what with the big doubs 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.070
 not approaching it very short but there 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.520
 I bought honey and oils 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.490
 simply 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.340
 and I put that on my head I left to 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.710
 about 45 minutes what and then in 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.160
 did I get it back it's hair 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:50.030
 yes I know I should not have but in 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.430
 did right now I wanted to have 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.930
 smooth hair I know it's not 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.180
 well, but well, that's what it was 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.770
 five months that I kept my hair 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.840
 curly all that and I always did 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.520
 a message once a month but in 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.550
 did I want to find a 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.140
 little bit my smooth hair so I 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.360
 know it's not good but that's it 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.110
 but it is that the said I already said 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.910
 but hey, you must not do like me 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.350
 the facts is to respect his routine 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.970
 what 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.430
 but hey I protected them well before 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.280
 I made an electric sound a care 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.260
 nourishing and then that's what I have not 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.690
 I was playing not many breaks this 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.110
 moment that I do not think either 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.990
 that is to say that it hurts my 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.970
 hair what then we'll see but 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.140
 for now I do not have much 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.120
 of hair fears and I am rather 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.410
 happy because at one point he 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.150
 a few months ago yes I had a lot 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.919
 a lot of hair loss and there I 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:53.660
 I am rather satisfied so here is otherwise 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:57.020
 apart from that nothing at all I wish 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:01.120
 just a good day good evening and 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.120
 a good week we see there eggs
