00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.520
 I am year leone to the winner and I 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.730
 am the gallery manager 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.449
 wide-angle that heals dedicated to the 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.449
 contemporary photography 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.790
 it is a place that I thought and 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.989
 built to showcase the 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.910
 contemporary photography 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.280
 all the little details have been thought 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.629
 to be able to really create good 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.399
 exposure conditions 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.449
 we have a lot of photographers who 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.190
 work in the regions they do 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.070
 a very good job that had made the 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.659
 force and mandelieu where he could expose 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.070
 this work there even though there is a lot 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.690
 of initiatives that are made in particular 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.320
 by associations around the 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.690
 photography 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.879
 but here we are really in the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.910
 part of an art gallery that is going to 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.379
 specialize in photography and put in 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.580
 honor a broad section of the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.770
 contemporary photography 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.140
 I did not want to stop at a type of 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.640
 technique or a type of photography in 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.550
 especially me what interests me 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.450
 truly it's going to be the approach of the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.369
 photographer and the artist and his more 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.929
 it's bad this line of conduct 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.610
 I want to follow in the gallery 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.860
 at the programming level rather than 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.070
 my task and to develop technical in 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.070
 made 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.130
 respectful m maximum gait 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:46.689
 people I get so but that's 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.189
 really a place that also fit 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.459
 in a form of cultural dynamism 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.929
 that is to say, but this is the case 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.899
 on this exhibition that I feel in 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.780
 this moment with the gaffes galore 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.640
 when we have a job that goes beyond 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.270
 the photography the thresholds of power the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.759
 showcase 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.399
 also here it's in the context of the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.500
 poetry with mathieu any kind that 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.509
 I had previously hosted it was 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.160
 painting but that's what I care 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.420
 it's to keep this link the photograph 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.780
 and 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.120
 to show with the one pedagogical side 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.450
 that's the whole process of the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.450
 nobody 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.150
 the layout of the gallery is enough 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.120
 particular it was truly a 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.720
 biased my part to mount this project 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.160
 there in a shopping arcade 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.880
 it creates a lot of constraints well 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.230
 sure since on fee and at the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.060
 notion of passage that must be the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.090
 difference 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.830
 here again this qualitative question 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.140
 which is inevitably and present since 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.810
 here we are not used to seeing this 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.400
 type of place in a shopping arcade 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.180
 it was something that interests me and 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.590
 which did not interest me and then it was 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.590
 really a bias on my part because 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.500
 than 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.580
 I found that 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.560
 too often there was still 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.180
 a lot of people who are not us 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.580
 necessarily to make the move to go 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.410
 in this type of truly dedicated place 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:17.140
 when we are all we are all 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.900
 able to enjoy watching 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.459
 to be sensitive to a job a job 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.530
 photographic that's what I have 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.200
 wanted to put forward an item that 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.819
 I was interested to settle down 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.080
 there for it to be an open place and 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.940
 that with people but the apprehension to 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.570
 come back to see and discover at 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.550
 discuss there are really 7.7 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.740
 this notion of exchange which is 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.960
 fundamental less in the context of 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.960
 this project grenoble 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.960
 and 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.940
 we are ready 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.940
