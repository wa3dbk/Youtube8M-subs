00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.530
 hello everyone I am the electric man 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.660
 will fill and I come to say my opinion 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.779
 about a certain subject that I suppose 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.910
 more than one must already have known 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.789
 just today I just found out that in 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.399
 2015 will be a new dragon movie 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.890
 ball z directed by akira toriyama lo 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.020
 which is great news because it does not 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.210
 I know how many months Toriyama had said 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.399
 that I did not want to continue the series and that 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.739
 therefore there would be a new saga what 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.930
 which seemed like shit to me because for 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.120
 me the end of the battle movie 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.950
 of the gods was like a continue and 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.050
 I assumed that the movie was a simple 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.820
 prologue to what is coming goes and is for 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.470
 what a possible sequel to the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.540
 battle of the gods would be a 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.790
 excellent opportunity to close 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.829
 the story although I guess for that 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.170
 it would take another movie more later 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.720
 of this because if you do not see everything very 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.520
 hurried in addition this would be a good 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.590
 opportunity to see how they give more 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.500
 protagonism to characters like itching or 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.360
 bojan noten trump if maybe apan and me 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.369
 I would also like to see something whose deal 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.770
 is to work as a team or something like that 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.929
 this is just a guess 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.729
 another topic that I should talk about is 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.619
 about if the movie will be 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.750
 dubbed the Latino as they did with the 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.060
 previous although remember that for that 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.039
 the movie was delayed several months but 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.020
 I think this time it will be faster 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.909
 because now you do not need to have 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.159
 that bring all the actors together one by 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.219
 one and it is possible that he arrives after only one 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.049
 good wait month I know there was a lot 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.030
 people that did not like the previous 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.369
 movie so I guess that said 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.469
 people do not want to have another one but 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.049
 they may also try to give it a 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.929
 Second chance to the series in 2015 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.060
 but hey you just have to wait for 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.250
 true it can also be that the voices 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.899
 originals in Latin are present in 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.479
 the saga of ma ying-jeou in dragon ball 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.030
 kai although it is only one can be x's 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.310
 as it is now I dismiss leaves in the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.950

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.289

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.060
