00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.470
 how hard will it be to play with 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.670
 atlas who 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.270
 fired recently chief 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.619
 coach it will be 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.650
 impetus for the team less active 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.210
 fight further more it will fall apart 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.489
 sales do not think that the new world associate 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.710
 coaches code yes team a little bit 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.120
 interested in 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.070
 so I think the guys will be charged 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.060
 just to fight for a ticket to go 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.989
 because it will be harder 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.350
 I think something is motivation 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.980
 the police conducted a great light 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.260
 future 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500
 today at an away match 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.980
 Charger 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.510
 motivation methods are satisfied 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.710
 and because it is nationalists 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.540
 but if it's hard to say what will happen 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.400
 it is very easy or very difficult for me 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.570
 will be difficult and independence from that 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.100
 that yes the coach is gone 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.189
 most often the team is a cow which 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.500
 i'm still playing 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.780
 in order to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.210
 prove to the new coach that they are 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.790
 so worth has the right to play in this team 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.940
 so the team will have it all 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.400
 some kind of pain it was elevated 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.570
 mood 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.290
 so I think that the atlas command is not 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.710
 will come out 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 good mood will fight up 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.710
 the last 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.450
 for now it's worth being afraid 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.280
 Atlanta teams that may be worth it 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.630
 may be afraid 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.540
 or having repulsed it is the only one 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.660
 Moscow 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.310
 that fear no one is worth yes 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.310
 need to play a percentage of your hockey which 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.110
 if we will perform the installation 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.170
 everything will be fine 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.660
 weak sides 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.100
 probably seems to me 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.360
 and this is defense but basically they are so 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.340
 lot 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.030
 we have the weakest side is that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.400
 percent 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.290
 the team has not won so long 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.010
 of course it's very hard to get out of it 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.760
 although on the other hand it is if the push for 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.780
 to lead 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.170
 from this hard position from this pit to 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.340
 last year the team is here so let's say ska 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.279
 greeted me very kindly 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.239
 It was such that the tribunes spoke 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.679
 interferes with this game 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:12.979
 yes no special 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.409
 I do not notice that I hope and sharpened 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.579
 weights 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:17.839
 happens sometimes 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.659
 spend such a creature 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.680
 each his own opinion, it may seem 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.759
 hands 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.599
 just need to pay attention to it 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.939
 naturally we try each 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.089
 set the task to win dates 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:30.559
 the main thing is to match the game 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.669
 interest in which is shown throughout 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.099
 last of him that brigade also 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.859
 tried the same fought fought 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.449
 so that the baron also played the goalkeeper yes 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.219
 so sesna will play again on 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.519
 victory 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.959
 try to bring joy to your 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:43.749
 to fans 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.789
 I thought for some reason that the guest slave 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.879
 I do not think that it will go to count 6 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.059
 after he was score 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.469
 but from defense 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.429
 while very big means loves 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.789
 on the contrary was only the price 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.889
 we have such a rival works on 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.199
 building 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.379
 as leaders 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.499
 it's harder for Peter 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.279
 that's the day before what happened
