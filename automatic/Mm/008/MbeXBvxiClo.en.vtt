00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hey guys I'm going to be doing a review

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.990 
hey guys I'm going to be doing a review
on<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.939> vivobook<00:00:03.240> as<00:00:03.659> 400<00:00:04.170> ta<00:00:04.319> by<00:00:04.560> ASUS<00:00:05.000> I've

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
on the vivobook as 400 ta by ASUS I've

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600 
on the vivobook as 400 ta by ASUS I've
had<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.299> laptop<00:00:06.779> for<00:00:07.230> about<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.740> week<00:00:08.040> now<00:00:08.099> so

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
had this laptop for about a week now so

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.780 
had this laptop for about a week now so
I<00:00:08.910> think<00:00:09.210> I'm<00:00:09.330> ready<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.660> do<00:00:10.309> my<00:00:11.309> thoughts<00:00:11.550> on

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
I think I'm ready to do my thoughts on

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.310 
I think I'm ready to do my thoughts on
this<00:00:12.150> laptop<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.780> whether<00:00:12.929> or<00:00:12.990> not<00:00:13.139> you

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
this laptop and whether or not you

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.099 
this laptop and whether or not you
should<00:00:13.349> buy<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.429> first<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.450> all<00:00:15.570> let's<00:00:15.780> talk

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
should buy it so first of all let's talk

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.510 
should buy it so first of all let's talk
about<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.440> specs<00:00:16.650> I'm<00:00:16.920> sure<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.190> know<00:00:17.340> them

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
about the specs I'm sure you know them

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.490 
about the specs I'm sure you know them
if<00:00:17.670> you're<00:00:17.760> looking<00:00:18.060> into<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> SAP<00:00:18.510> top<00:00:18.750> comes

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
if you're looking into the SAP top comes

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.080 
if you're looking into the SAP top comes
with<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.740> 500<00:00:20.189> gigabyte<00:00:20.600> 5400<00:00:21.600> RPM<00:00:22.080> hard<00:00:22.710> drive

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
with a 500 gigabyte 5400 RPM hard drive

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.640 
with a 500 gigabyte 5400 RPM hard drive
that's<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.300> normal<00:00:24.449> hard<00:00:24.779> drive<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.410> little

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that's a normal hard drive it's a little

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.599 
that's a normal hard drive it's a little
bit<00:00:25.769> thinner<00:00:25.949> than<00:00:27.560> 2.5<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.619> think<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.490> if

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
bit thinner than 2.5 I think so if

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.070 
bit thinner than 2.5 I think so if
you're<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:29.970> replacing<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
you're going to be replacing that with a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.229 
you're going to be replacing that with a
solid<00:00:31.349> state<00:00:31.560> drive<00:00:31.940> you're<00:00:32.940> gonna<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
solid state drive you're gonna have to

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.930 
solid state drive you're gonna have to
look<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:33.780> windows<00:00:34.020> smaller<00:00:34.320> slimmer<00:00:34.680> ones

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
look for windows smaller slimmer ones

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.850 
look for windows smaller slimmer ones
comes<00:00:35.940> also<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.600> little<00:00:36.930> insider<00:00:37.559> drive

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
comes also with a little insider drive

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.760 
comes also with a little insider drive
with<00:00:38.610> solid-state<00:00:39.390> memory<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.590> that's

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
with solid-state memory on it so that's

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.240 
with solid-state memory on it so that's
twenty<00:00:41.040> four<00:00:41.190> gigabytes<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.820> optimizing<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
twenty four gigabytes for optimizing it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.729 
twenty four gigabytes for optimizing it
really<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> helps<00:00:44.489> out<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> lot<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
really it helps out a lot so you want to

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.260 
really it helps out a lot so you want to
keep<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.070> there<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.090> want<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
keep that in there but if you want to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810 
keep that in there but if you want to
replace<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:49.079> say<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.160> bigger<00:00:50.489> drive

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
replace it with like say a bigger drive

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.420 
replace it with like say a bigger drive
you<00:00:51.239> might<00:00:51.390> you're<00:00:52.079> gonna<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.350> size<00:00:52.649> issues

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you might you're gonna have size issues

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.830 
you might you're gonna have size issues
because<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> way<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.239> set<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.390> there's<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
because the way it's set up there's a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.689 
because the way it's set up there's a
little<00:00:55.050> both<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.530> away<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.430> can't

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
little both of them away so you can't

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.170 
little both of them away so you can't
really<00:00:56.789> fit<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> large<00:00:57.600> inside<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.579> like<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> m4

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
really fit a large inside of like the m4

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.479 
really fit a large inside of like the m4
if<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> want<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> put<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.739> lot<00:01:01.980> more<00:01:02.190> memory

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
if you want to put in a lot more memory

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.219 
if you want to put in a lot more memory
into<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.809> think<00:01:04.019> it

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
into that for what it is I think it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
into that for what it is I think it
works<00:01:04.409> well<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.189> optimization<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.939> quite

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
works well and the optimization is quite

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.380 
works well and the optimization is quite
good<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.990> 14<00:01:07.320> inches<00:01:08.119> doesn't<00:01:09.119> come<00:01:09.240> with

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
good it's 14 inches doesn't come with

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.920 
good it's 14 inches doesn't come with
Bluetooth<00:01:09.720> at<00:01:09.930> least<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.350> North<00:01:10.500> America

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
Bluetooth at least not in North America

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.620 
Bluetooth at least not in North America
also<00:01:12.930> has<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> touchscreen<00:01:13.500> which<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
also has a touchscreen which is one of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.030 
also has a touchscreen which is one of
the<00:01:15.750> big<00:01:15.900> features<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.560> let's<00:01:16.830> look<00:01:16.920> at

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the big features on this let's look at

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.980 
the big features on this let's look at
the<00:01:17.220> ports<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:17.729> quickly<00:01:18.090> kensington<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the ports really quickly kensington to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.899 
the ports really quickly kensington to
your<00:01:19.259> speed<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.470> point<00:01:19.799> knows<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.610> also<00:01:20.790> have

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
your speed to point knows you also have

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.940 
your speed to point knows you also have
your<00:01:21.030> headphone<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> microphone<00:01:22.470> jack

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
your headphone and microphone jack

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.700 
your headphone and microphone jack
all-in-one<00:01:23.460> an<00:01:24.299> SD<00:01:24.659> card<00:01:24.689> reader<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.560> that's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
all-in-one an SD card reader so that's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.539 
all-in-one an SD card reader so that's
only<00:01:25.890> SD<00:01:26.509> then<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> USB<00:01:28.350> 3.0<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.280> one

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
only SD then you have a USB 3.0 here one

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.800 
only SD then you have a USB 3.0 here one

see the full glass display so the edges

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.389 
see the full glass display so the edges
do<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.530> little<00:01:46.649> bit<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.860> random<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
do have a little bit of random of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.880 
do have a little bit of random of
aluminum<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.270> them<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.409> use<00:01:49.649> like

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
aluminum on them but you can use like

get<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:34.950> much<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.940> if<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.090> want<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.300> hold<00:03:36.510> it

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
get that much so if you want to hold it

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.229 
get that much so if you want to hold it
up<00:03:36.690> like<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:37.020> with<00:03:37.260> even<00:03:37.590> one<00:03:37.709> hand<00:03:38.010> then<00:03:38.730> do

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
up like this with even one hand then do

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.880 
up like this with even one hand then do
some<00:03:39.420> posh<00:03:39.630> stuff<00:03:39.900> it's<00:03:40.500> going<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.709> be<00:03:40.860> a

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
some posh stuff it's going to be a

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.080 
some posh stuff it's going to be a
little<00:03:41.130> bit<00:03:41.280> awkward<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.150> as<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:43.620> can<00:03:43.739> see<00:03:44.090> it

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
little bit awkward so as you can see it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.270 
little bit awkward so as you can see it
opens<00:03:45.360> up<00:03:45.480> at<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.750> decent<00:03:46.050> angle<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:46.830> not<00:03:47.010> quite

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
opens up at a decent angle but not quite

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.110 
opens up at a decent angle but not quite
as<00:03:48.110> as<00:03:49.110> much<00:03:49.350> as<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.560> wish<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:50.010> would

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
as as much as I wish it would

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.230 
as as much as I wish it would
so<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:53.080> solid<00:03:53.380> state<00:03:53.530> drive<00:03:54.240> really

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
so the the solid state drive really

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.060 
so the the solid state drive really
helps<00:03:55.600> out<00:03:55.810> with<00:03:55.990> optimization<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:56.920> does

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
helps out with optimization so does

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.820 
helps out with optimization so does
windows<00:03:57.310> 8<00:03:57.550> this<00:03:57.760> runs<00:03:58.090> windows<00:03:58.540> 8<00:03:58.830> just

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
windows 8 this runs windows 8 just

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.590 
windows 8 this runs windows 8 just
windows<00:04:00.070> 8<00:04:00.280> not<00:04:00.670> pro<00:04:00.970> or<00:04:01.180> anything<00:04:01.480> like<00:04:01.510> that

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
windows 8 not pro or anything like that

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.540 
windows 8 not pro or anything like that
so<00:04:01.870> if<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:02.050> want<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.470> kind<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:02.740> stuff<00:04:02.980> you

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
so if you want that kind of stuff you

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.000 
so if you want that kind of stuff you
have<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.760> be<00:04:03.880> upgrading<00:04:04.300> it<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:05.500> battery<00:04:05.860> life

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
have to be upgrading it the battery life

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.520 
have to be upgrading it the battery life
is<00:04:06.280> also<00:04:07.150> another<00:04:07.330> disappointing<00:04:07.900> part<00:04:08.440> of

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
is also another disappointing part of

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.370 
is also another disappointing part of
this<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.830> would<00:04:09.010> say<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.400> main<00:04:10.380> problems

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
this I would say the main problems

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.750 
this I would say the main problems
people<00:04:11.830> might<00:04:11.950> have<00:04:11.980> with<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.340> is<00:04:12.550> no

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
people might have with this is no

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.740 
people might have with this is no
bluetooth<00:04:13.150> battery<00:04:14.050> life<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:16.390> fact<00:04:16.630> that

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
bluetooth battery life and the fact that

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.750 
bluetooth battery life and the fact that
the<00:04:16.989> trackpad<00:04:17.410> is<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.620> little<00:04:17.860> bit<00:04:17.980> iffy<00:04:18.280> it's

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
the trackpad is a little bit iffy it's

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.400 
the trackpad is a little bit iffy it's
the<00:04:18.850> battery<00:04:19.030> life<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.480> get<00:04:19.690> about<00:04:19.870> three<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.260> a

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
the battery life I get about three and a

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.860 
the battery life I get about three and a
half<00:04:20.440> hours<00:04:20.890> 24<00:04:21.250> hours<00:04:21.310> on<00:04:21.820> this<00:04:22.000> that's<00:04:22.750> not

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
half hours 24 hours on this that's not

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.770 
half hours 24 hours on this that's not
doing<00:04:23.110> much<00:04:23.230> idle<00:04:23.470> time<00:04:23.800> is<00:04:23.980> great<00:04:24.220> on<00:04:24.780> gets

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
doing much idle time is great on gets

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.420 
doing much idle time is great on gets
back<00:04:26.020> from<00:04:26.170> hibernation<00:04:26.740> like<00:04:27.010> it's<00:04:27.160> almost

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
back from hibernation like it's almost

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.740 
back from hibernation like it's almost
just<00:04:27.640> like<00:04:27.760> you're<00:04:27.940> opening<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.270> lid<00:04:28.540> it's

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
just like you're opening the lid it's

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.500 
just like you're opening the lid it's
awesome<00:04:29.200> but<00:04:29.890> if<00:04:30.400> you're<00:04:30.610> actually<00:04:30.880> using<00:04:31.120> it

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
awesome but if you're actually using it

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.550 
awesome but if you're actually using it
you're<00:04:31.630> only<00:04:31.750> going<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.020> get<00:04:32.110> about<00:04:32.260> three<00:04:32.530> and

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
you're only going to get about three and

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.990 
you're only going to get about three and
a<00:04:32.680> half<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.980> four<00:04:33.010> hours<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.490> battery<00:04:33.730> life<00:04:33.790> on

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
a half to four hours of battery life on

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.610 
a half to four hours of battery life on
this<00:04:34.150> thing<00:04:34.210> which<00:04:35.170> is<00:04:35.290> a<00:04:35.320> little<00:04:35.530> bit

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
this thing which is a little bit

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.880 
this thing which is a little bit
disappointing<00:04:37.110> it's<00:04:38.110> not<00:04:38.260> very<00:04:38.320> easy<00:04:38.530> to

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
disappointing it's not very easy to

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.710 
disappointing it's not very easy to
replace<00:04:39.160> things<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:40.000> being<00:04:40.210> said<00:04:40.420> you<00:04:40.630> know

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
replace things that being said you know

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.810 
replace things that being said you know
it<00:04:40.900> is<00:04:41.050> an<00:04:41.470> ultrabook<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.130> it's<00:04:42.370> gonna<00:04:42.580> be<00:04:42.790> a

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
it is an ultrabook so it's gonna be a

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.460 
it is an ultrabook so it's gonna be a
little<00:04:42.940> bit<00:04:43.120> better<00:04:43.330> than<00:04:43.510> most<00:04:43.750> that<00:04:44.110> you

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
little bit better than most that you

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.440 
little bit better than most that you
might<00:04:44.650> find<00:04:44.680> so<00:04:45.070> you<00:04:45.100> can<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.580> can<00:04:45.880> add<00:04:46.150> a

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
might find so you can it you can add a

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.150 
might find so you can it you can add a
single<00:04:46.720> ram<00:04:47.020> slot<00:04:47.320> I've<00:04:47.500> went<00:04:47.860> ahead<00:04:47.980> and

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
single ram slot I've went ahead and

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.700 
single ram slot I've went ahead and
added<00:04:48.310> on<00:04:48.720> forgive<00:04:49.720> bites<00:04:49.900> more<00:04:50.110> RAM<00:04:50.380> comes

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
added on forgive bites more RAM comes

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.440 
added on forgive bites more RAM comes
with<00:04:50.860> four<00:04:51.100> gigabytes<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:51.610> RAM<00:04:51.790> so<00:04:52.090> now<00:04:52.240> has

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
with four gigabytes of RAM so now has

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.090 
with four gigabytes of RAM so now has
eight<00:04:52.720> I'm<00:04:53.530> sure<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.800> could<00:04:53.890> add<00:04:54.070> another

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
eight I'm sure you could add another

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.250 
eight I'm sure you could add another
eight<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:54.730> get<00:04:54.850> 12<00:04:56.520> instead<00:04:57.520> of<00:04:57.640> them<00:04:58.260> instead

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
eight and get 12 instead of them instead

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.409 
eight and get 12 instead of them instead
of<00:04:59.350> eight<00:04:59.560> so<00:05:00.930> in<00:05:01.930> 1,600<00:05:02.730> 1,600<00:05:03.730> ram<00:05:03.850> too<00:05:04.150> so

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
of eight so in 1,600 1,600 ram too so

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.370 
of eight so in 1,600 1,600 ram too so
it's<00:05:04.570> not<00:05:04.900> bad<00:05:05.140> it's<00:05:05.380> pretty<00:05:05.650> fast<00:05:06.900> as<00:05:07.900> far<00:05:08.200> as

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
it's not bad it's pretty fast as far as

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.860 
it's not bad it's pretty fast as far as
a<00:05:08.669> processor<00:05:09.669> goes<00:05:09.880> it<00:05:10.120> is<00:05:10.150> an<00:05:10.419> ultra-low

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
a processor goes it is an ultra-low
