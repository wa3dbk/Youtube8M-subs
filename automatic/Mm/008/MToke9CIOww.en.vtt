00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that there are green bearings in there

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.360 
that there are green bearings in there
which<00:00:36.090> i<00:00:36.270> replaced<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> old<00:00:37.950> bearings

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
which i replaced from the old bearings

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.549 
which i replaced from the old bearings
because<00:00:38.579> i<00:00:38.790> used<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.170> bearings<00:00:40.469> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
because i used to have the bearings that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.670 
because i used to have the bearings that
came<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.520> actual<00:00:41.790> deck<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.390> i<00:00:43.320> didn't

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
came with the actual deck and i didn't

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
came with the actual deck and i didn't
like<00:00:43.770> them<00:00:43.950> very<00:00:43.980> much<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:45.180> were

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
like them very much and they were

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
like them very much and they were
getting<00:00:45.890> pretty<00:00:46.890> slow<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.590> i<00:00:49.620> just

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
getting pretty slow and so i just

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
getting pretty slow and so i just
decided<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.489> replace<00:00:50.940> them<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.360> these<00:00:51.600> lucky

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
decided to replace them with these lucky

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
decided to replace them with these lucky
epic<00:00:52.530> three<00:00:52.770> bearings<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.489> I'm<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.210> pick

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
they weren't broken in yet and they only

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.100 
they weren't broken in yet and they only
spun<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.409> about<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.619> minute<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.390> um<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.990> you

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
spun for about a minute so um if you

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.210 
spun for about a minute so um if you
don't<00:01:16.140> check<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.770> video<00:01:16.909> but<00:01:17.909> um<00:01:18.650> yep<00:01:19.650> so

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
don't check out that video but um yep so

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.149 
don't check out that video but um yep so
there's<00:01:20.460> my<00:01:20.640> board<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:22.710> tape<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
there's my board and I put tape on the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.710 
there's my board and I put tape on the
back<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.150> wouldn't<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.420> scratched

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
back so that it wouldn't get scratched

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.280 
back so that it wouldn't get scratched
up<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:26.070> does<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.880> scratched<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:28.939> and

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
up because it does get scratched up and

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.060 
up because it does get scratched up and
put<00:01:31.290> some<00:01:31.380> stickers<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.920> there<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.740> trucks

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
put some stickers on there the trucks

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.160 
put some stickers on there the trucks
are<00:01:35.280> four<00:01:35.790> inches<00:01:36.680> unlike<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> penny<00:01:39.170> which

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
are four inches unlike the penny which

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.510 
are four inches unlike the penny which
is<00:01:40.409> three<00:01:40.619> inches<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> trucks<00:01:42.979> they<00:01:43.979> come<00:01:44.250> out

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
is three inches the trucks they come out

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940 
is three inches the trucks they come out

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
a little bit more from the deck so um I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.319 
a little bit more from the deck so um I
actually<00:01:47.159> fell<00:01:47.579> once<00:01:47.850> by<00:01:48.840> pushing<00:01:49.729> my<00:01:50.729> um<00:01:50.909> when

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
actually fell once by pushing my um when

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.780 
your bearings there's a lot of people
probably<00:02:02.790> you're<00:02:03.780> thinking<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
probably you're thinking if you have a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.880 
probably you're thinking if you have a
board<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.079> got<00:02:07.290> new<00:02:07.560> bearing

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
board and you just got new bearing

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.919 
board and you just got new bearing
shipping<00:02:08.310> oh<00:02:08.520> my<00:02:08.729> god<00:02:08.910> these<00:02:09.450> bearings

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
shipping oh my god these bearings

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.500 
shipping oh my god these bearings
they're<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.349> they're<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.220> riding

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
they're not they're not a riding

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.160 
they're not they're not a riding
they're<00:02:13.170> not<00:02:13.340> spinning<00:02:14.340> faster<00:02:15.120> long<00:02:15.360> you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
they're not spinning faster long you

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.890 
they're not spinning faster long you
just<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:16.409> break<00:02:16.650> them<00:02:16.829> in<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.810> once<00:02:18.810> you

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
just have to break them in and once you

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.350 
just have to break them in and once you
break<00:02:18.989> them<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.319> then<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.890> oil<00:02:20.310> will<00:02:20.730> probably

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
break them in then the oil will probably

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.210 
break them in then the oil will probably
start<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.720> run<00:02:21.900> out<00:02:21.930> pretty<00:02:22.260> quick<00:02:22.620> inside<00:02:23.069> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
start to run out pretty quick inside the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.660 
start to run out pretty quick inside the
bearings<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:24.360> i<00:02:24.750> recommend<00:02:25.170> speed<00:02:25.799> cream<00:02:26.159> for

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
bearings so i recommend speed cream for

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.780 
bearings so i recommend speed cream for
that<00:02:26.989> because<00:02:27.989> um<00:02:28.379> speaking<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.519> one<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
that because um speaking to one of the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.520 
that because um speaking to one of the
best<00:02:29.909> lubricants<00:02:30.480> are<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.810> best<00:02:31.110> lubricant

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
best lubricants are the best lubricant

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.420 
best lubricants are the best lubricant
for<00:02:32.480> ball<00:02:33.480> bearings<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.319> um<00:02:36.079> yeah<00:02:37.079> so<00:02:37.620> there's

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
for ball bearings and um yeah so there's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.090 
for ball bearings and um yeah so there's
my<00:02:38.549> board<00:02:38.760> right<00:02:38.879> there
