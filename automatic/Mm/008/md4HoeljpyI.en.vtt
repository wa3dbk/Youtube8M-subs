ask<00:00:07.080> an<00:00:07.410> astronomer

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.029 

why<00:00:12.900> does<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.259> loon<00:00:13.440> look<00:00:13.679> like<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> changes<00:00:16.039> well

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
why does a loon look like a changes well

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.609 
why does a loon look like a changes well
here<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.520> earth<00:00:17.730> turns<00:00:18.570> out<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.380> always

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
here on earth turns out that we always

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.400 
here on earth turns out that we always
see<00:00:20.130> exactly<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.060> same<00:00:21.180> features<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
moon surface that's because the moon

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.460 
moon surface that's because the moon
spins<00:00:26.160> once<00:00:26.519> around<00:00:26.880> its<00:00:27.119> axis<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.140> same
