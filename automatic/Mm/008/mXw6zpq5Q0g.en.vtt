well<00:03:18.880> as<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.510> wait<00:03:20.470> not<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.890> when<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.489> just

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
well as it wait not like when you just

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.569 
well as it wait not like when you just
you<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.049> actually<00:03:23.350> hit<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.500> like<00:03:23.980> side<00:03:24.430> of

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
you you actually hit the like side of

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.340 
you you actually hit the like side of
the<00:03:24.670> stage<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:25.120> bit<00:03:25.299> low<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.630> like<00:03:25.810> there<00:03:26.109> but

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
the stage a bit low I like there but

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.449 
the stage a bit low I like there but
it's<00:03:26.440> really<00:03:26.680> risky<00:03:26.859> because<00:03:27.100> if<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.370> don't

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
it's really risky because if you don't

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.970 
it's really risky because if you don't
get<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.880> man<00:03:28.060> forget<00:03:28.810> about<00:03:28.840> there<00:03:29.319> and<00:03:29.620> then

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
get it man forget about there and then

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.280 
get it man forget about there and then
pop<00:03:30.220> around<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.269> then<00:03:31.840> you're<00:03:31.989> kind<00:03:32.260> of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
pop around it and then you're kind of

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.080 
pop around it and then you're kind of
like<00:03:32.440> left<00:03:32.680> exposed<00:03:33.010> all<00:03:33.340> right<00:03:33.489> oh<00:03:33.639> no<00:03:34.030> you

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
like left exposed all right oh no you

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.180 
like left exposed all right oh no you
not<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:35.049> it's<00:03:35.319> not<00:03:35.470> too<00:03:35.620> bad<00:03:35.739> your<00:03:35.980> head<00:03:36.010> just

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
not to it's not too bad your head just

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.270 
not to it's not too bad your head just
comes<00:03:36.430> slightly<00:03:36.730> above<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.590> left<00:03:38.799> or<00:03:39.160> you

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
comes slightly above the the left or you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.670 
comes slightly above the the left or you
can<00:03:39.459> get<00:03:39.579> back<00:03:39.790> on<00:03:39.970> there

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
can get back on there

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.890 
can get back on there
easily<00:03:41.069> so<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.819> don't<00:03:42.090> know<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:42.420> good<00:03:42.629> to<00:03:42.719> mix

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
easily so I don't know it's good to mix

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.220 
easily so I don't know it's good to mix
it<00:03:43.049> up<00:03:43.109> but<00:03:43.349> it's<00:03:44.010> risky<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:44.939> said<00:03:45.000> yeah<00:03:45.780> if

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
it up but it's risky like I said yeah if

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.959 
it up but it's risky like I said yeah if
you<00:03:46.409> don't<00:03:46.530> get<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.829> perfectly<00:03:47.310> right<00:03:47.579> then

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:47.969 
you don't get it perfectly right then

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:51.080 
you don't get it perfectly right then
you<00:03:48.750> pulled<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.109> out<00:03:49.319> yeah<00:03:49.769> exactly<00:03:50.090> it's

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
you pulled it out yeah exactly it's

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.580 
you pulled it out yeah exactly it's
rough<00:03:51.329> because<00:03:51.540> if<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.930> land<00:03:52.140> on<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.349> stage

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
rough because if you land on the stage

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.559 
rough because if you land on the stage
with<00:03:52.799> NASA<00:03:53.069> experts<00:03:53.250> upbeat<00:03:53.790> yeah<00:03:54.299> how<00:03:54.480> much

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
with NASA experts upbeat yeah how much

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.440 
with NASA experts upbeat yeah how much
lag<00:03:54.840> time<00:03:55.170> yeah<00:03:55.670> that's<00:03:56.670> that's<00:03:56.819> a<00:03:56.969> really

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
lag time yeah that's that's a really

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.449 
lag time yeah that's that's a really
hard<00:03:57.629> time<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.989> cover<00:03:58.200> which<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.799> unfortunate

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
hard time to cover which is unfortunate

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.009 
hard time to cover which is unfortunate
the<00:03:59.670> carnage<00:03:59.969> is<00:04:00.090> with<00:04:00.299> disadvantage<00:04:00.900> of

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
the carnage is with disadvantage of

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.229 
the carnage is with disadvantage of
dreamland<00:04:01.920> as<00:04:02.159> well<00:04:02.370> because<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:03.090> such<00:04:03.209> a

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
dreamland as well because it's such a

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.089 
dreamland as well because it's such a
small<00:04:03.450> stay<00:04:03.840> exactly<00:04:04.230> how's<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.889> Tron's

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
small stay exactly how's the Tron's

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.429 
small stay exactly how's the Tron's
spent<00:04:05.519> off<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.969> bat<00:04:06.150> exactly<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.109> that's<00:04:07.260> one

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
spent off the bat exactly and that's one

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.979 
spent off the bat exactly and that's one
thing<00:04:07.469> like<00:04:07.859> as<00:04:08.250> far<00:04:08.579> as<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.819> stage<00:04:09.359> current

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
thing like as far as the stage current

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.349 
thing like as far as the stage current
stage<00:04:10.260> lyst<00:04:10.560> goes<00:04:10.739> for<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.069> safe<00:04:11.219> axes<00:04:11.670> it's

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
stage lyst goes for the safe axes it's

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.089 
stage lyst goes for the safe axes it's
made<00:04:12.510> up<00:04:12.629> with<00:04:12.750> it's<00:04:12.900> entirely<00:04:13.379> small<00:04:13.769> stages

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
made up with it's entirely small stages

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.589 
made up with it's entirely small stages
I<00:04:14.340> think<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.639> one<00:04:14.760> good<00:04:14.970> thing<00:04:15.000> about<00:04:15.150> Hyrule

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
I think the one good thing about Hyrule

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.539 
I think the one good thing about Hyrule
is<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:16.019> it<00:04:16.169> gives<00:04:16.769> characters<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.370> don't

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
is that it gives characters you don't

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.979 
is that it gives characters you don't
have<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.699> good<00:04:17.849> recovery<00:04:18.060> more<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> chance

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
have a good recovery more of a chance

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.850 
have a good recovery more of a chance
yeah<00:04:19.410> well<00:04:19.680> I'm<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.919> stage<00:04:20.190> driver<00:04:20.489> start<00:04:21.060> the

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
yeah well I'm the stage driver start the

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.930 
yeah well I'm the stage driver start the
characters<00:04:22.860> are<00:04:22.889> walk<00:04:23.099> home<00:04:23.310> like<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:23.669> saw<00:04:23.910> a

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
characters are walk home like you saw a

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.820 
characters are walk home like you saw a
lot<00:04:24.150> more<00:04:24.270> link<00:04:24.539> on<00:04:24.690> models<00:04:25.139> it<00:04:25.320> exactly

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
lot more link on models it exactly
