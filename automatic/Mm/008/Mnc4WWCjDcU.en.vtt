 and now I suggest to go to our watch 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.500
 and so the clock 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.079
 quality plastic data often 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.450
 strong enough good enough 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:03:00.769
 nothing no I'm not about not moving away and not hanging 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.950
 Snot on good enough painting 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.549
 nothing anywhere slazit not painted over not 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.549
 smeared 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.829
 nothing to complain about perhaps but 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.290
 not so well represented 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.959
 color gamut can be represented 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.850
 of course I would like to paint a little 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:25.790
 brighter well, not bad principle 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.990
 there are moving parts that are hands and 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.630
 wrists unfortunately have few legs 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.440
 does not move 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:39.760
 head too unfortunately but there is 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:45.680
 such a chip screen backlight 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.690
 do something interesting with the alarm clock 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.210
 on works from two batteries 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.660
 impact screwed ie baby 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.420

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:05.110
 Turns alarm is now put things 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:10.400

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.960
 wait for this kit is not available 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.990
 no accessories 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:19.700
 that is, just iodine works like this 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:22.310
 Our alarm clock I want to say well 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.170
 In principle, this is a good gift for your 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.270

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:30.770
 holidays form the alarm clock runs on 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.250
 growing farther is worse that is 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.830

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:42.080
 cost cost of this kit 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:45.400

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.210
 way off unfortunately here 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.730
 no function 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:55.190
 to change the melody that is only 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:57.080
 Only here such a sound with principle this 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.130
