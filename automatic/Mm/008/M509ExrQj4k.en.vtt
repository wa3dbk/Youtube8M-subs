 There are still independent in Europe

 states and hula not so much but 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.190
 the mere fact of their presence does not allow 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.649
 to the americans 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.710
 the main fighter for sanctions to talk about 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.660
 that all of Europe in unison as a rush 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.590
 reality is broken and about what 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.700
 this can lead to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.100
 Yara Kherovo Hungary Slovakia Czech Republic Serbia 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.500
 Greece Greece loudly and clearly states that

 refuse to obey us orders though 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.789
 themselves risk falling under sanctions but im 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.710
 no longer scary because the world is changing and 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.199
 no longer playing by the rules which 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.270
 impose even the most influential states 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.760
 American magazine today write about 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.049
 that in the United States is rapidly losing credibility 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.909
 in the international arena 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.790
 American foreign policy 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.530
 the strategy is at an impasse american 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.020
 political and economic values 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.869
 become less attractive to 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.340
 rest of the world rose brooks professor 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.799
 George Town University 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.659
 the usa kind of brooks thinks that the world 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.540
 value sasha collapsed above all 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.320
 because a weak state got stronger but 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.780
 recognize what ambition is there 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.520
 more opportunities america naturally 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.979
 cannot therefore try to act 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.900
 old proven methods scare 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.210
 rebellious revolution 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.100
 like for example the Hungarians because she doesn't 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.140
 refuses to cooperate with Russia 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.180
 and building the south stream a 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.850
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.350
 regularly criticizes politics with while 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.280
 Russia calls one of the key 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.050
 partners of Europe and the males are stupid 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.640
 either glad that the ball is western politics 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.400
 sanctions which are a consequence 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.940
 Russia actions hurt us more than 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.340
 Russia 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.350
 politicians called cut down a bitch in 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.570
 which you sit naturally such speeches are not 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.820
 Can not annoy America and she this 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.560
 irritation does not even hide directly 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.959
 can not tell or can throw 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.000
 reason for popular unrest case with 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.250
 hungary washington made up a list 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.810
 corrupt officials on this list have faces 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.370
 more precisely to say representatives 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.410
 establishment and government member 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.660
 hungary which is viewed in us 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.620
 as not meeting the requirements for 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.840
 entry into the country 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.730
 no evidence as usual 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.440
 leads to the main reason to collect 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.900
 crowd her out on the streets of budapest 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.330
 to demand the overthrow of the government 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.670
 a lot of people came out but much less than 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.049
 was at demonstrations in support of the orban 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.120
 on and according to opinion polls 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.860
 the vast majority of Hungarian 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.079
 voters premier policy 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.780
 support no media and t-shirts and 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:56.140
 thinks well washington think for all at once 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.120
 but in reality it all turns into an attempt 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.430
 destabilize domestic political 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.500
 the situation with the country mode which is not 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.630
 does this state department or his 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.400
 partners notes czech president milos 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.680
 the demon felt for himself what it means 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.780
 he goes the wrong way too he criticizes 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.090
 sanctions against russia even require them 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.980
 cancellation wants to cooperate Moscow in 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
 fight igil terrorists and in general 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.209
 urged all countries to civilized 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.870
 dialogue for which he was scattered with eggs and 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.880
 tomatoes 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.040
 at a rally on the eve of the Czech anniversary 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.900
 velvet revolution as prime minister 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.850
 Bohuslav sobotka allowed himself to declare 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.360
 what will hold with the president serious 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.220
 conversation 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.690

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.560
 government its public 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.870
 performances 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.819
 what the prime minister fears is generally understandable 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.680
 we all know the possibilities that exist 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.409
 our American policy partners 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.430
 who is now at the helm 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.189
 european eastern european 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.920
 central european and express 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.659
 the desire to develop a dialogue with Russia 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.969
 show promise seem quite 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.530
 fogs for the simple reason that 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.000
 sorry the pressure is too much it 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.099
 strong pressure on you now 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.379
 experiencing from serbia she is not a member 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.269
 the European Union but it requires from her rather and 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.260
 forcing to join the sanctions 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.750
 against Russia 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.150
 Serbia legally pledged within 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.219
 accession negotiations gradually 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.319
 align your position congress on 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:14.689
 difficult question such as sanctions in 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.239
 With respect to Russia, it is very important and we 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.150
 expecting Belgrade to respect this 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.550
 obligations johannes han eurocommissioner 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.889
 from an interview with a Belgrade newspaper 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.750
 news and hints of this is no accident beat couple 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.880
 some still haven't had time to heal 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.830
 giving serbia never forget 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.020
 the bombing of belgrade aviation nato 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.180
 section of the country perennial western 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.940
 sanctions but despite all the hints from 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.949
 EU Serbia has repeatedly given 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.169
 negative answer kies and america 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.509
 because this country has compelling 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:48.680
 reasons to support russia three sanctions 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:51.770
 can't break anything in this matter 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.449
 so the government of serbia never 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.130
 will dream the n fleet of the Russian 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.110
 federations 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.570
 The Russian people are our friendly people 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.360
 we have a lot of experience sanctions unfortunately 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.940
 90 years therefore we know what is 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.620
 the male has the same opinion and 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.030
 In Slovakia, that's probably why 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.610
 the visit of the President of Ukraine Peter 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.289
 Poroshenko in Bratislava, the police did not 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.440
 overclock 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.440
 unauthorized demonstration 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:22.030
 about as hot on this 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.030
 week met Poroshenko and in Moldova 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.380
 by the way the president of Ukraine did not come 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.000
 just keep acting 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.490
 power and agitate the people for 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.469
 Eurointegration on November 30 in Moldova 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.120
 elections to the Parliament and of 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:37.759
 who will choose the future path depends 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.830
 republic but what's unpleasant for s in 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.479
 moldova only rulers ready euro 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.500
 integrate but people like 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.389
 show polls 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.750
 favors close collaboration with 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.090
 Togo 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.880
 our union therefore Poroshenko's task was 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.080
 challenging to advertise of course about 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.000
 that the European Union 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.560
 Moldova and Ukraine are interesting 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.200
 only as a market 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.630
 resource source and main buffer or 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.670
 even a springboard next to the Russian authorities 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.360
 prefer not to say not to 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.700
 provoke 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.160
 America and there are rarely raise 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.650
 these topics in negotiations with those of all 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.900
 only pawns in the main game against Russia 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.590
 faith sirogo whether Hleb Kirill 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.590
 event center
