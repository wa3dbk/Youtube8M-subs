00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and wizard house which is not very

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760 
and wizard house which is not very
balanced<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.229> they<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.409> all

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
balanced you can see that they are all

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.609 
balanced you can see that they are all
pointing<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> different<00:01:33.619> unbalanced

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
pointing at a different unbalanced

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.429 
pointing at a different unbalanced
locations<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> motor<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.900> visibly

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
locations and the motor is very visibly

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.060 
locations and the motor is very visibly
exposed<00:01:38.189> motor<00:01:38.790> cannot<00:01:39.329> attack<00:01:39.930> anyone<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
exposed motor cannot attack anyone that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.730 
exposed motor cannot attack anyone that
is<00:01:41.189> near<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.909> motor<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.899> position<00:01:43.680> of

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
is near the motor so this position of

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.420 
is near the motor so this position of
the<00:01:43.829> motorized<00:01:44.540> quite<00:01:45.540> exposed<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the motorized quite exposed so it's a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.190 
the motorized quite exposed so it's a
very<00:01:47.460> very<00:01:48.000> cool<00:01:48.270> than<00:01:48.509> candidate<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> can

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
very very cool than candidate you can

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.929 
very very cool than candidate you can
see<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> Town<00:01:49.680> Hall<00:01:49.710> 10<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> definitely<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
see the Town Hall 10 is definitely a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.289 
see the Town Hall 10 is definitely a
rush<00:01:51.299> town<00:01:51.930> hall<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.040> walls<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.610> pretty

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
rush town hall with the walls are pretty

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.590 
rush town hall with the walls are pretty
low<00:01:55.259> levels<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.850> has<00:01:57.090> how<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.329> clan

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
low levels so I just has how the clan

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600 
low levels so I just has how the clan
castle<00:01:57.630> weather<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> East<00:01:59.399> any

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
that's not reinforcements true at all so

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.530 
that's not reinforcements true at all so
I'm<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:05.009> spreading<00:02:05.610> out<00:02:05.790> my<00:02:05.969> troops<00:02:06.360> and

I'm<00:04:31.470> very<00:04:31.860> very<00:04:32.100> lucky<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.640> i<00:04:32.910> can<00:04:33.090> find<00:04:33.419> this

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
I'm very very lucky that i can find this

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.780 
I'm very very lucky that i can find this
base<00:04:33.810> at<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.050> very<00:04:34.350> high<00:04:34.440> resource<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.220> of

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
base at a very high resource and of

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.420 
base at a very high resource and of
course<00:04:36.030> do<00:04:36.300> find<00:04:36.690> out<00:04:36.870> if<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.650> alexa<00:04:38.190> can

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
course do find out if the alexa can

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.750 
course do find out if the alexa can
cover<00:04:38.700> your<00:04:38.940> cost<00:04:39.240> of<00:04:39.390> your<00:04:39.540> troops<00:04:40.760> well

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
cover your cost of your troops well

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.100 
cover your cost of your troops well
basically<00:04:41.970> that's<00:04:42.240> it<00:04:42.330> for<00:04:42.510> this<00:04:42.630> clash<00:04:42.990> of

basically that's it for this clash of

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.190 
basically that's it for this clash of
clans<00:04:43.380> strategy<00:04:43.740> part<00:04:43.950> 55<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.880> remember<00:04:45.780> to

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
clans strategy part 55 and remember to
