Champions League and stuff there's a lot
more<00:00:53.300> games<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:53.750> there's<00:00:53.960> less<00:00:54.110> time<00:00:54.320> on<00:00:54.380> the

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
more games so there's less time on the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.830 
more games so there's less time on the
training<00:00:54.920> field<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:55.670> fail<00:00:55.880> as<00:00:56.030> well<00:00:56.060> you're

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
training field you fail as well you're

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.810 
training field you fail as well you're
playing<00:00:56.990> and<00:00:57.380> then<00:00:57.830> recovering<00:00:58.400> and<00:00:58.550> then

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
playing and then recovering and then

playing<00:00:59.180> and<00:00:59.300> recovering<00:00:59.720> it's<00:01:00.170> obviously<00:01:00.650> a

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
playing and recovering it's obviously a

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.620 
playing and recovering it's obviously a
challenge<00:01:00.770> for<00:01:01.310> you<00:01:01.460> for<00:01:01.730> your<00:01:01.790> body<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.210> play

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
be fantastic and it's definitely

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.150 
be fantastic and it's definitely
