00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.780 
stayed to it and I built this little box
that<00:01:30.120> they<00:01:30.270> could<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.570> under<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:32.840> no<00:01:33.840> matter

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
that they could go under and no matter

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.580 
that they could go under and no matter
what<00:01:35.790> rabbits<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.330> have<00:01:36.540> they<00:01:37.170> love<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> go

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590

under<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.010> box<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:38.550> where<00:01:38.820> they

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
under the box and that's where they

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.810 
under the box and that's where they
always<00:01:39.210> start<00:01:39.479> digging<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.310> never<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
always start digging so I never have a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.490 
always start digging so I never have a
problem<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.510> them<00:01:42.660> going<00:01:43.080> somewhere<00:01:43.470> else

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
problem with them going somewhere else

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and if they dig too much I always have a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.250 
and if they dig too much I always have a
rake<00:01:46.740> nearby<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.850> I'll<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.660> put<00:01:48.869> their<00:01:49.050> dirt

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
rake nearby and I'll just put their dirt

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.850 
rake nearby and I'll just put their dirt
right<00:01:49.500> back<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.420> dig<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.140> again<00:01:52.410> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
right back and they can dig it again the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.359 
right back and they can dig it again the
next<00:01:53.070> day<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.430> see<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.550 
next day and as you can see on the
inside<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.940> cage<00:02:00.180> there's<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.660> door<00:02:00.900> like<00:02:01.470> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
inside of the cage there's a door like a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.490 
inside of the cage there's a door like a
little<00:02:01.830> minute<00:02:02.100> out<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:03.060> they<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.500> come

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
little minute out and they can come

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.190 
little minute out and they can come
through<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:08.190> they<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:09.149> run<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.050> out

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
through here and they can run in and out

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.490 
through here and they can run in and out
really

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
really

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
really
this<00:02:13.500> little<00:02:13.739> tube<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.190> here<00:02:14.459> on<00:02:15.180> top

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
this little tube in here on top

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.600 
this little tube in here on top
that's<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> rabbits<00:02:17.070> can't<00:02:17.280> get<00:02:17.489> on

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
that's just so the rabbits can't get on

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:27.150 
that's just so the rabbits can't get on
top<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.150> try<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.390> jump<00:02:18.690> out

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160
