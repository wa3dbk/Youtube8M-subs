as<00:01:49.570> well<00:01:49.810> this<00:01:50.020> just<00:01:50.079> dreamy<00:01:50.679> number<00:01:51.189> 140<00:01:51.909> and

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
as well this just dreamy number 140 and

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.109 
as well this just dreamy number 140 and
the<00:01:53.679> reason<00:01:53.859> why<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.130> like<00:01:54.399> this<00:01:54.609> is<00:01:54.880> because

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
the reason why I like this is because

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.539 
the reason why I like this is because
this<00:01:55.329> is<00:01:55.509> it<00:01:56.020> does<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.560> same<00:01:56.590> kind<00:01:57.189> of<00:01:57.310> thing

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
this is it does the same kind of thing

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.429 
this is it does the same kind of thing
is<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.850> Latino<00:01:58.329> like<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.810> brings<00:01:59.079> a<00:01:59.229> lot<00:01:59.380> of

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
is the Latino like it brings a lot of

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.429 
is the Latino like it brings a lot of
light<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.070> light<00:02:00.850> but<00:02:01.329> it's<00:02:01.479> it's<00:02:01.960> more<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.380> a

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
light and light but it's it's more of a

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.090 
light and light but it's it's more of a
brown<00:02:02.710> based<00:02:03.369> or<00:02:03.700> bronzey<00:02:04.479> based<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.829> can

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
brown based or bronzey based so you can

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.980
