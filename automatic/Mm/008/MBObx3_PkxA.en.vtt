outside down on a room temperature until
it's<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.150> call<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.720> water<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.800> I'll<00:01:43.979> take

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
it's a so call the water then I'll take

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.550 
it's a so call the water then I'll take
this<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:45.240> my<00:01:45.510> stove<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:47.250> medium<00:01:47.430> gas

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560

this one to my stove on a medium gas
I'll<00:01:49.560> start<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.160> gas<00:01:51.200> like<00:01:52.200> medium<00:01:52.650> heat<00:01:54.110> I'm

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
I'll start my gas like medium heat I'm

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.469 
I'll start my gas like medium heat I'm
going<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.650> cook<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.550> basically<00:01:57.330> I'm

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
going to cook this one basically I'm

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.740 
going to cook this one basically I'm
going<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:57.810> boil<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:59.300> right<00:02:00.300> now<00:02:00.509> let's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
going to boil it and right now let's

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.859 
going to boil it and right now let's
look<00:02:00.869> pretty<00:02:01.290> thick<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.360> once<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.660> this

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
look pretty thick and so once that this

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.830 
look pretty thick and so once that this
one<00:02:04.080> is<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> mixer<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.850> will<00:02:06.030> become<00:02:06.420> liquid

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
one is a mixer it will become liquid

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.350 
one is a mixer it will become liquid
then<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.680> gonna<00:02:07.890> let<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.190> cool<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
then I'm gonna let it cool for like a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.830 
then I'm gonna let it cool for like a
few<00:02:10.050> minutes<00:02:10.520> before<00:02:13.340> he's<00:02:14.340> into<00:02:14.730> my<00:02:14.940> freezer

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
