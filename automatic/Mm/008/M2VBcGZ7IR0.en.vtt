and we also ask them what can they do to
beat<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.490> other<00:02:35.640> they<00:02:36.210> like<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.569> shoot<00:02:36.810> it

they want to shoot it and they want to
dribble<00:02:39.600> penetration<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.709> we're<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
dribble penetration and we're going to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.900 
dribble penetration and we're going to
have<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.400> stop<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.120> triple<00:02:42.480> penetration

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
have to stop that triple penetration

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.460 
have to stop that triple penetration
definitely<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.120> beat<00:02:45.300> them<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:45.660> we<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.230> stop

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
definitely to beat them if we can stop

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.990 
definitely to beat them if we can stop
their<00:02:46.680> triple<00:02:46.980> penetration<00:02:47.430> would<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.850> all

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
their triple penetration would be all

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.360 
their triple penetration would be all
right<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.540> would<00:02:49.170> expect<00:02:49.620> from<00:02:49.740> Rockville<00:02:50.190> to

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
right I would expect from Rockville to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.949 
right I would expect from Rockville to
do<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.520> lot<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.760> pressing<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.330> trapping<00:02:51.810> up

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
do a lot of pressing and trapping up

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.410 
do a lot of pressing and trapping up
they<00:02:52.620> had<00:02:53.370> us<00:02:53.490> rattle<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.880> little<00:02:54.120> bit<00:02:54.240> when

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
they had us rattle a little bit when

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.270 
they had us rattle a little bit when
they<00:02:54.540> went<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> their<00:02:55.380> pressing<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:55.950> trapping

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
they went to their pressing and trapping

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.640 
they went to their pressing and trapping
defense<00:02:56.430> with<00:02:56.940> actually<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.810> think<00:02:58.410> they<00:02:58.500> did<00:02:58.620> a

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
defense with actually I think they did a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.620 
defense with actually I think they did a
little<00:02:58.890> late<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.430> game<00:02:59.490> but<00:02:59.910> fortunately

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
little late in that game but fortunately

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.270 
little late in that game but fortunately
for<00:03:00.840> us<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:01.140> were<00:03:01.260> able<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.470> escape<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.920> and

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
for us we were able to escape that and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.009 
for us we were able to escape that and
whether<00:03:02.430> they<00:03:02.640> are<00:03:02.670> storm<00:03:02.940> they<00:03:03.540> outrebounded

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
whether they are storm they outrebounded

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.800 
whether they are storm they outrebounded
us<00:03:04.970> which<00:03:05.970> killed<00:03:06.840> us<00:03:07.019> in<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.319> law

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
us which killed us in the law

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.940 
us which killed us in the law
so<00:03:08.810> we're<00:03:08.990> going<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.200> have<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.530> bring<00:03:09.770> our<00:03:09.890> a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
so we're going to have to bring our a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.180 
so we're going to have to bring our a
game<00:03:10.130> as<00:03:10.700> far<00:03:11.150> as<00:03:11.530> boxing<00:03:12.530> out<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.980> doing

funny little basketball to win the keys

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.850 
funny little basketball to win the keys
to<00:03:17.450> beating<00:03:17.600> Rockville<00:03:18.110> i<00:03:18.440> would<00:03:18.650> say<00:03:18.800> is

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
to beating Rockville i would say is

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.010 
to beating Rockville i would say is
definitely<00:03:19.850> what<00:03:20.090> we<00:03:20.240> want<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.480> be<00:03:20.570> physical

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
definitely what we want to be physical

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.900 
definitely what we want to be physical
with<00:03:21.050> them<00:03:21.280> traditionally<00:03:22.280> Rockville<00:03:22.670> teens

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
with them traditionally Rockville teens

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.630 
with them traditionally Rockville teens
have<00:03:23.150> been<00:03:23.330> very<00:03:23.750> physical<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:25.310> want<00:03:25.550> to

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
have been very physical and you want to

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.570 
have been very physical and you want to
do<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.760> lot<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.020> ball<00:03:27.020> fakes<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:28.250> want<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.490> be

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
do a lot of ball fakes you want to be

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.340 
do a lot of ball fakes you want to be
very<00:03:28.610> fundamentally<00:03:29.540> sound<00:03:29.690> on<00:03:29.930> offense

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
very fundamentally sound on offense

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.020 
very fundamentally sound on offense
because<00:03:30.530> they<00:03:30.770> do<00:03:30.830> a<00:03:30.950> lot<00:03:31.100> of<00:03:31.160> when<00:03:31.940> they

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
because they do a lot of when they

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.520 
because they do a lot of when they
notice<00:03:32.330> when<00:03:32.570> they<00:03:32.660> get<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> weakness<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.380> you

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
notice when they get a weakness in you

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.780 
notice when they get a weakness in you
they'll<00:03:33.710> definitely<00:03:33.890> take<00:03:34.160> advantage<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.700> it

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
they'll definitely take advantage of it

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.870 
they'll definitely take advantage of it
they<00:03:35.750> play<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.170> passing<00:03:36.560> lanes<00:03:36.740> very<00:03:37.070> hard<00:03:37.370> so

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
they play the passing lanes very hard so

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.310 
they play the passing lanes very hard so
we<00:03:38.060> want<00:03:38.240> to<00:03:38.270> make<00:03:38.420> sure<00:03:38.450> that<00:03:38.810> we're<00:03:38.960> cutting

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
we want to make sure that we're cutting

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.140 
we want to make sure that we're cutting
and<00:03:39.650> doing<00:03:40.340> all<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.520> fundamental<00:03:41.000> things

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
and doing all the fundamental things

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.850 
and doing all the fundamental things
that<00:03:41.270> it<00:03:41.360> takes<00:03:41.570> against<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.350> team<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.560> plays

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
that it takes against a team that plays

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.320 
that it takes against a team that plays
that<00:03:43.040> kind<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.280> defense<00:03:43.640> at<00:03:43.760> Rockville<00:03:44.120> plays

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
that kind of defense at Rockville plays

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.260 
that kind of defense at Rockville plays
we'll<00:03:44.960> be<00:03:45.110> ready<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.680> thought<00:03:46.550> your<00:03:46.760> attempted
