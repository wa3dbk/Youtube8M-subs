00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.470
 the saint 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.730
 hi friends from youtube I'm Carlos and 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.650
 in this new tutorial video they 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.700
 I will teach how to put structure mode 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.260
 snapshots in your minecraft 1.7 point 2 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.660
 the first thing they should do is download 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.430
 the file that was uploading mediafire go to my 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.539
 blog and click on the link that 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.539
 will lead to download 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.510
 They give them to download and start 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.510
 download this raf file 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.600
 they go to downloads and extract the file 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.600
 that were downloaded 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.480
 extract here 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.470
 and leave them a folder with two 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.360
 files a notebook and the mode of 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.670
 instantaneous structures xd 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.800
 now they go to your minecraft point folder 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.900
 they enter their mods folder and put there the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.900
 file downloaded like me in the video 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.610
 and ready that easy we already have our 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.620
 mode installed in our minecraft xd 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.210
 now I will show you a little the utility 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.470
 in this way that is pretty good 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.450
 stay to see the module a bit 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.400
 as I told you in the previous video 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.470
 they have to go in with their version of 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.470
 forge to enter with mods xd 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.100
 well we are here I will show you only 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.700
 three of the many structures that there are 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.700
 in this mod 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.849
 it is very easy to operate the mode 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.009
 you just put the juice of the structure that 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.880
 you want to click and you're done 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.880
 great structure 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.340
 this structure is that the more I 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.390
 like but little bit of the position that is 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.390
 very large xd 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.740
 good since I took off my see it the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.190
 structure that this cube leaves us is a 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.020
 immense skyscraper and I wanted them 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.030
 teach more structures but here 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.980

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.830

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.140
