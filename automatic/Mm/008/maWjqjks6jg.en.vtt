though<00:01:20.850> cuz<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.120> second<00:01:21.450> time<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> wanted<00:01:21.960> me

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
though cuz the second time I wanted me

though cuz the second time I wanted me
to<00:01:22.140> me<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.440> wouldn't<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.800> even<00:01:22.950> made<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
to me I wouldn't have even made it to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.840 
to me I wouldn't have even made it to
begin<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:23.910> but

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.700 

you<00:01:28.850> get<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.090> watch<00:01:29.210> only<00:01:29.990> one<00:01:30.229> attempt<00:01:30.530> though

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710

I've<00:01:31.009> decided<00:01:31.579> that<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.030> first<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.680> have<00:01:33.680> to

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
I've decided that the first to have to

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.710 
I've decided that the first to have to
be<00:01:33.950> cut<00:01:34.159> well<00:01:34.549> mainly<00:01:34.729> because<00:01:34.970> I'm<00:01:35.270> running

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
be cut well mainly because I'm running

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.630 
be cut well mainly because I'm running
out<00:01:35.780> of<00:01:35.840> time<00:01:36.049> if<00:01:36.619> I<00:01:36.799> left<00:01:36.950> them<00:01:37.100> all<00:01:37.189> in<00:01:37.399> but

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
out of time if I left them all in but

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.240 
out of time if I left them all in but
also<00:01:38.000> because<00:01:38.740> any<00:01:39.740> kind<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.039> pointless

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
also because any kind of pointless

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.560
