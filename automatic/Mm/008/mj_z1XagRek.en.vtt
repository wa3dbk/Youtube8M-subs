really<00:01:13.170> good<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.469> Nexus<00:01:13.979> that's<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.399> sure<00:01:14.549> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
really good on Nexus that's for sure it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.819 
really good on Nexus that's for sure it
gives<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> couple<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:17.210> these<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
put this all together because yeah

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.529 
put this all together because yeah
that's<00:01:22.770> interesting<00:01:23.490> instead<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.180> using<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
that's interesting instead of it using a

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:25.910 
that's interesting instead of it using a
screw<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> hold<00:01:24.899> it<00:01:25.140> together<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.619> actually

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
screw to hold it together it actually

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.219 
screw to hold it together it actually
uses<00:01:26.130> these<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.670> pins<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.810> let's<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.140> ahead

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
uses these little pins so let's go ahead

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.870 
uses these little pins so let's go ahead
and<00:01:28.409> get<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.680> onto<00:01:28.950> Nexus<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.520> see<00:01:29.640> how<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and get this onto Nexus and see how it

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.149 
and get this onto Nexus and see how it
looks<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.780> first<00:01:31.020> step<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.829> taking

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
looks so the first step is just taking

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.950 
looks so the first step is just taking
off<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.399> old<00:01:32.579> wing<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.179> all<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.359> have<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
off the old wing and all I have to do is

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.349 
off the old wing and all I have to do is
pry<00:01:34.320> these<00:01:34.799> two<00:01:35.130> bars<00:01:35.399> out<00:01:35.820> from<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> rear

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
pry these two bars out from the rear

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.260 
pry these two bars out from the rear
shock<00:01:36.630> tower<00:01:37.340> alright<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:39.060> old

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
shock tower alright now that the old

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.179 
shock tower alright now that the old
wing<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> way<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.619> need<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> go

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
wing is out of the way I need to go

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.060 
wing is out of the way I need to go
ahead<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.549> put<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.149> wing<00:01:42.299> mount<00:01:42.570> together<00:01:43.229> so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
ahead and put the wing mount together so

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.099 
ahead and put the wing mount together so
how<00:01:44.429> this<00:01:44.609> works<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:45.179> that<00:01:45.390> there's<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.689> center

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
how this works is that there's a center

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.919 
how this works is that there's a center
piece<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:47.520> hooks<00:01:47.789> up<00:01:47.999> to<00:01:48.149> each<00:01:48.299> side<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
piece that hooks up to each side and

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.289 
piece that hooks up to each side and
then<00:01:49.320> there's<00:01:49.560> two<00:01:49.829> screws<00:01:50.219> that<00:01:50.249> go<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.850> from

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
then there's two screws that go on from

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.209 
then there's two screws that go on from
each<00:01:51.450> side<00:01:51.719> to<00:01:51.840> hold<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.140> all<00:01:52.229> together<00:01:52.350> I'm

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
each side to hold it all together I'm

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.739 
each side to hold it all together I'm
just<00:01:53.280> gonna<00:01:53.520> use<00:01:53.759> some<00:01:53.789> leftover<00:01:54.359> stainless

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
just gonna use some leftover stainless

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:56.840 
just gonna use some leftover stainless
steel<00:01:54.960> screws<00:01:55.289> and<00:01:55.530> there<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.249> I<00:01:56.429> have<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
steel screws and there we go I have it

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.399 
steel screws and there we go I have it
all<00:01:56.969> together<00:01:57.119> now<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> thought<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:57.990> had<00:01:58.229> some

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
all together now I thought I had some

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.289 
all together now I thought I had some
nitrous<00:01:58.770> stainless<00:01:59.219> steel<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.939> ran<00:02:00.149> out

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
nitrous stainless steel but I ran out

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.840 
nitrous stainless steel but I ran out
I'm<00:02:00.539> surprising<00:02:01.200> no<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:02.009> anyways<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.520> ended<00:02:02.729> up

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
I'm surprising no but anyways I ended up

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.639 
I'm surprising no but anyways I ended up
using<00:02:03.030> these<00:02:03.299> sizes<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.990> think<00:02:04.259> there<00:02:04.409> are<00:02:04.439> say

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
using these sizes I think there are say

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.069 
using these sizes I think there are say
12<00:02:04.979> millimeters<00:02:05.549> long<00:02:05.789> but<00:02:06.090> they<00:02:06.359> are<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
12 millimeters long but they are the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.710 
12 millimeters long but they are the
stock<00:02:07.560> VXL<00:02:08.130> screws<00:02:08.460> and<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.120> have<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.270> ton<00:02:09.690> of

these two top holes perfectly align with
these<00:02:30.269> two<00:02:30.629> top<00:02:30.959> holes<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.980> what<00:02:32.189> I'm<00:02:32.280> gonna<00:02:32.400> do

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
these two top holes so what I'm gonna do

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.759 
these two top holes so what I'm gonna do
is<00:02:33.120> I'm<00:02:33.299> gonna<00:02:33.420> go<00:02:33.659> ahead<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.019> drill<00:02:34.439> these

is I'm gonna go ahead and drill these
two<00:02:35.400> top<00:02:35.670> holes<00:02:35.969> a<00:02:36.299> little<00:02:36.750> bit<00:02:37.019> wider<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.620> this

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
two top holes a little bit wider so this

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.039 
two top holes a little bit wider so this
kind<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.790> screw<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.269> fit<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.629> there<00:02:39.840> because

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
kind of screw can fit in there because

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.069 
kind of screw can fit in there because
as<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.439> can<00:02:40.530> see<00:02:40.829> there's<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.609> slot<00:02:42.030> or<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> three

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
as you can see there's a slot or a three

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.530 
as you can see there's a slot or a three
millimeter<00:02:43.319> not<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.889> go<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.219> there<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.700> that's

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
millimeter not to go in there and that's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.089 
millimeter not to go in there and that's
what<00:02:45.750> I'm<00:02:45.810> gonna<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:46.049> doing<00:02:46.079> because<00:02:46.469> having

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
what I'm gonna be doing because having

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.459 
what I'm gonna be doing because having
this<00:02:47.219> being<00:02:47.549> held<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.939> there<00:02:48.120> with<00:02:48.419> just<00:02:48.900> that

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
this being held in there with just that

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.099 
this being held in there with just that
it's<00:02:49.739> not<00:02:49.829> gonna<00:02:50.069> work<00:02:50.159> also<00:02:51.049> these<00:02:52.049> two

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
it's not gonna work also these two

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.399 
it's not gonna work also these two
bottom<00:02:53.010> holes<00:02:53.280> from<00:02:53.969> the<00:02:54.090> wing<00:02:54.389> mount<00:02:54.689> do<00:02:55.230> not

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
bottom holes from the wing mount do not

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.379 
bottom holes from the wing mount do not
align<00:02:55.680> with<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.250> holes<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:56.609> the<00:02:56.730> bottom<00:02:57.090> so

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
align with the holes on the bottom so

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.689 
align with the holes on the bottom so
what<00:02:57.480> I'm<00:02:57.629> gonna<00:02:57.750> do<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:58.469> that<00:02:59.280> after<00:02:59.669> I

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.569 
install the two top screws I'm going to
go<00:03:02.609> ahead<00:03:02.699> and<00:03:03.180> drill<00:03:03.480> two<00:03:03.989> new<00:03:04.319> holes<00:03:04.650> through

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
go ahead and drill two new holes through

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.490 
go ahead and drill two new holes through
this<00:03:05.760> part<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.389> shock<00:03:06.810> tower<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.349> way<00:03:07.469> I

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
this part of the shock tower that way I

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.199 
this part of the shock tower that way I
can<00:03:07.739> go<00:03:07.889> ahead<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.280> mount<00:03:08.400> two<00:03:08.699> more<00:03:08.909> screws

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
can go ahead and mount two more screws

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.720 
can go ahead and mount two more screws
on<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:09.480> bottom<00:03:09.629> that<00:03:10.439> way<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.829> will<00:03:10.919> be<00:03:10.980> really

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
on the bottom that way it will be really

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.550 
on the bottom that way it will be really
sturdy<00:03:12.209> as<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.719> can<00:03:12.870> see<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.049> went<00:03:13.260> ahead<00:03:13.409> and

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
sturdy as you can see I went ahead and

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.959 
sturdy as you can see I went ahead and
drilled<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:13.980> hole<00:03:14.129> out<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.340> little<00:03:14.579> bit<00:03:14.760> bigger

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
drilled the hole out a little bit bigger

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.939 
drilled the hole out a little bit bigger
so<00:03:15.359> these<00:03:15.569> kind<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:15.989> screws<00:03:16.229> can<00:03:16.439> fit<00:03:16.650> through

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
so these kind of screws can fit through

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.360 
so these kind of screws can fit through
now<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.569> next<00:03:18.870> step<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.290> did<00:03:19.319> was<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:20.069> went

ahead and put a wing mount on put a
little<00:03:23.699> small<00:03:24.000> screwdriver<00:03:24.509> through<00:03:25.049> that

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229 
little small screwdriver through that

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.649

hole and marked where I'm gonna be doing
the<00:03:27.959> next<00:03:27.989> two<00:03:28.379> holes<00:03:28.650> now<00:03:29.159> that<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.609> my

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:29.759 
the next two holes now that I have my

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.759 
the next two holes now that I have my
two<00:03:29.819> custom<00:03:30.449> holes<00:03:30.629> drilled<00:03:31.049> out<00:03:31.229> I<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.650> go

you<00:05:05.560> do<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:06.490> wing<00:05:06.669> mount<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:07.300> attach<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:08.259> into

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
you do the wing mount and attach it into

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.170 
you do the wing mount and attach it into
the<00:05:08.590> rear<00:05:08.800> shock<00:05:09.039> tower<00:05:09.069> while<00:05:09.729> it's<00:05:09.970> still
