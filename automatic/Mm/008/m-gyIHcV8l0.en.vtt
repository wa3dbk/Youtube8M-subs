00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
get them sorted into cells but I was

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.029 
get them sorted into cells but I was
having<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> bit<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> trouble<00:00:14.849> with<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.500> I

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
having a bit of trouble with that so I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.359 
having a bit of trouble with that so I
came<00:00:17.130> up<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.430> sort<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.119> fun<00:00:18.359> little<00:00:18.510> way<00:00:18.660> of

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
came up with sort of a fun little way of

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.740 
came up with sort of a fun little way of
getting<00:00:20.369> all<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.850> your<00:00:20.970> passive<00:00:21.390> animals

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
getting all of your passive animals

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.250 
getting all of your passive animals
sorted<00:00:22.740> into<00:00:22.859> cells<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.660> it<00:00:24.660> uses<00:00:24.810> fishing

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
sorted into cells and it uses fishing

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.570 
sorted into cells and it uses fishing
rods<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.039> be<00:00:26.099> good<00:00:26.220> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
rods and now it's going to be good so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.419 
rods and now it's going to be good so

sheep and a magenta sheep over here and
the<00:00:32.130> magenta<00:00:32.520> sheeps<00:00:32.730> buddy<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.360> all<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> way

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
until achieve is sort of against the far

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.189 
until achieve is sort of against the far
wall<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> cell<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.820> ease<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.960> might

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
wall of the cell at ease in which might

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.380 
wall of the cell at ease in which might
take<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> little<00:00:55.860> bit<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> waiting<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.879> yeah

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
take a little bit of waiting but yeah

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.939 
take a little bit of waiting but yeah
it's<00:00:57.570> good<00:00:57.690> enough<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.109> then<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.739> just

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
it's good enough and then you can just

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.520 
it's good enough and then you can just
pop<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.910> right<00:01:00.000> over<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:01.260> when<00:01:01.469> you're

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
pop it right over and then when you're

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.340 
pop it right over and then when you're
done<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.070> tower<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:04.049> delete<00:01:04.320> it

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
done with the tower you just delete it

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.969 
done with the tower you just delete it
and<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:06.420> i<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.630> come<00:01:06.720> over<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.350> i<00:01:07.860> want

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and that i can come over here and i want

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.410 
and that i can come over here and i want
to<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.250> them<00:01:08.430> into<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> same<00:01:08.820> cell<00:01:09.090> well

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
to get them into the same cell well

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.940 
to get them into the same cell well
actually<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.900> could<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
actually what I could do for this is

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.260 
actually what I could do for this is
just<00:01:11.460> remove<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.330> wall<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.820> they

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
just remove this wall so and then they

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.789 
just remove this wall so and then they
could<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.990> wait<00:01:16.140> until<00:01:16.290> they're<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.530> same

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
could I just wait until they're the same

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.990 
could I just wait until they're the same
cell<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.250> there's<00:01:17.400> not<00:01:17.490> other<00:01:17.610> animals

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
cell because there's not other animals

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.490 
cell because there's not other animals
let's<00:01:18.509> say<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> yellow<00:01:19.170> sheep

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
let's say I want to get the yellow sheep

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.490 
let's say I want to get the yellow sheep
into<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.950> same<00:01:20.189> cell<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.869> make

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
into the same cell so I can just make

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.630 
into the same cell so I can just make
another<00:01:22.530> tower<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.430> hook<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.450> yellow<00:01:24.750> sheep

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
another tower here hook the yellow sheep

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.679 
another tower here hook the yellow sheep
wait<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.820> him<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.939> stop<00:01:27.180> running<00:01:27.330> around

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
wait for him to stop running around

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.630 
wait for him to stop running around
because<00:01:28.049> he's<00:01:28.259> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.560> chaotic<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.130> can't

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
because he's going to do chaotic I can't

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.550 
because he's going to do chaotic I can't
hook<00:01:30.240> him<00:01:30.390> from<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.960> try<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.409> it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
hook him from here if I try and do it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.690 
hook him from here if I try and do it
he'll<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.799> go<00:01:31.920> straight<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.400> because<00:01:32.579> he's

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
he'll just go straight up because he's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.370 
he'll just go straight up because he's
up<00:01:32.850> against<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> wall<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:35.960> missed<00:01:36.960> again<00:01:37.110> if

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
up against the wall so missed again if

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.310 
up against the wall so missed again if
you<00:01:37.829> miss<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:39.150> useful<00:01:39.659> technique<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.140> just

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you miss one useful technique is just

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.270 
you miss one useful technique is just
switching<00:01:40.650> away<00:01:40.770> from<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> fishing<00:01:41.220> rod

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
switching away from the fishing rod

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.819 
switching away from the fishing rod
because<00:01:41.640> then<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> won't<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:43.320> hook<00:01:43.470> will<00:01:43.649> get

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
because then it won't the hook will get

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.219 
because then it won't the hook will get
removed<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> animal<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.840> I've<00:01:45.930> got<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
removed from the animal so I've got the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.450 
removed from the animal so I've got the
hook<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> yellow<00:01:46.710> she<00:01:46.829> pees<00:01:47.130> against<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
hook in the yellow she pees against the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.219 
hook in the yellow she pees against the
far<00:01:47.610> wall<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.630> could<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.840> pop<00:01:49.020> him<00:01:49.140> right

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
far wall and I could just pop him right

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.710 
far wall and I could just pop him right
over<00:01:49.790> it's<00:01:50.790> sort<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.060> fun<00:01:51.240> little<00:01:51.329> technique

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
over it's sort of a fun little technique

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
over it's sort of a fun little technique
of<00:01:52.649> course<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.070> other<00:01:53.189> ways<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.850> your

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
of course there's other ways to get your

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.460 
of course there's other ways to get your
animals<00:01:54.360> sorted<00:01:54.720> there's<00:01:54.960> some<00:01:55.170> physical

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
animals sorted there's some physical

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.740 
animals sorted there's some physical
ways<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.130> rely<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.880> size<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.270> an<00:01:57.360> animal

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
ways that rely on the size of an animal

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.399 
ways that rely on the size of an animal
or<00:01:59.390> if<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.509> want<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.140> sheep

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
or if you want to just get your sheep

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.319 
or if you want to just get your sheep
sorted<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.520> manually<00:02:02.790> dye<00:02:03.060> them

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
sorted you can just manually dye them

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.959 
sorted you can just manually dye them
but<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.009> quick<00:02:05.159> way<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.790> if

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
but it's a it's a quick way to do it if

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.490 
but it's a it's a quick way to do it if
you<00:02:06.240> don't<00:02:06.360> want<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.140> worry<00:02:07.170> about

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
you don't want to have to worry about

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.020 
you don't want to have to worry about
all<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.860> stuff<00:02:08.069> trying<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.729> set<00:02:08.849> up<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
all that stuff trying to set up the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.190 
all that stuff trying to set up the
physical<00:02:09.390> sizes<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.979> also<00:02:11.129> fun<00:02:11.520> so

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
physical sizes and it's also fun so

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.530 
physical sizes and it's also fun so
it's<00:02:12.739> just<00:02:13.010> generally<00:02:13.459> really<00:02:13.670> fun<00:02:13.879> to<00:02:14.180> to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
it's just generally really fun to to

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.500 
it's just generally really fun to to
sink<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.930> fishing<00:02:15.560> line<00:02:15.739> into<00:02:16.129> a<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:17.090> an<00:02:17.180> animal

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
sink a fishing line into a to an animal

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.040 
sink a fishing line into a to an animal
and<00:02:17.660> try<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.349> hook<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.530> over<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:20.050> hopefully

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
and try and hook it over so hopefully

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.030 
and try and hook it over so hopefully
something<00:02:21.230> you'll<00:02:21.410> find<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.709> technique

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
something you'll find this technique

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.300 
something you'll find this technique
useful<00:02:22.489> or<00:02:22.760> at<00:02:22.879> least<00:02:23.060> fun<00:02:23.269> and<00:02:24.220> thanks<00:02:25.220> for

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
useful or at least fun and thanks for

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.910 
useful or at least fun and thanks for
watching

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920
