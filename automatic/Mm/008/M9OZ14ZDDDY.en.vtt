 work anyway that's right 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.620
 need to even after reinstalling the system 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.920

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:58.309
 we promise the bot itself here are two 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.309
 version starts 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.000
 just looking for need 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.760
 to cover 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:24.020
 knight should be there with 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.840
 not wearing a shield or there is a weak point 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.350
 his weapon is not as soon as he 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:35.120
 the moon begins to burn 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.900
 Fight can be carried out but it is still here 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.330
 bad because sit anyway and 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.940
 wait until the Bibik is not but nevertheless 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.340
 time is saved 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.190

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.400
 only winning and that's only configured 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:59.479

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:02.780
 we must of course we are warm from some 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.340
 what is it usually more accurate is weak 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.950
 opponent of danquat squat 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.980
 strong opponents at my level already 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.260
 there are few such guys, but there is one more year 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.709
 the second version and that is this 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.450
 counter 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.380
 even without armor up to account and without the drunk 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.730
 he was not killed at all 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.910
 the only one without assault where protection 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:39.290
 just the usual such is killed in any 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:44.350
 case and we look about it in our 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.350
 the market look our armor is 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.350
 firmly 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:59.150
 814 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:02.300
 17 face that if you press then 8 - 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:07.340
 strength here is the second version of the bot 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:13.840
 where he seeks out just not completely 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:18.970
 armed knight and he will focus 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.970
 in short he will do exactly eight sing 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:29.480
 that's all you can safely go to sleep 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:35.150
 every computer will be but for the night all 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.150
