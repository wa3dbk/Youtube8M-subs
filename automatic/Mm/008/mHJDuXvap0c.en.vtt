00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.660
 hello friends today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:06.790
 terrifying chocolate cake for 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.010
 halloween for this we need the 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.470
 following ingredients 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.750
 well first we will do is crush the 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.690
 cookie our cake consists of three 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.210
 simple steps the first is to prepare 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.880
 the basis that would be to crush the 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.099
 crumbs cookie 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.900
 if you have the machine then the 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.820
 crushing is in the machine and if not then in 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.050
 a bag with a spoon you are giving 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.420
 taps and so we would stay 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.020
 crushed then we will put the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.450
 melted melted butter 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.510
 so that it stays in the cookie more 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.250
 compact and so when preparing the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.530
 base everything is uniform 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.480
 we will put it in the mold and with the same 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.850
 We are going to spoon him 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.790
 we're going to crush it so it's 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.410
 the base will be put in the fridge or in 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.130
 the refrigerator and leave it for 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.890
 cool 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.979
 while we will put the liquid cream or the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.880
 milk cream to heat and we will separate 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.320
 a little bit to put the gelatin then 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.580
 as you can see the gelatin and the tapeworm 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.650
 hydrating in a glass of water then 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.870
 once already put if you do not have the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.810
 blades 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.170
 you can use gelatin powder that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.070
 it would be about two good spoons 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.010
 we remove the gelatin from the water 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.080
 and let's warm it a little bit in the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.790
 microwave once and the cream is 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.560
 hot we will put the tablet of 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.930
 chocolate and we will be stirring little to 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.479
 little that we do not get the fire has 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.510
 to be very short we will put the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.880
 sugar remember that we have again that 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.110
 do it so you do not use all the 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.000
 sugar half of the glass in the chocolate 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.770
 with milk and in the other half in the 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.320
 white chocolate once you're 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.660
 we will put it in the mold and 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.180
 we will put in the fridge now 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.759
 we will prepare the white base with 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.009
 white chocolate we repeat the same step 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.780
 We reserve a little bit for gelatin and 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.569
 we heat 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.849
 in a saucepan the other half 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.799
 three more gelatin plates that would be 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.920
 two tablespoons more or less we return it to 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.930
 put it heat nothing 10 seconds to the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.480
 microwave and gelatin is already dissolved 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.900
 automatically once it is already hot 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.989
 the cream we will put the chocolate and as 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.139
 we will use to remove so that the chocolate 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.989
 dissolve we will put the sugar that 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:40.500
 you have left over that you already know 300 grams per 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.840
 150 with one layer and the other 150 with the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.689
 another we will put the cream with the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.120
 gelatin and as you see it cools 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:51.239
 right away and it will set 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.430
 second layer that would be chocolate 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.069
 white we will put it in the fridge 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.459
 through until it set then with a 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.829
 knife we â€‹â€‹will separate the mold and as 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.930
 You see, I have this mold, it's more 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.310
 easy to disassemble but if you have another 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.310
 pad so the same 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:16.630
 and then with a little bit of 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.300
 of chocolate syrup we will make 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.590
 in a spiral 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.140
 so that the guy with the spider web 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.370
 with the stick what we will do is trace 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.530
 lines to look like the cobweb 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.269
 and I had a little toy spider 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.549
 rubber because it has put you in the center 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.030
 now you can put the animals 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.459
 what do you have 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.220
 As you can see, it 's quite simple and it's 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.040
 pretty tasty we will cut a piece 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.250
 so you can see how easy and good it is 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.250
 is 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.100
 we will try a bit to see how 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.200
 remains 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.820
 which is good I recommend you guys 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.820
 so that the preparation is very easy 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.040
