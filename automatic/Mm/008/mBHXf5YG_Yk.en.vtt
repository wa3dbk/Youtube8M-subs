the<00:00:14.490> way<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.700> fish<00:00:15.030> shadows<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.690> don't<00:00:16.020> know<00:00:16.110> if

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
the way you fish shadows I don't know if

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.660 
the way you fish shadows I don't know if
you<00:00:16.289> guys<00:00:16.410> are<00:00:16.470> Delta<00:00:16.950> rats<00:00:17.160> or<00:00:17.369> know<00:00:17.460> anything

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
you guys are Delta rats or know anything

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.030 
you guys are Delta rats or know anything
about<00:00:17.820> titles<00:00:18.680> you<00:00:19.680> could<00:00:19.830> fish<00:00:21.529> shadows<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
about titles you could fish shadows the

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.130 
about titles you could fish shadows the
same<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.490> tides<00:00:23.759> and<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.570> call<00:00:24.779> them<00:00:24.869> shadow

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
same as tides and I call them shadow

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.310 
same as tides and I call them shadow
tides<00:00:25.730> incoming<00:00:26.730> shadows<00:00:27.119> incoming<00:00:28.110> tides

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
tides incoming shadows incoming tides

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.530 
tides incoming shadows incoming tides
are<00:00:28.650> better<00:00:28.980> than<00:00:29.310> outgoing<00:00:29.759> because<00:00:30.419> it

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
are better than outgoing because it

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.350 
are better than outgoing because it
pinches<00:00:31.079> fish<00:00:31.320> into<00:00:31.680> the<00:00:31.770> funnel<00:00:31.950> so<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:33.120> mean

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
pinches fish into the funnel so I mean

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.639 
pinches fish into the funnel so I mean
I'll<00:00:33.510> watch<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> shadow<00:00:34.110> line<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.470> come<00:00:34.559> over

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I'll watch the shadow line and come over

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.590 
I'll watch the shadow line and come over
here<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.220> big<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.030> I'll<00:00:36.120> catch<00:00:36.270> tens

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
here to get that big and I'll catch tens

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.620 
here to get that big and I'll catch tens
out<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.160> but<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> growing<00:00:38.489> tides<00:00:38.910> growing

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
out of it but a growing tides growing

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.000 
out of it but a growing tides growing
shadows<00:00:40.020> they're<00:00:40.260> harder<00:00:40.530> because<00:00:40.680> fish

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
shadows they're harder because fish

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.520 
shadows they're harder because fish
actually<00:00:41.250> start<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> separate<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.420> expand<00:00:43.200> so

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
actually start to separate and expand so

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.740 
actually start to separate and expand so
there's<00:00:44.520> different<00:00:44.670> edges<00:00:45.179> sometimes<00:00:45.449> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
there's different edges sometimes you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
there's different edges sometimes you
get<00:00:45.870> expanding<00:00:46.410> ones<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.739> I'll<00:00:46.800> fish<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.640> can

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
get expanding ones and I'll fish you can

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
get expanding ones and I'll fish you can
fish<00:00:47.940> out<00:00:48.089> 60<00:00:48.539> foot<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:48.929> edge<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.469> fish

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
fish out 60 foot on one edge and fish

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.479 
fish out 60 foot on one edge and fish
the<00:00:50.309> bank<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.670> other<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.829> but<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.859> mean<00:00:53.100> when

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the bank on the other so but I mean when

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.369 
the bank on the other so but I mean when
I'm<00:00:53.609> on<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.350> when<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.589> it<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.429> done

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
I'm on it when I'm on it it's it's done

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.989 
I'm on it when I'm on it it's it's done
you're<00:00:58.379> creating<00:00:58.920> an<00:00:59.070> environment<00:00:59.579> of<00:01:00.559> like

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
you're creating an environment of like

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.160 
you're creating an environment of like
suspended<00:01:02.999> animation<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.839> it's<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
suspended animation it's just it's a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.380 
suspended animation it's just it's a
nothing<00:01:04.680> there's<00:01:05.519> really<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> lot<00:01:06.180> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
nothing there's really not a lot of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.880 
nothing there's really not a lot of
movement<00:01:06.570> even<00:01:07.140> though<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> bobber

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
movement even though you see the bobber

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.610 
movement even though you see the bobber
popping<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.050> do<00:01:10.050> that<00:01:10.320> there's

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
popping up and down I do that there's

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.890 
popping up and down I do that there's
enough<00:01:10.860> friction<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> line<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:12.690> bobber

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
enough friction on the line the bobber

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.390 
enough friction on the line the bobber
is<00:01:13.050> coming<00:01:13.290> forward<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.740> baits<00:01:13.979> might<00:01:14.250> only

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
is coming forward that baits might only

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.830 
is coming forward that baits might only
coming<00:01:14.670> back<00:01:14.940> maybe<00:01:15.210> two<00:01:15.510> or<00:01:15.630> three<00:01:15.659> inches

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
coming back maybe two or three inches

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.110 
coming back maybe two or three inches
and<00:01:16.260> it<00:01:16.980> does<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.160> pendulum<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.790> does<00:01:17.910> a<00:01:17.940> little

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
and it does a pendulum it does a little

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.210 
and it does a pendulum it does a little
sawtooth<00:01:18.660> under<00:01:19.230> the<00:01:19.290> water<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.040> pop

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
sawtooth under the water when I go pop

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.240 
sawtooth under the water when I go pop
pop<00:01:20.370> pop<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.850> let<00:01:21.690> it<00:01:21.780> sit<00:01:22.020> still<00:01:22.230> pop<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.980> I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
pop pop I let it sit still pop up up I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.720 
pop pop I let it sit still pop up up I
let<00:01:23.730> it<00:01:23.850> sit<00:01:24.030> still<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:25.710> movement<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.430> so

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
let it sit still so that movement is so

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.510 
let it sit still so that movement is so
minut<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.980> you're<00:01:29.130> doing<00:01:29.340> big

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
minut it's not like you're doing big

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.670 
minut it's not like you're doing big
rips<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.840> not<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.410> you<00:01:31.590> know

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
rips on it it's not like you're you know

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350 
rips on it it's not like you're you know
the<00:01:31.920> most<00:01:32.220> aggressiveness<00:01:32.910> that<00:01:33.240> you're

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the most aggressiveness that you're

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.670 
the most aggressiveness that you're
going<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.510> get<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.870> this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.440> drop

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
going to get out of this is the drop

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.120 
going to get out of this is the drop
once<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.190> hit<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> water<00:01:36.890> but<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.010> you

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
once you hit the water but when you

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.420 
once you hit the water but when you
create<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.430> suspended<00:01:39.180> animation

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
create that suspended animation

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.070 
create that suspended animation
you<00:01:41.430> usually<00:01:41.670> dictate<00:01:42.300> that<00:01:42.480> to<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> fish<00:01:42.930> on

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
you usually dictate that to the fish on

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.410 
you usually dictate that to the fish on
how<00:01:43.200> they<00:01:43.350> eat<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.650> too<00:01:43.830> because<00:01:44.180> you'll<00:01:45.180> throw

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
how they eat it too because you'll throw

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.200 
how they eat it too because you'll throw
it<00:01:45.540> out<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:46.100> it's<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.340> still<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.910> not<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it out and it's so still it's not like a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.180 
it out and it's so still it's not like a
fish<00:01:48.480> is<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> rush<00:01:49.050> up<00:01:49.260> there<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.560> grab

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
fish is going to rush up there and grab

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.620 
fish is going to rush up there and grab
it<00:01:50.220> they<00:01:50.700> come<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> wintertime

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
it they come out in the wintertime

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.120 
it they come out in the wintertime
they're<00:01:51.990> coming<00:01:52.230> up<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> forty<00:01:52.860> foot<00:01:53.010> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
they're coming up at a forty foot of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.030 
they're coming up at a forty foot of
water<00:01:53.720> super<00:01:54.720> slow<00:01:54.960> taking<00:01:55.680> their<00:01:55.800> time

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
water super slow taking their time

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.020 
water super slow taking their time
they're<00:01:56.880> saying<00:01:57.120> okay<00:01:57.510> I'm<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.500> 40<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.100> see<00:01:59.910> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
they're saying okay I'm at 40 I see the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.480 
they're saying okay I'm at 40 I see the
bait<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.360> there<00:02:00.510> at<00:02:00.600> 12<00:02:00.840> foot<00:02:01.250> maybe<00:02:02.250> I'll<00:02:02.370> go

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
bait up there at 12 foot maybe I'll go

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.850 
bait up there at 12 foot maybe I'll go
to<00:02:02.520> 30<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.630> baits<00:02:03.840> still<00:02:03.930> there<00:02:04.260> maybe<00:02:04.680> I'll

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
to 30 the baits still there maybe I'll

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.999 
to 30 the baits still there maybe I'll
come<00:02:04.980> up<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.220> 20<00:02:05.550> bait<00:02:06.240> still<00:02:06.480> there<00:02:06.690> if<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.830> get

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
come up to 20 bait still there if I get

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.130 
come up to 20 bait still there if I get
up<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> bait<00:02:08.519> I'll<00:02:09.090> eat<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.629> that's

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
up to the bait I'll eat it and that's

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.199 
up to the bait I'll eat it and that's
how<00:02:10.289> slow<00:02:10.560> those<00:02:10.739> fish<00:02:10.950> will<00:02:11.099> come<00:02:11.340> up<00:02:11.489> ascend

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
how slow those fish will come up ascend

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.210 
how slow those fish will come up ascend
to<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> bait<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:13.590> once<00:02:13.739> they<00:02:13.890> get<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.129> the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
to the bait and once they get to the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.490 
to the bait and once they get to the
bait<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.489> they<00:02:14.580> see<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.930> they<00:02:15.930> grab<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
bait and they see it they grab it and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.990 
bait and they see it they grab it and
they<00:02:16.590> descend<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.190> same<00:02:17.400> way<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:17.790> not<00:02:17.970> like

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
they descend the same way it's not like

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.050 
they descend the same way it's not like
they<00:02:18.239> do<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.569> once<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:19.050> get<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:19.909> you<00:02:20.909> can

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
they do this once they get to it you can

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.030 
they do this once they get to it you can
see<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.780> way<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.590> structure

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
see that the way the the structure

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.390 
see that the way the the structure
itself<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.489> laid<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.299> see<00:02:24.480> an<00:02:24.569> intern

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
itself is laid out you can see an intern

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.449 
itself is laid out you can see an intern
right<00:02:25.610> here<00:02:25.879> a<00:02:26.000> cup<00:02:26.650> where<00:02:27.650> that's<00:02:27.950> actually<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
right here a cup where that's actually a

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.339 
right here a cup where that's actually a
funnel<00:02:28.849> you<00:02:29.420> look<00:02:29.599> out<00:02:29.780> here<00:02:30.019> a<00:02:30.049> little<00:02:30.230> bit

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
funnel you look out here a little bit

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.660 
funnel you look out here a little bit
further<00:02:30.650> out<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.010> point<00:02:31.280> there's<00:02:31.610> a

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
further out and the point there's a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.929 
further out and the point there's a
there's<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.030> point<00:02:32.390> out<00:02:32.659> there<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.430> fish<00:02:34.730> will

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
there's a point out there the fish will

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.149 
there's a point out there the fish will
run<00:02:35.180> those<00:02:35.420> shadow<00:02:35.689> edges<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.470> same<00:02:36.739> exact

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
run those shadow edges the same exact

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.610 
run those shadow edges the same exact
way<00:02:37.370> they<00:02:37.610> do<00:02:37.670> against<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.269> Bank<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
way they do against this Bank the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.140 
way they do against this Bank the
problem<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.129> is<00:02:40.340> some<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:40.730> depth<00:02:41.000> out

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
problem is is some of this depth out

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.559 
problem is is some of this depth out
here<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.480> 40<00:02:41.810> 50<00:02:42.109> 60<00:02:42.470> foot<00:02:42.620> of<00:02:42.739> water<00:02:43.359> so<00:02:44.359> here's

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
here is 40 50 60 foot of water so here's

what<00:02:44.720> we're<00:02:44.840> going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.989> do<00:02:45.170> we're<00:02:46.040> going<00:02:46.069> to

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
what we're going to do we're going to

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.110 
what we're going to do we're going to
take<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.609> bobber<00:02:47.420> off<00:02:48.370> now<00:02:49.370> they're<00:02:49.549> keyed

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
take this bobber off now they're keyed

take this bobber off now they're keyed
in<00:02:50.269> on<00:02:50.390> bait<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.129> here's<00:02:52.129> what<00:02:52.310> people<00:02:52.519> have

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
in on bait and here's what people have

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.610 
in on bait and here's what people have
the<00:02:52.909> hardest<00:02:53.209> thing<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.510> do<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:53.989> trying<00:02:54.500> to

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
the hardest thing to do is trying to

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.220 
the hardest thing to do is trying to
think<00:02:54.799> out<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.069> box<00:02:55.129> like<00:02:55.519> this<00:02:56.230> biggest

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
think out of the box like this biggest

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.339 
think out of the box like this biggest
thing<00:02:57.409> is<00:02:57.560> is<00:02:57.829> I'm<00:02:58.040> going<00:02:58.129> to<00:02:58.190> retie<00:02:58.549> because

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
thing is is I'm going to retie because

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.589 
thing is is I'm going to retie because
on<00:03:00.349> any<00:03:00.590> casts<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.159> can<00:03:01.310> catch<00:03:01.519> a<00:03:01.609> 10-pound

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
on any casts I can catch a 10-pound

on any casts I can catch a 10-pound
largemouth<00:03:03.049> or<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.489> 30<00:03:04.489> pound<00:03:04.700> striper<00:03:05.120> on<00:03:05.329> the

fish structure and cover you know I

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.360 
fish structure and cover you know I
really<00:04:08.050> pay<00:04:08.230> attention<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.860> details<00:04:09.220> on

actually thrown out in the Sun right

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.200 
actually thrown out in the Sun right
there<00:05:11.110> but<00:05:11.350> five<00:05:12.310> foot<00:05:12.520> in<00:05:12.610> front<00:05:12.820> of<00:05:12.910> me<00:05:13.000> is<00:05:13.090> my

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
there but five foot in front of me is my

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.029 
there but five foot in front of me is my
secondary<00:05:13.690> shoreline<00:05:14.200> that's<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.800> soft

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
secondary shoreline that's the soft

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.640 
secondary shoreline that's the soft
structure<00:05:15.520> if<00:05:16.450> I<00:05:16.630> was<00:05:16.780> going<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:16.960> get<00:05:17.139> bit<00:05:17.380> it

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
structure if I was going to get bit it

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.760 
structure if I was going to get bit it
would<00:05:17.830> be<00:05:18.010> right<00:05:18.250> against<00:05:18.639> that<00:05:18.700> shadow<00:05:19.060> edge

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
would be right against that shadow edge

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.379 
would be right against that shadow edge
down<00:05:20.770> there<00:05:21.010> you<00:05:21.310> can<00:05:21.430> see<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.729> pocket<00:05:22.210> and

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
down there you can see the pocket and

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.940 
down there you can see the pocket and
then<00:05:23.080> you're<00:05:23.200> going<00:05:23.289> to<00:05:23.350> actually<00:05:23.680> have<00:05:23.830> an

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
then you're going to actually have an

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.860 
then you're going to actually have an
outside<00:05:24.370> point<00:05:24.580> out<00:05:24.820> there<00:05:25.000> that's<00:05:25.240> in<00:05:25.450> 80

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
outside point out there that's in 80

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.800 
outside point out there that's in 80
foot<00:05:26.169> of<00:05:26.289> water<00:05:26.940> that<00:05:27.940> spot<00:05:28.330> right<00:05:28.360> there<00:05:28.570> on

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
foot of water that spot right there on

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.150 
foot of water that spot right there on
top<00:05:28.990> water<00:05:29.200> would<00:05:29.500> be<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.740> best<00:05:29.919> spot<00:05:30.100> to

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
top water would be the best spot to

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.590 
top water would be the best spot to
throw<00:05:30.460> a<00:05:30.490> top<00:05:30.700> water<00:05:30.880> bait<00:05:31.000> against<00:05:31.450> that

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
shadow the soft structure and still

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.339 
shadow the soft structure and still
catch<00:05:35.080> a<00:05:35.169> fish<00:05:35.380> out<00:05:35.590> in<00:05:35.620> 80<00:05:35.860> foot<00:05:36.099> of<00:05:36.190> water<00:05:36.340> a
