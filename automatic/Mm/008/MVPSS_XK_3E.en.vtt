really hints at where the movie is kind

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.930 
really hints at where the movie is kind
of<00:01:00.539> gonna<00:01:00.690> start<00:01:01.140> off<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.649> think<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
of gonna start off I think it's going to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
of gonna start off I think it's going to
take<00:01:03.149> place<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:04.290> timeline<00:01:04.890> wise

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
take place you know timeline wise

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.850 
take place you know timeline wise
obviously<00:01:05.729> after<00:01:06.080> Return<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> Jedi<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
obviously after Return the Jedi and I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.890 
obviously after Return the Jedi and I
think<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.250> gonna<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> time<00:01:09.420> where<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
think it's gonna be in a time where the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.890 
think it's gonna be in a time where the
force<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.400> regarded<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> myth<00:01:12.299> or

probably think there's no sip rally
beginning<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> movie<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.479> kind

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
beginning the movie it's like it's kind

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.780 
beginning the movie it's like it's kind
of<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.770> what's<00:01:38.220> what's<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> force

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
of just you know what's what's the force

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
of just you know what's what's the force
right<00:01:39.000> now<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
right now right so I think I think the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.920 
right now right so I think I think the
title<00:01:40.909> hints<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.060> kind<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> clean

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
title hints to kind of like a clean

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.810 
title hints to kind of like a clean
slate<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.710> movies<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> film<00:01:44.610> which

any more mixed feelings because there

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.150 
any more mixed feelings because there
were<00:06:05.690> some<00:06:05.780> cool<00:06:05.960> stuff<00:06:06.230> that<00:06:06.470> they<00:06:06.860> had<00:06:07.010> with

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
were some cool stuff that they had with

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.220 
were some cool stuff that they had with
that<00:06:07.310> I<00:06:07.520> know<00:06:08.000> they<00:06:08.240> had<00:06:08.570> the<00:06:08.660> air<00:06:08.780> the<00:06:08.930> Empire

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
that I know they had the air the Empire

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.380 
that I know they had the air the Empire
and<00:06:09.410> the<00:06:09.470> Thrawn<00:06:09.740> Trilogy<00:06:09.860> and<00:06:10.520> not<00:06:11.210> that<00:06:11.330> you

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
and the Thrawn Trilogy and not that you

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.760 
and the Thrawn Trilogy and not that you
expect<00:06:11.720> that<00:06:11.810> to<00:06:11.870> be<00:06:12.050> these<00:06:12.140> movies<00:06:12.530> but<00:06:12.680> if

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
expect that to be these movies but if

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.870 
expect that to be these movies but if
they<00:06:12.920> were<00:06:12.980> I<00:06:13.130> think<00:06:13.280> people<00:06:13.610> would<00:06:13.670> have<00:06:13.790> been

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
they were I think people would have been

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.160 
they were I think people would have been
juiced<00:06:14.090> for<00:06:14.330> that<00:06:14.420> because<00:06:14.690> those<00:06:14.810> were

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
juiced for that because those were

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.020 
juiced for that because those were
really<00:06:15.560> highly<00:06:15.980> regarded<00:06:16.370> in<00:06:16.460> the<00:06:16.520> 90s<00:06:16.910> as

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
really highly regarded in the 90s as

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.790 
really highly regarded in the 90s as
good<00:06:17.570> books<00:06:17.810> I<00:06:17.990> feel<00:06:18.200> like<00:06:18.350> we've<00:06:18.530> discussed

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.290 
good books I feel like we've discussed
this<00:06:19.070> before<00:06:19.130> maybe<00:06:19.580> not<00:06:19.760> on<00:06:19.880> here<00:06:20.120> but

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.300 
this before maybe not on here but
personally<00:06:20.810> my<00:06:21.320> whole<00:06:21.500> thing<00:06:21.710> with<00:06:21.830> that<00:06:21.980> is<00:06:22.160> I

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
personally my whole thing with that is I

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.370 
personally my whole thing with that is I
understand<00:06:22.880> but<00:06:23.510> we<00:06:23.840> are<00:06:23.990> getting<00:06:24.110> to<00:06:24.350> the

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
understand but we are getting to the

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.770 
understand but we are getting to the
point<00:06:24.470> where<00:06:25.010> the<00:06:25.490> people<00:06:25.790> who<00:06:26.000> really<00:06:26.600> care

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
point where the people who really care

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.840 
point where the people who really care
about<00:06:27.170> that<00:06:27.320> stuff<00:06:27.830> are<00:06:28.070> not<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.610> target

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850

Katarn<00:06:55.689> from<00:06:56.050> the<00:06:56.169> from<00:06:56.349> the<00:06:56.409> dark<00:06:56.620> forces

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
Katarn from the from the dark forces

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.920 
Katarn from the from the dark forces
video<00:06:57.580> games<00:06:57.789> and<00:06:57.939> that<00:06:57.969> was<00:06:58.180> always<00:06:58.389> sort<00:06:58.779> of

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
video games and that was always sort of

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.929 
video games and that was always sort of
kind<00:06:59.620> of<00:06:59.770> cannon<00:07:00.099> and<00:07:00.129> now<00:07:00.279> I<00:07:00.310> guess<00:07:00.490> it's<00:07:00.789> not

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:00.939 
kind of cannon and now I guess it's not

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:02.820 
kind of cannon and now I guess it's not
know<00:07:01.389> that<00:07:01.509> was<00:07:01.719> supposed<00:07:02.229> to<00:07:02.319> be<00:07:02.469> totally

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
know that was supposed to be totally

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.679 
know that was supposed to be totally
canon<00:07:03.189> he<00:07:03.400> was<00:07:03.490> a<00:07:03.550> guy<00:07:03.669> that<00:07:03.699> personally<00:07:04.539> got

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:04.689 
canon he was a guy that personally got

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:06.989 
canon he was a guy that personally got
the<00:07:04.810> death<00:07:05.020> star<00:07:05.259> plans<00:07:05.340> you<00:07:06.340> know<00:07:06.460> he<00:07:06.759> you

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:06.999 
the death star plans you know he you

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:08.820 
the death star plans you know he you
know<00:07:07.090> he<00:07:07.240> existed<00:07:07.810> in<00:07:07.930> that<00:07:08.050> universe<00:07:08.469> he<00:07:08.680> was

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
know he existed in that universe he was

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.279 
know he existed in that universe he was
in<00:07:09.009> you<00:07:09.550> know<00:07:09.639> he<00:07:10.569> wasn't<00:07:10.749> in<00:07:10.930> shadows<00:07:11.169> of<00:07:11.229> the

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:11.289 
in you know he wasn't in shadows of the

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:12.779 
in you know he wasn't in shadows of the
empire<00:07:11.560> but<00:07:11.710> he<00:07:11.860> was<00:07:11.979> always<00:07:12.219> around<00:07:12.339> Kyle

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:12.789 
empire but he was always around Kyle

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:14.399 
empire but he was always around Kyle
Katarn<00:07:12.999> and<00:07:13.569> I<00:07:13.629> guess<00:07:13.749> shadows<00:07:14.020> Empire<00:07:14.289> isn't

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:14.409 
Katarn and I guess shadows Empire isn't

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:15.540 
Katarn and I guess shadows Empire isn't
there<00:07:14.560> anymore<00:07:14.740> either<00:07:15.039> but<00:07:15.219> that<00:07:15.310> was<00:07:15.400> always

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
there anymore either but that was always

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.070 
there anymore either but that was always
kind<00:07:15.699> of<00:07:15.729> a<00:07:15.789> weird<00:07:16.029> sort<00:07:16.210> of<00:07:16.270> thing<00:07:16.479> anyway

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
kind of a weird sort of thing anyway

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.140 
kind of a weird sort of thing anyway
shadows<00:07:17.529> the<00:07:17.650> Empire<00:07:17.919> but<00:07:18.249> now<00:07:18.370> you<00:07:18.430> got<00:07:18.999> video

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
shadows the Empire but now you got video

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.219 
shadows the Empire but now you got video
games<00:07:19.360> that<00:07:19.449> aren't<00:07:19.599> can<00:07:19.810> anywhere<00:07:20.139> we're
