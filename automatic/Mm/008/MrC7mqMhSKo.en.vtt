or earthling so really interesting to

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.330 
or earthling so really interesting to
like<00:03:40.870> how<00:03:40.989> it's<00:03:41.170> playing<00:03:41.410> out<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.980> pretty

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
like how it's playing out and pretty

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.160 
like how it's playing out and pretty
much<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.700> have<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.880> lot<00:03:43.209> of<00:03:43.239> behind-the-scenes

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
much you have a lot of behind-the-scenes

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.870 
much you have a lot of behind-the-scenes
manipulation<00:03:45.070> that's<00:03:45.220> really<00:03:45.519> getting<00:03:45.760> me

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
manipulation that's really getting me

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.610 
manipulation that's really getting me
entertained<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.930> big<00:03:47.080> thing<00:03:47.110> here<00:03:47.290> is

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
entertained and the big thing here is

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.110 
entertained and the big thing here is
will<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.890> King<00:03:48.100> ever<00:03:48.280> realized<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:48.970> his

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
will the King ever realized that his

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.400 
will the King ever realized that his
daughters<00:03:49.570> alive<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:49.840> wonder<00:03:50.140> what<00:03:50.290> would

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
daughters alive I wonder what would

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.320 
daughters alive I wonder what would
happen<00:03:50.590> if<00:03:50.799> he<00:03:50.920> realized<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.519> his<00:03:52.030> daughter

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
happen if he realized that his daughter

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.699 
happen if he realized that his daughter
is<00:03:52.510> alive<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:52.750> he's<00:03:52.930> still<00:03:53.200> bombing<00:03:53.620> the

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
is alive and he's still bombing the

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.250 
is alive and he's still bombing the
 plan<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.340> mean<00:03:54.519> what<00:03:55.150> if<00:03:55.360> this<00:03:55.959> isn't

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
 plan I mean what if this isn't

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.860 
 plan I mean what if this isn't
what<00:03:56.500> if<00:03:56.650> what<00:03:57.010> if<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.970> know<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.420> princess

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
what if what if you know the princess

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.259 
what if what if you know the princess
dies<00:03:59.170> because<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.340> king<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.760> then<00:04:01.060> he

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
dies because of the king and then he

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.319 
dies because of the king and then he
finds<00:04:01.570> out<00:04:01.840> later<00:04:02.140> on<00:04:02.500> oh<00:04:02.860> my<00:04:03.640> god<00:04:03.910> that<00:04:04.239> would

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
finds out later on oh my god that would

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.240 
finds out later on oh my god that would
be<00:04:04.360> so<00:04:04.420> freaking<00:04:05.049> tragic<00:04:05.500> honestly<00:04:06.040> at<00:04:06.220> this

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
be so freaking tragic honestly at this

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.539 
be so freaking tragic honestly at this
standpoint<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.900> really<00:04:08.230> can't<00:04:08.560> blame<00:04:08.829> the

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
standpoint you really can't blame the

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.340 
standpoint you really can't blame the
King<00:04:09.820> for<00:04:10.150> his<00:04:10.180> action<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:10.840> let's<00:04:10.989> think<00:04:11.260> about

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
King for his action so let's think about

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.310 
King for his action so let's think about
this<00:04:11.650> logically<00:04:12.130> okay<00:04:12.489> if<00:04:12.760> your<00:04:13.420> sister<00:04:13.959> your

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
this logically okay if your sister your

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.800 
this logically okay if your sister your
daughter<00:04:14.650> someone<00:04:15.459> was<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.730> get<00:04:15.910> killed<00:04:16.209> okay

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
daughter someone was to get killed okay

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.430 
daughter someone was to get killed okay

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
and she got slaughtered and literally

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.599 
and she got slaughtered and literally
out<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.680> nowhere<00:04:20.919> like<00:04:21.099> you

out of nowhere like you
they're<00:04:21.819> for<00:04:22.030> peace<00:04:22.300> but<00:04:22.629> you've<00:04:22.780> got<00:04:22.990> you

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
logical choice of human actions we would

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.779 
logical choice of human actions we would
do<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.629> so<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:35.229> actually<00:04:35.710> have<00:04:36.069> to<00:04:36.189> compliment

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
watchful he's attacking her even though

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.559

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
we know earth is in the right

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.119 
we know earth is in the right
technically<00:05:01.569> the<00:05:01.990> Martian<00:05:02.379> king<00:05:02.590> is<00:05:02.770> in<00:05:02.889> Iran

technically the Martian king is in Iran

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.149 
technically the Martian king is in Iran
to<00:05:03.460> since<00:05:04.150> he<00:05:04.599> really<00:05:05.259> believes<00:05:05.620> his<00:05:05.919> daughter

got<00:05:06.460> assassinated<00:05:07.060> by<00:05:07.330> Earthlings<00:05:07.900> so<00:05:08.199> you

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
got assassinated by Earthlings so you

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.499 
got assassinated by Earthlings so you
have<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:08.949> think<00:05:08.979> about<00:05:09.250> this<00:05:09.460> from<00:05:09.610> his<00:05:10.000> point

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
have to think about this from his point

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.529 
have to think about this from his point
of<00:05:10.689> view<00:05:10.840> but<00:05:11.830> at<00:05:12.099> the<00:05:12.250> same<00:05:12.490> time<00:05:12.819> and<00:05:13.270> it's

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
of view but at the same time and it's

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:14.790 
of view but at the same time and it's
going<00:05:13.629> to<00:05:13.689> be<00:05:13.779> tragic<00:05:14.110> when<00:05:14.169> he<00:05:14.289> finds<00:05:14.529> out

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
going to be tragic when he finds out

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.709 
going to be tragic when he finds out
that<00:05:15.129> the<00:05:15.400> Earthlings<00:05:16.029> didn't<00:05:16.300> do<00:05:16.389> this<00:05:16.539> but

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
that the Earthlings didn't do this but

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.209 
that the Earthlings didn't do this but
it<00:05:16.810> was<00:05:16.900> his<00:05:17.020> home<00:05:17.169> people<00:05:17.560> he's<00:05:17.770> definitely

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
it was his home people he's definitely

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:21.749 
it was his home people he's definitely
going<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.430> be<00:05:18.520> very<00:05:19.210> upset<00:05:19.870> now<00:05:20.590> also<00:05:21.099> with

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
going to be very upset now also with

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.730 
going to be very upset now also with
this<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:22.180> seems<00:05:22.360> like<00:05:22.599> slain<00:05:23.020> is<00:05:23.349> going<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.650> be

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
this it seems like slain is going to be

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.800 
this it seems like slain is going to be
sentenced<00:05:24.099> to<00:05:24.219> death<00:05:24.340> very<00:05:25.000> soon<00:05:25.330> because<00:05:25.539> now

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
sentenced to death very soon because now

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.450 
sentenced to death very soon because now
the<00:05:25.870> King<00:05:26.169> believes<00:05:26.500> that<00:05:26.650> splains<00:05:26.860> an<00:05:27.129> enemy

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
the King believes that splains an enemy

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.920 
the King believes that splains an enemy
and<00:05:27.789> then<00:05:27.969> you<00:05:28.060> have<00:05:28.240> you<00:05:28.360> know<00:05:28.449> the<00:05:28.599> orbital

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
and then you have you know the orbital

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.149 
and then you have you know the orbital
knots<00:05:29.080> probably<00:05:29.409> gonna<00:05:29.500> find<00:05:29.800> out<00:05:29.949> next

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
knots probably gonna find out next

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.279 
knots probably gonna find out next
episode<00:05:30.729> and<00:05:31.000> so<00:05:31.270> those<00:05:31.360> slain<00:05:31.690> is<00:05:31.990> probably

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
episode and so those slain is probably

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.529 
episode and so those slain is probably
going<00:05:32.469> to<00:05:32.589> be<00:05:32.770> killed<00:05:33.159> or<00:05:33.400> he's<00:05:34.120> going<00:05:34.330> to<00:05:34.449> have

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
going to be killed or he's going to have

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:35.909 
going to be killed or he's going to have
to<00:05:34.569> escape<00:05:34.839> to<00:05:35.110> the<00:05:35.139> arc<00:05:35.319> length<00:05:35.379> which<00:05:35.800> I've

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
to escape to the arc length which I've

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.230 
to escape to the arc length which I've
already<00:05:35.949> Fury's<00:05:36.400> day<00:05:36.580> couple<00:05:36.849> times<00:05:37.029> in<00:05:37.120> a

also<00:05:39.039> talked<00:05:39.310> about<00:05:39.430> it<00:05:39.759> so<00:05:39.969> it's<00:05:40.210> less<00:05:40.659> obably

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
also talked about it so it's less obably
