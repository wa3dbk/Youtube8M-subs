a couple those had no real use for him
started<00:01:29.310> using<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> them<00:01:30.060> as<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> backing

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
started using one of them as a backing

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.449 
started using one of them as a backing
kind<00:01:31.109> of<00:01:31.170> almost<00:01:31.289> like<00:01:31.499> a<00:01:31.529> table<00:01:31.979> or<00:01:32.100> surface

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
kind of almost like a table or surface

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.209 
kind of almost like a table or surface
for<00:01:32.639> spray-painting<00:01:33.179> and<00:01:33.709> as<00:01:34.709> I<00:01:34.859> did<00:01:35.039> that<00:01:35.069> I

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
for spray-painting and as I did that I

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.129 
for spray-painting and as I did that I
said<00:01:35.429> to<00:01:35.459> myself<00:01:35.609> you<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.840> hides

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:37.139 
said to myself you know what this hides

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:40.190 
said to myself you know what this hides
the<00:01:37.349> fogging<00:01:37.859> factor<00:01:38.479> it's<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.749> fogging

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the fogging factor it's kind of fogging

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.879 
the fogging factor it's kind of fogging
cool<00:01:41.060> terrible<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.619> looks<00:01:43.619> kind<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:43.889 
cool terrible and looks kind of

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:45.620 
cool terrible and looks kind of
interesting<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.939> started<00:01:45.119> using<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
interesting so I just started using a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.929 
interesting so I just started using a
little<00:01:45.840> bit<00:01:45.929> of<00:01:46.020> snow<00:01:46.349> stray<00:01:47.069> spray<00:01:47.579> paint
