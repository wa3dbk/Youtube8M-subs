be the spy every time

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160 
be the spy every time
Speight<00:00:47.160> spies<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.450> through<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.960> walls

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
Speight spies can see through the walls

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.439 
Speight spies can see through the walls
with<00:00:49.559> their<00:00:49.770> ghouls<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.760> nice<00:00:51.030> equipment

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
with their ghouls have nice equipment

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.840 
with their ghouls have nice equipment
which<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.110> really<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.340> blind<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
which I really have will to blind the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.410 
which I really have will to blind the
enemies<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:55.610> excuse<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> explosions

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
enemies or just excuse the explosions

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420 
enemies or just excuse the explosions
and<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.320> deadly<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.859> their<00:00:59.070> melee

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and they are deadly with their melee

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.360 
and they are deadly with their melee
skills<00:00:59.840> don't<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> mercenary<00:01:01.440> mercs<00:01:02.039> are

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
skills don't be a mercenary mercs are

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.369 
skills don't be a mercenary mercs are
usually<00:01:02.820> tough<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.809> right<00:01:03.989> equipment

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
usually tough with the right equipment

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
usually tough with the right equipment
but<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.339> use<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.510> being

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
but you can use it if you are being

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.940 
but you can use it if you are being
stabbed<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> face

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
stabbed in the face

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.090 
stabbed in the face
so<00:01:08.640> mark<00:01:09.510> marks<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:10.830> through<00:01:11.070> walls

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
so mark marks can see through walls

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.310 
so mark marks can see through walls
maybe<00:01:11.850> they<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.330> track<00:01:12.570> their<00:01:12.780> opponents

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
maybe they can track their opponents

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.530 
maybe they can track their opponents
with<00:01:13.500> motion<00:01:13.890> detectors<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
with motion detectors but it can be a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.130 
with motion detectors but it can be a
trap

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
trap

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.990 
trap
so<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> spy<00:01:16.950> every<00:01:17.310> time<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.790> team

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
so be the spy every time in team

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.179 
so be the spy every time in team
deathmatch<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.320> most<00:01:19.500> important<00:01:20.130> thing

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189

are using your spies vs mercs blacklist

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.999 
are using your spies vs mercs blacklist
class<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.369> would<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:36.119> bad<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.200> tried<00:01:37.770> it

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
class it would be really bad I tried it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.069 
class it would be really bad I tried it
five<00:01:38.369> or<00:01:38.400> six<00:01:38.850> times<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> won't<00:01:39.869> help

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
five or six times but it won't help

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.140 
five or six times but it won't help
wrong<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.829> made<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> class<00:01:41.430> designed<00:01:41.729> for

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
wrong so I made a class designed for

doing UMP for alternative submachine

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.420 
doing UMP for alternative submachine
weapons<00:03:43.049> because<00:03:44.049> they<00:03:44.260> are<00:03:44.410> strong<00:03:45.720> if<00:03:46.720> you

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
weapons because they are strong if you

cannot aim very well I will come and
shoot<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.739> ump45<00:03:52.739> because<00:03:53.739> it's<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.730> most

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
shoot the ump45 because it's the most

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.089 
shoot the ump45 because it's the most

accurate weapon in the game and it's

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.740 
accurate weapon in the game and it's
strong<00:03:57.760> enough<00:03:57.790> for<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:59.400> these<00:04:00.750> close-range

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
strong enough for the these close-range

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.949 
strong enough for the these close-range
fighters<00:04:02.380> I<00:04:02.650> recommend

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
fighters I recommend

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.370 
fighters I recommend
sc4000<00:04:04.959> s<00:04:05.170> it's<00:04:05.560> it's<00:04:06.190> really

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
sc4000 s it's it's really

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.870 
sc4000 s it's it's really
inaccurate<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.880> can<00:04:10.540> cause<00:04:11.350> problems<00:04:11.880> the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
inaccurate and it can cause problems the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.170 
inaccurate and it can cause problems the
vector<00:04:13.240> is<00:04:13.680> between<00:04:14.680> them<00:04:14.980> so<00:04:15.430> it's<00:04:15.910> good<00:04:16.150> for

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
vector is between them so it's good for

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.520 
vector is between them so it's good for
long<00:04:16.690> ranges<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.799> close<00:04:18.160> ranges<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:19.350> for<00:04:20.350> the

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
long ranges and close ranges to for the

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.150 
long ranges and close ranges to for the
pistols<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.370> recommend<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.150> only<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:23.620> SI<00:04:24.100> see
