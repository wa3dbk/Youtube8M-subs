goes only to the person who runs the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.710 
goes only to the person who runs the
factory<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.850> you'll<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.240> play<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.540> one

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
factory so you'll see if I play this one

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.960 
factory so you'll see if I play this one
out<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:43.020> generates<00:01:43.409> plus<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:43.979> card<00:01:44.310> and

will be level two not if I have eight
cards<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:33.840> level<00:02:34.080> eight<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:34.860> essentially

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
cards it's level eight but essentially

if it's over level three you're going to
pay<00:02:42.000> more<00:02:42.390> money<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.260> let's<00:02:43.470> say<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.890> green

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
pay more money so let's say that green

pay more money so let's say that green
had<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> level<00:02:44.730> three<00:02:45.030> stock<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.569> wanted<00:02:45.810> to

buy I would have some money maybe on my

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.820 
buy I would have some money maybe on my
turn<00:02:48.239> I'd<00:02:48.450> pay<00:02:48.690> three<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.110> back<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.530> buy<00:02:49.620> a

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
turn I'd pay three of it back and buy a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.070 
turn I'd pay three of it back and buy a
green<00:02:50.100> stock<00:02:50.459> when<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.269> do<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.900> will<00:02:51.989> get

any<00:03:00.030> money<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.360> you're<00:03:00.480> not<00:03:00.600> going<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.840> be

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
any money so you're not going to be

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.410 
any money so you're not going to be
doing<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.170> right<00:03:01.350> away<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:02.370> can<00:03:02.549> also<00:03:02.730> sell

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
doing that right away you can also sell

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.449 
doing that right away you can also sell
stocks<00:03:03.840> when<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.560> sell<00:03:04.799> stocks<00:03:05.100> you're<00:03:05.280> going

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
stocks when you sell stocks you're going

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.979 
stocks when you sell stocks you're going
to<00:03:05.549> sell<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> stock<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.299> any<00:03:06.450> color<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.900> you're

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
to sell a stock of any color and you're

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.570 
to sell a stock of any color and you're
going<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.290> get<00:03:07.470> its<00:03:07.680> current<00:03:08.010> development

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
going to get its current development

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.850 
going to get its current development
level<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.970> terms<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.299> money<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.470> had<00:03:10.650> that

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
level in terms of money so if I had that

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.410 
level in terms of money so if I had that
green<00:03:11.069> stock<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.519> dreamless<00:03:11.760> level<00:03:12.060> 3<00:03:12.239> i'd

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
green stock and dreamless level 3 i'd

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.320 
green stock and dreamless level 3 i'd
sell<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.780> back<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.319> i<00:03:14.010> would<00:03:14.549> get<00:03:14.760> 3<00:03:15.120> money

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
sell it back and i would get 3 money

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330 
sell it back and i would get 3 money
again<00:03:16.140> you're<00:03:16.709> probably<00:03:16.860> not<00:03:17.069> going<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.250> want

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
again you're probably not going to want

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.470 
again you're probably not going to want
to<00:03:17.459> sell<00:03:17.580> your<00:03:17.730> stocks<00:03:17.970> right<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.269> beginning

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
to sell your stocks right the beginning

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.180 
to sell your stocks right the beginning
of<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.660> game<00:03:18.780> but<00:03:19.170> if<00:03:19.410> this<00:03:19.620> happens<00:03:20.010> whoever

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
of the game but if this happens whoever

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.789 
of the game but if this happens whoever
owns<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.820> factory<00:03:21.390> must<00:03:21.810> then<00:03:22.019> discard<00:03:22.709> a

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
owns that factory must then discard a

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.310 
owns that factory must then discard a
card<00:03:22.829> from<00:03:23.220> their<00:03:23.459> hand<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:24.000> they<00:03:24.780> don't<00:03:25.019> have

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
card from their hand if they don't have

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.660 
card from their hand if they don't have
any<00:03:25.590> cards<00:03:25.829> in<00:03:25.980> their<00:03:26.100> hand<00:03:26.130> they<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:26.519> to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
any cards in their hand they have to

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.060 
any cards in their hand they have to
discard<00:03:27.060> one<00:03:27.329> of<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.570> levels<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.989> their<00:03:28.650> stock

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
discard one of the levels of their stock

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.640 
discard one of the levels of their stock
so<00:03:29.430> they're<00:03:29.880> their<00:03:30.359> actual<00:03:30.780> stock<00:03:31.049> value<00:03:31.440> will

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
so they're their actual stock value will

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.319 
so they're their actual stock value will
decrease<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:32.370> they<00:03:32.459> don't<00:03:32.640> have<00:03:32.820> cards<00:03:33.180> in

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
decrease if they don't have cards in

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.259 
decrease if they don't have cards in
hand<00:03:33.540> at<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.870> time<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.670> third<00:03:35.910> thing<00:03:35.940> you

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
hand at that time the third thing you

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.819 
hand at that time the third thing you
can<00:03:36.420> do<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.630> run<00:03:36.840> your<00:03:36.870> factory<00:03:37.440> now<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.620> begin

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
can do is run your factory now to begin

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:38.750 
can do is run your factory now to begin
to<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.100> game<00:03:38.250> since<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.579> have<00:03:38.730> no

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
to the game since you have no

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.280 
to the game since you have no
developments<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.510> your<00:03:39.600> factory<00:03:39.810> there's<00:03:40.200> no

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
developments in your factory there's no

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.870 
developments in your factory there's no
point<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:40.560> running<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:41.370> once<00:03:41.549> you<00:03:41.670> get<00:03:41.760> these

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
point in running but once you get these

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.610 
point in running but once you get these
developments<00:03:42.329> as<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.630> said<00:03:42.840> earlier<00:03:42.870> you'll

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
developments as I said earlier you'll

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.080 
developments as I said earlier you'll
have<00:03:43.799> them<00:03:44.010> out<00:03:44.130> let's<00:03:44.340> say<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.519> have<00:03:44.609> these<00:03:44.850> I

have them out let's say I have these I
have<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.239> level<00:03:45.420> two<00:03:45.780> factory<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.950> would<00:03:47.100> run

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
have a level two factory and I would run

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.770 
have a level two factory and I would run
it<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.459> for<00:03:47.790> each<00:03:47.910> share<00:03:48.150> i<00:03:48.180> have<00:03:48.450> i'm<00:03:48.600> going

to get to money and everyone else who
own<00:03:50.850> share<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.630> shares<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.350> my<00:03:52.500> factory<00:03:53.100> will

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
own share it shares in my factory will

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.949 
own share it shares in my factory will
get<00:03:53.579> to<00:03:53.730> money<00:03:53.910> per<00:03:54.120> share<00:03:54.329> they<00:03:54.510> own<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.870> I'm

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
get to money per share they own so I'm

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.390 
get to money per share they own so I'm
gonna<00:03:55.079> get<00:03:55.230> for<00:03:55.440> money<00:03:55.650> for<00:03:55.709> running<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.160> and

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
gonna get for money for running this and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.250 
gonna get for money for running this and
I<00:03:56.760> will<00:03:56.940> draw<00:03:57.120> one<00:03:57.359> card<00:03:57.390> adding<00:03:58.019> it<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.140> my

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
I will draw one card adding it to my

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.280 
I will draw one card adding it to my
development<00:03:58.799> card<00:03:59.130> hand<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.900> that's<00:04:01.079> how<00:04:01.230> you

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
development card hand so that's how you

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.110 
development card hand so that's how you
generate<00:04:01.680> money<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.519> this<00:04:02.609> case<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.970> would

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
generate money so in this case I would

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.759 
generate money so in this case I would
get<00:04:03.299> for<00:04:03.569> money<00:04:03.900> if<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.170> were<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.410> run<00:04:04.590> my

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
get for money if I were to run my

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.990 
get for money if I were to run my
factory<00:04:06.470> again<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.769> can<00:04:07.799> do<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.310> thing<00:04:08.760> called

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
factory again you can do a thing called

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.610 
factory again you can do a thing called
selling<00:04:09.450> resources<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:10.109> as<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.350> get<00:04:10.500> these

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
selling resources so as you get these

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.930 
selling resources so as you get these
cards<00:04:10.980> in<00:04:11.069> hand<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.340> you'll<00:04:11.459> get<00:04:11.609> more<00:04:11.790> and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
cards in hand and you'll get more and

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.490 
cards in hand and you'll get more and
more<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.150> these<00:04:12.359> cards<00:04:12.780> as<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:12.989> increase<00:04:13.260> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
more of these cards as you increase the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.809 
more of these cards as you increase the
levels<00:04:13.799> of<00:04:13.859> your<00:04:14.010> factory<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.519> run<00:04:14.670> them

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
levels of your factory and run them

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.310 
levels of your factory and run them
sometimes<00:04:15.299> you'll<00:04:15.480> draw<00:04:15.660> even<00:04:15.870> like<00:04:16.109> five

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
sometimes you'll draw even like five

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.949 
sometimes you'll draw even like five
cards<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:17.340> can<00:04:17.519> trade<00:04:17.789> three<00:04:18.209> cards<00:04:18.600> in<00:04:18.720> from

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
cards you can trade three cards in from

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.990 
cards you can trade three cards in from
your<00:04:19.079> hand<00:04:19.350> in<00:04:19.560> order<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.190> get<00:04:20.310> ten<00:04:20.579> dollars

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
your hand in order to get ten dollars

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.779 
your hand in order to get ten dollars
now<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.109> way<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.590> basically<00:04:23.280> trade<00:04:23.640> in

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
now this is a way to basically trade in

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.700

stock value is going to be its
development<00:05:27.780> level<00:05:27.930> so<00:05:28.200> if<00:05:28.290> this<00:05:28.410> was<00:05:28.560> level<00:05:28.860> 5

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
development level so if this was level 5

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.490 
development level so if this was level 5
because<00:05:30.180> that's<00:05:30.360> five<00:05:30.600> cards<00:05:30.990> next<00:05:31.200> to<00:05:31.380> it

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
because that's five cards next to it

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.440 
because that's five cards next to it
it's<00:05:31.890> going<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.130> be<00:05:32.250> five<00:05:32.580> per<00:05:33.030> each<00:05:33.210> one<00:05:33.419> of

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
it's going to be five per each one of

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.880 
it's going to be five per each one of
these<00:05:33.630> shares<00:05:33.930> which<00:05:34.110> gives<00:05:34.290> me<00:05:34.410> 10<00:05:34.650> more

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
these shares which gives me 10 more

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.830 
these shares which gives me 10 more
dollars<00:05:35.100> I'd<00:05:35.850> also<00:05:36.060> get<00:05:36.360> money<00:05:36.510> for<00:05:36.690> each

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
dollars I'd also get money for each

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.540 
dollars I'd also get money for each
other<00:05:37.080> person's<00:05:37.530> value<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:37.979> stock<00:05:38.220> so<00:05:38.400> if<00:05:38.460> I

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
other person's value of stock so if I

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.860 
other person's value of stock so if I

is<00:06:10.410> as<00:06:11.280> I<00:06:11.340> said<00:06:11.669> very<00:06:11.970> simple<00:06:12.510> you're<00:06:12.660> going<00:06:12.840> to

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
is as I said very simple you're going to

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.300 
is as I said very simple you're going to
be<00:06:12.990> operating<00:06:13.440> that<00:06:13.530> Factory<00:06:13.979> you<00:06:14.070> really

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
be operating that Factory you really

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.310 
be operating that Factory you really
only<00:06:14.430> have<00:06:14.520> five<00:06:14.910> action<00:06:15.450> choices<00:06:15.870> and<00:06:15.990> taking

only have five action choices and taking
those<00:06:16.470> choices<00:06:16.770> is<00:06:17.520> oftentimes<00:06:18.000> relatively

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
those choices is oftentimes relatively

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.110 
those choices is oftentimes relatively
obvious<00:06:19.080> the<00:06:19.229> best<00:06:19.500> thing<00:06:19.710> to<00:06:19.830> do<00:06:20.010> is<00:06:20.250> to<00:06:20.520> trade

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
obvious the best thing to do is to trade

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.909
