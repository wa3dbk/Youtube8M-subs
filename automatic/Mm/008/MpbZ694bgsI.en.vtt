00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
and it's just this foil right here so

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.779 
and it's just this foil right here so
that's<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.170> an<00:01:01.379> example<00:01:01.489> this<00:01:02.489> actually

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that's just an example this actually

gecko TIG actually doesn't eat very much

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.380 
gecko TIG actually doesn't eat very much
for<00:01:32.880> paschi<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.790> kind<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.090> worrying

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
for paschi so it was kind of worrying

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
for paschi so it was kind of worrying
but<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.170> actually<00:01:37.439> notice<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.189> she's

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
but now I can actually notice that she's

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.460 
but now I can actually notice that she's
readily<00:01:39.299> eating<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.200> there's<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
readily eating this like there's a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.530 
readily eating this like there's a
noticeable<00:01:40.680> amount<00:01:41.100> gone<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.360> recommend

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
noticeable amount gone so I do recommend

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.440 
noticeable amount gone so I do recommend

that's for the Pangaea specifically I
know<00:02:57.570> repast<00:02:57.990> these<00:02:58.170> two<00:02:58.380> parts<00:02:58.680> water<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.190> one

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
know repast these two parts water to one

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.880 
know repast these two parts water to one
part<00:02:59.700> food<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.750> just<00:03:01.110> look<00:03:01.290> at<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> bag<00:03:01.650> and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
part food so just look at the bag and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.440 
part food so just look at the bag and
you<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.130> have<00:03:02.640> an<00:03:02.760> idea<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.090> where<00:03:03.360> you're

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
you can have an idea of where you're

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.660 
you can have an idea of where you're
going<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.630> need<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.900> be<00:03:04.050> at<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.370> get<00:03:05.490> that

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
going to need to be at we can get that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.280 
going to need to be at we can get that
out<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> way<00:03:06.030> now<00:03:06.690> if<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.930> want<00:03:07.170> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
out of the way now if you want to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.170 
out of the way now if you want to
measure<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.770> certainly<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:10.820> just<00:03:11.820> dump<00:03:12.060> it

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
measure you certainly can just dump it

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.590 
measure you certainly can just dump it
in<00:03:12.300> there<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:13.940> I've<00:03:14.940> done<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.270> so<00:03:15.360> many<00:03:15.420> times

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
in there but I've done it so many times

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.380 
in there but I've done it so many times
that<00:03:15.930> generally<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.740> just<00:03:16.950> add<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.970> an<00:03:18.120> amount

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
that generally can just add in an amount

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.110 
that generally can just add in an amount
of<00:03:18.600> water<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.140> get<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.220> consistency<00:03:20.550> as<00:03:20.940> I'd

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
of water and get the consistency as I'd

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.820 
of water and get the consistency as I'd
like<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.990> don't<00:03:22.170> add<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.470> enough<00:03:22.800> water

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
like if you don't add in enough water

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.800 
like if you don't add in enough water
you<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.790> always<00:03:24.170> add<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:26.040> more<00:03:26.070> after<00:03:26.810> because

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
you can always add in more after because

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.270 
you can always add in more after because
you're<00:03:27.930> looking<00:03:28.200> for<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.620> kind<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.040> like

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
you're looking for it to be kind of like

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.750 
you're looking for it to be kind of like
a<00:03:29.750> milkshake<00:03:30.770> consistency<00:03:31.770> like<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.610> don't

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
looks like right now i do recommend you

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.670 
looks like right now i do recommend you
leave<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.240> for<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.690> couple<00:03:45.900> minutes<00:03:46.170> just<00:03:46.440> to

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
leave it for a couple minutes just to

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.280 
leave it for a couple minutes just to
solidify<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.340> finally<00:03:47.730> get<00:03:47.990> to<00:03:48.990> the<00:03:49.110> point

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
solidify and finally get to the point

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.990 
solidify and finally get to the point
where<00:03:49.470> it's<00:03:49.620> absorb<00:03:49.950> most<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.459> water<00:03:50.670> and

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
where it's absorb most of the water and

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.810 
where it's absorb most of the water and
then<00:03:51.660> add<00:03:52.080> more<00:03:52.410> because<00:03:52.740> generally<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.670> will

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
then add more because generally it will

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.270 
then add more because generally it will
harden<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:54.270> past<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.810> point<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.280> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
harden up past the point of the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.280 
harden up past the point of the
consistency<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.000> you'd<00:03:57.270> like<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.170> do

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
consistency that you'd like so I do

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.630 
consistency that you'd like so I do

recommend just leaving it for a little

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.190 
recommend just leaving it for a little
bit<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.000> coming<00:04:00.510> back<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.870> adding<00:04:01.170> a
