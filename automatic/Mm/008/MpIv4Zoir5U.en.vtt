00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
mentioned here using the httpd any

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.710 
mentioned here using the httpd any
script<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.640> he<00:02:46.150> was<00:02:46.269> correct<00:02:46.540> about

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
script and and he was correct about

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.860 
script and and he was correct about
Linux<00:02:47.410> being<00:02:47.920> at<00:02:48.069> HT<00:02:48.940> Access<00:02:49.269> file<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.630> let<00:02:49.810> me

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
Linux being at HT Access file so let me

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.819 
Linux being at HT Access file so let me
show<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.049> that<00:02:50.290> file<00:02:52.319> now<00:02:53.319> this<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.680> very

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
show you that file now this is very

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.620 
show you that file now this is very

the<00:03:09.459> first<00:03:09.670> line<00:03:09.970> here<00:03:10.299> is<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:11.319> just<00:03:11.530> put<00:03:11.769> the

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
the first line here is I just put the

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.059 
the first line here is I just put the
comment<00:03:13.269> of<00:03:13.420> pound<00:03:13.750> sign<00:03:14.109> comments<00:03:14.590> out<00:03:14.920> of

comment of pound sign comments out of

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.680 
comment of pound sign comments out of
line<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.459> can<00:03:15.549> pound<00:03:16.000> sign<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.359> anywhere

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
line so you can pound sign it anywhere

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.690 
line so you can pound sign it anywhere
to<00:03:16.840> make<00:03:17.109> yourself<00:03:17.440> comments<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.250> keep<00:03:18.430> notes

and it won't process it the script won't
process<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:22.030> line<00:03:22.269> so<00:03:23.200> here<00:03:23.440> we<00:03:23.470> claim

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040

through seven now to make the rewrite

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.750 
through seven now to make the rewrite
condition<00:03:34.049> work<00:03:35.049> correctly<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.340> turn<00:03:36.579> the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
condition work correctly you turn the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.690 
condition work correctly you turn the
rewrite<00:03:37.060> engine<00:03:37.420> on<00:03:37.569> and<00:03:38.160> here<00:03:39.160> i<00:03:39.190> just<00:03:39.459> put<00:03:39.670> a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
rewrite engine on and here i just put a

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.330 
rewrite engine on and here i just put a
note<00:03:39.910> says<00:03:40.150> make<00:03:40.389> all<00:03:40.540> requests<00:03:41.139> have<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.590> WWE

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
note says make all requests have the WWE

note says make all requests have the WWE
in<00:03:42.639> them<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:45.459> here<00:03:45.940> is<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.269> condition<00:03:46.780> and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
in them so here is the condition and

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.830 
in them so here is the condition and
then<00:03:47.470> here<00:03:47.799> is<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:47.950> rewrite<00:03:48.819> rule<00:03:49.090> so<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.720> can

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
then here is the rewrite rule so you can

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.629 
then here is the rewrite rule so you can
see<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.170> condition<00:03:50.650> is<00:03:50.799> anything<00:03:51.220> in<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.400> web

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
see the condition is anything in the web

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.200 
see the condition is anything in the web
intersect<00:03:52.180> website

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.640 

on<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:56.680> server<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.670> any<00:03:58.600> page<00:03:58.990> that<00:03:59.020> happens

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
on that server and any page that happens

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.970 
on that server and any page that happens
to<00:04:00.010> be<00:04:00.240> navigated<00:04:01.240> to<00:04:01.270> if<00:04:01.630> the<00:04:03.180> www<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:05.530> missing

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
to be navigated to if the www is missing

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.710 
to be navigated to if the www is missing
then<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:07.150> gets<00:04:07.420> added<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.530> using<00:04:08.950> this

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
then it gets added to it using this

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.360 
then it gets added to it using this
little<00:04:10.720> file<00:04:10.990> and<00:04:11.260> this<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.770> how<00:04:11.920> you<00:04:11.980> make<00:04:12.190> the

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
little file and this is how you make the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.930 
little file and this is how you make the
file<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:12.820> go<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.740> like<00:04:14.740> notepad<00:04:15.100> or<00:04:15.610> something

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
file you go to like notepad or something

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.590 
file you go to like notepad or something
that's<00:04:16.480> just<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:16.870> very<00:04:17.140> basic<00:04:17.500> text<00:04:18.100> editor<00:04:18.600> or

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
that's just a very basic text editor or

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.620 
that's just a very basic text editor or
you<00:04:20.200> can<00:04:20.440> create<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.280> file<00:04:21.550> and<00:04:21.850> then<00:04:22.090> rename

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
you can create the file and then rename

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.420 
you can create the file and then rename
it<00:04:22.810> once<00:04:23.020> it's<00:04:23.230> on<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.530> server<00:04:23.770> using<00:04:24.310> your

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
it once it's on the server using your

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.300 
it once it's on the server using your
FTP<00:04:24.970> program<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:27.030> let's<00:04:28.030> see<00:04:29.010> let's<00:04:30.010> put<00:04:30.220> in

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
FTP program and let's see let's put in

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.080 
FTP program and let's see let's put in
that<00:04:30.430> code<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.190> would<00:04:33.460> just<00:04:33.670> take<00:04:33.850> this

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
that code so you would just take this

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.110 
that code so you would just take this
code<00:04:34.420> and<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:36.220> would<00:04:36.370> put<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.700> in<00:04:36.790> a<00:04:36.910> notepad

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
code and you would put it in a notepad

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.100 
code and you would put it in a notepad
file<00:04:37.770> where<00:04:38.770> is<00:04:38.950> that<00:04:40.500> give<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:41.620> all<00:04:41.740> this<00:04:41.950> crap

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
file where is that give it all this crap

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.190 
file where is that give it all this crap
is<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.920> notepad<00:04:45.340> file<00:04:45.610> untitled<00:04:46.480> so<00:04:46.630> far<00:04:46.900> and

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
is the notepad file untitled so far and

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.040 
is the notepad file untitled so far and
then<00:04:47.380> put<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.010> code<00:04:48.250> in<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:49.180> go<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.390> file<00:04:49.810> save

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
then put the code in you go to file save

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.750 
then put the code in you go to file save
as<00:04:50.890> let's<00:04:51.640> just<00:04:51.820> put<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.030> on<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.240> desktop<00:04:52.600> and

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
as let's just put it on a desktop and

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:01.020
