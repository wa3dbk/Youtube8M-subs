00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.250
 today I will teach you how I did the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.319
 custom cufflinks that were 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.480
 used by my fiancÃ© and the men of 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.010
 family at the wedding was a success 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.009
 total and I decided to share with 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.710
 You are very easy, you will need 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.779
 white glue is the normal liquid glue 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.060
 also need scissors 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.460
 any scissors you have to be 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.289
 easy to work a lot more paper 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.180
 cool I chose this map because the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.070
 decor was about travel and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 cufflinks that come with a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.960
 separate glass of fat holder 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.399
 for you to put your stamp on 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.790
 come on, because you will see that it is 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.010
 super easy you will get the paper to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.100
 photo finally the image you chose 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.530
 You will pass glue and you will paste. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.750
 author of the bottle lasts precisely 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.370
 where the image you want appears 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.500
 and you will repeat this in all 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.000
 computers that you have the coolest 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.930
 Is that you can put a photo of 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.010
 you 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.899
 a cool phrase and wants to know if my father 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 things that can get very 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.850
 cool in your arms and you're not drying up 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.909
 after you have insurance more or 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.130
 less so half an hour 40 minutes 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.860
 you will begin to trim each of the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.860
 The authors' squares are very simple 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.479
 and it's that simple it gets ready 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.939
 quickly 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.909
 now we just have to put our 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.979
 on the basis of hard struggle and for that 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.780
 We will also use you or 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.149
 anything that makes it easier to spread 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:47.110
 This glue for us to stick together. 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:48.850
 our prints have no difficulty in 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.159
 work with this type of material 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.069
 the cufflinks you find in house 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.920
 craftsmanship is in stores that sell 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:59.049
 enough things like for example 25 of 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.509
 March the big shopping centers you 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.000
 or even on the internet for 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.009
 example of eln the set on any site 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.079
 this type is very easy to find 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.829

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.349
