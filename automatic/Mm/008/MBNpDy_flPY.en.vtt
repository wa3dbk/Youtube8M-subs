00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
we have a lot of it the reason why corn

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.130 
we have a lot of it the reason why corn
is<00:00:02.730> being<00:00:02.970> used<00:00:03.149> right<00:00:03.300> now<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.810> that<00:00:03.929> there's

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
is being used right now is that there's

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.909 
is being used right now is that there's
a<00:00:04.200> surplus<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.950> it<00:00:05.270> and<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:06.660> it's<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.680> tail

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
a surplus of it and so it's a tail

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.280 
a surplus of it and so it's a tail
wagging<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.429> dog<00:00:08.550> right<00:00:09.030> now<00:00:09.290> alcohol

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
thinking of it as the main reason for

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.160 
thinking of it as the main reason for
farming<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.150> produce<00:00:18.330> energy<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.050> you'll

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
farming is to produce energy and you'll

farming is to produce energy and you'll
see<00:00:19.410> why<00:00:19.890> we're<00:00:20.100> going<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> turn<00:00:20.460> that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
see why we're going to turn that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that's what's getting alcohol out there

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.179 
that's what's getting alcohol out there
is<00:00:24.449> trying<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.900> something<00:00:25.140> with<00:00:25.410> something

little bit about making alcohol and the
carbon<00:00:59.850> dioxide<00:01:00.390> issue<00:01:01.789> back<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.300> we

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
carbon dioxide issue back and see we

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.080 
carbon dioxide issue back and see we
want<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:04.070> where<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> want<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.519> next<00:01:05.850> with

this now making alcohol is really

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.550 
this now making alcohol is really
mankind<00:01:11.970> second<00:01:12.360> oldest<00:01:12.659> profession<00:01:13.200> we're

mankind second oldest profession we're
talking<00:01:13.740> about<00:01:14.010> something<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.729> low-tech

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
talking about something that is low-tech

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.870 
talking about something that is low-tech
we<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:15.990> understand<00:01:16.560> how<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
we really understand how to do this it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.310 
we really understand how to do this it
doesn't<00:01:18.360> take<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.960> sophisticated

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
doesn't take really sophisticated

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.740 
doesn't take really sophisticated
equipment<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.400> pull<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> off<00:01:20.880> basically

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
equipment to pull it off basically

making<00:01:22.680> wine<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.340> been<00:01:23.460> something<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.450> know

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
making wine it's been something you know

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.630 
making wine it's been something you know
we've<00:01:24.689> been<00:01:24.720> doing<00:01:25.110> forever<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.710> making<00:01:26.070> you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
we've been doing forever and making you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460
