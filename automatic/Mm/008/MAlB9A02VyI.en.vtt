00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
what's up everybody's Johnny Candido of

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.690 
what's up everybody's Johnny Candido of
Candida<00:00:02.250> training<00:00:02.820> H<00:00:03.620> Q<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.859> know<00:00:05.460> this<00:00:05.609> will

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
Candida training H Q I know this will

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.760 
Candida training H Q I know this will
probably<00:00:05.879> be<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.120> controversial<00:00:06.750> video<00:00:07.080> but

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
probably be a controversial video but

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.950 
probably be a controversial video but
it's<00:00:07.919> on<00:00:08.040> why<00:00:08.220> don't<00:00:08.580> use<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> rpe<00:00:09.240> scale<00:00:09.630> for

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
it's on why don't use the rpe scale for

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.110 
it's on why don't use the rpe scale for
my<00:00:10.139> programming<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.130> for<00:00:11.639> those<00:00:11.759> who<00:00:11.940> aren't

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
my programming and for those who aren't

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.259 
my programming and for those who aren't
familiar<00:00:12.210> with<00:00:12.809> RPE<00:00:13.380> based<00:00:13.769> programs<00:00:14.429> what

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
familiar with RPE based programs what

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.200 
familiar with RPE based programs what
essentially<00:00:15.780> does<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:17.220> auto<00:00:17.609> regulates

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
essentially does is it auto regulates

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.349 
essentially does is it auto regulates
the<00:00:18.420> loading<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.990> use<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:20.130> your<00:00:20.340> sets<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the loading you use for your sets and it

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.390 
the loading you use for your sets and it
says<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.810> wanted<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.230> certain<00:00:22.500> difficulty<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
says you wanted a certain difficulty and

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.340 
says you wanted a certain difficulty and
then<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.880> go<00:00:24.060> off<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.269> how<00:00:24.630> difficult<00:00:25.230> you

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
then you go off of how difficult you

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.800 
then you go off of how difficult you
perceive<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.099> set<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.849> rather<00:00:27.510> than

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
perceive that set to be rather than

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.200 
perceive that set to be rather than
having<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.320> set<00:00:28.619> percentage<00:00:28.859> or<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.849> set

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
having a set percentage or a set

progression<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.170> was<00:00:31.380> already<00:00:31.830> determined

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
progression that was already determined

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.639 
progression that was already determined
before<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.000> workout<00:00:33.300> began<00:00:33.750> now<00:00:34.230> first<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
before that workout began now first of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.190 
before that workout began now first of
all<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.860> want<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.280> say<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.690> nothing

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
all I want to say that I have nothing

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.470 
all I want to say that I have nothing
against<00:00:37.559> RPE<00:00:37.920> based<00:00:38.280> programs<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
against RPE based programs and I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.240 
against RPE based programs and I
actually<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.350> great<00:00:40.590> thing<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
actually think it's a great thing that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.000 
actually think it's a great thing that
it's<00:00:41.700> now<00:00:41.940> become<00:00:42.420> popular<00:00:43.020> because<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.770> more

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it's now become popular because the more

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.850 
it's now become popular because the more
options<00:00:44.520> lifters<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.629> better<00:00:45.870> try<00:00:46.649> out

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
options lifters have the better try out

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
options lifters have the better try out
everything<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:47.820> curious<00:00:48.180> about<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
then just see how you enjoy it if you

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.420 
then just see how you enjoy it if you
like<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> progress<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.770> then

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
like it you progress well with it then

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.819 
like it you progress well with it then
by<00:00:53.670> all<00:00:53.699> means<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.480> don't<00:00:55.260> stick<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
by all means do it don't stick to a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.160 
by all means do it don't stick to a
specific<00:00:56.550> dogma<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.719> because<00:00:58.050> your

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
specific dogma just because your

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
specific dogma just because your
favorite<00:00:58.350> lifter<00:00:58.829> does<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.460> want<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> make

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
favorite lifter does it I want to make

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.060 
favorite lifter does it I want to make
that<00:01:00.000> very<00:01:00.059> clear<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.620> straight<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that very clear so to get straight to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250 
that very clear so to get straight to
the<00:01:02.160> point<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.579> my<00:01:03.120> number<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.750> reason<00:01:04.110> for

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the point here my number one reason for

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.250 
the point here my number one reason for
why<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> don't<00:01:04.860> use<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> RP<00:01:05.549> scale<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.210> due<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
why I don't use the RP scale is due to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.280 
why I don't use the RP scale is due to
psychological<00:01:07.700> factors<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.049> both

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
psychological factors and this is both

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770 
psychological factors and this is both
for<00:01:10.560> before<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.220> workout<00:01:11.610> during<00:01:12.180> my<00:01:12.390> actual

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
for before the workout during my actual

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.320 
for before the workout during my actual
sets<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.320> afterwards<00:01:14.159> moving<00:01:14.610> forward<00:01:15.060> from

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
sets and afterwards moving forward from

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330 
sets and afterwards moving forward from
a<00:01:15.450> workout<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.650> mean<00:01:16.799> by<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
a workout now what I mean by this is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.390 
a workout now what I mean by this is
when<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> specific<00:01:19.409> goal<00:01:19.650> set

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
when I have a specific goal set

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.999 
when I have a specific goal set
beforehand<00:01:21.390> before<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.960> workout<00:01:22.259> even<00:01:22.439> began

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
beforehand before the workout even began

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.969 
beforehand before the workout even began
I<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.820> visualize<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.290> forces<00:01:25.650> me<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
I can visualize it and it forces me to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.830 
I can visualize it and it forces me to
take<00:01:26.490> care<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.210> little<00:01:27.390> details

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
take care of all the little details

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.289 
take care of all the little details
leading<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.820> I'm<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
leading up to it if I know I'm going to

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.130 
leading up to it if I know I'm going to
squat<00:01:30.540> let's<00:01:30.750> say<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.170> 95<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:32.490> 1<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.630> 4<00:01:33.659> reps

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
squat let's say for 95 for 1 to 4 reps

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.530 
squat let's say for 95 for 1 to 4 reps
and<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.610> very<00:01:35.820> difficult<00:01:36.030> wait

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
and I know that's a very difficult wait

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.899 
and I know that's a very difficult wait
for<00:01:36.869> me<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.369> sure<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.880> my

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
for me I'm going to make sure I get my

having<00:01:48.210> 5<00:01:48.479> plates<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.960> each<00:01:49.170> side<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> know

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
having 5 plates on each side I know

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.700 
having 5 plates on each side I know
exactly<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.430> look<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.909> my<00:01:51.090> squat<00:01:51.450> rack<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.899> may

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
exactly how look in my squat rack I may

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.770 
exactly how look in my squat rack I may
be<00:01:52.770> even<00:01:53.040> watching<00:01:53.460> videos<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.090> other<00:01:54.299> lifters

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
be even watching videos of other lifters

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.600 
be even watching videos of other lifters
squatting<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> same<00:01:55.590> weight<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.159> reps<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
squatting the same weight for reps and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.969 
squatting the same weight for reps and
by<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.329> time<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> actually<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.409> doing<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
by the time I actually get to doing the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.370 
by the time I actually get to doing the
workout<00:01:59.369> I've<00:01:59.759> already<00:02:00.119> done<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.509> exact<00:02:01.020> set

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
workout I've already done that exact set

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.160 
workout I've already done that exact set
over<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.250> over<00:02:02.460> again<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.820> my<00:02:02.850> head<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.719> now<00:02:03.750> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
over and over again in my head so now it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.020 
over and over again in my head so now it
feels<00:02:04.320> easy<00:02:04.619> now<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> feel<00:02:05.130> pumped<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
feels easy now I feel pumped for it and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.789 
feels easy now I feel pumped for it and
completely<00:02:06.479> ready<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:07.409> when<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> comes

completely ready and then when it comes
to<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.979> actual<00:02:08.129> workout<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.940> lot<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.420> times

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to the actual workout a lot of times

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.510 
to the actual workout a lot of times
you'll<00:02:09.899> warm<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.619> you'll<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:10.979> feel<00:02:11.250> bad

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
just something will feel off

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.370 
just something will feel off
you'll<00:02:13.640> feel<00:02:13.880> weak<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:14.510> then<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.050> workout

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
you'll feel weak but then the workout

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.140 
you'll feel weak but then the workout
actually<00:02:15.650> ends<00:02:15.860> up<00:02:15.890> being<00:02:15.950> very<00:02:16.490> good<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.090> you

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
actually ends up being very good and you

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
end up performing well and this happens

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.850 
end up performing well and this happens
very<00:02:20.180> often<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:20.930> ask<00:02:21.200> experienced

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
very often you can ask experienced

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.860 
very often you can ask experienced
lifters<00:02:22.190> about<00:02:22.520> this<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:23.150> almost<00:02:23.390> every

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
lifters about this it almost every

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.390 
lifters about this it almost every
single<00:02:24.200> one<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.380> them<00:02:24.590> will<00:02:24.740> tell<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.130> story

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
single one of them will tell you a story

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.000 
single one of them will tell you a story
about<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.880> happening<00:02:26.360> where<00:02:27.110> in<00:02:27.350> this<00:02:27.830> is

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
about this happening where in this is

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.750 
about this happening where in this is
why<00:02:28.160> if<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.610> had<00:02:28.640> RPE<00:02:29.270> set<00:02:29.810> up<00:02:30.050> my<00:02:30.650> RP<00:02:31.100> scale<00:02:31.490> in

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
why if I had RPE set up my RP scale in

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.730 
why if I had RPE set up my RP scale in
my<00:02:32.180> head<00:02:32.420> I'd<00:02:32.570> be<00:02:32.720> thinking<00:02:33.110> ok<00:02:33.440> I'm<00:02:33.590> gonna

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
my head I'd be thinking ok I'm gonna

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.160 
my head I'd be thinking ok I'm gonna
dial<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.310> down<00:02:34.480> because<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:35.750> clearly<00:02:36.050> just

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
dial it down because it's clearly just

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.600 
dial it down because it's clearly just
not<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.770> cards<00:02:37.040> today

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
not in the cards today

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.370 
not in the cards today
and<00:02:37.730> then<00:02:37.940> my<00:02:38.060> psychology<00:02:38.600> during<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.020> set<00:02:39.230> is

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
and then my psychology during the set is

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.010 
and then my psychology during the set is
very<00:02:39.950> clear<00:02:40.670> all<00:02:40.910> I'm<00:02:41.150> thinking<00:02:41.540> about<00:02:41.630> is

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
very clear all I'm thinking about is

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.650 
very clear all I'm thinking about is
maybe<00:02:42.230> one<00:02:42.650> or<00:02:42.800> two<00:02:42.830> technique<00:02:43.580> use<00:02:43.850> if<00:02:44.090> any

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
maybe one or two technique use if any

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.930 
maybe one or two technique use if any
and<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.500> just<00:02:45.740> want<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.950> be<00:02:46.070> completely<00:02:46.520> in<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
and I just want to be completely in the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.910 
and I just want to be completely in the
zone<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.330> don't<00:02:47.510> want<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.690> analyze<00:02:48.050> anything<00:02:48.560> I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
zone I don't want to analyze anything I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.710 
zone I don't want to analyze anything I
don't<00:02:49.280> want<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.490> think<00:02:49.700> how<00:02:49.910> fast<00:02:50.150> was<00:02:50.540> this

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
don't want to think how fast was this

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.870 
don't want to think how fast was this
rep<00:02:50.960> or<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.260> rep<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.680> just<00:02:52.160> want<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.430> think<00:02:52.610> I'm

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
rep or that rep I just want to think I'm

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.060 
rep or that rep I just want to think I'm
getting<00:02:53.390> this<00:02:53.600> weight<00:02:53.930> up<00:02:54.200> I'm<00:02:54.470> getting<00:02:54.950> it

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
getting this weight up I'm getting it

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.680 
getting this weight up I'm getting it
for<00:02:55.220> at<00:02:55.340> least<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.790> amount<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.210> reps<00:02:56.450> and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
for at least this amount of reps and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.360 
for at least this amount of reps and
there's<00:02:57.170> nothing<00:02:57.680> that's<00:02:57.830> going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.070> stop<00:02:58.130> me

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
there's nothing that's going to stop me

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.040 
there's nothing that's going to stop me
now<00:02:58.880> I'm<00:02:58.970> not<00:02:59.030> saying<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.540> can't<00:02:59.600> train

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
now I'm not saying that you can't train

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.510 
now I'm not saying that you can't train
with<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.230> great<00:03:00.500> deal<00:03:00.650> of<00:03:00.770> intensity<00:03:01.220> while

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
with a great deal of intensity while

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.730 
with a great deal of intensity while
using<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.970> RPE<00:03:02.270> scale<00:03:02.600> because<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.350> clearly

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
using the RPE scale because you clearly

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.400 
using the RPE scale because you clearly
can<00:03:04.190> my<00:03:04.790> point<00:03:05.120> is<00:03:05.240> that<00:03:05.300> just<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.780> prefer<00:03:06.110> to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
can my point is that just I prefer to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.650 
can my point is that just I prefer to
train<00:03:06.650> with<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:06.830> clear<00:03:07.220> mind<00:03:07.520> and<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.360> want<00:03:08.570> to

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
train with a clear mind and I want to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.590 
train with a clear mind and I want to
leave<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.110> analyzing<00:03:09.710> aspect<00:03:10.400> for<00:03:11.030> after<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
leave the analyzing aspect for after the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.690 
leave the analyzing aspect for after the
workout<00:03:11.690> not<00:03:12.080> during<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.620> actual<00:03:13.070> set<00:03:13.310> itself

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
workout not during the actual set itself

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.610 
workout not during the actual set itself
now<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.330> lot<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.750> aspects<00:03:15.170> I've<00:03:15.350> talked

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
now a lot of the aspects I've talked

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.620 
now a lot of the aspects I've talked
about<00:03:15.770> leading<00:03:16.220> up<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.730> actual<00:03:17.060> set<00:03:17.390> in

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
about leading up to the actual set in

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.110 
about leading up to the actual set in
during<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.470> are<00:03:18.650> basically<00:03:19.550> forcing<00:03:20.030> yourself

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
during it are basically forcing yourself

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.510 
during it are basically forcing yourself
to<00:03:20.390> hit<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.780> minimum<00:03:21.350> number<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:22.190> want<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.430> be
