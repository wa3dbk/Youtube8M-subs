00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.330
 let's talk about the whole world we think 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.960
 that we have a moon or that we have had 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.960
 a moon 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.570
 I want to talk about the two moons and the two 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.030
 moons that says david good in mind the 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.289
 definition of things that a moon is 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.009
 logically a one let's say it's going to be a 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.160
 little direct on a stone two turns 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:33.710
 the issue is that it orbits in an orbit 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.840
 circular circular with which the center and 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.600
 that the center is on earth is a 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.510
 let's say the concept of there are some that 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.640
 They are partial moon crescents etc. 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.490
 they are ones that during a certain time 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.140
 they are orbiting and not because their orbit 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.540
 be unstable and then leave him but 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.520
 because his own trajectory makes 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.630
 for a while it orbits around a 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.380
 planet 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.020
 there is a moon that has enough leads 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.760
 many was described year 86 and it was by 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.590
 some say a second one was discovered 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.909
 moon if exactly this is where 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.229
 I mean because there are some more in 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.210
 other planes even on other planets 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.890
 it is a moon that the truth that is one is 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.580
 a stone the size similar to 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.910
 previous 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.730
 the other day in which the mission 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.170
 remember to try a drill has 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.170
 about 5 kilometers in length 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.700
 the moon is that I was telling you 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.470
 called 3753 whitney and it's a stone 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.930
 about 5 kilometers in length 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.540
 what happens is that it's an asteroid that 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.280
 has a trajectory that revolves around 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.050
 of the sun now well is a trajectory 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.970
 lptic instead of circulating like that of the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.370
 land and also there are not two planes but 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.490
 in three is to say that you have a 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.580
 trajectory to which is your period of 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.200
 Turning respect to the sun is 364 days and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.870
 peak with which practically matches 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.010
 with that of the earth that escapes the 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.720
 64.1 days or so go 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.390
 approximately meters is delayed 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.390
 a little bit about being delayed 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.880
 a little about the earth in terms of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.380
 its orbit not what happens is that you and there 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.729
 certain moments in which the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.960
 Earth 's gravity also influences 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.729
 he because he has a lithic trajectory 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.480
 then there is time when he approaches 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.360
 down to earth then says this has a 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.920
 trajectory approximately stable but 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.660
 that within a few thousand years 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.170
 they calculate that about eight thousand or so 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.810
 it will go away from the earth 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.740
 that vary a bit its orbit what happens 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.930
 is it is 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.880
 you imagine the sun and the earth spinning 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.740
 around there is another star that with the 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.720
 same with the same turning frequency 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.790
 that the earth makes one makes one 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.590
 elliptical trajectory one of the centers 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.930
 they are sun and another is on earth 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.650
 where for a certain moment a year 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.840
 every year it coincides with that 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.140
 we say coincidental orbit of all the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.940
 Earth with the turn of the satellite 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.770
 who says that always for a while 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.690
 it is always turning but from the earth 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.790
 is not continually that's why in a 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.440
 temporary but nothing good happens 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.910
 to walk many asteroids giving 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.680
 tumbles and some catches it from orbit 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.180
 terrestrial and just goes to the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.150
 distance that you have to spend 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.550
 to satellites and everything that goes around 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.230
 this what the station has done 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.350
 spatial are artificial ones in 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.220
 fruits and only that it is in orbit only 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.420
 respect to the land that also 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.100
 Regarding the sun what happens is that 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.770
 when we spend driving on the earth 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.170
 it orbits fairly and I have also 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.340
 made the return let's say it influences the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.110
 terrestrial gravity the magic has said that 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.080
 has five kilometers taking in 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.650
 account that the orbit not regular but that 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.780
 elliptical and slam 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.040
 it's stable that said if it's going to say 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.930
 we always cross the same point is 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.700
 stable 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.470
 if what happens is that it is presuming that 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.180
 it is practically impossible to impact 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.440
 on earth in the next very many 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.830
 thousands of years and we will not see it if 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.269
 most likely they say 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.910
 unfortunately a few man 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.190
 thousands of years 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.950
 it stays because we go there is not 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.750
 positive what I said always I believe 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.599
 that if one has to die of some 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.540
 way a very original is that it's going to 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.769
 come a giant asteroid but not for 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.450
 at least the last of maine are 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.519
 awesome I prefer to choose that 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.019
 to sleep in the bed we noventero 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.459
 we can see but I prefer something a little 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.260
 more through a movie and you 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.030
 you imagine just youtube is just a 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.440
 very quick summary and it is that it has a 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.479
 very interesting topic this is new 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.310
 moon and it's a subject that its severity is 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.810
 practically zero and its temperature is 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.180
 also practically zero since 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.030
 it has very little mass then how it 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.110
 He created at the same time than when 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.520
 that the universe 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 if we are able to climb in fact there are 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.280
 an emission now with a robot with a 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.260
 satellite without no people to 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.700
 analyze it because it has materials from 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.420
 when the big-bang was made since the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.400
 seriousness I do not know 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.080
 and tenth has always been zero degrees 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.720
 with which is a is a place where 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.240
 we can go up to practice as 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.510
 explode let's say the materials that there 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.790
 in satellites of that type of bird in that 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.520
 kind of comets neither are nor are 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.650
 meteorites but are kind of planet and 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.280
 from that guy without the interesting topic 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.280
 in today's
