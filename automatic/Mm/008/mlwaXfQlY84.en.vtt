00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
mount we use on the octocopter it's like

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.140 
mount we use on the octocopter it's like
a<00:00:13.400> automatic<00:00:14.400> stabilized<00:00:15.059> mount<00:00:16.400> so<00:00:17.400> I'm

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
a automatic stabilized mount so I'm

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.320 
a automatic stabilized mount so I'm
gonna<00:00:18.390> show<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.630> guys<00:00:18.750> how<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.170> works<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:20.330> don't

here it is as you can see we just

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.700 
here it is as you can see we just
mounted<00:00:29.510> our<00:00:30.510> camera<00:00:32.120> and<00:00:33.170> I'll<00:00:34.170> show<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.469> how

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
mounted our camera and I'll show you how

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.919 
mounted our camera and I'll show you how
it<00:00:34.890> acts

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:38.929 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:44.540 

i'ma<00:00:39.929> show<00:00:40.019> you<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:41.070> mount<00:00:41.339> wheels<00:00:43.550> which

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
i'ma show you the mount wheels which

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.700 
i'ma show you the mount wheels which
stabilizes<00:00:45.140> automatically<00:00:46.140> when<00:00:46.409> it's<00:00:46.559> in

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
stabilizes automatically when it's in

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.410 
stabilizes automatically when it's in
the<00:00:46.829> air

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.439 

it's<00:00:56.749> pretty<00:00:56.989> cool<00:00:57.170> thing<00:01:00.850> stabilizing<00:01:01.850> now

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
it's pretty cool thing stabilizing now

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:14.540 
it's pretty cool thing stabilizing now
I<00:01:02.800> mean<00:01:05.259> calibrating

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.680 

okay<00:01:15.550> we<00:01:15.730> got<00:01:15.910> this<00:01:16.090> little<00:01:18.120> in<00:01:19.120> Dutch<00:01:19.390> it's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
okay we got this little in Dutch it's

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.520 
okay we got this little in Dutch it's
called<00:01:19.930> about<00:01:20.230> the<00:01:20.410> puss<00:01:20.620> I<00:01:20.950> don't<00:01:21.250> know<00:01:22.530> but

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
called about the puss I don't know but

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.960 
called about the puss I don't know but
you<00:01:23.650> probably<00:01:23.860> know<00:01:24.160> what<00:01:24.370> it<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.610> with<00:01:24.820> the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
you probably know what it is with the

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.810 
you probably know what it is with the
bubble<00:01:25.270> inside<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:26.980> it's<00:01:27.280> on<00:01:27.490> top<00:01:27.790> of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
bubble inside there it is it's on top of

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.820 
bubble inside there it is it's on top of
the<00:01:28.000> camera<00:01:28.330> where<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.810> flash<00:01:29.080> goes<00:01:29.410> and<00:01:31.830> so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
the camera where the flash goes and so

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.310 
the camera where the flash goes and so
when<00:01:32.980> we<00:01:33.100> calibrate<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:33.870> then<00:01:34.870> we<00:01:35.020> know<00:01:35.140> it's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
when we calibrate it then we know it's

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:45.540 
when we calibrate it then we know it's
really<00:01:35.740> really<00:01:35.980> straight<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:41.620> as<00:01:41.740> you<00:01:41.980> see<00:01:44.550> it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
really really straight and as you see it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.330 
really really straight and as you see it
always<00:01:45.880> tries<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.240> stay<00:01:46.690> horizontal<00:01:47.340> however

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
always tries to stay horizontal however

00:01:48.340 --> 00:02:04.860 
always tries to stay horizontal however
the<00:01:48.430> quad<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:48.910> moving

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.200 

the<00:02:05.410> mound<00:02:05.710> is<00:02:05.920> being<00:02:06.100> moved<00:02:06.280> by<00:02:06.490> two<00:02:06.640> servos

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
the mound is being moved by two servos

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.050 
the mound is being moved by two servos
here<00:02:07.480> one<00:02:07.720> on<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.960> side<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.759> ones<00:02:09.759> in<00:02:09.970> the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
here one on the side and ones in the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.210 
here one on the side and ones in the
middle<00:02:10.420> like<00:02:10.960> I<00:02:11.170> can't<00:02:11.620> really<00:02:11.770> get<00:02:12.040> there

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
middle like I can't really get there

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.970 
middle like I can't really get there
with<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.460> camera<00:02:12.990> but<00:02:13.990> um<00:02:14.200> there<00:02:14.800> are<00:02:14.830> two

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
with the camera but um there are two

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.880 
with the camera but um there are two
servos<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.200> they're<00:02:17.200> just<00:02:17.380> being<00:02:17.680> told

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
servos on it and they're just being told

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:32.160 
servos on it and they're just being told
when<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.220> move<00:02:18.570> by<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.630> gyro

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.830 

okay<00:02:32.830> guys<00:02:33.010> well<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.430> was<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.790> about<00:02:34.150> the

okay guys well this was it about the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.080 
okay guys well this was it about the
gyroscopic<00:02:35.500> mount<00:02:35.950> we<00:02:36.220> have<00:02:36.400> for<00:02:37.000> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
gyroscopic mount we have for the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.420 
gyroscopic mount we have for the
octocopter<00:02:37.569> I<00:02:37.930> hope<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.770> enjoyed<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.250> and
