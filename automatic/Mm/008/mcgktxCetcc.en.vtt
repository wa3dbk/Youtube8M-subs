00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.119
 Hello friends, says and shows 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.710
 gleborg and today I have a curious fight 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.300
 on the map northwest if you looked 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.910
 my video 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.800
 recent and 50 m on this map where we 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:29.859
 from the bottom of the spawn they asked for it successfully and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.330
 very quickly won then you know our 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.790
 opinion about this card about 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.270
 balance on arrest on this card 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.340
 driven sapan sir 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.140
 says that he for example does not even remember 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.030
 when is the last time he's from the top resp 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.120
 on this map, well, I won 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.989
 In fact, I remember such a case one after 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.250
 recent times 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:51.609
 well here so we decided to Tighten 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.300
 immediately the option that was 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.590
 I showed video on and 50 but 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.870
 actually on say here 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.420
 Of course, everything is simplified a little by the fact that 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.429
 the enemy does not have fast tanks well besides l 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.050
 . There are no fast tanks which 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:09.340
 we could meet here so we with 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.020
 with fur we press immediately with our shots 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.500
 by the gods here in this square not to 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.090
 give the enemy a foothold tyazhem 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.670
 respectively squared a2b 2 yes and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.690
 allow our guns and supporting 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.000
 our strength to shoot us take forces 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.120
 quietly the balcony here on line beta of 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.060
 35 according to our illumination actually i 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.200
 I prefer to mainly borrow here 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.680
 from there if 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.570
 to occupy it on both lines 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.070
 on top yes the same as the upper route 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.799
 how little leaves options for 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.450
 a waste case of something but here in my me 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.210
 persuaded but in principle from the batch 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.220
 fast enough fast tank to and 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.149
 the bottom slips this pros like me 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.270
 and said at the enemy with wheelbarrows 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.399
 not very good in this fight well and here is our 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.060
 our plan was a success we are here enough 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.819
 it was easy to consolidate here we see that in 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.630
 principle is not enough that we are with the stage 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:13.569
 so lucky we have we no matter how it 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.819
 funny we were in terms of the planet I have 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.650
 in view of the plus, we still have a serious one 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.079
 why am I shooting 50b in the hull 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.819
 never do that i think everything 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:26.530
 starting to shoot at the tower that's based on 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.910
 this fight looms enough 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.060
 what a bright picture on the subject of what 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.269
 balance of those or other risks on the card 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.359
 yes it depends not only good luck or 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.489
 unsuccessful movement there hands movement 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.650
 mouse map what matter there or 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.989
 come to this business he still depends very much 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.340
 much here 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.440
 setups commands that is so pretty 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.060
 complicated topic so I will not be on now 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.069
 medium-strong spread on general 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.500
 the easiest example of this is yes 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.549
 mines in which if you do not have experience 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.080
 which are able to take 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.900
 and quickly a hill then most likely you will 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.850
 In this about and very hard here such 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.480
 same situation the enemy has no place and they 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.790
 lose direction despite being 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.360
 that here from me by all means trying 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.900
 to shower 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:19.610
 and the 50th shot even leaned out to me 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.100
 shoot from art I get but even 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.590
 such a hunt for mother success to the enemy is not 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:30.320
 brings strands which are tightened here 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.940
 although, in principle, not necessarily 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.300
 there was so much power to come here 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.510
 tyazh were in such a vulnerable 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.290
 position and gift and under the chamber with 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.160
 balcony and under our shots well and we 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.110
 here with fur 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.480
 we leave seeking fiqh them of course 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.020
 arranges for me they hindrance to find how 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.250
 it still says to me these delicious 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.770
 french rolls this delicious 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.980
 French where is burgo and stay 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.990
 very small loads JP but 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.890
 no less our plan is absolutely 100 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:07.360
 percent succeeded we pursed the enemy and 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:12.140
 just shot from both sides 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.700
 tyazh that were here there is such 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.090
 small question to be if 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.640
 for example tyazh went on a bottom on they on 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.340
 the top, then there would be a possible option all 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.360
 goes as e100 for example if seven 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.370
 there and 5 spain favor tried us 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.780
 somehow resist but i think that 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.570
 even in this case it would be easier for us than 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.120
 if we had not taken this corner there was 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.820
 would still be easier in this case rods 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.100
 cope because too we could with 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.169
 two sides how do you throw though all 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.610
 I have a little question to see 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.400
 maybe someday this will come out 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.860
 fight when we take the corner of the stretch on the bottom 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.990
 under stretch well and in general while we are here 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.360
 crushed as we see on the other flank 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.569
 Our competently notice defile 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.229
 direction and if you noticed 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:06.990
 then at the beginning of the battle the player on the tree recognized us 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.360
 wrote us fry water matter i think 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.969
 that the mission is fully accomplished 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.020
 I rushed forward here at all 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:18.030
 a bit hp and i decided to try first 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.460
 kill the waffle then I realized that it is not 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.689
 I have time in the end did not have time for some third 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.639
 nick seven not map 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.159
 but on the other hand, and Kirkorov too 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.159
 so I didnâ€™t want to be in this fight 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:31.439
 bayonet best i'm a little bit here about 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.939
 fame soil you ends friends not 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.439
 I will show you the results because 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:36.990
 that basically nothing outstanding 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:38.580
 I did not show here and how 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.409
 frags distribution i think you see 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.379
 it's great that our whole team played 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.900
 very good 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:48.990
 clearly quality otzharili so to speak 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.819
 enemy team on this for today all 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.439
 Thanks for watching you was Gleb
