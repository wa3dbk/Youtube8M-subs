00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.400
 talk on youtube market who captured 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.010
 and in this video I'll be 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.500
 giving you some pecs 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.630
 for sheik tech and a quick notice that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.150
 before I start the video, I want 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.760
 half of the pro-Daniel credits by 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.270
 have to put his channel Daniel is there 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.160
 in the description for having disclosed the fec 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.050
 because before you could not edit 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.910
 so if you do not know the channel yet 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.539
 should go in there and take a look here he 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.350
 have a technique over and over again here is that the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.219
 pec comes so it 's in 2d in two files 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.500
 huh 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.640
 You have to get the two of you to go there. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.590
 in your part of PV ac one game quot blank 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 pec comes here and play ready or do not need 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.129
 move replace or anything 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.180
 now it opens the pb so the business goes 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.360
 appear 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.910
 here comes the part that's uncertain as 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.239
 can not see did not check did not do anything 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.530
