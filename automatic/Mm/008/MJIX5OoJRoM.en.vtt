50<00:01:01.750> percent<00:01:01.899> horsepower<00:01:02.679> increase<00:01:02.920> we

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
50 percent horsepower increase we

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.310 
50 percent horsepower increase we
haven't<00:01:04.089> had<00:01:04.210> any<00:01:04.360> official<00:01:04.839> numbers<00:01:05.110> just

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
haven't had any official numbers just

haven't had any official numbers just
checked<00:01:05.590> as<00:01:05.710> it<00:01:05.830> is<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:05.980> tuner<00:01:06.370> kit<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:07.570> we<00:01:07.690> will

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
checked as it is a tuner kit but we will

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.210 
checked as it is a tuner kit but we will
be<00:01:07.870> working<00:01:08.080> on<00:01:08.260> that<00:01:08.320> soon<00:01:08.680> we<00:01:08.860> should<00:01:08.920> have

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
be working on that soon we should have

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.950 
be working on that soon we should have
that<00:01:09.400> I'd<00:01:09.549> say<00:01:09.729> probably<00:01:09.970> in<00:01:10.210> about<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.659> month

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
that I'd say probably in about a month

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.530 
that I'd say probably in about a month
or<00:01:11.140> so<00:01:11.549> some<00:01:12.549> design<00:01:12.850> features<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.390> we

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540
