00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello to all here 1922 match who 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.870
 speak to you and today I am going to 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.580
 do a little tutorial in minecraft so 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.590
 this tutorial will consist of showing you a 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:20.880
 secret passage so a secret passage 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.939
 discreet without thinking invisible and puts 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.220
 so here is already first advice 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.920
 for this secret passage I advise you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.380
 to do it in the corner of your table 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.920
 in sing because I for me that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.930
 will be slow finger the perfect place where he 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.629
 will be the least risk to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.879
 seek a secret passage so here 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.040
 then for opening your 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.350
 secret passage you have to find some 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.050
 very discreet thing a lever button 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:55.129
 it's not discreet and I'm going to 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.840
 show something if it's okay 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.489
 as you heard I pressed 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.989
 a button 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.089
 he wears had not seen it so voila 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.759
 c 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.219
 the secret passage and 100% discreet 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.460
 take the focus the decorates I'll you 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:16.850
 explain exactly how I 'm doing them 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.539
 so already we will go for the first 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.619
 part 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.850
 the first part is to know 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.770
 how did I do to press a 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.929
 button through a blog and beats 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.579
 maybe you've seen it but this 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.770
 was not a real block 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.810
 in fact here it is a staircase and me 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.039
 this bug in fact what is very 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.759
 strange is that you can actually I 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:46.280
 I'll try to explain you but 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.579
 when a staircase and crooked like 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.670
 this you see here you are on the 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.500
 part where there is a wall and no you see 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.869
 the small squares but when you go 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.239
 gold there are more small carts and 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.079
 that's the same thing except that 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.140
 Minecraft 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.700
 there you see we have this but in fact 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:12.250
 minecraft that he has two 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.790
 two stairs that intersect as 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.050
 these is low he's going to change the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.239
 texture of this block 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.760
 he's going to make sure that it makes a 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.319
 angle but in fact this is only the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.180
 visual part that will be like that it's 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:31.000
 no it's not the physical part here 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.680
 as you can see it's seen 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.580
 always the hole and so we can we can 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.519
 Press a button 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.450
 just behind and therefore it's the same here 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.010
 you see we see one too much and that can 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.200
 give access to chests that's for 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.260
 these for the hidden chests too that 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.150
 can be practical then so after 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.720
 have our button one has a system of 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.940
 trigger so already so that all 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.390
 works it takes what's called a 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.390
 cop so floats the flop it's very healthy 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.450
 the 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.600
 the principle is very simple it is 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.720
 wants that once we press a 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.430
 button that it lights up and once we 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.980
 re pressed this button this year 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.860
 and therefore in my view is to make a movie 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.580
 flop is simply we put two 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.010
 blocks of field torches over 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.360
 pistons below the torches and and me 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.430
 I put a block of redstone but we can 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.100
 put a different block so that the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.959
 current goes through these same things 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:39.300
 then the most important thing 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.290
 the door so the door she is very 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.110
 simple to make 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.530
 if in fact you just have that and 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:52.860
 envelopes if that's all it is at its 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:54.750
 asks that cyclists have so for for 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:01.320
 to make sure that it works you put 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:04.950
 your six pistons play it like this you 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:08.070
 go put blocks on top 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.980
 like these is on you go 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.860
 put two repeaters in the middle and the 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.950
 wire knowing that there is a repeater that 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.840
 must be simply shifted 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.370
 finally you can add your block 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.490
 is tired of a young and a lever 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.700
 but when his flute flops with the 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.510
 buttons that there is a flip flop comes out well 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.980
 in fact so as you see I'm going 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.080
 not to explain to you because otherwise 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:41.680
 I risk getting mixed up 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:44.920
 but that's after what it does and so 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.530
 So here I show you directly 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.320
 so here we have our stairs of 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.020
 button the button that is connected a flop 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.150
 and do it more the man who is connected to the 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.130
 opening system and so after to 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.650
 to turn off all that I like the 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.100
 button also produced itself offer 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:11.320
 flowers so that's going to change the state 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:16.120
 so it's going to close and the chips away 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:19.380
 flip flop go the floch and in a way to 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.870
 what the door is that a 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.670
 way to stay all your antics when 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.510
 I press the button you can see 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.610
 than when when the pistons are 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.510
 enclosed light is lit decor 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.280
 and pistons are retracted and beat the 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.470
 light and that's simple 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.570
 just pass my movies just 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.060
 you put the film on the block at 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.760
 just above the lamp and stand 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.980
 did the springs of fun but that again 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.960
 I risk zorro to confuse you 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.000
 talking sand is the last thing 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.620
 it's very simple that's it you 're not 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.420
 not obliged to put it just because 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.520
 that I think it's not a good move 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.020
 the pistons enclosed relationship I find 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.970
 not that pretty to their choice I prefer 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.689
 close it's simple we take the 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.419
 bias and we 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:06.159
 two tracks have bah so here it was 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.439
 max 2222 that made you a little 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.479
 video is a tour on my channel the tdm 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:12.519
 do anything you do not want to talk about 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:18.959
 I do not like I'm not too embarrassed 

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:18.959
 subbarao no thank you
