 It is why referred to as a high-quality small size pc microphone 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.330
 It's that mic 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:32.320
 8 why not 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:34.440
 If I bought this even though I have an ecm pcv 80 u 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 Well this is 80 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.839
 Well that pink this is hey 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:48.040
 It is a type to put in a normal way, but just shooting that kind of thing I wish I had a little pin microphone 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:50.910
 I thought that I was a little picky with Aso's pick camera Yes 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.120
 The actual thing is this 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 Yes Well I that I here that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.090
 The stand is attached at first, but that's it 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.990
 Also with a clip 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.990
 You can use it as a pin microphone The stand looks like this 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.070
 It's amazing, isn't it stylish? 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.070
 Oh thin here is very 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.810
 Foundation has made of metal 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.850
 It's very small but it has a weight and it's stable 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.850
 Maybe it would be a stand 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 This one sounds better. 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.290
 Well, later on day 8 or later in the next video 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.900
 Let's compare well 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.550
 Well this is it 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:50.030
 Well first Kedomo we were unlucky in here or say that also can be attached to here 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:53.930
 I immediately removed it and put it in the direction of this pin to make it a pin microphone 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.930
 Well what you can choose is good again 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:02.330
 Where there are two 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.020
 Depending on the application, here is something like this 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.310
 I want to put a cat 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.430
 Well though I can make wrinkles if I do this way 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.800
 Parker and serve shirt and tourist 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.800
 I feel that put here I Pitte effective 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:23.860
 In Well plug is like Well normal wintering 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.370
 I wonder if 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:33.020
 Though it's not a stereo mini plug like a ne Well stereo 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.630
 It is an ordinary three pole 3.5mm jack 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:41.570
 So that's normal 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.100
 Yes it can also be used as an external microphone for a personal computer and ic recorder 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:49.130
 Well hey 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:56.290
 If you are using a main mark and you are using mac, you will need to use that microphone 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:59.150
 Because it is not put ordinary Well then because the form to refer through usb of sound audio box 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.390

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:08.850
 I want to put it in a salt box and use it 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:11.620
 Here I think to be very firm because the metal body 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.770
 Even if you put on your clothes video 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.740
 Or rather fashionable 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.000

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.300

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.130
 And what a cat 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:35.170
 It comes with a extension cord of an additional 1 meter but I know this 1.2 meter 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:39.760
 Yes, I think this is another of see you convenient wearing of here o's 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.730
 It's so deaf to the handy cam or to refer Te push of that Handycam 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.150
 This real is 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:51.790
 Handy cam at that stand 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:55.060
 Ohtumi's Handycam supports microphone input, so please pop it 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.780
 Well you can also use this as a pin microphone 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.520
 Just use that audio level when using it with your handycam or something 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.770
 Please lower it properly 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:08.180
 If you shoot in normal condition, there are 8 different things 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.970
 I will pick up various noises, so I should lower it properly 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.910
 Please buy 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:22.230
