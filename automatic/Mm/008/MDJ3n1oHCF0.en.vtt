00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.360
 Hello guys 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:17.410
 I came back today and I'll comment a little bit 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:23.140
 on the super grandson book never again 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.840
 written by the candid kit to this book 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.810
 which was published by the publisher gryphus 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.140
 here in Brazil and how I love the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:38.370
 panels will have to buy the story she 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:43.420
 happens at the beginning of the second season 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.760
 from series to when pack their impala 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:51.160
 of the dim is to be totally destroyed and 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.690
 he has to repair it packs 60 and see 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.960
 who watched the show knows I'm 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.079
 Talking here are they going the brothers going 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.200
 help a friend from the west get rid of 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.149
 one that a spirit that haunts the house 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.299
 of him on weekends 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.039
 the story is set in New York and to 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.630
 anyone who has watched the series knows that 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.399
 brothers they never go to cities 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.380
 big they always stay in cities 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:19.899
 minors because it is easier to find the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.240
 what they are looking for and also they 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.759
 also go unrecognized in these 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.959
 cities in this story they go to 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.270
 new york 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:31.450
 enjoying that they are in the city there 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.409
 in New York they will investigate a 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.389
 Another case is also a parallel that is a 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.420
 murder actually two 

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:49.509
 murders that happened days before 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:53.679
 they arrive and soon realize that 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.029
 the two are based on two short stories 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.139
 edgar allan poe 

00:01:55.029 --> 00:02:08.349
 the first is the barrel on one side and the 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:11.830
 according to her the two know what happens 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.440
 in history but has not yet read and wants to 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.550
 there and wants to read the book and also wants to read 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.830
 and get to a little 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.990
 I suggest you read these two stories and 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.760
 also the heart delator and the bells 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.530
 because this story also appears and 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.870
 This story has spoilers as soon as 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.600
 he got there they will go deeper 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.840
 more 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:41.410
 they discover that they are for a ritual 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.300
 the ritual plaster rejection and search more 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.880
 in the diary of their father they 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.360
 discover this ritual army to the state 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:55.480
 a special part of the father's diary 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:03:00.310
 of them that is a part where there are only things 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.380
 false or myths and that in fact more 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.730
 they need to find this killer to 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.240
 end this story 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:12.310
 the story that goes on here in the book is 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:15.820
 different from the stories that appear 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.560
 in series because in the series usually they 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.620
 did not prepare a face to face with the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.510
 human murderer and yes as ghosts 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.060
 spirits monsters or demons the angel and 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.550
 maybe that's what pleased me so much 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.590
 here in history a man the story 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:42.400
 very good and has that dose of suspense 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:44.860
 which usually have in the series a being 108 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.780
 Peggau's first conversations 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.980
 The only thing that did not please me is 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.140
 in this book were the genomic pronouns and the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.819
 Review is all wrong 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.720
 and I 'm not boring for these things 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:03.370
 I usually let it pass but here it was. 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:07.170
 What annoyed me the most was I 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.610
 I think on every page then the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:14.800
 editors editors 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:17.350
 pay good attention apart from that there is the 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.019
 book is very good I quite liked the 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.599
 story and I recommend it to everyone 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.080
 What do you like supernatural? 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:27.720
 despite editing 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:33.620
 01 of this table but it was a good story 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:37.020
 it was nice to be back in the early days 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.270
 that penetrate e 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.479
 I thought a little and there are more books 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.879
 written by the candid club 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.030
 related to this book that 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.919
 he is the author and authorized by 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.550
 creators actually penetrated the 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.610
 creator of the supplement to write about 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.849
 the series then is nothing unauthorized 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.919
 And I think it's cool, so now it's 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.580
 just wait for the antithesis to publish new ones 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.199
 books penetrated us that's what I 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.449
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.000
 So you liked who you down here. 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.020

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.740
