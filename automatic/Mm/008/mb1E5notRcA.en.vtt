loving is called split pick and it's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.259 
loving is called split pick and it's
freaking<00:02:50.640> awesome<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.579> can<00:02:53.730> make<00:02:53.820> clones

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
freaking awesome and you can make clones

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.530 
freaking awesome and you can make clones
and<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.769> like<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.370> just<00:02:56.400> has<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.209> picture

and so it's like it just has the picture

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.330 
and so it's like it just has the picture
divided<00:02:58.019> so<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.320> like<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:59.040> takes<00:02:59.070> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
divided so it's like it takes the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.740 
divided so it's like it takes the
picture<00:02:59.640> over<00:02:59.880> here<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.390> then<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.630> takes

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
picture over here and then it takes

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.810 
picture over here and then it takes
picture<00:03:01.109> over<00:03:01.350> here<00:03:01.380> but<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.340> one<00:03:02.609> whole

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820
