negative space nails a huge at the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.049 
negative space nails a huge at the
moment<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.990> did<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> design<00:00:08.099> recently<00:00:08.760> on<00:00:08.910> this

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
moment I did a design recently on this

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.299 
moment I did a design recently on this
thing<00:00:09.269> or<00:00:09.389> Eliza<00:00:09.630> Doolittle<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.800> I'm<00:00:11.130> going

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
to show you how to create it today so

to show you how to create it today so
negative<00:00:15.389> space<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.199> all<00:00:16.500> about<00:00:16.859> creating

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
negative space is all about creating

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.340 
negative space is all about creating
shapes<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.660> new<00:00:18.990> nail<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.619> leaving<00:00:21.350> spaces

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
shapes or new nail and leaving spaces

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.769 
shapes or new nail and leaving spaces
where<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.279> see<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.580> naked<00:00:24.119> nail<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
where you can see the naked nail and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.929 
where you can see the naked nail and
it's<00:00:25.350> very<00:00:25.560> important<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> keep<00:00:26.430> graphic<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
it's very important to keep graphic and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's very important to keep graphic and
simple<00:00:29.939> shapes<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.590> if<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.800> stick<00:00:32.160> two

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
simple shapes really so if you stick two

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.450 
simple shapes really so if you stick two
parallel<00:00:33.270> lines<00:00:33.440> stripes<00:00:34.520> Chevron<00:00:35.520> squares

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
parallel lines stripes Chevron squares

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.020 
parallel lines stripes Chevron squares
arches<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.559> just<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.800> fun<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.370> really

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
arches and just have fun with it really

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.920 
arches and just have fun with it really
as<00:00:42.360> long<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.780> you've<00:00:42.960> got<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:44.539> gap<00:00:45.539> between

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
as long as you've got your gap between

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.250 
as long as you've got your gap between
your<00:00:46.620> shapes<00:00:46.950> an<00:00:47.340> equal<00:00:47.940> distance<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.110> then

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
your shapes an equal distance and then

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
your shapes an equal distance and then
you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> outline<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:51.000> look

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
you can outline that and it just look

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.420 
you can outline that and it just look
really<00:00:51.480> pops<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:55.550> start<00:00:56.550> off<00:00:56.760> by<00:00:57.230> by<00:00:58.280> filling<00:00:59.280> in

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
really pops I start off by by filling in

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.790 
really pops I start off by by filling in
the<00:00:59.579> basic<00:01:00.120> shapes<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.230> nail<00:01:01.379> polish

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the basic shapes with the nail polish

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.939 
the basic shapes with the nail polish
brush<00:01:02.600> then<00:01:03.600> when<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.870> go<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> second<00:01:04.769> coat

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
brush then when I go in the second coat

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.070 
brush then when I go in the second coat
I<00:01:05.159> tend<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.909> striping<00:01:06.420> brush<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
I tend to use the striping brush so I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:19.139 
I tend to use the striping brush so I
can<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.409> more<00:01:07.560> accurate<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:08.549> positioning

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.749 

you<00:01:20.149> can<00:01:20.390> use<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.200> paint<00:01:21.560> brush<00:01:21.799> dipped<00:01:22.520> in

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
you can use a paint brush dipped in

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.050 
you can use a paint brush dipped in
acetone<00:01:23.450> or<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.840> corrector<00:01:24.590> liquid<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.549> tidy<00:01:25.880> up

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
acetone or a corrector liquid to tidy up

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.789 
acetone or a corrector liquid to tidy up
and<00:01:26.479> make<00:01:26.750> your<00:01:26.960> angles<00:01:27.469> really<00:01:28.070> sharp<00:01:32.799> once

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
and make your angles really sharp once

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.010 
and make your angles really sharp once
you're<00:01:34.069> happy<00:01:34.189> with<00:01:34.429> your<00:01:34.729> shapes<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:35.840> can

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
you're happy with your shapes you can

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.529 
you're happy with your shapes you can
start<00:01:36.319> outlining<00:01:36.860> with<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.700> contrasting<00:01:38.509> color

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
start outlining with a contrasting color

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:47.350 
start outlining with a contrasting color
I<00:01:44.439> used<00:01:45.439> a<00:01:45.770> like<00:01:45.979> a<00:01:46.009> Barbie<00:01:46.490> pink<00:01:46.759> because<00:01:47.209> I

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
I used a like a Barbie pink because I

00:01:47.360 --> 00:02:08.800 
I used a like a Barbie pink because I
thought<00:01:47.539> it<00:01:47.600> would<00:01:47.719> go<00:01:47.899> nice<00:02:07.239> so<00:02:08.239> once<00:02:08.509> that's

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
thought it would go nice so once that's

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.690 
thought it would go nice so once that's
dry<00:02:09.140> I'm<00:02:09.679> then<00:02:09.950> going<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.190> steal<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.549> whole

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
dry I'm then going to steal the whole

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.260 
dry I'm then going to steal the whole
thing<00:02:10.970> with<00:02:11.180> my<00:02:11.329> top<00:02:11.510> coat

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.330
