00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
changed I do feel like JC's sort of of

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.820 
changed I do feel like JC's sort of of
the<00:04:09.000> opinion<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.420> he<00:04:10.050> will<00:04:10.230> never<00:04:10.500> raised

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
the opinion that he will never raised

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.470 
the opinion that he will never raised
before<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.459> flop<00:04:11.670> if<00:04:11.910> he<00:04:12.000> has<00:04:12.120> his<00:04:12.330> druthers

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
before the flop if he has his druthers

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.690 
before the flop if he has his druthers
raising<00:04:15.480> before<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.840> flop<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:16.169> not<00:04:16.700> the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
raising before the flop is not the

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.490 
raising before the flop is not the
characteristic<00:04:18.540> of<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.810> particular<00:04:19.109> heads

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
characteristic of this particular heads

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.820 
characteristic of this particular heads
up<00:04:19.709> it's<00:04:19.980> not<00:04:20.190> happening<00:04:20.640> very<00:04:20.850> much<00:04:21.440> no<00:04:22.440> trans

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
up it's not happening very much no trans
