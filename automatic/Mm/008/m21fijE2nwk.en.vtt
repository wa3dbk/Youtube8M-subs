00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
strong base to which we can attach the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.700 
strong base to which we can attach the
teeth<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:16.049> treatment<00:01:16.289> involves

teeth and the treatment involves

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.069 
teeth and the treatment involves
attaching<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.460> teeth<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.270> implants

attaching the teeth to the implants
immediately<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.700> essentially<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
immediately that is essentially the

concept with on fall it's the most

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.849 
concept with on fall it's the most

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
common for large rehabilitation in our

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.969 
common for large rehabilitation in our
practice<00:01:26.100> today<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.960> implants<00:01:28.649> enough

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
practice today are for implants enough

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.789 
practice today are for implants enough
to<00:01:29.280> replace<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> full<00:01:30.030> set<00:01:30.359> of<00:01:30.479> teeth<00:01:30.509> well<00:01:31.409> in

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
to replace a full set of teeth well in

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.160 
to replace a full set of teeth well in
the<00:01:32.159> past<00:01:32.399> we<00:01:32.880> used<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.210> play<00:01:33.359> six<00:01:33.899> or<00:01:34.139> more

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the past we used to play six or more

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.529 
the past we used to play six or more
implants<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.490> weren't<00:01:35.670> sure<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
implants because we weren't sure if the

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:37.999 
implants because we weren't sure if the
individual<00:01:36.960> implants<00:01:37.409> were<00:01:37.499> going<00:01:37.679> to<00:01:37.829> work

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
individual implants were going to work

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.029 
individual implants were going to work
but<00:01:38.520> over<00:01:38.880> time<00:01:39.060> we've<00:01:39.299> learned<00:01:39.600> that

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
but over time we've learned that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.770 
but over time we've learned that
implants<00:01:41.039> do<00:01:41.189> work<00:01:41.399> that<00:01:41.909> our<00:01:41.939> CEO<00:01:42.270> integrate

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
implants do work that our CEO integrate

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.340 
implants do work that our CEO integrate
so<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:44.340> need<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.670> make<00:01:45.119> sure<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.049> only

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
so we need to make sure that not only

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.620 
so we need to make sure that not only
the<00:01:46.619> implants<00:01:47.130> osseo<00:01:47.520> integrate<00:01:47.999> but<00:01:48.179> we<00:01:48.389> want

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the implants osseo integrate but we want

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.569 
the implants osseo integrate but we want
to<00:01:48.719> make<00:01:48.840> sure<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.619> they're<00:01:49.770> successful<00:01:50.429> for

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
to make sure that they're successful for

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.969 
to make sure that they're successful for
the<00:01:50.639> long<00:01:50.819> term<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.959> do<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.409> they<00:01:52.709> have

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the long term and to do that they have

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.370 
the long term and to do that they have
to<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.219> cleanable<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.569> more<00:01:54.749> implants<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to be cleanable so the more implants you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.270 
to be cleanable so the more implants you
have<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.130> harder<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.270> actually<00:01:57.450> clean

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
have the harder it is to actually clean

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.779 
have the harder it is to actually clean
under<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.459> bridge<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:02.039> makes<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
under the bridge and it makes the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.699 
under the bridge and it makes the
maintenance<00:02:03.569> of<00:02:03.689> them<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.959> lot<00:02:04.079> more<00:02:04.109> complex

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
maintenance of them a lot more complex

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.290 
maintenance of them a lot more complex
so<00:02:05.600> four<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.869> enough<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.649> most<00:02:08.100> patients<00:02:08.399> but

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so four is enough in most patients but

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.750 
so four is enough in most patients but
of<00:02:09.450> course<00:02:09.750> every<00:02:10.709> patient<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.190> different<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
of course every patient is different and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.550 
of course every patient is different and
there<00:02:12.270> will<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.480> situations<00:02:13.260> where<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.500> need

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
there will be situations where you need

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.710 
there will be situations where you need
more<00:02:13.950> than<00:02:14.010> four<00:02:14.489> implants<00:02:14.939> or<00:02:15.390> where<00:02:15.629> you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
more than four implants or where you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.600 
more than four implants or where you
need<00:02:15.840> additional<00:02:16.080> procedures<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.310> or

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
need additional procedures in or

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.130 
need additional procedures in or
to<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.880> able<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.180> achieve<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.750> result<00:02:19.080> that

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
to be able to achieve the result that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.290 
to be able to achieve the result that
you're<00:02:19.350> after<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> can<00:02:20.610> see<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:21.030> by<00:02:21.120> having

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
you're after so I can see that by having

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.660 
you're after so I can see that by having
fewer<00:02:21.690> implants<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.620> makes<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.980> teeth<00:02:23.190> easier

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
fewer implants it makes the teeth easier

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.370 
fewer implants it makes the teeth easier
to<00:02:23.820> clean<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:24.480> more<00:02:24.630> comfortable<00:02:25.200> over

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
to clean and it's more comfortable over

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.670 
to clean and it's more comfortable over
time<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.640> what<00:02:26.820> about<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.210> aesthetics<00:02:27.750> well

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
time but what about the aesthetics well

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.960 
time but what about the aesthetics well
that's<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.010> other<00:02:29.040> thing<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.640> this

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
that's the other thing with this

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.690 
that's the other thing with this
procedure<00:02:30.450> involves<00:02:31.320> what<00:02:31.950> we<00:02:32.070> call<00:02:32.220> an<00:02:32.340> lv

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
procedure involves what we call an lv

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.300 
procedure involves what we call an lv
elekta<00:02:33.060> me<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.390> LVL<00:02:34.260> ectomy<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.860> when<00:02:35.160> we

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
elekta me and LVL ectomy is when we

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.420 
elekta me and LVL ectomy is when we
reshape<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.210> jawbone<00:02:36.780> during<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.890> process

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
reshape the jawbone during the process

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.940 
reshape the jawbone during the process
during<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.910> surgery<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.290> we<00:02:40.800> can

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
during the surgery so that we can

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.870 
during the surgery so that we can
achieve<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.310> flatter<00:02:41.760> surface<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.780> jaw<00:02:43.080> and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
achieve a flatter surface of the jaw and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.420 
achieve a flatter surface of the jaw and
make<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.270> flatter<00:02:45.810> interface<00:02:46.560> where<00:02:47.280> the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
make it a flatter interface where the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.000 
make it a flatter interface where the
teeth<00:02:47.730> attached<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.600> implants<00:02:49.050> because

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
teeth attached to the implants because

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.980 
teeth attached to the implants because
it's<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.459> flatterer<00:02:50.820> interface<00:02:51.330> again<00:02:51.810> it's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
it's a flatterer interface again it's

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.980 
it's a flatterer interface again it's
easier<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.980> clean<00:02:53.250> apart<00:02:54.090> from<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.540> cleaning

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
easier to clean apart from the cleaning

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.630 
easier to clean apart from the cleaning
side<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.440> things<00:02:55.620> there<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.040> also<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
side of things there is also the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.160 
side of things there is also the
aesthetics<00:02:57.150> because<00:02:57.450> we're<00:02:57.630> doing<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.959> lv

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
aesthetics because we're doing the lv

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.380 
aesthetics because we're doing the lv
elective<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.620> flattening<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.190> bone<00:02:59.400> we<00:03:00.150> are

elective and flattening the bone we are

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.270 
elective and flattening the bone we are
increasing<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.140> space<00:03:01.590> we're<00:03:01.830> increasing

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
increasing the space we're increasing

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.750 
increasing the space we're increasing
the<00:03:02.400> room<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.260> we're<00:03:04.260> able<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:05.100> we<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.489> more

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the room and we're able to we have more

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.830 
the room and we're able to we have more
if<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.780> like<00:03:07.489> creative<00:03:08.489> ability<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.390> do<00:03:09.600> what

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
if you like creative ability to do what

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.900 
if you like creative ability to do what
we<00:03:10.020> like<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.680> aesthetics<00:03:11.190> when<00:03:11.730> we've

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
we like with the aesthetics when we've

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.080 
we like with the aesthetics when we've
got<00:03:12.090> more<00:03:12.300> room<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:12.780> what's<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.980> key<00:03:14.340> then<00:03:14.730> to

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
got more room so what's the key then to

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.690 
got more room so what's the key then to
the<00:03:15.270> aesthetics<00:03:15.810> for<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.500> key<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.950> having<00:03:17.459> a

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
the aesthetics for the key to having a

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.240 
the aesthetics for the key to having a
nice<00:03:17.880> smile<00:03:18.270> is<00:03:18.630> harmony<00:03:19.290> between<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.920> teeth

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
nice smile is harmony between the teeth

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.880 
nice smile is harmony between the teeth
the<00:03:20.670> gums<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.420> lips<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:22.320> it's<00:03:22.440> not<00:03:22.590> just

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
the gums and the lips so it's not just

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.009 
the gums and the lips so it's not just
the<00:03:23.010> teeth<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.580> we<00:03:23.730> need<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:23.970> get<00:03:24.120> right<00:03:24.390> we

those who need the on for treatment the
gums<00:03:30.510> have<00:03:30.840> quite<00:03:31.080> often<00:03:31.290> receded<00:03:32.070> or<00:03:32.340> they're

gums have quite often receded or they're

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.910 
gums have quite often receded or they're
quite<00:03:32.730> unshapely<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:34.049> they<00:03:34.350> don't<00:03:34.650> look<00:03:34.860> very

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
quite unshapely so they don't look very

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.090 
quite unshapely so they don't look very
nice<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:36.180> lv<00:03:36.630> elective<00:03:37.080> procedure<00:03:37.500> which<00:03:37.799> is

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
nice the lv elective procedure which is

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.250 
nice the lv elective procedure which is
the<00:03:38.370> word<00:03:38.610> LVL<00:03:39.060> ectomy<00:03:39.390> means<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.750> reshaping

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
the word LVL ectomy means the reshaping

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.830 
the word LVL ectomy means the reshaping
of<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.650> jawbone<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.700> lv<00:03:42.030> elective<00:03:42.420> procedure

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
of the jawbone the lv elective procedure

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.090 
of the jawbone the lv elective procedure
because<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.680> allows<00:03:43.980> us<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.400> space<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:46.100> be

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
because it allows us the space to be

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.580 
because it allows us the space to be
able<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.760> recreate<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.660> teeth<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.110> well<00:03:49.440> as

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
able to recreate the teeth as well as

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.490 
able to recreate the teeth as well as
the<00:03:49.739> gums<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.760> does<00:03:51.150> provide<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.930> harmony

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
the gums it does provide that harmony

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.820 
the gums it does provide that harmony
between<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.519> gums<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.390> teeth<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.140> lips

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
between the gums the teeth and the lips

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.250 
between the gums the teeth and the lips
so<00:03:56.549> what<00:03:56.820> do<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.209> do<00:03:57.480> with<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.840> bone<00:03:58.019> that

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
so what do you do with the bone that

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.470 
so what do you do with the bone that
you're<00:03:58.410> removed<00:03:58.799> we<00:03:59.370> quite<00:03:59.850> often<00:04:00.030> don't<00:04:00.390> have

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
you're removed we quite often don't have

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.020 
you're removed we quite often don't have
to<00:04:00.660> throw<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:00.930> away<00:04:01.019> so<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:01.890> can<00:04:02.070> reuse<00:04:02.790> the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
to throw it away so we can reuse the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.050 
to throw it away so we can reuse the
bone<00:04:03.269> from<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.350> jaw<00:04:04.799> from<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.430> lv<00:04:05.670> elective

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
bone from the jaw from the lv elective

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.240 
bone from the jaw from the lv elective
procedure<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.600> we<00:04:06.690> can<00:04:06.870> recycle<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.560> we<00:04:08.070> can

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
procedure and we can recycle it we can

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.220 
procedure and we can recycle it we can
place<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.820> in<00:04:09.120> parts<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.750> joy<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:09.989> are

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
place it in parts of the joy that are

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.170 
place it in parts of the joy that are
deficient<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:11.190> all<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.760> done<00:04:11.940> at<00:04:12.120> the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
deficient and all that is done at the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.600 
deficient and all that is done at the
same<00:04:12.420> time<00:04:12.630> as<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.959> implant<00:04:13.320> surgery<00:04:13.890> so<00:04:14.489> in

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
same time as the implant surgery so in

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.699 
same time as the implant surgery so in
most<00:04:14.730> cases<00:04:15.060> we're<00:04:15.329> still<00:04:15.600> able<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:16.350> fit<00:04:16.560> the

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
most cases we're still able to fit the

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.890 
most cases we're still able to fit the
teeth<00:04:17.010> on<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.640> implants<00:04:18.150> straight<00:04:18.390> away<00:04:18.630> and

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
teeth on the implants straight away and

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.790 
teeth on the implants straight away and
at<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.410> same<00:04:19.680> time<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.609> bone
