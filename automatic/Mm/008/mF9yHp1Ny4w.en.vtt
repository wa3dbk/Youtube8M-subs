00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.690
 welcome me, I am sarah 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.780
 I'm 36 years old, I'm a mother of two 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.050
 children and work as a creator of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.710
 content and I'm a blogger this is a challenge 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.980
 for me 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.810
 because I want to share it 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 Well, I think that helped me 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.260
 because I want to get it and I want 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.240
 be healthy all my life 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.240
 and I think it's about time that this is the 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.550
 moment to get it 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.400
 and because I know that in my situation there 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.730
 many girls of boys that cost them 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.620
 Dieting and exercise 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.000
 I can help you, I can encourage you and 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.340
 motivate 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.760
 and everything is here and everything can be 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.710
 you can not get 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.230
 we have to work our mind and 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.149
 get our mind in the 2000's 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.829
 dominate our mind not that our 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.880
 mind the dominated but us 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.520
 dominate our mind to 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.559
 it takes us strength 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.559
 tell you that I have fibromyalgia 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.000
 skimming cholesterol 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.660
 and that's also one of the things that I 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.660
 has made 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.380
 to take care of me also because I felt 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.380
 very tired 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.530
 I ached all over and gave me all the 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.790
 killed 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.790
 He told me I had to do 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.070
 I had strong muscles 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.820
 Well, not the struggles I have against 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.470
 I myself am my impatience 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.580
 I'm a little impatient, I'm fighting 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.420
 with that I think that that 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.280
 the power is blocking me 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.500
 get diets because I've done many 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.450
 diets and I have always recovered then 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.180
 I am working with my mind 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.100
 to have patience and fight I also have 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.159
 my family that supports me that is very 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.860
 important but if one does not control this 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.080
 neither 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.800
 It sets as a goal to get it down I'm going to 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.800
 do and I'm going to 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.310
 I am many people like me or 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.709
 impatient they want to lose fast the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.319
 weight but this diet is not to lose 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.079
 fast start to learn little by little 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.340
 which is the healthiest but is lost 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.250
 weekly 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.330
 that motivates you 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.330
 so cheer up 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.459
 and doing is to motivate me and already 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.319
 so I encourage you all to do 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.640
 this diet the new diet dukan 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.890
 stepped 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.810
 because I have seen it very balanced 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.810
 I also like how why 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.569
 every day is one more meal and the body 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.060
 how grateful it would be like what 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.900
 you do with desire and motivates you too 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.420
 I wanted to say that when we achieve or achieve 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.389
 because I will achieve it when I achieved my 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.769
 ideal weight that is to lose 10 kilos of 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:12.730
 those 77 400 I have to leave about 67 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.080
 kilos 67-68 my ideal weight when 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.800
 get the ideal weight 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.800
 we are not finished 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.810
 the best comes when the second phase the 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.550
 consolidation and the third phase the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.590
 stabilization 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.040
 we have to pass those two last phases 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.200
 which are easier 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.090
 to move on and not go back to 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.340
 fatten this diet if we do it well 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.109
 these three phases the first weeks 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.989
 the weeks staggered when we arrived 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.060
 to our ideal weight the second phase of 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.640
 consolidation and the third of 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.530
 stabilization and stabilization already 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.950
 abstract of life but it is very easy to 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.340
 do and so we will not gain the weight that 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.750
 we have lost and the effort so great and 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:03.829
 we will be healthy and handsome and beautiful 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 super good and nothing cheer and diet and 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:11.230
 exercise and nothing to tell you that 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.810
 you will see videos of every day of everything that 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.820
 as of eats goes every day so that 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.590
 you see the diet how all the 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.440
 days you can diet step by step 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.140
 week 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.550
 and every day a pattern is made 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.800
 next weeks you start with the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.139
 same guideline 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.319
 so you'll have the first week of my 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.319
 diet 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.240
 and already the second week third and fourth 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.330
 fifth will be a summary with weighing with 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.060
 the weight that I'm losing and some 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.700
 tricks tips and things that are going 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.729
