00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.340
 we take care of the third variant 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.880
 dacia original lance with the new dakar 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.710
 nozzle the thing is very solidly built 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.500
 15 cm in diameter has 0.7 mm holes 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.019
 two pieces down in the ground of course where 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.050
 otherwise and is in two parts here with one 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.539
 Thread through accordingly the two 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.219
 silicone o-rings to them there 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.420
 can compress them here 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.059
 keep on your ear 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.270
 I do it during the assembly so that I 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.250
 just turn the thread so far that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.620
 the wrestlers are still not touching and 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.840
 then finally the lance on it if 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.629
 I feel that the rubber over it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.539
 the two did not slip 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.030
 then just hand-turn 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.899
 it is already mentioned in the forum 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.730
 I have that still game I can 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.340
 So from my experience say at the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.460
 Silvia then actually plants I can 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.500
 actually turn relatively easily though 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.710
 Relatively easy still means if 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.390
 I was there with the rag then penetrated 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.450
 it is not a problem the field can be seen 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.790
 good here too , so I can 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.009
 really shake the field then 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.580
 not slip I have this in sync 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.770
 rings give in any case enough stop yes 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.750
 As you can see is the original lanza 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.659
 now a whole lot longer so 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.439
 About the piece from the bottom nozzle 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.170
 body here 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.450
 that hangs completely free anyway me 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.470
 So as I said no game I can 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:47.310
 wonderful with the nozzle so work from 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.380
 and more room for a new one for everyone 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.850
 among you have seen the lyrics waste 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.799
 Of course we'll throw these 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.990
 milk not away but we will then 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.130
 Afterwards in the pudding of cook I begin 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.130
 clean up now 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.180
 as you have seen it with me 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.439
 now taken a little longer 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.970
 but that can always be because of it 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.810
 that maybe I'm a little too short 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.769
 the steam power is waiting for dacia and it 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.480
 has a bit too strong once 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.019
 improved while pulling what you but also 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.780
 Immediately he is right 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.220
 fast 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.079
 when rolling you can do something more 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.150
 time let that vortex far from it 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.829
 as strong as we probably do 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.019
 and hopefully right at the gad 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.480
 seen because the same are to be considered 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.739
 and I have a milk foam you can see 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.440
 now here when shaking but 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.769
 also from the surface of the very 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.629
 is very fine-pored and very good 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.480
 under vegetables one sees now also at 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.069
 So I've been pouring all the time 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.560
 you can still see the bubbles 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.920
 they have very small with get out the 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.349
 all the time a very fine-pored 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.370
 uniform milk foam 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.440
 or may I think so 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.160
 now really milk 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.160
 cream talk
