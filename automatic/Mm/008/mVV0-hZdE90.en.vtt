00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
then jump until you find a place where

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510 
then jump until you find a place where
you<00:00:40.020> land<00:00:40.260> mid<00:00:40.530> jump<00:00:40.800> you're<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.370> need

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
you land mid jump you're going to need

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.700 
you land mid jump you're going to need
to<00:00:41.640> move<00:00:41.820> very<00:00:42.329> slightly<00:00:42.600> side<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.200> side<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
to move very slightly side to side to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.920 
to move very slightly side to side to
try<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.950> find<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:44.879> place<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.840> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
try to find the right place it can be a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290 
try to find the right place it can be a
little<00:00:46.140> tricky<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> hit<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.399> always<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
little tricky to hit and not always to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.080 
little tricky to hit and not always to
terribly<00:00:49.230> consistent<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.460> once<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.969> it

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
terribly consistent but once you get it

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
terribly consistent but once you get it
you<00:00:51.180> should<00:00:51.390> stop<00:00:51.660> mid<00:00:51.899> jump<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:52.680> just

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you should stop mid jump and then just

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.410 
you should stop mid jump and then just
keep<00:00:53.219> jumping<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.850> will<00:00:54.030> begin<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
keep jumping and you will begin the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.090 
keep jumping and you will begin the
climb<00:00:54.539> once<00:00:55.199> you're<00:00:55.350> climbing<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.920> not

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
climb once you're climbing you do not

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.910 
climb once you're climbing you do not
need<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.399> hold<00:00:56.520> forward<00:00:56.940> anymore<00:00:57.449> until<00:00:58.410> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
need to hold forward anymore until you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.220 
need to hold forward anymore until you
jump<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.789> land<00:01:00.030> normally<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.109> are

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
jump in you land normally then you are

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
jump in you land normally then you are
on<00:01:01.410> top<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> barrier<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.730> run<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
on top of the barrier and you can run to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
on top of the barrier and you can run to
the<00:01:03.420> other<00:01:03.750> side<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.350> where<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.619> drop<00:01:04.890> down

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the other side of it where you drop down

the other side of it where you drop down
and<00:01:05.430> once<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.479> drop<00:01:06.840> down<00:01:07.140> you're<00:01:07.590> pretty

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and once you drop down you're pretty

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.429 
and once you drop down you're pretty
much<00:01:08.460> done<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> big<00:01:09.510> area<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.260> map

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
much done you have a big area of the map

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.289 
much done you have a big area of the map
to<00:01:10.590> explore<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.400> only<00:01:11.670> thing<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.119> be
