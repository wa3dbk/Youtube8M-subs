now<00:00:28.650> I'm<00:00:28.920> coloring<00:00:29.340> everything<00:00:30.119> using<00:00:30.660> black

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
now I'm coloring everything using black

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.510 
now I'm coloring everything using black
marker<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.829> I'm<00:00:35.160> coloring

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
marker so and now I'm coloring

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.420 
marker so and now I'm coloring
everything<00:00:36.200> except<00:00:37.200> some<00:00:37.500> parts<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.250> I'm

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
everything except some parts that I'm

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.610 
everything except some parts that I'm
living<00:00:38.640> white<00:00:41.059> too<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:42.960> yes<00:00:43.290> for

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
living white too for what yes for

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.040 
living white too for what yes for
reflection<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.640> light<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.469> will<00:00:46.680> use

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
reflection of light and then we will use

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
reflection of light and then we will use
Glendon<00:00:49.050> we'll<00:00:49.320> mix<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.890> black<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.520> we

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
Glendon we'll mix it with black and we

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.250 
Glendon we'll mix it with black and we
will<00:00:51.510> make<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> smooth<00:00:52.559> transition<00:00:53.489> from<00:00:54.480> black

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
will make a smooth transition from black

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.040 
will make a smooth transition from black
to<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:58.289> white<00:00:58.920> maybe<00:00:59.489> just<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.629> center<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
to to white maybe just in the center of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.509 
to to white maybe just in the center of
those<00:01:01.350> white<00:01:02.309> parts<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.949> it's<00:01:04.949> much<00:01:05.220> better

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
those white parts so it's much better

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.230 
those white parts so it's much better
than<00:01:05.850> use<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.420> grey<00:01:06.840> or<00:01:07.700> cancel<00:01:08.700> cancel<00:01:08.880> it's

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
than use like grey or cancel cancel it's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.020 
than use like grey or cancel cancel it's
just<00:01:09.479> noisy<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.950> spend<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.820> use

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
just noisy when you spend so you can use

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.109 
just noisy when you spend so you can use
it<00:01:12.180> for<00:01:12.390> tweet<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.229> use<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.280> but

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it for tweet you can use it for you but

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
it for tweet you can use it for you but
you<00:01:15.330> must<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.780> careful<00:01:16.080> when<00:01:16.439> you're<00:01:16.590> drawing

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
you must be careful when you're drawing

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.200 
you must be careful when you're drawing
something<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.700> whether<00:01:18.650> plastic<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:20.210> silk

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
something like whether plastic or silk

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.560 
something like whether plastic or silk
white<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:22.460> especially<00:01:23.460> when<00:01:23.909> paper<00:01:24.299> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
white because especially when paper is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510 
white because especially when paper is
not<00:01:24.810> bleep<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.439> paper<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.070> really

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
not bleep of paper there is really

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.069 
not bleep of paper there is really
smooth<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:30.079> general

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
smooth we can you can just on a general

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.560 
smooth we can you can just on a general
a4<00:01:31.590> paper<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.369> use<00:01:32.430> imprinted<00:01:33.360> it's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
strong reflection yes so sometimes I

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.660 
strong reflection yes so sometimes I
think<00:02:56.599> I<00:02:56.930> open<00:02:57.470> use<00:02:57.590> words<00:02:57.950> reflection

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
think I open use words reflection

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.820 
think I open use words reflection
