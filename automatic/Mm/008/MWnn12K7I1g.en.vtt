a<00:00:01.100> common<00:00:02.100> question<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.760> where<00:00:03.689> do<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.049> divide

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
a common question is where do I divide

my orchid not all orchids are dividable
in<00:00:08.160> fact<00:00:08.429> there's<00:00:08.820> two<00:00:09.120> different<00:00:09.469> specific

so<00:05:19.560> when<00:05:19.740> dividing<00:05:20.310> an<00:05:20.430> orchid<00:05:20.730> like<00:05:20.910> this

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.990 

sometimes<00:05:25.950> you<00:05:26.070> don't<00:05:26.160> even<00:05:26.370> need<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.580> shears

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
sometimes you don't even need a shears

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.210 
sometimes you don't even need a shears
sometimes<00:05:27.570> you<00:05:27.690> can<00:05:27.810> just<00:05:27.840> wiggle<00:05:28.320> them<00:05:28.500> and

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
sometimes you can just wiggle them and

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.460 
sometimes you can just wiggle them and
they'll<00:05:29.340> fall<00:05:29.580> apart<00:05:30.410> such<00:05:31.410> as<00:05:31.590> this<00:05:31.740> piece

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
they'll fall apart such as this piece

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.720 
they'll fall apart such as this piece
when<00:05:34.470> dividing<00:05:34.890> these<00:05:35.040> type<00:05:35.250> of<00:05:35.280> orchids

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
when dividing these type of orchids

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.880 
when dividing these type of orchids
you're<00:05:36.390> going<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:36.720> center<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.320> plant<00:05:37.590> in<00:05:37.830> the

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
you're going to center the plant in the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.180 
you're going to center the plant in the
pot<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.760> pot<00:05:39.480> around<00:05:39.810> in<00:05:40.080> this<00:05:40.680> case<00:05:40.890> with<00:05:41.100> you

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
pot and pot around in this case with you

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.850 
pot and pot around in this case with you
sag<00:05:41.580> no<00:05:41.610> moss<00:05:41.910> or<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.240> small<00:05:42.780> great<00:05:43.260> bark<00:05:43.590> mix

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
sag no moss or a small great bark mix

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.280 
sag no moss or a small great bark mix
and<00:05:44.180> then<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.270> plan<00:05:45.450> will<00:05:45.600> continue<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:46.020> go

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
and then the plan will continue to go

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.160 
and then the plan will continue to go
around<00:05:47.060> so<00:05:48.060> that's<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.510> difference<00:05:48.840> between

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.170 
around so that's the difference between

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.160 
around so that's the difference between
some<00:05:49.650> of<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.980> simple<00:05:50.850> habit<00:05:51.420> growers<00:05:51.750> when

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
some of the simple habit growers when

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.600 
some of the simple habit growers when
dividing<00:05:53.150> it's<00:05:54.150> also<00:05:54.360> a<00:05:54.480> good<00:05:54.780> idea<00:05:54.840> to<00:05:55.650> give

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
dividing it's also a good idea to give

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.690 
dividing it's also a good idea to give
your<00:05:56.640> plant<00:05:57.140> half<00:05:58.140> a<00:05:58.260> week<00:05:58.440> to<00:05:58.650> a<00:05:58.680> week<00:05:58.770> on<00:05:59.160> the

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
your plant half a week to a week on the

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.670 
your plant half a week to a week on the
dry<00:05:59.910> side<00:06:00.210> without<00:06:00.390> watering<00:06:00.900> it<00:06:01.110> after

dry side without watering it after
repotting<00:06:02.190> sometimes<00:06:02.970> when<00:06:03.120> you<00:06:03.210> damage<00:06:03.570> a

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
repotting sometimes when you damage a

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.630 
repotting sometimes when you damage a
lot<00:06:03.810> of<00:06:03.900> roots<00:06:04.140> you<00:06:04.710> give<00:06:04.890> them<00:06:05.010> a<00:06:05.100> little<00:06:05.310> time

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
lot of roots you give them a little time

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.210 
lot of roots you give them a little time
to<00:06:05.850> dry<00:06:06.090> out<00:06:06.120> they'll<00:06:06.690> seal<00:06:07.080> up<00:06:07.320> callus<00:06:07.860> over

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
to dry out they'll seal up callus over

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.370 
to dry out they'll seal up callus over
and<00:06:08.400> they<00:06:08.790> won't<00:06:09.000> be<00:06:09.090> as<00:06:09.240> prone<00:06:09.600> to<00:06:09.810> rotting<00:06:10.230> as

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
and they won't be as prone to rotting as

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.320 
and they won't be as prone to rotting as
if<00:06:10.950> they<00:06:11.220> were<00:06:11.340> to<00:06:11.460> get<00:06:11.610> wet<00:06:11.790> immediately

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
if they were to get wet immediately

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.980 
if they were to get wet immediately
after<00:06:12.600> they<00:06:12.690> were<00:06:12.750> repotted<00:06:14.630> so<00:06:15.630> that<00:06:15.780> covers

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
after they were repotted so that covers
