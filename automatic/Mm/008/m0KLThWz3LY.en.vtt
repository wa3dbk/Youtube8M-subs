00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.480 

yeah<00:00:15.449> for<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.809> girl<00:00:16.020> like<00:00:16.049> Chris<00:00:16.349> codes<00:00:16.710> there

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
yeah for a girl like Chris codes there

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.490 
yeah for a girl like Chris codes there
are<00:00:17.640> guy<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.939> go<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.240> when<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.960> start<00:00:19.169> hitting

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
are guy to go to when you start hitting

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.260 
are guy to go to when you start hitting
so<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:20.099> know<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.700> plans<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.119> might

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
so you know some of the plans you might

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.630 
so you know some of the plans you might
try<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.789> put<00:00:23.789> them<00:00:23.939> into<00:00:24.119> play<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:24.720> maybe<00:00:25.640> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
try and put them into play but maybe the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.999 
try and put them into play but maybe the
way<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:27.029> bought<00:00:27.300> our<00:00:27.660> execution<00:00:28.470> wasn't<00:00:28.679> right

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
way we bought our execution wasn't right

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.810 
way we bought our execution wasn't right
I<00:00:29.250> think<00:00:30.199> we<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.740> percentage<00:00:32.339> was<00:00:32.519> maybe

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
I think we the percentage was maybe

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.890 
I think we the percentage was maybe
eighty<00:00:33.690> percent<00:00:34.019> out<00:00:34.379> of<00:00:34.500> 100<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.900> execution

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
eighty percent out of 100 on execution

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.450 
eighty percent out of 100 on execution
so<00:00:37.339> like<00:00:38.339> I<00:00:38.430> said<00:00:38.629> it<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.660> cost<00:00:40.140> us<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.739> it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so like I said it is cost us and it's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.820 
so like I said it is cost us and it's
not<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.729> first<00:00:41.970> game<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.269> you<00:00:42.809> know<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.170> we

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
not the first game that you know we we

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.640 
not the first game that you know we we
are<00:00:44.010> giving<00:00:44.699> too<00:00:44.909> many<00:00:45.030> runs<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:45.629> end<00:00:45.839> it's

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
are giving too many runs at the end it's

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.369 
are giving too many runs at the end it's
also<00:00:46.769> again<00:00:47.159> as<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:48.030> two<00:00:48.210> games<00:00:48.449> that<00:00:48.629> we

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
also again as the two games that we

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.450 
also again as the two games that we
played<00:00:49.650> early<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:51.170> we<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.409> have<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.739> go<00:00:52.860> go

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
played early on so we just have to go go

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.740 
played early on so we just have to go go
and<00:00:53.640> work<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:53.970> on<00:00:54.799> our<00:00:55.799> last<00:00:56.010> 15<00:00:56.879> overs<00:00:57.239> from

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and work out on our last 15 overs from

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.920 
and work out on our last 15 overs from
to<00:00:58.019> say<00:01:01.549> it<00:01:02.549> is<00:01:03.140> if<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.379> had<00:01:04.470> boardwalk<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.930> think

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
to say it is if we had boardwalk I think

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.630 
to say it is if we had boardwalk I think
almost<00:01:07.350> all<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.830> games<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.430> played

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
almost all the games that we have played

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.740 
almost all the games that we have played
you<00:01:08.820> could<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:10.430> around<00:01:11.430> 300<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.299> just

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
you could have just around 300 or just

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.550 
you could have just around 300 or just
under<00:01:13.560> 300<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> good<00:01:16.350> positive

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
under 300 but the it's a good positive

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.530 
under 300 but the it's a good positive
for<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:16.980> team<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.730> are<00:01:17.820> bearing<00:01:18.090> wall<00:01:18.270> so

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
for the team that we are bearing wall so

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.200 
for the team that we are bearing wall so
it's<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.260> matter<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:20.210> polishing
