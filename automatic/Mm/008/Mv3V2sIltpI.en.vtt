taking a look at smash cards which have

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.920 
taking a look at smash cards which have
you<00:00:09.520> never<00:00:09.639> played<00:00:09.730> it<00:00:09.969> before<00:00:10.030> it's<00:00:10.450> a<00:00:10.540> racing

you never played it before it's a racing
game<00:00:10.959> it's<00:00:11.410> similar<00:00:11.799> on<00:00:12.039> Micro<00:00:12.340> Machines<00:00:12.459> but

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
game it's similar on Micro Machines but

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.760 
game it's similar on Micro Machines but
different<00:00:13.510> premise<00:00:13.869> meaning<00:00:14.410> that<00:00:14.500> you<00:00:14.590> don't

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
different premise meaning that you don't

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.500 
different premise meaning that you don't
have<00:00:14.830> to<00:00:14.949> get<00:00:15.070> the<00:00:15.129> points<00:00:15.549> system<00:00:16.209> and<00:00:16.390> that<00:00:16.449> a

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
have to get the points system and that a

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.420 
have to get the points system and that a
win<00:00:16.720> saw<00:00:16.960> anywhere<00:00:17.380> out<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:17.949> side<00:00:18.160> you've<00:00:18.310> got

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
win saw anywhere out the side you've got

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.980 
win saw anywhere out the side you've got
single-player<00:00:18.970> multiplayer<00:00:19.210> it's<00:00:19.780> only

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
single-player multiplayer it's only

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.600 
single-player multiplayer it's only
online<00:00:20.230> multiplayer<00:00:20.740> it's<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.250> type<00:00:21.430> of<00:00:21.460> game

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
online multiplayer it's the type of game

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.220 
online multiplayer it's the type of game
that<00:00:21.730> is<00:00:21.940> begging<00:00:22.330> for<00:00:22.360> split-screen<00:00:22.900> but

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
that is begging for split-screen but

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.810 
that is begging for split-screen but
there<00:00:23.350> isn't<00:00:23.470> any<00:00:23.740> there's<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.370> options

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
there isn't any there's the options

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.550 
there isn't any there's the options
which<00:00:25.120> the<00:00:25.300> options<00:00:25.690> are<00:00:25.870> actually<00:00:25.990> fairly

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
which the options are actually fairly

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.020 
which the options are actually fairly
decent<00:00:27.100> on<00:00:27.160> this<00:00:27.310> because<00:00:27.520> it<00:00:27.640> allows<00:00:27.850> you<00:00:28.000> to

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
decent on this because it allows you to

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.700 
decent on this because it allows you to
switch<00:00:28.270> off<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.600> motion<00:00:28.780> sensor<00:00:29.350> so<00:00:29.500> if<00:00:29.560> you

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
switch off the motion sensor so if you

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.519 
switch off the motion sensor so if you
don't<00:00:29.950> like<00:00:30.190> motion<00:00:31.000> controls<00:00:31.480> then<00:00:31.869> you<00:00:32.349> can

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
don't like motion controls then you can

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.229 
don't like motion controls then you can
switch<00:00:32.920> them<00:00:33.190> off<00:00:33.309> and<00:00:33.520> I<00:00:33.550> will<00:00:33.610> explain<00:00:34.030> what

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
switch them off and I will explain what

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.330 
switch them off and I will explain what
emotion<00:00:34.660> controls<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.290> what<00:00:35.710> then<00:00:36.190> the

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
emotion controls and what then the

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.800 
emotion controls and what then the
analog<00:00:36.790> if<00:00:36.970> you've<00:00:37.090> got<00:00:37.239> them<00:00:37.329> off<00:00:37.480> does

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
analog if you've got them off does

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.850 
analog if you've got them off does
actually<00:00:38.170> go<00:00:38.290> in<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.500> game

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
actually go in the game

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.800 
actually go in the game
you<00:00:39.160> can<00:00:39.370> choose<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:39.850> what<00:00:40.360> side<00:00:40.600> you're

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
you can choose to what side you're

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.720 
you can choose to what side you're
holding<00:00:41.230> screen<00:00:41.680> and<00:00:41.890> that<00:00:41.980> is<00:00:42.160> what<00:00:42.399> side

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
holding screen and that is what side

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.520 
holding screen and that is what side
what<00:00:42.970> size<00:00:43.270> your<00:00:43.600> hood<00:00:43.750> in<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:43.899> screen<00:00:44.140> is<00:00:44.350> and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
what size your hood in the screen is and

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.220 
what size your hood in the screen is and
choose<00:00:45.310> voice<00:00:45.579> chat<00:00:45.910> on<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:46.149> off<00:00:46.210> of<00:00:46.329> that<00:00:46.480> so

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
choose voice chat on and off of that so

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.410 
choose voice chat on and off of that so
anywhere<00:00:47.829> there's<00:00:48.280> not<00:00:48.550> actually<00:00:48.760> much<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.329> do

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
anywhere there's not actually much to do

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.729 
anywhere there's not actually much to do
on<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.660> game<00:00:49.809> there's<00:00:50.200> only<00:00:50.290> 12

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
on the game there's only 12

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.000 
on the game there's only 12
single-player<00:00:51.550> events<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.239> do<00:00:52.360> so<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.800> one

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
single-player events to do so it's one

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.979 
single-player events to do so it's one
of<00:00:54.130> those<00:00:54.250> for<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.550> price<00:00:54.850> if<00:00:55.149> you<00:00:55.420> can<00:00:55.570> find<00:00:55.809> a

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
of those for the price if you can find a

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.750 
of those for the price if you can find a
full<00:00:56.170> price<00:00:56.500> you're<00:00:56.770> gonna<00:00:57.040> feel<00:00:57.309> ripped<00:00:57.579> off

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
full price you're gonna feel ripped off

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.790 
full price you're gonna feel ripped off
because<00:00:58.030> it<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.570> type<00:00:58.719> of<00:00:58.750> game<00:00:59.020> that<00:00:59.590> I'm

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
because it is the type of game that I'm

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.260 
because it is the type of game that I'm
positive<00:01:00.130> they're<00:01:00.550> just<00:01:00.700> gonna<00:01:00.790> release<00:01:01.059> a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
positive they're just gonna release a

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.940 
positive they're just gonna release a
horse<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.840> thing<00:01:02.050> I'll<00:01:02.170> say<00:01:02.379> at<00:01:02.500> some<00:01:02.710> point

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
horse the thing I'll say at some point

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.829 
horse the thing I'll say at some point
maybe<00:01:03.399> we'll<00:01:03.640> do<00:01:03.760> another<00:01:03.910> island<00:01:04.479> like<00:01:04.629> what

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
maybe we'll do another island like what

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.929 
maybe we'll do another island like what
burnout<00:01:05.229> did<00:01:05.500> something<00:01:06.100> like<00:01:06.189> that<00:01:06.250> because

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
burnout did something like that because

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.090 
burnout did something like that because
this<00:01:07.420> island<00:01:07.810> only<00:01:07.929> has<00:01:08.109> twelve<00:01:08.439> races<00:01:08.619> on<00:01:08.950> it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
this island only has twelve races on it

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.580 
this island only has twelve races on it
so<00:01:09.459> you'll<00:01:09.999> beat<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:10.509> a<00:01:10.630> couple<00:01:11.229> of<00:01:11.289> hours

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
so you'll beat it in a couple of hours

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.010 
so you'll beat it in a couple of hours
and<00:01:11.789> it<00:01:12.789> hasn't<00:01:12.969> even<00:01:13.119> got<00:01:13.420> any<00:01:13.569> major

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
and it hasn't even got any major

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.719 
and it hasn't even got any major
unlockables<00:01:14.859> that<00:01:15.039> will<00:01:15.159> keep<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:15.520> playing

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
unlockables that will keep you playing

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
because pretty much by getting twelve

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.169 
because pretty much by getting twelve
goals<00:01:17.679> you'll<00:01:18.069> get<00:01:18.399> pretty<00:01:18.759> much<00:01:18.909> all<00:01:19.090> the

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
ward and the whole point is just well

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.739 
ward and the whole point is just well
reassess<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.859> win<00:01:33.069> so<00:01:33.759> anyway<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.539> things

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749 
reassess and win so anyway the things

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:36.149 
reassess and win so anyway the things
that<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:34.929> can<00:01:35.049> do<00:01:35.200> you<00:01:35.380> can<00:01:35.529> use<00:01:35.709> Night<00:01:35.950> Raw

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
that you can do you can use Night Raw

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.219 
that you can do you can use Night Raw
which<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.609> can<00:01:36.789> gain<00:01:36.969> nitro<00:01:37.389> by<00:01:37.599> doing<00:01:37.869> stunts

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
which you can gain nitro by doing stunts

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.839 
which you can gain nitro by doing stunts
and<00:01:38.380> crashing<00:01:38.619> into<00:01:38.829> things<00:01:38.859> and<00:01:39.279> that's

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:39.849 
and crashing into things and that's

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.999 
and crashing into things and that's
where<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.630> motion<00:01:40.959> controls<00:01:41.319> come<00:01:41.499> in<00:01:41.619> the

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
where the motion controls come in the

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.620 
where the motion controls come in the
motion<00:01:42.340> controls<00:01:42.759> are<00:01:42.880> actually<00:01:43.209> better<00:01:43.389> and

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
motion controls are actually better and

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.149 
motion controls are actually better and
more<00:01:43.749> responsive<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.319> do<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.740> stunts

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
more responsive to do the stunts

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.129 
more responsive to do the stunts
however<00:01:45.789> it's<00:01:46.149> slightly<00:01:46.569> harder<00:01:46.840> aligned

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:47.139 
however it's slightly harder aligned

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.409 
however it's slightly harder aligned
with<00:01:47.319> them<00:01:47.469> up<00:01:47.590> north<00:01:47.829> but<00:01:48.459> the<00:01:48.609> analog<00:01:48.999> it's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:49.419 
with them up north but the analog it's

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:52.440 
with them up north but the analog it's
easier<00:01:49.749> land<00:01:50.049> but<00:01:50.349> you've<00:01:50.529> very<00:01:51.219> very<00:01:51.579> hard

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
easier land but you've very very hard

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.510 
easier land but you've very very hard
time<00:01:52.749> at<00:01:52.959> getting<00:01:53.200> our<00:01:53.349> five<00:01:53.679> stars<00:01:54.039> which<00:01:54.279> is

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
time at getting our five stars which is

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.249 
time at getting our five stars which is
pretty<00:01:55.090> much<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.359> whole<00:01:55.599> point<00:01:55.869> of<00:01:55.929> doing<00:01:56.079> the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
pretty much the whole point of doing the

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.569 
pretty much the whole point of doing the
stunts<00:01:56.529> because<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.859> have<00:01:57.009> to<00:01:57.130> em<00:01:57.310> for

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
stunts because you have to em for

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.370 
stunts because you have to em for
getting<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.849> five<00:01:58.060> stars<00:01:58.419> every<00:01:58.689> time

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
getting the five stars every time

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.109 
getting the five stars every time
you<00:01:59.500> can<00:01:59.710> via<00:02:00.040> Strax<00:02:00.369> forwards<00:02:00.790> and<00:02:00.880> backwards

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
you can via Strax forwards and backwards

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.910 
you can via Strax forwards and backwards
it<00:02:01.509> just<00:02:01.719> pretty<00:02:01.899> much<00:02:01.960> swaps<00:02:02.409> them<00:02:02.560> all<00:02:02.710> back

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
it just pretty much swaps them all back

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.560 
it just pretty much swaps them all back
because<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.640> one<00:02:03.850> here<00:02:04.030> I'm<00:02:04.149> coming<00:02:04.360> through

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
because this one here I'm coming through

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.109 
because this one here I'm coming through
yes<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:04.960> backwards<00:02:05.409> I<00:02:05.469> believe<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.039> on<00:02:06.789> one

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
yes and backwards I believe and on one

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.339 
yes and backwards I believe and on one
of<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.240> other<00:02:07.390> events<00:02:07.780> obviously<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:08.170> makes

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
of the other events obviously it makes

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.070 
of the other events obviously it makes
you<00:02:08.500> go<00:02:08.619> forward<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.819> kind<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.360> cheats<00:02:10.869> you

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
you go forward so it kind of cheats you

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.540 
you go forward so it kind of cheats you
in<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.349> way<00:02:11.500> as<00:02:11.680> well<00:02:11.860> because<00:02:12.280> there<00:02:12.459> aren't

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
in that way as well because there aren't

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.220 
in that way as well because there aren't
that<00:02:12.849> many<00:02:12.910> tracks<00:02:13.420> it's<00:02:13.690> just<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.110> can

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
that many tracks it's just that you can

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.930 
that many tracks it's just that you can
play<00:02:14.380> them<00:02:14.560> forwards<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:14.950> backwards<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.760> at

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
play them forwards and backwards but at

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.460 
play them forwards and backwards but at
just<00:02:19.239> speaking<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.959> tracks<00:02:20.230> it's

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
just speaking of the tracks it's

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.470 
just speaking of the tracks it's
basically<00:02:20.800> one<00:02:21.099> big<00:02:21.130> track<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.000> then<00:02:22.180> it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
basically one big track and then it

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.570 
basically one big track and then it
split<00:02:22.870> up<00:02:23.019> into<00:02:23.290> three<00:02:23.590> smaller<00:02:23.890> sections<00:02:24.400> and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
split up into three smaller sections and

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.339 
split up into three smaller sections and
then<00:02:24.730> you've<00:02:24.849> got<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> big<00:02:25.269> board<00:02:25.540> as<00:02:25.690> well<00:02:25.810> so

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
then you've got the big board as well so

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.320 
then you've got the big board as well so
technically<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.340> sport<00:02:27.640> tracks<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.150> can

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
technically the sport tracks and you can

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.550 
technically the sport tracks and you can
play<00:02:28.480> them<00:02:28.630> forward<00:02:28.930> them<00:02:29.050> backwards<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.530> that

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
play them forward them backwards on that

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.309 
play them forward them backwards on that
and<00:02:29.860> then<00:02:30.700> there's<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:31.120> different<00:02:31.750> boards

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
and then there's just different boards

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.539 
and then there's just different boards
this<00:02:32.530> one<00:02:32.769> I'm<00:02:32.890> on<00:02:32.950> at<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.160> moment<00:02:33.280> is

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
this one I'm on at the moment is

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.400 
this one I'm on at the moment is
Eliminator<00:02:34.030> where<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.330> whole<00:02:34.480> point<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.870> yeah

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
Eliminator where the whole point is yeah

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.080 
Eliminator where the whole point is yeah
what<00:02:35.769> are<00:02:35.890> pretty<00:02:36.069> much<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.400> end<00:02:36.519> first<00:02:36.790> place

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
what are pretty much the end first place

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.150 
what are pretty much the end first place
through<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.480> entire<00:02:37.750> base<00:02:38.019> because<00:02:38.470> every

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
through the entire base because every

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.440 
through the entire base because every
now<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.430> then<00:02:39.549> someone<00:02:40.030> will<00:02:40.180> just<00:02:40.239> get

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
now and then someone will just get

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.640 
now and then someone will just get
eliminated<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.110> if<00:02:41.260> you're<00:02:41.410> in<00:02:41.620> that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
eliminated and if you're in that

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.650 
eliminated and if you're in that
eliminating<00:02:42.250> spot<00:02:42.519> you're<00:02:42.880> dead<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.360> lose

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
eliminating spot you're dead you lose

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.559 
eliminating spot you're dead you lose
you<00:02:43.989> start<00:02:44.290> again<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:45.220> it's<00:02:45.910> just<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.209> standard

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
you start again so it's just a standard

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.059 
you start again so it's just a standard
rear<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.049> plays<00:02:47.319> really<00:02:47.590> well<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
rear so it plays really well the

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.670 
rear so it plays really well the
controls<00:02:48.519> work<00:02:48.760> perfectly<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.720> handling<00:02:50.530> and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
controls work perfectly the handling and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.770 
controls work perfectly the handling and
everything's<00:02:50.980> good<00:02:51.250> it's<00:02:51.579> just<00:02:51.940> an<00:02:52.299> excellent

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
everything's good it's just an excellent

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.089 
everything's good it's just an excellent
way<00:02:52.900> assay<00:02:53.200> it's<00:02:53.380> just<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.650> shame<00:02:53.799> about<00:02:53.920> the

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
way assay it's just a shame about the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.559 
way assay it's just a shame about the
price<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.579> how<00:02:54.760> little<00:02:54.940> content<00:02:55.360> there<00:02:55.480> is

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
price and how little content there is

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.660 
price and how little content there is
and<00:02:55.780> how<00:02:56.140> there's<00:02:56.410> no<00:02:56.560> split<00:02:57.400> screen

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
and how there's no split screen

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.949 
and how there's no split screen
multiplayer<00:02:57.970> cuz<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.599> is<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.780> type<00:02:58.930> of

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
multiplayer cuz this is the type of

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.569 
multiplayer cuz this is the type of
thing<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.349> I'd<00:02:59.440> love<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.680> play<00:02:59.950> with<00:03:00.160> me

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
thing that I'd love to play with me

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.190 
thing that I'd love to play with me
bullets<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.209> don't<00:03:01.269> see<00:03:01.690> why<00:03:01.870> there<00:03:02.079> isn't

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
bullets and I don't see why there isn't

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.900 
bullets and I don't see why there isn't
split-screen<00:03:02.650> multiplayer<00:03:03.069> because<00:03:03.640> it's

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
split-screen multiplayer because it's

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.120 
split-screen multiplayer because it's
not<00:03:04.060> as<00:03:04.180> if<00:03:04.299> you've<00:03:05.049> got<00:03:05.500> all<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.829> stuff<00:03:06.040> on

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
not as if you've got all the stuff on

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.770 
not as if you've got all the stuff on
the<00:03:06.220> screen<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.760> exactly<00:03:07.000> gonna<00:03:07.329> be<00:03:07.480> hard<00:03:07.690> to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
the screen is exactly gonna be hard to

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.449 
the screen is exactly gonna be hard to
see<00:03:08.109> on<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.260> smaller<00:03:08.590> screen<00:03:08.799> it's<00:03:09.100> not<00:03:09.160> as<00:03:09.340> if

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
see on a smaller screen it's not as if

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.580 
see on a smaller screen it's not as if
you<00:03:09.549> need<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.819> all<00:03:09.940> there<00:03:10.180> because<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:11.410> could

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
you need it all there because you could

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.020 
you need it all there because you could
have<00:03:11.650> quite<00:03:11.859> easily<00:03:12.040> taking<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.579> long<00:03:12.730> time<00:03:13.000> I

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
have quite easily taking a long time I

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.550 
have quite easily taking a long time I
hope<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.420> just<00:03:13.569> put<00:03:13.720> position<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.290> how<00:03:14.350> many

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
hope and just put position and how many

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.559 
hope and just put position and how many
laps<00:03:14.739> so<00:03:14.950> on<00:03:15.100> kept<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.880> stars<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.359> night

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
laps so on kept the stars on the night

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.330 
laps so on kept the stars on the night
bombing<00:03:16.810> as<00:03:17.109> so<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.889> could<00:03:18.160> have<00:03:18.250> easily

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
bombing as so that could have easily

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.550 
bombing as so that could have easily
split<00:03:18.730> up<00:03:18.910> into<00:03:19.060> four<00:03:21.900> well<00:03:22.900> I've<00:03:23.139> mentioned

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
split up into four well I've mentioned

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.930 
split up into four well I've mentioned
the<00:03:23.620> unlockables<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:24.549> is<00:03:24.670> basically

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
the unlockables so this is basically

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.699 
the unlockables so this is basically
what<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.329> there's<00:03:25.720> three<00:03:25.870> different<00:03:26.079> card

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
what it is there's three different card

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.229 
what it is there's three different card
types<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.400> each<00:03:27.850> of<00:03:28.000> them<00:03:28.120> has<00:03:28.209> different

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
types and each of them has different

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.629 
types and each of them has different
things<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:28.959> this<00:03:29.049> one's<00:03:29.319> mainly<00:03:30.100> handling<00:03:30.519> and

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
things so this one's mainly handling and

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.800 
things so this one's mainly handling and
strength<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.209> one's<00:03:31.480> me<00:03:31.630> on<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
strength this one's me on the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.360 
strength this one's me on the
acceleration<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.440> speed<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.920> this<00:03:32.980> one's<00:03:33.250> a

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
acceleration and speed and this one's a

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.430 
acceleration and speed and this one's a
mix<00:03:33.579> of<00:03:33.730> all<00:03:33.850> four<00:03:34.120> then<00:03:34.840> you've<00:03:35.230> got

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
mix of all four then you've got

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.629 
mix of all four then you've got
different<00:03:35.620> shells<00:03:36.040> that<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.220> can<00:03:36.400> unlock

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
different shells that you can unlock

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.120 
different shells that you can unlock
which<00:03:36.910> again<00:03:37.329> change<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.290> acceleration<00:03:38.650> and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
which again change the acceleration and

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.430 
which again change the acceleration and
stuff<00:03:39.370> but<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.209> can<00:03:40.359> also<00:03:40.510> edit<00:03:40.930> them<00:03:41.290> by

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
stuff but you can also edit them by

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.379 
stuff but you can also edit them by
going<00:03:41.620> into<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.920> pinboard<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.239> what

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
going into a pinboard and this is what

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.729 
going into a pinboard and this is what
the<00:03:43.480> unlockables<00:03:43.930> are<00:03:44.079> you<00:03:44.170> can<00:03:44.319> unlock<00:03:44.530> new

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
the unlockables are you can unlock new

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.890 
the unlockables are you can unlock new
decals<00:03:45.280> new<00:03:45.459> glass<00:03:45.940> types<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.510> stuff<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:46.810> can

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
decals new glass types and stuff you can

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.990 
decals new glass types and stuff you can
edit<00:03:47.170> your<00:03:47.290> colors<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:48.010> just<00:03:48.519> stuff<00:03:48.790> like

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
edit your colors and just stuff like

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.990 
edit your colors and just stuff like
that<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.959> that's<00:03:50.799> why<00:03:51.459> I'm<00:03:51.639> saying<00:03:51.850> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
that so that's why I'm saying the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.910 
that so that's why I'm saying the
unlockables<00:03:52.480> aren't<00:03:52.690> exactly<00:03:52.930> anything<00:03:53.200> to

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
unlockables aren't exactly anything to

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.319 
unlockables aren't exactly anything to
keep<00:03:54.100> you<00:03:54.250> coming<00:03:54.430> back<00:03:54.519> because<00:03:54.880> once<00:03:55.180> you've

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
keep you coming back because once you've

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.030 
keep you coming back because once you've
beat<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.750> there's<00:03:55.989> not<00:03:56.139> really<00:03:56.349> much<00:03:56.590> point<00:03:56.650> in

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
beat it there's not really much point in

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.160 
beat it there's not really much point in
unlocking<00:03:57.549> all<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.790> skins<00:03:58.090> unless<00:03:58.870> you<00:03:59.019> are<00:03:59.139> a

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
unlocking all the skins unless you are a

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.740 
unlocking all the skins unless you are a
completionist<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:00.609> hopefully<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.389> will<00:04:01.510> be

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
completionist so hopefully that will be

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.720 
completionist so hopefully that will be
DLC<00:04:02.260> hopefully<00:04:02.769> it'll<00:04:02.889> be<00:04:03.040> reasonably<00:04:03.489> priced

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
DLC hopefully it'll be reasonably priced

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.520 
DLC hopefully it'll be reasonably priced
and<00:04:03.970> hopefully<00:04:04.359> it<00:04:04.540> will<00:04:04.690> be<00:04:04.840> bigger<00:04:05.109> than<00:04:05.410> the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
and hopefully it will be bigger than the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.860 
and hopefully it will be bigger than the
actual<00:04:05.799> game<00:04:05.950> because<00:04:06.819> it<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.269> screaming<00:04:07.840> for

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
actual game because it is screaming for

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.629 
actual game because it is screaming for
more<00:04:08.109> content<00:04:08.380> because<00:04:08.919> it's<00:04:09.009> a<00:04:09.070> fantastic

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
more content because it's a fantastic

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.010 
more content because it's a fantastic
game<00:04:09.790> as<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.900> see<00:04:11.049> it<00:04:11.199> it<00:04:11.410> plays

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
game as I see it it plays

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.870 
game as I see it it plays
and<00:04:12.140> handles<00:04:12.470> well<00:04:12.650> as<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.220> can<00:04:13.370> see<00:04:13.520> it<00:04:13.670> looks

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
and handles well as you can see it looks

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.360 
and handles well as you can see it looks
great<00:04:14.240> and<00:04:14.540> sound<00:04:15.140> wise<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:15.740> think<00:04:15.770> it<00:04:16.100> sounds

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
great and sound wise I think it sounds

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.530 
great and sound wise I think it sounds
really<00:04:16.430> good<00:04:16.760> so<00:04:16.940> I'm<00:04:17.000> just<00:04:17.180> gonna<00:04:17.300> shut<00:04:17.420> up

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
really good so I'm just gonna shut up

00:04:17.540 --> 00:05:09.690 
really good so I'm just gonna shut up
for<00:04:17.690> a<00:04:17.720> bit

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.580 

so<00:05:10.390> there<00:05:10.540> we<00:05:10.660> go<00:05:10.690> oven<00:05:10.990> that's<00:05:11.260> better<00:05:11.470> than

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
so there we go oven that's better than

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.260 
so there we go oven that's better than
music<00:05:11.950> there's<00:05:12.430> not<00:05:12.610> really<00:05:12.760> much<00:05:12.940> left<00:05:13.210> to

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
music there's not really much left to

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.850 
music there's not really much left to
mention<00:05:13.720> you<00:05:13.960> might<00:05:14.110> just<00:05:14.350> saw<00:05:14.530> that<00:05:14.650> you<00:05:14.710> can

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
mention you might just saw that you can

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.620 
mention you might just saw that you can
drift<00:05:15.160> that's<00:05:15.430> another<00:05:15.670> way<00:05:15.820> to<00:05:15.940> get<00:05:16.090> turbos

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
drift that's another way to get turbos

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.870 
drift that's another way to get turbos
and<00:05:16.870> night<00:05:17.020> was<00:05:17.260> enough<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:18.520> other<00:05:18.640> thing

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
and night was enough and the other thing

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.180 
the game it is a fantastic game but it's
way<00:05:52.750> overpriced<00:05:53.080> or<00:05:53.500> what<00:05:53.620> you<00:05:53.710> get<00:05:53.890> and<00:05:54.070> it's
