00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.859
 a good two weeks ago and worked on the highway 1 a truck of the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.340
 Mikhail Chloride had a substance declared dangerous 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.339
 Large amounts of the substance must be seeped into the ground causing damage to the material 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:13.889
 Environment was considerable 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.330
 Every day then trucks with such dangerous goods on the streets in the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.380
 As a result, several hundred thousand tons become more explosive in the Bergisch Land every year 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.829
 Cargo transported across the region 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.909
 The legal requirements for this are becoming strict but constant 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.289
 renewed for this reason has today the IHK wuppertal-solingen-remscheid 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.129
 Forwarders in the region informed about new conditions 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.830
 to help prevent accidents in the future 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.950
 For about 20 years it is old the regulation for the transport of dangerous goods 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.100
 These pictures are there again and again if Bülow played through but one 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.819
 Dangerous goods transport crashed 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:48.510
 the consequences are often drastic 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.650
 The last case in Bergisches Land two weeks ago is divorced 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.390
 MITAC he pours himself over the a 1 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.960
 Hazardous goods from solvents to highly toxic chemicals Digel 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.380
 Industry needs and produces in abundance 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.380
 But the company alone raises about 37,000 tons of dangerous goods per year 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.380
 the street 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.810
 In order to avoid risks working five games have Zion together also 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.680
 Dangerous goods are specialized 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.000
 Drivers without dangerous goods training appropriate proof can me 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.920
 not only on the site 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.570
 The tanker trucks are also considered relatively safe 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.850
 too obvious are the risks for all concerned 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.390
 For years, the smaller ones were always the problem for companies 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.080
 Higher safety requirements of the legislator caused high costs 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.170
 the forwarding company Monfort did not belong to the problem children as a company 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.530
 250 truck trains nationwide 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.179
 who can not afford bad news 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.429
 That is why they pay attention to compliance with Niebels' own declarations 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.649
 the regulations 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.649
 before each single use Prof 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.049
 we have the vehicles 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.970
 according to each from Brussels 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.290
 who from the direction of Nuremberg personal protective equipment 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.820
 the toolbox for motorcycle tours why the faithful 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.980
 the GVS Schiller 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.260
 The wm crown is attached to other occupations item 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.760
 We will then have to be charged if they risk Godin 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.760
 charged for labeling 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:16.629
 In addition, our staff becomes the legally required school 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.649
 annually trained in-house 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:23.429
 According to theory, hardly anything can go wrong here should one think so 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.410
 but danger points can not be excluded it is not enough in the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.029
 Bergisches Land 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:34.159
 because where trucks have to use such roads, the risks are close to a gradient 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.040
 of ten percent are not uncommon a failure of the brakes one would like 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.499
 hardly think even here without dangerous goods on the loading area 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.499
 but the dangerous goods commissioned weighed 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.119
 the topography theirs 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:54.289
 which makes special demands about formally also the organizer was not 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.469
 underestimate 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.289
 Weller guinea pig aggravating form 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.450
 the accused 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.729
 Become women 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.989
 but there was just track coach Schröder with outrageous 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.579
 this confluence with phenomena indicates a very different problem 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.279
 because despite always more detailed and dangerous goods regulations many smaller ones 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.709
 Shipping companies are struggling to survive with dangerous consequences 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.829
 Rally drive over the social regulations and try percent 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.099
 with shrill staffing to maximize sales 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.769
 Because of the cost as well as this trade is im immense 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.039
 To survive, game becomes tense York - more so hip 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.019
 that means it really only there if the big before companies the 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.810
 Standards decency meet 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.909
 as long as the black sheep of the industry are on the street 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.969
 safety is often left behind 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:43.739
