00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
of these together before so the first

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.070 
of these together before so the first
time<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.850> but<00:01:14.150> all<00:01:14.330> I<00:01:14.360> did<00:01:14.830> turn<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:15.980> outside

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080

these<00:01:18.080> are<00:01:18.260> nipples<00:01:18.760> sadly<00:01:19.760> and<00:01:20.300> you<00:01:20.390> get<00:01:20.570> your

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
these are nipples sadly and you get your

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.680 
these are nipples sadly and you get your
black<00:01:20.840> piped<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:22.190> obviously<00:01:22.580> this<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.450> where

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
black piped and obviously this is where

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.120 
black piped and obviously this is where
your<00:01:23.840> money<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.110> at<00:01:24.350> most<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.830> money<00:01:25.010> is

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
your money is at most of the money is

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.540 
your money is at most of the money is
that<00:01:25.160> right<00:01:26.030> here<00:01:26.240> my<00:01:26.780> thinking<00:01:27.230> is<00:01:27.440> this<00:01:28.340> way

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
that right here my thinking is this way

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.270 
that right here my thinking is this way
it's<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.730> little<00:01:28.760> bit<00:01:29.030> cleaner<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:30.950> more

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
it's a little bit cleaner it is more

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.280 
it's a little bit cleaner it is more
portable<00:01:31.640> that's<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.480> purpose<00:01:32.810> for<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.140> is<00:01:33.260> a

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
portable that's the purpose for it is a

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.800 
portable that's the purpose for it is a
portable<00:01:33.650> part<00:01:34.040> this<00:01:35.030> way<00:01:35.240> you<00:01:35.300> can<00:01:35.510> kind<00:01:35.780> of

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
portable part this way you can kind of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.480 
portable part this way you can kind of
take<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.020> camping<00:01:36.440> or<00:01:36.560> whatnot<00:01:36.710> just<00:01:37.250> way<00:01:37.370> it's

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
take a camping or whatnot just way it's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.440 
take a camping or whatnot just way it's
not<00:01:37.640> going<00:01:37.730> to<00:01:37.820> hurt<00:01:37.940> anything<00:01:38.180> in<00:01:38.390> the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
not going to hurt anything in the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.880 
not going to hurt anything in the
process<00:01:38.810> but<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.020> can<00:01:39.170> also<00:01:39.290> adjust<00:01:39.470> the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
process but you can also adjust the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.090 
process but you can also adjust the
height<00:01:41.110> individually<00:01:42.110> on<00:01:42.290> all<00:01:42.650> four<00:01:42.950> of<00:01:42.980> these

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
height individually on all four of these

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.940 
height individually on all four of these
legs<00:01:43.400> I<00:01:43.640> just<00:01:44.090> smashed<00:01:44.870> down<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.409> my<00:01:45.530> ball<00:01:45.740> peen

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
legs I just smashed down to my ball peen

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.690 
legs I just smashed down to my ball peen
hammer<00:01:45.980> right<00:01:46.700> here<00:01:46.940> made<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.630> level<00:01:47.990> surface

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
hammer right here made a level surface

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.100 
hammer right here made a level surface
nothing<00:01:49.700> was<00:01:49.850> perfect<00:01:50.300> I'm<00:01:50.690> not<00:01:50.750> an<00:01:50.990> engineer

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
nothing was perfect I'm not an engineer

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.250 
nothing was perfect I'm not an engineer
I'm<00:01:51.560> just<00:01:51.770> some<00:01:51.950> some<00:01:52.880> dude<00:01:53.140> here's<00:01:54.140> the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
I'm just some some dude here's the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.750 
I'm just some some dude here's the
bottom<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:54.650> it<00:01:54.770> descent<00:01:55.130> has<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:55.250> white<00:01:55.490> paint

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
bottom of it descent has a white paint

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.840 
bottom of it descent has a white paint
which<00:01:55.970> is<00:01:56.530> what<00:01:57.530> was<00:01:57.680> on<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.190> washer<00:01:58.640> I

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
which is what was on the washer I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.750 
which is what was on the washer I
figured<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.540> will<00:01:59.690> let<00:01:59.900> it<00:02:00.020> chip<00:02:00.920> off<00:02:01.130> or<00:02:01.370> burn

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
figured I will let it chip off or burn

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.420 
figured I will let it chip off or burn
away<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.960> then<00:02:03.260> I'll<00:02:03.380> paint<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:03.830> up<00:02:03.950> if<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.220> want

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
away and then I'll paint it up if I want

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.649 
away and then I'll paint it up if I want
to<00:02:04.640> but<00:02:05.630> it's<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.620> simple<00:02:06.860> project<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:08.509> nice

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659

the<00:02:23.540> advantage<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.680> feel<00:02:25.120> compared<00:02:26.120> to

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
the advantage to this I feel compared to

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.000 
the advantage to this I feel compared to
say<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.840> front<00:02:27.200> loading<00:02:27.500> ones<00:02:27.710> what<00:02:27.890> I've

here is thin the other ones come out
about<00:02:34.970> right<00:02:35.180> here<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.510> that's<00:02:35.660> just<00:02:35.900> because

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
about right here and that's just because

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.440 
about right here and that's just because
that's<00:02:37.130> supposed<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.580> hold<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.000> water<00:02:38.210> and

the clothes on a front-loading style
that's<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:40.880> main<00:02:41.090> purpose<00:02:41.510> but<00:02:42.050> you<00:02:42.140> figure

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
that's this main purpose but you figure

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.590 
that's this main purpose but you figure
down<00:02:42.530> here<00:02:42.860> you've<00:02:43.010> got<00:02:43.220> ear<00:02:43.460> holes<00:02:43.730> all<00:02:44.270> along

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
down here you've got ear holes all along

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
here you're going to get a good burn

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.500

when you're having your fire but at the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.320 
when you're having your fire but at the
same<00:02:50.630> time<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.320> advantage<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:51.890> feel<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.670> that

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
same time the advantage I feel is that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.110 
same time the advantage I feel is that
it's<00:02:54.260> not<00:02:54.440> going<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.650> fall<00:02:54.830> over<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.940> nice
