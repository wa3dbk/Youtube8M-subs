00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 i 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.320
 very good back kids and welcome 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.510
 to a new video of 10-3 we are here in 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.029
 the main menu as you already know in the 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.700
 event selection menu we enter 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.890
 which we are currently running that 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.290
 it's the brembo blast and we're going to do today 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.930
 a trip showcase as you are seeing in 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.390
 screen you get three bronze medals 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.400
 silver gold and platinum and it comes 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.800
 simply to go on a circuit of 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.510
 tip to tip of the circuit skidding and 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.309
 getting the most points 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.450
 possible based on those points that 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:43.579
 we will get a medal of 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.589
 bronze silver gold or platinum 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.120
 let's run with this for the truth 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.920
 that is a pass and we are going to touch a 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.960
 little in this if the car settings 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.030
 I do not really know if I'm going to do it right or 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.739
 not if there are any who understand more than 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.309
 this for example leave in the comments 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.809
 and tell me if I'm playing well but 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.939
 I'm going to lower it a bit I 'm going to put it 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.460
 little more to rande the ground to be able 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.430
 skid better and have a little more 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.320
 aerodynamic load on the vehicle and 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.640
 we are going to touch then the theme of 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.590
 exchange ratio will put something 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.680
 the shorter the downforce the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.500
 we upload the suspension also the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.590
 differential also a little dot and the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.530
 braking cast we are going to put 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.750
 in this way as you see the car has 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.210
 lowered and good let's start the event 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.570
 Let's see how we are doing, I hope it comes out 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.990
 all right 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.990
 we give away 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.560
 right 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.659
 this lad 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.659
 Hello 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.910
 to the shipping mother of mine 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.010
 I go mobile 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.010
 a whore 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.100
 some for her go there for 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.349
 there but 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.849
 because last gave me last 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.390
 the boy come come come come come come 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.390
 let's go let's go 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.740
 10,000 points 10,000 points 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.020
 come come with two eggs fuck 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.410
 go of the palladium in treatment would have 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.770
 let come come vega 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:41.720
 here 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:44.600
 and now 12,680 points the new ones 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.760
 platinum facts that are 15,000 but good 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.610
 it's not bad the truth is that you have 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.050
 elements of those not very long are 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.270
 races of these short cuts but the 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.160
 truth is that it is worth the 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.660
 worth seeing them and on the other side of the cinema is 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.480
 how good you already know that events 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.400
 there were 11 are long are short will have 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.880
 that will be 10 minutes and they will have to 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.530
 will be 5 have almost I have then 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.660
 distributed all events by 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.940
 separate and at the time of for example 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.800
 make a playlist with 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.280
 all the videos of everything that would be the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.990
 campaign mode is to say three then it's a lot 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.460
 more comfortable and simple to see them in this 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.620
 way I do not see maybe two or three 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.600
 rallyes within a single video there 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.980
 when they do not weigh themselves too much they are 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.750
 too long has nothing to do 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.790
 one with the other and I like to have it like that 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.190
 a bit separated to be able to some 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.290
 way to have everything more ordered vouchers 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.030
 it's the way I see and the way 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.430
 that I like to work in climbing the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.810
 videos, if not in a way, then 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.700
 I say ordered separately 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.260
 if someone someday wants to see the list 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.300
 of reproduction then I have everything 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.739
 go ahead in an easy and simple way 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.739
 well, nothing we continue 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.410
 and to see at what level of reputation we 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.630
 place at this time 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.310
 we were in the room so we'll go to 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.600
 fifth gold when we did not arrive but we 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.600
 we are there justitos 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.700
 and now let's see the next event 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.170
 that touches us that is the end already as 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.580
 you are looking there on the right that is the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.200
 final blas and nothing we see in the 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.860
 next video in enamel is a greeting 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.860
 see you later
