00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.419
 and then gang beauty also again 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.969
 together to continue learning the common 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:14.460
 with us the magician in the layers method in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.270
 previous teaches how to mount our cross 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.080
 there and hit the sides of the slope 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:28.550
 corresponding colors and if the last lesson 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:32.730
 We'll learn how to ride the kines. 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.570
 and I already agreed to leave to finish 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.699
 to ride our own as a right magician is a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.989
 It is important to know the following if 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:45.539
 you finished Montaos the only cross here 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:51.390
 and the city and then hit the sides 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.690
 with the right colors and parts of the machine 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.069
 already fallen in the correct position you go 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:04.470
 skip this formula that I will pass 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:07.350
 now but as you will know how to quote the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.630
 the correct position of the following 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:17.160
 for example here would be the one that would be 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.650
 silver blue and red white piece 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.640
 she could have invested here but would have 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.890
 have blue and red white that this 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.660
 ask here 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:33.960
 okay to bring beauty Since then she's in 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.540
 now she's in the right place, but the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.080
 undo my cross to lower the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:47.040
 15 which was right side and can 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:52.440
 the four cups of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.450
 two certain two so 2 as well 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.790
 one loose right 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.290
 Okay, I'm going to assume that it's not 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.780
 There's nobody right here, right from wrong. 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.700
 wrong 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.810
 however I will hold the body that way 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.280
 if you had someone right to a right piece 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.970
 I was going to leave here 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:20.459
 This is the formula in this formula. 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:24.600
 if the right timetable top of 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:28.920
 Time left fight time 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.980
 the right time counterclockwise up 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.510
 time and hourly right 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.569
 This one is still wrong here. 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.480
 remains wrong here remains wrong and 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.050
 This is the certainty seeing now that I 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.090
 I'm right, I'll hold the 1 in this way. 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.459
 in this right column the piece that is 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.750
 certain 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:57.959
 I'll repeat the formula if you live 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.720
 voter and night time left 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.380
 counterclockwise in the anti right time 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.840
 time and counterclockwise and left 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.120
 hourly 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.160
 Then I see I got this continuous 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.030
 Certainly I am also right. 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.630
 this one is also right or white green and 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:23.250
 red white green and red 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:28.350
 This one is blue and red white too. 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.230
 white and blue and red personal beauty 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.560
 we cross the sides all right and 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.690
 the parts are already in place 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.690
 now is the last step 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.150
 if I had mounted macro if I had 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:49.040
 fallen pieces already right so I already 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.040
 would leave for this time now beauty 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.180
 this step is as follows 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.120
 is the first formula is as if it were the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.299
 first way, the difference is that 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.650
 the other is in the other form in the 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:09.290
 first family I hit the cnec 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.120
 I turned cube like I wanted it now 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:17.709
 now I can do this do the 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:20.630
 next I make this fame here what it is 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.080
 right did not have low time 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.650
 counter-clockwise 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.650
 schedule 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:36.680
 I could not hit it, I repeat. 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:40.220
 I repeat until you see that the piece is not 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.919
 I got it right until I hit the formula 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.490
 it's underneath you only copy the hit or 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:49.970
 Did not mention it even if I hit people 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:55.180
 It concluded the way now I'll hit me 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.180
 I have to finish the boot, come on. 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.570
 to be you 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:06.349
 but I have concluded the right formula 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:10.789
 because otherwise it will go wrong then there 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:12.770
 Guys, now I accept that, I'll go. 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.539
 next pro is wrong right? 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.330
 but I can not get here to start 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:21.130
 otherwise I'll go there all the time 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:28.720
 again I do my taco or wrong 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:28.720
 That's wrong, right? Do it again. 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.880
 this is how you remember 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:44.960
 I did the following I did the formula for 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:47.930
 hit this one x made and arrived at that 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.420
 time there that I finished doing here 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.870
 I got it right and then I had to 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.400
 finish formula right there I bring 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.620
 wrong next to here 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.790
 Then I do the same thing again as 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:05.950
 It's only copy right there. 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:09.020
 then you guys 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.550
 I hope you liked the classes there. 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.360
 right 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.610
 who could not mount and have some 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.350
 difficulty can send an email can 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:24.170
 leave a comment here that I'm going to 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.450
 as far as possible to avoid personal injury 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:30.590
 anyone who wants an equal cube means the whistle 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:32.690
 to fit such that it has spring and linen 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:37.070
 stop theft 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:41.350
 the pieces are all colored in teaching 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.830
 those annoying stickers like here 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:49.040
 going out 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:53.360
 This contact is not so good 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.510
 he was looking for a bit of anger or 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.900
 learn but who wants an equal that 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:04.040
 here I'll leave the link in the description 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.860
 the video is just access there and get the 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.750
 cube beauty personal 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.430
 So that hug any doubt can 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:14.290
