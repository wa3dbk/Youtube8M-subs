00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.800
 I still wear the same pants 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.480
 because I love her and I care 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.790
 I have a judgment changed 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.100
 Here is a nice spaghetti top from the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.409
 New York often I wear a golden one 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.340
 chain from the fairway trendone and one 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.340
 bangle from the cock 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.720
 ok, but what's next with the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 second occurs 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.470
 she wears this cool hat from the new 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.540
 yorker a really nice 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.060
 fluttered shirt with great bridges 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.470
 excerpt from the playmate to a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.470
 has penn in the used look 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.430
 it continues with the hair and here 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.380
 I show you as you with two means 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.630
 really nice beach babes team gets 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.860
 to make you curious you need 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.750
 first, for example, a curling iron 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.520
 and straighteners i'm here for 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.380
 the bell states seemed and take 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.600
 just different again and again 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.520
 Big hardware animals wrap without 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.440
 she had previously confessed to the great 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.120
 curling iron and the video here is in 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.370
 So see real time how long it will last 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.170
 and then I just came with her 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.850
 fingers through with the bells 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.620
 to become something more messi 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.330
 I repeat that with his 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.580
 entire hair repeatedly in 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.200
 different sized aspire to that 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.459
 just not so perfect and 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.799
 wanted looks but rather 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.390
 more natural and just after everyone loose 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.010
 I go through with both hands once 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.110
 with my fingers and lures the whole 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.819
 on as soon as I lured all strands 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.799
 I 'll go with a brush again 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.180
 through and shake my hair out and 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.950
 then your hair will look pretty good 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.510
 cool but i always want one 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.920
 a little more volume and therefore draw 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.900
 I still have my hair on a bit 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.579
 but not yet a hair 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.950
 really like beach babes and there 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.810
 I just help myself with a spray 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.459
 that's just salt or 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.590
 seawater and you can do that 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.180
 Just spray in the hair several times 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.950
 and then i will contact the hair always so 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.750
 nice by having it distributed and 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.340
 the strands form and if he does 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.840
 that goes through all the tips 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.090
 and you have a really cool one right away 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.530
 look and now we come to mine 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.989
 personal favorite part of this 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.400
 videos and indeed the make-up for it 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.109
 I already have my everyday 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.940
 make up and applied mine 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.010
 eyebrow eyelashes and some concealer 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.470
 but I still want you a few 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.630
 Cool products show eg this range 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.880
 here from the terra natur I use here 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.799
 the second brown color from the right and 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.540
 Give my eyeliner and compete 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.310
 something my disadvantage with mine 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.560
 makes face all evening 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.079
 I'm using this powder from here 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.120
 eat and give it to everyone without me 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.380
 face mini snow line so to 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.480
 example at zone 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.970
 then I have a new cream here 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.830
 highlighter of essens and I carry 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.830
 just with my fingers on the drive 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.810
 I dunk was there 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.240
 and then there would be the highest points 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.310
 my choice and I'm just that 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.410
 makes a great shimmer because of it 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.420
 I just wear my name 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.250
 nose so that it stays there, too 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.470
 sits the whole still with the Hesse 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.210
 color again from the anatomy palette 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.340
 I think that's a very fast one 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.810
 but really nice bright summer 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.670
 make up and therefore perfect for one 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.050
 festival suitable but only with the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.180
 next step will be perfect and 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.550
 you need a pair of pliers and these 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.290
 mails dekker here by also eating 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.270
 still some cheap eyelash glue 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.100
 for example, this one of essens- or 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.989
 by patrice for some wrong 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.209
 eyelash z then you just take it 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.160
 These stones with the tweezers on and 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.080
 Give them in the glue and carry them 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.270
 then your vote in a pattern 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.460
 your choice on the wind webber 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.050
 of course, that raises the whole thing really well 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.970
 It's wonderful, especially 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.620
 if she writes a sun glitters 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.810

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.760
 also at festivals and if you like one 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.050
 to take over my lux and thus 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.470
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.470
 next time
