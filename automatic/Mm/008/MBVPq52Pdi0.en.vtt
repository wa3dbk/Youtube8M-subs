00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
can't do right now because I don't have

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.520 
can't do right now because I don't have
enough<00:01:18.299> points<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> I'll<00:01:18.900> explain<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.500> little

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
enough points and I'll explain a little

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.679 
enough points and I'll explain a little
more<00:01:19.770> about<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.070> later<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.330> review

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
more about that later on in this review

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.280 
more about that later on in this review
purple<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.610> back<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.420> white<00:01:24.570> again<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.229> I'm

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
purple and back to white again so I'm

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.890 
purple and back to white again so I'm
going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> keep<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:26.150> let's<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.540> say<00:01:27.659> black

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
going to keep it at let's just say black

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.350 
going to keep it at let's just say black
which<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.829> kind<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.310> grey<00:01:29.549> I'm

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
which is more like kind of a grey I'm

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.940 
which is more like kind of a grey I'm
down<00:01:30.689> here<00:01:30.720> well<00:01:31.350> right<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
down here well right here in the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.550 
down here well right here in the
instructions<00:01:32.600> are<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.810> instructions

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
instructions are the instructions

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.249 
instructions are the instructions
BOM<00:01:35.280> which<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> explain<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
BOM which I'm going to explain in the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.810 
BOM which I'm going to explain in the
review<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.100> don't<00:01:38.250> need<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.549> look<00:01:38.640> through

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
review so we don't need to look through

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.399 
review so we don't need to look through
that<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:40.820> up<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.570> game<00:01:42.930> cards

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
that and up here we have the game cards

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
that and up here we have the game cards
for<00:01:44.250> different<00:01:44.280> games<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.240> insert

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
for different games that you can insert

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.050 
for different games that you can insert
right<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:45.990> there's<00:01:46.229> only<00:01:46.350> three<00:01:46.610> with<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
right now there's only three with one of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.929 
right now there's only three with one of
them<00:01:48.180> being<00:01:48.570> unlockable<00:01:49.579> which<00:01:50.579> means<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
them being unlockable which means you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.039 
them being unlockable which means you
have<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.060> get<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> certain<00:01:51.570> amount<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.840> points

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
have to get a certain amount of points

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.230 
have to get a certain amount of points
which<00:01:52.380> once<00:01:53.009> again<00:01:53.250> I'll<00:01:53.460> explain<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> litter

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
which once again I'll explain the litter

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.139 
which once again I'll explain the litter
later<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.960> little<00:01:55.590> later<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.969> video

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
later on a little later on in this video

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.690 
later on a little later on in this video
so<00:01:58.049> hopefully<00:01:58.380> it'll<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.860> adding<00:01:59.159> more<00:01:59.310> but

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
so hopefully it'll be adding more but

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.899 
so hopefully it'll be adding more but
let's<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.180> hot<00:02:00.390> go<00:02:00.899> ahead<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.469> open<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.920> IDs

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
let's go hot go ahead and open this IDs

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
let's go hot go ahead and open this IDs
so<00:02:03.090> open<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.750> DS<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.649> double<00:02:04.890> tap<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> now<00:02:07.890> we

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so open the DS just double tap so now we

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.880 
so open the DS just double tap so now we
open<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.149> looks<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:10.110> regular<00:02:10.379> DX

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
open and it just looks like a regular DX

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.770 
open and it just looks like a regular DX
so<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.849> can

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
so I can

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.440 
so I can
scroll<00:02:13.350> like<00:02:13.740> human<00:02:14.520> stuff<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:16.730> know<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.820> would<00:02:18.330> I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
scroll like human stuff I know I would I

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.010 
scroll like human stuff I know I would I
have<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.690> do

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
have to do

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.100 
have to do

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
definitely a lot of money that they're

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.510
