feet 48 inches so we're gonna test that
out<00:01:14.850> right<00:01:15.119> now

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.830 

and<00:01:19.160> while<00:01:19.430> that's<00:01:19.610> usually<00:01:19.910> a<00:01:19.940> nasty<00:01:20.480> drop

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
and while that's usually a nasty drop

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.730 
and while that's usually a nasty drop
we're<00:01:21.320> gonna<00:01:21.470> take<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.620> look<00:01:21.830> at<00:01:21.980> it<00:01:22.130> and

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
we're gonna take a look at it and

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.740 
we're gonna take a look at it and
everything's<00:01:24.740> still<00:01:25.130> working<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.540> he's

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
everything's still working and he's

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.210 
everything's still working and he's
pretty<00:01:26.900> much<00:01:27.080> still<00:01:27.320> functioning<00:01:27.830> not<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.010> lot

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
pretty much still functioning not a lot

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.800 
pretty much still functioning not a lot
of<00:01:28.250> scratches

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.719 

so<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.590> train<00:01:31.830> is<00:01:31.979> also<00:01:32.250> designed<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.670> be

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
so that train is also designed to be

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
so that train is also designed to be
waterproof<00:01:33.090> under<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> meter<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.530> water

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
waterproof under up to a meter of water

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.140 
waterproof under up to a meter of water
for<00:01:34.950> 30<00:01:35.159> minutes<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.610> we're<00:01:35.700> gonna<00:01:35.790> test<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
for 30 minutes so we're gonna test that

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.170 
for 30 minutes so we're gonna test that
out<00:01:36.180> right<00:01:36.420> here

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.480 

and<00:01:43.300> in<00:01:44.020> addition<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.950> terrain<00:01:45.310> is

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
and in addition to that the terrain is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.400 
and in addition to that the terrain is
designed<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:46.030> handle<00:01:46.330> extreme<00:01:46.930> temperatures

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
designed to handle extreme temperatures

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.620 
designed to handle extreme temperatures
ranging<00:01:47.830> from<00:01:48.070> zero<00:01:48.700> degrees<00:01:49.000> Celsius<00:01:49.180> to
