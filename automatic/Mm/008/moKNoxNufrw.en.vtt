00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
think it was mostly our attitude we knew

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.490 
think it was mostly our attitude we knew
we<00:03:42.120> had<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.359> come<00:03:42.569> out<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.840> with<00:03:43.049> hit<00:03:43.349> this

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
we had to come out and with hit this

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.280 
we had to come out and with hit this
three<00:03:43.769> points<00:03:44.159> yesterday<00:03:44.760> we<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.989> knew<00:03:46.109> was<00:03:46.230> a

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
three points yesterday we we knew was a

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.229 
three points yesterday we we knew was a

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
think our heads running it as much as

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.440 
think our heads running it as much as
they<00:03:49.620> needed<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:49.950> be<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.879> today<00:03:51.090> we<00:03:51.299> just
