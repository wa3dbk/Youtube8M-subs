00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.409
 we will see here how to insert tolerance to mention a pin our project 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.490
 many developed projects are parts that will be used in 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.699
 mechanical assemblies 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.149
 in these cases the parts must have a greater rigor in their dimensions so that 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.149
 the set works properly 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.420
 to set a tolerance to mention one we must access the options 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.240
 biti mention of auto cad 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.190
 which is done by selecting the fan try 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.160
 and in the panel of liars we click pina is right here 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.530
 by clicking on it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.040
 a dialog box opens 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.190
 where we can have created a new style based on iso 20 5 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.730
 we create a vip esteem in a thousand 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.240
 we defined as 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 tolerance to mention a name 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.740
 and click Continue 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.650
 in this new dialog box that opens 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.590
 We selected Sabato Dantas 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.940
 and then methods 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.420
 we select the method that will be used 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.270
 let's use here 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.380
 the option 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.380
 Detour 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.490
 What are you going to do? What? 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.280
 will set a year a minimum value that the maximum 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.409
 but we still have the sexual option here 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.520
 where we have a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.170
 in the same dimension 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.170
 both for more and less 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.100
 we still have the limits 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.260
 where we inform 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.090
 the actual dimension number 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.430
 both for more and less 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.170
 and we still have the zeca tab where we more define that dimension there will be 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.500
 fixed at that value and can not vary neither more nor less 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.110
 that calorie go is the base value 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 and ready 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.989
 in the case in question let's use as I said the deviation 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.359
 the accuracy I return emissary two decimal places 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.129
 for 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:15.999
 my 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.879
 maximum value i'll set 04 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.559
 and for there the organism 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:25.249
 zero 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.849
 Score 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.359
 04 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.989
 Let's study a little here, this is the poet's advantage here of der-es am 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.309
 the deviation 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.479
 of dimension that we can inform different values 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.279
 in the form of these two values ​​here 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:46.349
 I can already see in this box how will the division 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.949
 I confirm with rock 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.909
 this dialogue box here 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.909
 and now I've passed my resignation 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:03.429
 to apply dimensions of tolerance to mention one we use the 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:07.719
 same tools used by the team in normal sanitation 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.389
 that is 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.449
 the tools that linear to light né 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:14.539
 frei god and hunter 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.879
 I'll select the tool line 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.699
 and I will define the 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.699
 of this drilling 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.039
 applying the transfer rate 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.779
 I can already see it here 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.609
 that there is value 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.589
 of the drilling which is 140 units 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.350
 which may vary 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.779
 for more services ball 04 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.279
 or for less 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.449
 zero comma 06 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:46.779
 and thus we conclude this class where we set up 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:50.969
 mention an auto cad and attack the project
