00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.149 
into acquisition with things like our
hyper<00:00:46.120> deck<00:00:46.420> line<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:47.530> this<00:00:47.649> was<00:00:47.829> really<00:00:47.949> kind

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
hyper deck line and this was really kind

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.770 
hyper deck line and this was really kind
of<00:00:48.219> a<00:00:48.309> natural<00:00:48.670> evolution<00:00:48.760> it's<00:00:49.480> a<00:00:49.570> solid

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
of a natural evolution it's a solid

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.259 
of a natural evolution it's a solid
state<00:00:50.199> disk<00:00:50.589> recorder<00:00:51.070> as<00:00:51.219> opposed<00:00:51.519> to<00:00:51.670> CF<00:00:52.089> or

state disk recorder as opposed to CF or
obviously<00:00:52.569> film<00:00:52.839> so<00:00:53.379> it's<00:00:53.499> got<00:00:53.649> that

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
obviously film so it's got that

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.610 
obviously film so it's got that
technology<00:00:54.399> it's<00:00:55.329> using<00:00:55.659> cinema<00:00:55.960> D&amp;G<00:00:56.409> raw

technology it's using cinema D&amp;G raw
12-bit<00:00:57.190> which<00:00:57.399> we've<00:00:57.579> been<00:00:57.699> doing<00:00:57.999> with

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
12-bit which we've been doing with

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.270 
12-bit which we've been doing with
resolve<00:00:58.569> we've<00:00:59.199> also<00:00:59.379> been<00:00:59.559> experimenting

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
resolve we've also been experimenting

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.729 
resolve we've also been experimenting
with<00:01:00.309> obviously<00:01:00.850> prores<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:01.719> dnxhd<00:01:02.409> on<00:01:02.620> our

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
with obviously prores and dnxhd on our

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.890 
with obviously prores and dnxhd on our
high<00:01:02.829> petek<00:01:03.100> studios<00:01:03.519> so<00:01:04.089> it's<00:01:04.210> got<00:01:04.360> multiple

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
high petek studios so it's got multiple

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.710 
high petek studios so it's got multiple
flavors<00:01:05.110> of<00:01:05.350> recording<00:01:05.920> formats<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:07.479> got

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
flavors of recording formats it's got

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.540 
flavors of recording formats it's got
thunderbolts<00:01:08.140> on<00:01:08.560> it<00:01:08.740> obviously<00:01:08.920> been<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.370> big

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
thunderbolts on it obviously been a big

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.609 
thunderbolts on it obviously been a big
you<00:01:10.030> know<00:01:10.120> pusher<00:01:10.870> and<00:01:10.900> developer<00:01:11.590> of

you know pusher and developer of
Thunderbolt<00:01:12.280> product<00:01:12.759> so<00:01:12.880> it's<00:01:13.000> got<00:01:13.149> that<00:01:13.360> on

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
Thunderbolt product so it's got that on

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.330 
Thunderbolt product so it's got that on
there<00:01:13.960> you<00:01:14.530> know<00:01:14.619> we<00:01:14.740> want<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:15.040> have<00:01:15.130> something

that<00:01:15.549> had<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.759> higher<00:01:16.180> than<00:01:16.479> HD<00:01:16.840> video

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
that had a higher than HD video

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.959 
that had a higher than HD video
resolution<00:01:17.770> so<00:01:18.250> we've<00:01:18.340> got<00:01:18.520> this<00:01:18.640> great

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.389 
resolution so we've got this great
two-and-a-half<00:01:19.689> k<00:01:19.960> chip<00:01:20.259> on<00:01:20.469> there<00:01:20.710> so<00:01:21.009> you

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
two-and-a-half k chip on there so you

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.340 
two-and-a-half k chip on there so you
can<00:01:21.520> do<00:01:21.640> that<00:01:21.790> in<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.180> cinema<00:01:22.479> TNG<00:01:22.899> raw<00:01:23.049> or

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
can do that in the cinema TNG raw or

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
for us was having to convince these guys

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.300 
for us was having to convince these guys
that<00:03:30.330> rather<00:03:30.570> than<00:03:30.690> selling<00:03:31.050> 10<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.739> year<00:03:31.890> at

that rather than selling 10 a year at

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.760 
that rather than selling 10 a year at
tens<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.239> thousands<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.690> dollars<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.680> was

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
tens of thousands of dollars that it was

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.070 
tens of thousands of dollars that it was
about<00:03:34.920> selling<00:03:35.340> thousands<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.150> these<00:03:36.330> you

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
about selling thousands of these you

know thousands of these and it was a new
model<00:03:38.970> for<00:03:39.000> them<00:03:39.270> but<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.930> great

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
model for them but it's a great

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.680 
model for them but it's a great
technology<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.850> we<00:03:42.120> can't<00:03:42.360> talk<00:03:42.570> about

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
technology that that we can't talk about

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.600 
technology that that we can't talk about
too<00:03:42.900> much<00:03:43.020> but<00:03:43.350> but<00:03:43.800> is<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.070> know<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:44.340> with

too much but but is you know it's with
that<00:03:44.730> high<00:03:44.940> dynamic<00:03:45.209> range<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.959> really<00:03:46.410> just

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
that high dynamic range is really just

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.530 
that high dynamic range is really just
