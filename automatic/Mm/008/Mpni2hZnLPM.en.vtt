00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.390
 Pitch and pitch 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.340
 I think it is used with almost the same meaning 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:46.970
 A pitch is essentially the distance of the favor 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:50.520
 In words and in contrast pitch represents the height of the sound, which is determined by the number of vibration 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:57.960
 Originally, the meaning is different from the pitch 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.860
 How much time genuine list is free of turbidity, which was to spread the Municipal you, but criteria for the large 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.730
 Is it good to adjust ? 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.839
 I will explain each waon 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.280
 First c major 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.230
 Configuration sound 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.340
 c 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.330
 Good 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.450
 g's is sound, but three times of rice 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.680
 14 cents- 9 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.920
 Take Kobe's g as high as 2000 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.100
 Of genuine temperament 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.380
 I'm worried every day without turbidity 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.790
 There are three Ambusha control points 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.180
 Pull in the direction of strengthening 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.180
 This is 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.640
 How to raise the pitch will be shrimp screen 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.870
 This thing just explains in detail 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.290
 The effect is less, but you can improve a little, even Anbusha 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.380
 Two points 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.860
 It is the angle to enter go to the acute angle 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.860
 This is 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.750
 2 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:26.210
 In brass band music, the location is often corrected with a finger, but with anything or anything, the tone is 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.130
 While thinking because it will be useless 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.200
 I think it is better to use at point 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.260
 The following is the g sharp of him 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.560
 With cows to raise and low 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.560
 to come 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.010
 yeah 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.280
 Hmmm 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.280
 hey 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.050
 Uw u u u 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.050
