00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.190
 e 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.410
 false 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.719
 we meet for a video 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.160
 today on a game any firm has 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.840
 worn on iphone 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.090
 I think it should be available 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.070
 on ipad also that you have link 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.290
 description anyway for the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.950
 download so this is a game that is a 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.930
 little in the kind that borders or in 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.590
 do not let people go 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.600
 according to their provenance 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.829
 So here I am, I 've already done two three 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.300
 little parts I found that pretty 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.610
 funny and you will understand very 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.950
 very quickly, in fact, you have to pass 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.410
 be thick right or left so the 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.630
 red and green cards depending on the 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.370
 or the arrow are worth if the arrow 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.080
 red good bah you have to buy if 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.570
 the lure of horses playing high he 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.340
 must be sold and the reverse for the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.200
 low and loops begins a glass 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.990
 and results actually it's a game of 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.410
 quickness and mind bernard made unfair 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.520
 that you stay focused and also if 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.239
 you make too many mistakes you go 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.149
 see what was going to happen 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.939
 we will not be thrown too much so that's 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.470
 a very simple game but it can very 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.770
 to make time pass by train in 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.300
 the metro by car if if you have the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.790
 long average way I found it rather 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.409
 morose 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.360
 there you see that newsletters begin 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.800
 to amass a little bit and I'm going 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.190
 start making mistakes so I have 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.770
 not taken 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.530
 yes but otherwise pill is on the right 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.450
 I could have taken it to improve my 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.220
 speed but a game took on that one 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.770
 I will try to resume in a 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.890
 next in a next video 6 and 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.680
 iv of if I wanted so that it starts 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.450
 to speed up nasty I'm doing 40 dollar 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.490
 on each each newsletter 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.229
 but yes there are small times of 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.640
 reflection on some newsletters have 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.760
 does what I think the bottom point 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.770
 is usually it's a once a 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.080
 think time like that it's fucking 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.130
 there I am in the red zone where he 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.860
 is like that sounds 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.369
 Besides, I'm going to lose on that but 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.539
 I would have done in $ 8,135 on the 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.520
 first day what is rather not 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.709
 bad taste and where I'm fired 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.640
 file in English it's come and in 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.170
 French and then they invited 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.480
 jealousies you run out the window 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.970
 and then you continue with a 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.310
 next traders and you see of course 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.870
 to the stats and how much you have won 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.310
 there is a small shop I think 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.050
 that they will add a lot of small 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.819
 stuff as they come 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.890
 who develops the brussels game comes 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.720
 just started 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.430
 so there finally for a new part 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.230
 so and green arrows 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.120
 when he goes up we buy them when she 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.590
 go down we do not buy them alas for the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.590
 red 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.900
 so there five years not too bad general 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.840
 I drove well left the sea left to 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.579
 left to right at the top right at 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.470
 left to the left and so on 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.090
 otherwise we will talk quickly 2 gta 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.220
 seine so it's been a while I 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.819
 not had to shell 4.5 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.880
 I am always very busy in my 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.920
 life outside of videos so that's for 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.750
 I did not have too much time to play but 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.850

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.950
 videos you have spent some pictures on 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.660

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.680
