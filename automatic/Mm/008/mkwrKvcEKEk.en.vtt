yeah I am a red X fan so you should
probably<00:05:48.159> take<00:05:49.029> that<00:05:49.560> score<00:05:50.560> if<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.770> grand<00:05:51.039> salt

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
probably take that score if a grand salt

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.709 
probably take that score if a grand salt
it<00:05:52.210> could<00:05:52.539> probably<00:05:52.930> like<00:05:53.789> to<00:05:54.789> certain<00:05:55.360> people

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 
it could probably like to certain people

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.170 
it could probably like to certain people
it<00:05:55.839> could<00:05:56.050> be<00:05:56.229> poet<00:05:56.589> three<00:05:57.370> because<00:05:58.029> there

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
it could be poet three because there

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.629 
it could be poet three because there
wasn't<00:05:58.389> much<00:05:58.719> actual<00:05:59.110> action<00:05:59.650> or<00:05:59.830> anything<00:06:00.490> in

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
wasn't much actual action or anything in

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.749 
wasn't much actual action or anything in
this<00:06:00.729> episode<00:06:01.199> but<00:06:02.199> then<00:06:02.349> again<00:06:02.379> the<00:06:03.339> relevant

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
this episode but then again the relevant

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.999 
this episode but then again the relevant
series<00:06:04.120> you<00:06:05.080> sure<00:06:05.319> has<00:06:05.500> action<00:06:06.370> secondary<00:06:07.089> to

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
series you sure has action secondary to

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.570 
series you sure has action secondary to
everything<00:06:09.009> else<00:06:09.129> usually<00:06:09.930> till<00:06:11.550> like<00:06:12.550> the

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
everything else usually till like the

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.350 
everything else usually till like the
end<00:06:12.849> of<00:06:12.939> the<00:06:13.060> arc<00:06:14.009> then<00:06:15.009> it<00:06:15.219> has<00:06:15.370> action<00:06:15.960> um<00:06:16.960> I

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
end of the arc then it has action um I

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.550 
end of the arc then it has action um I
thought<00:06:19.360> this<00:06:19.539> was<00:06:19.719> pretty<00:06:20.020> good<00:06:20.229> upset

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
thought this was pretty good upset

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.640 
thought this was pretty good upset
considering<00:06:21.159> it<00:06:22.120> didn't<00:06:22.960> really<00:06:23.259> straight

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
considering it didn't really straight

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.670 
considering it didn't really straight
from<00:06:23.889> the<00:06:24.009> source<00:06:24.189> material<00:06:24.839> it

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
from the source material it

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.850

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
add a little bit and I'm I took a little

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.700 
add a little bit and I'm I took a little
bit<00:06:30.160> away<00:06:30.430> but<00:06:31.110> nothing<00:06:32.110> that<00:06:32.139> would<00:06:32.440> actually

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
bit away but nothing that would actually

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.960 
bit away but nothing that would actually
affect<00:06:33.699> a<00:06:34.000> story<00:06:34.270> at<00:06:34.570> all<00:06:35.460> so<00:06:36.460> yeah<00:06:36.580> this
