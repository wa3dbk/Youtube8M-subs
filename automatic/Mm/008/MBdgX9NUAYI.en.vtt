00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.590
 good monica here I am showing you a 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:08.880
 part of your machine with the changer 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.850
 four-color automatic 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.130
 you see is placed with this support so that 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.410
 see it 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.810
 on this side the support is placed 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.640
 for the tensioner since we have the other 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:28.189
 tensor that is identical to the main one that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.520
 we have it here well here is the machine 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.410
 completita there we have the car 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.510
 then he cleaned it better because 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.190
 obviously this was too fast 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.800
 but well at least there you give yourself 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.470
 account the state let's make a 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.950
 Threading quickie to start knitting 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.980
 because you already saw the common threading in 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.739
 the videos so we do the following 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.620
 let's see we open the floodgate of the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.940
 feeder the one that is weaving is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.430
 Alfred 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.890
 we place the wool we hold the tip of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.670
 the money 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.240
 with the left hand 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.280
 and then to forgiveness we will place a 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.149
 X number of needles in position 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.710
 work that is the work position and 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.710
 if we do not look here 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.290
 it does not look good we have abcyd not it 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.240
 You have to be in position b 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.560
 there is 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.290
 then we do with wool below 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.159
 I hold it with my left hand and do 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.159
 One last 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.280
 to see how it really was not a 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.400
 Threading is an engaged there 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.010
 they hooked all the needles well now 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.150
 let's do the following 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.560
 we put a wool that does not break and 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.520
 notice 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.210
 to see where you are 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.789
 and there's between the hook and the needle between 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.190
 the hook and the needle this does to the 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.190
 brake I do the column better 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:21.340
 and there it is and we hold it doing 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.400
 pressure like I had a dumbbell in there 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.810
 we are both extremes 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.810
 good let's leave a little 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.490
 that is, with the difference 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.860
 but it's not like to start a garment 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.319
 or when we did more or less four or 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.340
 five times you see here we have the little thread 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.340
 we take it out 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.409
 ready he went and the tissue is not 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.829
 great thing is nothing more than to start 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.829
 to knit 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.700
 for safety then take it out we take 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.650
 needles to rest this is also the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.970
 video 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.579
 the lever in n or switch in n 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.069
 what it does is lift needles from 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.069
 rest and take work weaving 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.120
 and get this out is more than anything 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.120
 place the shore figures 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.269
 in the other video I explained that you have to 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.079
 do it four times that is not in 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.799
 no manual there we have the box 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.799
 of accesories 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.650
 in the extremes 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:56.080
 causing the first and the last 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:59.050
 they are tight it is better that it protrudes 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.190
 I weigh it then I stay calm 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.680
 that the first and the last 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.680
 they are strained and vÃ­ctor and we weave 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.160
 so needles at rest 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.430
 so you can see how to make a neck 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.910
 is already in the video placed the lever on 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.910
 h 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.009
 he wove what was at work what 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.069
 I was at rest you do not think that you 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.050
 edge is now that point put the 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.490
 provider and there it is 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.590
 so there we would have to put a 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.060
 thinker and me or directly the pulls 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.060
 with your finger with your hand 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.930
 n again and we raise 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.240
 it's a good united wool short here and 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.230
 we make another video so it is not 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.230
 started to upload it
