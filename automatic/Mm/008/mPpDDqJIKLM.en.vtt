way you would of course run up with the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.500 
way you would of course run up with the

book with the CPU bus to be at 400 again
and<00:02:33.510> here's<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.870> funny<00:02:34.080> thing<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.410> want<00:02:34.560> to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
and here's the funny thing I want to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.050 
and here's the funny thing I want to
mention<00:02:34.770> about<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.220> CPU<00:02:35.690> notice<00:02:36.690> here<00:02:38.060> core

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
mention about the CPU notice here core

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.970 
mention about the CPU notice here core
zero<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.630> cool<00:02:39.840> one<00:02:40.110> always<00:02:40.320> have<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:40.860> an

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
zero and cool one always have like an

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.500 
zero and cool one always have like an
eight<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.220> 10<00:02:41.370> degrees<00:02:41.670> C<00:02:41.880> difference<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
eight to 10 degrees C difference in the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.830 
eight to 10 degrees C difference in the
temperatures<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.310> believe<00:02:44.310> core<00:02:44.760> zeros<00:02:45.180> sensor

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
temperatures I believe core zeros sensor

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.880 
temperatures I believe core zeros sensor
is<00:02:46.019> defective

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
is defective

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.340 
is defective
I<00:02:46.940> think<00:02:47.940> core<00:02:48.150> ones<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.810> more<00:02:48.989> correct

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
I think core ones is more correct

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.400 
I think core ones is more correct
because<00:02:50.160> look<00:02:50.340> here<00:02:50.519> at<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> CPU<00:02:51.260> sensor<00:02:52.260> on

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
because look here at the CPU sensor on

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.150 
because look here at the CPU sensor on
the<00:02:52.500> motherboard

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
the motherboard

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.470 
the motherboard
it<00:02:53.610> says<00:02:53.910> 41<00:02:54.300> C<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.150> thing<00:02:57.360> has<00:02:57.450> been
