00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.080
 Yes 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.170
 well it's everybody's guys his 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.850
 hobbies hope you're good wood 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.800
 it's going great today we find ourselves 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.810
 again on the dlc invasion of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.160
 call of duty ghost for the gameplay that 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.590
 is going to be an attempt I said well 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.330
 attempt even case in assault so I 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.580
 think that already klm it's quite complicated 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.870
 on the new maps even more and we 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.640
 soberly think that there the difficulty 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.870
 is at maximum so I hope the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 gameplay you will like I invite you to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.629
 vence left a little I like for this 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.950
 who's in the class put you a 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.720
 screenshot on the screen for you can 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.320
 memorize it or even redo it is 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.879
 really not bad 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.290
 we either have an affair is the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.910
 turret and the helicopter it's really 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.890
 districts that really hurt I you 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.329
 also advise them and so voila 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.520
 it was on shares is like I i 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.290
 in confirmed eliminations so I was 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.820
 accompanied by two colleagues case but 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.619
 elected officials who go no more but as soon as 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.540
 that from the eleventh to the vest 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.070
 ballistic at first I take this opportunity to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.450
 thank code that god side m6 of the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.130
 place it makes me extremely happy 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.600
 of course I will introduce my 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.229
 chain at the end of the video so I'll you 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.240
 invite to stay 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.560
 and here for the video I will present 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.910
 the map the map 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.890
 so I present it to you in depth 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.880
 fills if we can say so here we go 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.200
 start right away 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.390
 so it's a work that takes place at 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.850
 mexico so in mexico i think that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.900
 you have it all you know because 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.140
 it's written in the description of the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.909
 map 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.409
 so it's a pretty colorful map when 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.940
 even that changes other map enough 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.650
 dark that we usually really but 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.420
 really colorful and a nice atmosphere 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.740
 so it's happening in mexico the day of 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.690
 the party starts so she says to 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.180
 dead and basically it's a party that has 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.760
 place that takes place every year so 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.470
 October October October forgiveness November 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.820
 from what I saw on the internet and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.439
 so it takes place every year in the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.790
 mexican culture which means like 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.860
 there are a lot of mexicans in america 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.360
 latin america south america coup 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.500
 and united states so it's going on 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.670
 a lot in america and all 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.290
 mexicans make this party 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.450
 so it's a party unlike this 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.830
 that we think pretty festive yet it's 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.970
 a party to commemorate the terminals 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.990
 normally it's supposed to be sad but 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.549
 it's pretty festive and from what 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.140
 I understood and so basically they 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.820
 clean the graves of their loved ones 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.650
 who died of course it's 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.480
 graves and put flowers there and that's 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.739
 still pretty festive so there is 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.380
 nets and everything so that's really 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.030
 nice and good here is the district 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.950
 special of the amap it's the mariachi of 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.110
 death so he had little he has an outfit 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.730
 a little clean at the hall at the feast of 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.870
 dead so that's up to my style and you 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.160
 go see at the end of the video I 'm going 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.390
 show you an excerpt where I 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.890
 develops so I had it unlock in 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.450
 this part too but to be able 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.920
 continue my series still not frozen 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.910
 best left to the combine and thus 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.260
 the ally will take it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.610
 but in another known part already 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.630
 done online is jelly unlock so 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.400
 I put it very much for you 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.600
 see a little bit about what it gives 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.890
 also I want to clarify a little trick 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.320
 for the gameplay the wars need to know 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.880
 that on xbox on ice at juhasz is 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.620
 quite simple if we can say that you 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.750
 a lot when a lot thresher but 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.370
 on the dlc even more than it was playing 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.510
 extremely dirty because here are the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.830
 people who buy the dl if we have a 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.200
 minimum level so they know how to play 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.790
 so some like a lot for their 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.870
 ratios or so some know 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.950
 really good a game so they know 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.670
 very well played so it's pretty hard to 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.140
 make gameplay 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.090
 I was lucky to fall in a 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.230
 home where he was moderately strong he 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.060
 still had the level that's why 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.560
 that I may have missed it anyway 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.760
 we'll see but so here I really 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.770
 I want to say that it's not easy to 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.820
 make a gameplay like that will be the maps 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.980
 and so here I am really asking you 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.280
 to put a little tiempo for this 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.480
 gameplay is so see walou so too 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.680
 I want to raid I want to introduce my 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.060
 chain so we're soon a thousand 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.290
 subscribers so really do not hesitate to 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.730
 take a ride is kid we are soon 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.050
 thousand subscribers it past them but 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.160
 we're just after the two thousand 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.870
 subscribers so do not hesitate to make a 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.760
 turn for to continue doing 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.900
 advance my chain and so here you are 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.310
 can see that luck is rich that 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.900
 the little job that goes well I do not have 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.610
 burn it skf passing a briefcase 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.590
 normal and I did a nice little job 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.510
 that we can say we see the whey that 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.620
 I have not bad old ones so there I read 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.080
 headed there I'm going down the steps 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.300
 and unfortunately you will see that 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.410
 I killed this enemy is there he is half 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.880
 did not press too much ball as I 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.050
 liked it a few balls and that's it we see 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.910
 who are stealing from the Ruthenian stadium for 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.310
 the spots will not come back I finish 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.360
 on 1 54 9 with 13 plate pick up and 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.680
 so now we'll go to 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.120
 marsh acts of death so as you 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.620
 can see the jelly unlock it's a 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.240
 other part that I had done another 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.060
 day online and so when you have it 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.770
 you have the 44 magnum akimbo you have 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.790
 the oracle activated but the red oracle so 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.170
 it's really stylish have a little 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.300
 ambient music also really not 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.530
 badly and when we're going to kill them the enemy he 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.209
 will turn into teammates of 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.650
 support but a bit like louis stupid he 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.790
 go see the pack and taste so the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.650
 enemies can not know if it's you 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.180
 or your clown you can have up to 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.500
 two clones at the same time in the map 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.030
 and if any of your clubs do not die like 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.169
 this is the case well we could hold 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.160
 the harbor enemy who joined claude who 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.640
 is asking is so it's big 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.840
 massacre 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.600
 you will see that I am going to do 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.730
 a fidh duvet with the only downside 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.960
 of mariachi is that when you have it 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.310
 you can not activate your strict keys 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.270
 so - in this case I had a helicopter 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.590
 a turret and I could not 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.460
 put it to me that it's not 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.990
 available for the moment 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.250
 whereas normally I could have 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.840
 this is a big massacre 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.010
 really advise you will see that 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.660
 I'll chain them I do the same 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.070
 win the game by taking the plate 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.180
 so here is the video you liked 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.980
 do not hesitate to take a look at my 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.810
 chain 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.190
 So that's two thousand subscribers 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.510
 really huge 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.220
 so here I know earlier for my 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.210

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.290

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.160
 today we will try to make go 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.600
 without rule I know it's possible 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.940
 it's hard I know it's 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.530
 possible we have 2000 here it is 100 m 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.790

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.410
