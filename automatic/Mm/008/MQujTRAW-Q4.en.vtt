example we've used this wheat field is
our<00:02:47.580> approach<00:02:47.970> we're<00:02:48.270> not<00:02:48.390> going<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.600> walk

our approach we're not going to walk
along<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.290> edge<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.740> field<00:02:49.920> we've<00:02:50.130> kind

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
along the edge of the field we've kind

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.590 
along the edge of the field we've kind
of<00:02:50.340> come<00:02:50.550> across<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.030> middle<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.390> field

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
of come across the middle of the field

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.090 
of come across the middle of the field
we're<00:02:52.200> going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.350> come<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.680> here

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
we're going to come in here

we're going to come in here
the<00:02:53.340> winds<00:02:53.550> out<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.000> south<00:02:54.330> we're<00:02:54.690> going

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
the winds out of the south we're going

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.990 
the winds out of the south we're going
to<00:02:54.900> approach<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.380> coming<00:02:55.710> from<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.950> north<00:02:56.190> and

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
to approach it coming from the north and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.570 
to approach it coming from the north and
then<00:02:57.210> we<00:02:57.750> let<00:02:58.020> our<00:02:58.110> sit<00:02:58.380> travel<00:02:58.800> back<00:02:58.980> out<00:02:59.220> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
then we let our sit travel back out and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.310 
then we let our sit travel back out and
we've<00:02:59.970> used<00:03:00.210> a<00:03:00.360> pinch<00:03:00.660> point<00:03:00.960> here<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.260> the

we've used a pinch point here in the
quarter<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.800> wheat<00:03:01.980> field<00:03:02.190> where<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:02.550> got<00:03:02.730> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
quarter of a wheat field where we got a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.390 
quarter of a wheat field where we got a

fence power line right away it makes

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.490 
fence power line right away it makes

those deer come through this actual

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.560 
those deer come through this actual
pinch<00:03:07.800> point<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.760> give<00:03:09.210> us<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.420> best

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
pinch point to give us the best
