00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.850
 if we can get used to the changes 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.560
 of color in the clothing why not 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.300
 give a touch of color also to 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.910
 our home that's why we went to talk 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.099
 with marilú jiménez to show us 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.870

 nice to meet you, mariluz because 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.230
 we tend to choose colors smooth colors 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.760
 classics to decorate our environments 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.100
 Generally, men are 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.800
 gentlemen who are inclined by the tones 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.460
 classics like being the black the brown 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.309
 white chocolate women tend to 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.199
 choose cheerful colors indeed with 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:55.239
 designs with flowers and striped stripes that 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.120
 proposed to have for this week as 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.310
 to get out a bit of the classic good 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.130
 this week I want to present you in a 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.410
 armchair we already know we've seen 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.960
 all the chocolate brown in the coco air 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.729
 we've seen it structure in brown 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.100
 chocolate and color pillows 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.979
 sealing but this week the vedette is 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.619
 again be the bread trail that is a 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.800
 armchair that the structure we made it with 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.149
 ice color a color that is fashionable 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.759
 formerly it was called chalk today they call it 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.830
 ice and the cushions are made in 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.140
 a senile 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.940
 another thing that was lost is to use the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.980
 set of a large armchair and two 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.230
 little ones but in this case it has 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.360
 company the pampita if we what 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.420
 we accompany with a little armchair is called 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.630
 gazebo is a very small armchair 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.360
 nice very comfortable and in this case what 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.000
 we integrate the structure in this way in 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.680
 ice color and the cushions we look for 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.720
 a design that had the color sea ​​and 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.050
 this type of design with these colors 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.140
 which leg to advise in this case 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.760
 we did it with metal legs both 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.490
 big squeaky like the two little ones 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.709
 so environment can adapt this 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.360
 model with these colors this design is 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.190
 for any environment in fact the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.200
 lady who bought it is for a house of 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.330
 field but you can also go for a 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.150
 department here we are playing with 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.000
 colors with what else can we play 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.209
 good with colors that with textures with 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.940
 designs with important flowers with stripes 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.150
 with blondas all is allowed everything is 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.920
 use in the case that we want to incorporate 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.530
 a new armchair to what we already have 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.140
 exist 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.510
 can provide the upholstery service 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.880
 for example some chair or some 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.430
 complement that we have at home and 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.110
 we have upholstered retapizados 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.819
 We do not do it because our factory 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.100
 As you know, it's in Buenos Aires 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.290
 and you have to take it and bring them 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.170
 again what we can do in 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.020
 The customer's favor is to sell the same 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.020
 fabric the tone you choose the texture the 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.380
 design so that in turn she can 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.780
 command to reuphive it and thus integrate it 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.519
 to the new chair there is another module that 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.489
 we like it a lot and it's the heat 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.530
 do in cloth not the expensive unfortunately 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.750
 in cloth it can not be done because of course 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.060
 what it has is a lot of design takes 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.700
 stitching without and the stitching jim 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.700
 would lose in which the then that's 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.000
 simply makes eneko completely leather 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.090
 by the characteristic of the stitching and 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.370
 in addition the double-sided cushions 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.290
 on the side of one side of posts carries 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.000
 buttons when we get tired of seeing the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.480
 blunt if we turn it around and we have 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.430
 another design and how we can bring the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.920
 carol because good we always saw it in 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.900
 white and good chocolate we can 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.930
 do in various shades that we have in 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.420
 a very wide palette of colors the color 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.819
 it is very happy is the blue colorado and 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.160
 those colors we make the stitching jim 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.200
 which is the contrast to be noticed 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.660
 I work a model that I like a lot 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.940
 it is this that has large flowers in the 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.010
 cushions as we can adapt or 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.610
 combine other textures with other tones 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.799
 well that model is called marilyn is a 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.680
 armchair of two meters end looks great in 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:17.040
 one in two meters because if we do it in 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.680
 one of a body is going to a body 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.329
 it's going to 120 and this good what 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.300
 I commented we can combine it with the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.850
 design and texture you want in this 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.310
 case is if a thousand bodies in the structure 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.190
 without black power and the cushions in a 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.500
 Imported fabric is French with large 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.260
 flowers but in any dress there is no 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.900
 good motor is a very feminine armchair 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.600
 and since the sea ​​and a beautiful body is very 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.240
 great with which we can accompany it if 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.610
 we have a smaller space so 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.800
 We can accompany with the armchair gazebo or 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.530
 but with the little chairs that remain 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.480
 it gives you a very young vibe that you can 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.090
 it is also chosen can be integrated into the 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.640
 same tone of the armchair good many 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.320
 thank you mariluz has been a pleasure and 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.860

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.420
