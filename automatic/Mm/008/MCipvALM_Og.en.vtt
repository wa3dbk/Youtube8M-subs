00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
to the edge of the glass so it goes over

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.359 
to the edge of the glass so it goes over
the<00:01:44.790> front<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.930> goes<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.070> the

the front like so and goes right to the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.850 
the front like so and goes right to the
edges<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:48.329> instead<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.869> having<00:01:49.110> glass<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
edges but instead of having glass to the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.319 
edges but instead of having glass to the
edge<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.549> well<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.119> may<00:01:51.270> be

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
edge you have this well this may be

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.990 
edge you have this well this may be
glass<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.350> black<00:01:52.649> ring<00:01:53.280> so

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
glass but you have this black ring so

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.420 
glass but you have this black ring so
it's<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.689> bit<00:01:54.780> different<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.200> way<00:01:55.530> now

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
it's a little bit different that way now

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.959 
it's a little bit different that way now
the<00:01:56.820> case<00:01:57.060> itself<00:01:57.799> aside<00:01:58.799> from<00:01:59.040> having<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
the case itself aside from having the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.880 
the case itself aside from having the
glass<00:02:00.180> screen<00:02:00.450> protector<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.290> has<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
glass screen protector with it has a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.609 
glass screen protector with it has a
glass<00:02:02.430> back<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.420> which<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.659> what<00:02:03.840> makes<00:02:04.409> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
glass back on it which is what makes it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.170 
glass back on it which is what makes it
unique<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.189> not<00:02:05.549> only<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.060> glass

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
unique so not only do you have a glass

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
unique so not only do you have a glass
front<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> glass<00:02:06.960> back<00:02:07.229> very<00:02:07.560> similar

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
front you have a glass back very similar

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.949 
front you have a glass back very similar
to<00:02:08.099> an<00:02:08.190> iPhone<00:02:08.520> 4<00:02:08.849> which<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.660> one<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.840> my

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
to an iPhone 4 which was one of my

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.540 
to an iPhone 4 which was one of my
favorite<00:02:10.410> designs<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.039> thought<00:02:11.280> we'd<00:02:11.430> take

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
favorite designs so I thought we'd take

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.480 
favorite designs so I thought we'd take
a<00:02:11.610> look<00:02:11.819> at<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> case

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
a look at the case

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.990 
a look at the case
so<00:02:13.030> inside<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.050> case<00:02:14.320> it's<00:02:15.160> got<00:02:15.430> dual<00:02:15.760> layers

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
so inside this case it's got dual layers

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.540 
so inside this case it's got dual layers
and<00:02:16.690> here's<00:02:17.470> just<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.770> little<00:02:17.950> insert<00:02:18.340> that

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
and here's just a little insert that

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.910 
and here's just a little insert that
goes<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:18.940> it's<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.510> dual<00:02:19.810> layers<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.770> can

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
goes here it's a dual layers and you can

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.530 
goes here it's a dual layers and you can
see<00:02:21.070> this<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.370> glass<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:22.030> isn't<00:02:22.300> plastic

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
see this is glass this isn't plastic

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.440 
see this is glass this isn't plastic
it's<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.080> glass<00:02:23.350> piece<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:25.030> place<00:02:25.300> your

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
it's a glass piece and you place your

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.770 
it's a glass piece and you place your
iPhone<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.730> fits<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.240> so<00:02:28.450> no<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.660> do

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
iPhone in it and it fits like so no I do

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.390 
iPhone in it and it fits like so no I do
have<00:02:28.960> a<00:02:28.990> skin<00:02:29.320> on<00:02:29.350> my<00:02:29.560> iPhone<00:02:29.920> but<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.190> fits

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
have a skin on my iPhone but it fits

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.450 
have a skin on my iPhone but it fits
fine<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:32.530> those<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.070> like<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.310> put

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
fine for those of you that like to put

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.340 
fine for those of you that like to put
skins<00:02:33.760> on<00:02:33.910> your<00:02:34.030> phones<00:02:34.240> too<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.930> then<00:02:35.110> put

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
skins on your phones too and then put

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.200 
skins on your phones too and then put
them<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.650> case<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.520> can<00:02:36.550> do<00:02:36.820> that

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
them in a case you can do that

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.860 
them in a case you can do that
so<00:02:38.200> we'll<00:02:38.500> clip<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:38.860> into<00:02:38.980> place<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:40.720> can

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
so we'll clip it into place and you can

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.840 
so we'll clip it into place and you can
see<00:02:41.110> it's<00:02:41.230> pretty<00:02:41.650> thick<00:02:42.190> right<00:02:42.460> there<00:02:42.700> and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
see it's pretty thick right there and

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.340 
see it's pretty thick right there and
that's<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.180> part<00:02:43.420> I'm<00:02:43.570> not<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:43.930> crazy<00:02:44.080> about

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
that's the part I'm not so crazy about

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.710 
that's the part I'm not so crazy about
and<00:02:44.950> right<00:02:45.460> here<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.730> obviously<00:02:46.150> could<00:02:46.510> not

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
and right here I obviously could not

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.990 
and right here I obviously could not
reach<00:02:47.050> those<00:02:47.410> buttons<00:02:47.830> without<00:02:48.070> putting<00:02:48.460> this

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
reach those buttons without putting this

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.030 
reach those buttons without putting this
piece<00:02:49.330> on<00:02:49.630> so<00:02:50.020> what<00:02:50.200> we<00:02:50.320> do<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.560> we<00:02:50.680> take<00:02:50.830> this

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
piece on so what we do is we take this

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.160 
piece on so what we do is we take this
ring<00:02:52.860> we<00:02:53.860> place<00:02:54.100> it<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.370> like<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:56.080> just

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
ring we place it on like so and just

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.680 
ring we place it on like so and just
kind<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.560> work<00:02:56.740> our<00:02:56.920> way<00:02:57.040> around<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.700> I'm<00:02:58.480> not

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
kind of work our way around and I'm not

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.590 
kind of work our way around and I'm not
sure<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:58.930> like<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.440> texture<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:01.030> rubber

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
sure I like the texture of this rubber

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.690 
sure I like the texture of this rubber
piece<00:03:01.930> it's<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.770> little<00:03:03.010> bit<00:03:03.130> different<00:03:03.580> it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
piece it's a little bit different it

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.880 
piece it's a little bit different it
feels<00:03:03.970> kind<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.450> like<00:03:04.630> Oh<00:03:04.960> kind<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.620> like<00:03:05.680> it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
feels kind of like Oh kind of like it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.520 
feels kind of like Oh kind of like it
looks<00:03:06.160> kind<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.730> like<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.940> tire<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.210> suppose<00:03:07.840> so

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
looks kind of like a tire I suppose so

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.690 
looks kind of like a tire I suppose so
it<00:03:09.280> makes<00:03:09.640> this<00:03:09.910> case<00:03:10.270> or<00:03:10.690> makes<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.140> phone

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
it makes this case or makes this phone

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.930 
it makes this case or makes this phone
pretty<00:03:12.700> bulky<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:14.070> it's<00:03:15.070> definitely<00:03:15.700> going

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
pretty bulky and it's definitely going

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.600 
pretty bulky and it's definitely going
to<00:03:15.970> protect<00:03:16.360> your<00:03:16.540> phone<00:03:16.720> from<00:03:16.990> drops<00:03:17.080> in<00:03:17.770> it

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
to protect your phone from drops in it

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.280 
to protect your phone from drops in it
will<00:03:18.820> let<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.120> see<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.630> back<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:19.810> your<00:03:20.020> phone

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
have different colors just change it so

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.790 
so it's not that bad of a thing it does
look<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.510> tire<00:03:40.720> because<00:03:41.080> it's<00:03:41.230> black<00:03:41.500> but

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
look like a tire because it's black but

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.650 
look like a tire because it's black but
you<00:03:41.830> can<00:03:42.070> reach<00:03:42.280> your<00:03:42.550> your<00:03:43.330> different

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
you can reach your your different

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.990 
you can reach your your different
buttons<00:03:43.990> with<00:03:44.170> no<00:03:44.320> problem<00:03:44.770> you<00:03:45.160> can<00:03:45.190> slide<00:03:45.670> up

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
buttons with no problem you can slide up

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.460 
buttons with no problem you can slide up
and<00:03:46.180> down<00:03:46.270> this<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.810> little<00:03:47.050> bit<00:03:47.170> different

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
and down this is a little bit different

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.230 
and down this is a little bit different
take<00:03:47.650> but<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:47.950> can<00:03:48.130> slide<00:03:48.490> up<00:03:48.670> and<00:03:48.790> down<00:03:48.970> your

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
take but you can slide up and down your

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.320 
take but you can slide up and down your
vibrate<00:03:49.900> switch<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.880> silent<00:03:51.880> switch<00:03:51.970> there

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
vibrate switch and silent switch there

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.030 
vibrate switch and silent switch there
and<00:03:52.540> then<00:03:52.660> you've<00:03:52.780> got<00:03:52.930> your<00:03:53.080> volume<00:03:53.770> up<00:03:53.860> and

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
and then you've got your volume up and

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.770 
and then you've got your volume up and
down<00:03:54.100> they're<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:54.880> little<00:03:55.120> bit<00:03:55.300> difficult<00:03:55.510> to

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
down they're a little bit difficult to

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.830 
down they're a little bit difficult to
push<00:03:56.080> and<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:57.250> power<00:03:57.730> button<00:03:57.970> same<00:03:58.390> thing<00:03:58.690> but

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
push and the power button same thing but

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.080 
push and the power button same thing but
they<00:03:58.990> all<00:03:59.110> work<00:03:59.350> no<00:03:59.530> problems<00:04:00.100> there<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.490> then

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
they all work no problems there and then

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.150 
they all work no problems there and then
on<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:01.300> back<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.690> can<00:04:01.810> see<00:04:01.870> your<00:04:02.560> phone<00:04:02.800> and

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
on the back you can see your phone and

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.190 
on the back you can see your phone and
that's<00:04:03.610> one<00:04:03.910> thing<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.270> know<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.420> lot<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:04.780> people

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
that's one thing I know a lot of people

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.050 
that's one thing I know a lot of people
want<00:04:05.410> they<00:04:05.590> might<00:04:06.040> buy<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.250> silver<00:04:06.730> one<00:04:06.880> like

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
want they might buy the silver one like

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.180 
want they might buy the silver one like
this<00:04:07.240> or<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.660> gold<00:04:07.930> people<00:04:08.560> want<00:04:08.830> to<00:04:08.920> see<00:04:09.070> the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
this or the gold people want to see the

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.890 
this or the gold people want to see the
color<00:04:09.430> of<00:04:09.550> their<00:04:09.820> phone<00:04:10.090> through<00:04:10.510> here<00:04:10.750> and

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
color of their phone through here and

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.780 
color of their phone through here and
that's<00:04:11.620> what<00:04:11.830> this<00:04:11.950> allows<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.520> it<00:04:12.580> has<00:04:12.760> a

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
that's what this allows and it has a

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.180 
that's what this allows and it has a
nice<00:04:13.030> feel<00:04:13.300> to<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.570> back<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.110> then<00:04:14.830> on<00:04:15.040> the

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
nice feel to the back and then on the

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.220 
nice feel to the back and then on the
bottom<00:04:15.340> you've<00:04:16.180> got<00:04:16.420> your<00:04:16.570> access<00:04:16.960> to<00:04:17.109> your

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
bottom you've got your access to your

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.750 
bottom you've got your access to your
ports<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:17.799> they're<00:04:17.950> in<00:04:18.070> there<00:04:18.220> quite<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.489> ways

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
ports and they're in there quite a ways

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.830 
ports and they're in there quite a ways
you<00:04:19.299> can<00:04:19.480> see<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.950> then<00:04:21.220> you've<00:04:22.090> got<00:04:22.390> access

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
you can see and then you've got access

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.930 
you can see and then you've got access
to<00:04:23.110> this<00:04:23.380> board<00:04:23.680> as<00:04:23.800> well

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
to this board as well

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.750 
to this board as well
let<00:04:25.210> me<00:04:25.300> show<00:04:25.480> you<00:04:25.540> how<00:04:25.750> deep<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.170> really<00:04:26.530> is

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
let me show you how deep this really is

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.490 
let me show you how deep this really is
so<00:04:27.760> if<00:04:27.850> I<00:04:27.910> put<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.150> lightning<00:04:28.720> cable<00:04:28.900> in<00:04:29.230> here

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
so if I put a lightning cable in here

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.970 
so if I put a lightning cable in here
you'll<00:04:30.040> see<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.430> goes<00:04:30.610> up<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:31.200> about<00:04:32.200> halfway

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
you'll see it goes up to about halfway

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.240 
you'll see it goes up to about halfway
up<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:34.390> cable<00:04:34.720> itself<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.380> it's<00:04:36.070> got<00:04:36.220> a

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
up the cable itself so it's got a

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.780 
up the cable itself so it's got a
considerable<00:04:37.260> distance<00:04:38.260> in<00:04:38.620> there<00:04:38.800> but<00:04:39.100> this

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
considerable distance in there but this

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.280 
considerable distance in there but this
is<00:04:40.090> going<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.570> protect<00:04:40.720> your<00:04:41.080> phone<00:04:41.230> from

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
is going to protect your phone from

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.120 
is going to protect your phone from
drops<00:04:41.650> no<00:04:42.400> problem<00:04:42.850> so<00:04:43.210> let<00:04:44.200> me<00:04:44.380> put<00:04:44.950> these

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
drops no problem so let me put these

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.690 
drops no problem so let me put these
back

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
back

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.020 
back
they<00:04:46.450> actually<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.860> actually<00:04:48.220> seals<00:04:48.640> in<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
they actually this actually seals in the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.390 
they actually this actually seals in the
bottom<00:04:49.450> of<00:04:49.630> your<00:04:49.780> lightning<00:04:50.170> connector<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:50.860> it

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
bottom of your lightning connector so it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.220 
bottom of your lightning connector so it
keeps<00:04:51.670> you<00:04:51.820> from<00:04:51.910> getting<00:04:52.030> dust<00:04:52.540> in<00:04:52.840> there<00:04:53.050> I

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
keeps you from getting dust in there I

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.290 
keeps you from getting dust in there I
just<00:04:53.590> got<00:04:53.740> an<00:04:53.830> email<00:04:54.010> or<00:04:54.370> something<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:55.120> keeps

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
just got an email or something it keeps

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.410 
just got an email or something it keeps
you<00:04:55.420> from<00:04:55.510> getting<00:04:55.690> dust<00:04:56.080> in<00:04:56.290> there<00:04:56.470> and

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
you from getting dust in there and

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.120 
you from getting dust in there and
prevents<00:04:58.420> that<00:04:58.570> now<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.930> nice<00:04:59.170> part<00:04:59.470> is<00:04:59.590> if

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
prevents that now the nice part is if

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.710 
prevents that now the nice part is if
you<00:05:00.310> put<00:05:00.490> their<00:05:00.670> glass<00:05:00.850> screen<00:05:01.210> protector<00:05:01.690> on

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
you put their glass screen protector on

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.960 
you put their glass screen protector on
the<00:05:01.900> front<00:05:02.230> it<00:05:02.350> protects<00:05:02.770> edge-to-edge<00:05:02.980> so

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
the front it protects edge-to-edge so

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.750 
the front it protects edge-to-edge so
you<00:05:04.750> don't<00:05:04.930> see<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.350> black<00:05:05.530> point<00:05:05.860> part<00:05:06.250> you

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
you don't see the black point part you

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.120 
you don't see the black point part you
just<00:05:07.060> see<00:05:07.270> this<00:05:07.720> white<00:05:07.960> piece<00:05:08.230> but<00:05:08.830> if<00:05:09.010> you

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
just see this white piece but if you

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.320 
just see this white piece but if you
were<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.310> take<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.670> off<00:05:09.880> and<00:05:09.910> use<00:05:10.180> it

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
were to take this off and use it

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.240 
were to take this off and use it
separately<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:10.930> glass<00:05:11.530> screen<00:05:11.830> protector

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
separately that glass screen protector

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.800 
separately that glass screen protector
doesn't<00:05:12.520> work<00:05:12.700> as<00:05:12.880> well<00:05:13.060> they<00:05:13.270> also<00:05:13.420> say<00:05:13.690> this

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
doesn't work as well they also say this

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.830 
doesn't work as well they also say this
has<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.020> six<00:05:14.380> foot<00:05:14.650> drop<00:05:14.980> protection<00:05:15.640> but<00:05:16.390> again

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
has a six foot drop protection but again

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.410 
has a six foot drop protection but again
it<00:05:17.080> is<00:05:17.200> bulky<00:05:17.650> so<00:05:17.860> if<00:05:17.920> you<00:05:18.040> want<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.370> thin<00:05:18.700> case<00:05:19.000> I

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
it is bulky so if you want a thin case I

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.390 
it is bulky so if you want a thin case I
