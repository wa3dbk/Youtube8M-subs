00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
you can see that the environment here

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
you can see that the environment here
the<00:00:46.680> lod<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.370> they<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.640> sort<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.300> you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the lod is that they have sort of as you

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.850 
the lod is that they have sort of as you
go<00:00:48.629> away<00:00:48.750> from<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.590> no<00:00:49.680> longer

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
directly see it there's a wall there so

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
directly see it there's a wall there so
the<00:00:51.750> game<00:00:51.930> thinks<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.260> can't<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:53.190> loads

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the game thinks I can't see it it loads

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.910 
the game thinks I can't see it it loads
out<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.300> extra<00:00:54.719> models<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.289> props<00:00:55.530> i<00:00:55.710> put
