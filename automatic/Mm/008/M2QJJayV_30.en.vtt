vegetable peeler and peel it but I'm

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.780 
vegetable peeler and peel it but I'm
going<00:00:40.769> to<00:00:40.800> show<00:00:40.979> you<00:00:41.040> something<00:00:41.460> that's<00:00:41.580> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
going to show you something that's a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.149 
going to show you something that's a
little<00:00:42.180> bit<00:00:42.479> more<00:00:42.659> creative<00:00:43.080> first<00:00:43.830> of<00:00:44.040> all

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:44.159 
little bit more creative first of all

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.979 
little bit more creative first of all
you<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.580> understand<00:00:45.089> the<00:00:45.269> shape<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you have to understand the shape of a

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.170 
you have to understand the shape of a
mango<00:00:46.409> if<00:00:46.650> you<00:00:46.949> take<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.220> look<00:00:47.519> at<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.790> mango

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
mango if you take a look at this mango

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.420 
mango if you take a look at this mango
you'll<00:00:48.449> see<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.199> there's<00:00:49.470> almost<00:00:49.769> a<00:00:50.100> seam

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
you'll see that there's almost a seam

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.479 
you'll see that there's almost a seam
that<00:00:50.460> runs<00:00:50.729> along<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.049> top<00:00:52.080> and<00:00:52.739> that's

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
that runs along the top and that's

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.719 
that runs along the top and that's
because<00:00:54.030> there's<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> flat<00:00:54.739> seed<00:00:55.739> right<00:00:56.339> inside

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
because there's a flat seed right inside

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.450 
because there's a flat seed right inside
the<00:00:56.879> mango<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:58.199> side<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.799> mango<00:00:59.220> is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the mango so one side of the mango is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.060 
the mango so one side of the mango is
more<00:00:59.970> narrow<00:01:00.330> than<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:00.960> other<00:01:01.470> side<00:01:01.830> of<00:01:01.979> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
more narrow than the other side of the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
more narrow than the other side of the
mango<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.970> want<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.330> do<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
mango what we want to do is we want to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.820 
mango what we want to do is we want to
cut<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.559> alongside<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:06.180> seed<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.440> if<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
cut right alongside that seed so if the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.250 
cut right alongside that seed so if the
seed<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.100> flat<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.360> I'm<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
seed is flat like this I'm going to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.160 
seed is flat like this I'm going to
place<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.500> knife<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.729> side<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.689> seam

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
place my knife to one side of this seam

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.160 
place my knife to one side of this seam
and<00:01:13.560> I'm<00:01:14.009> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.609> just<00:01:15.240> draw<00:01:15.630> my<00:01:15.899> knife

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and I'm going to just draw my knife

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.920 
and I'm going to just draw my knife
straight<00:01:16.680> down<00:01:17.060> along<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> seed<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.750> can

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
straight down along the seed and I can

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.440 
straight down along the seed and I can
feel<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:19.530> seat<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.430> there<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.210> have

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
feel the seat there and there we have

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.950 
feel the seat there and there we have
one<00:01:22.049> cheek<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.549> mango<00:01:23.969> now<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that is the most flesh of the mango but

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.819 
that is the most flesh of the mango but
there's<00:01:39.270> still<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.539> lot<00:01:39.899> surrounding<00:01:40.679> this
