00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.110
 in this one the first one was to show how they were little less 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.239
 I will invite the main steps 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.579
 I will go into details of how it will be resolved 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.319
 the fighter known as vulcano 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:18.730
 who raised on Saturday the 20th because 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.779
 and it's the same designed by the same person who designed it 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.869
 the teacher pianist pyramid five layers 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.789
 percent went in 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:32.900
 this tunnel 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.210
 it is similar to agr 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.540
 epidermis 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.770
 but with him 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 one small difference and that is that the outer layers 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.010
 they can turn 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.630
 enriches but tours in these inner layers 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.570
 by other equivalent population 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 this piece syrian this 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.220
 this is the title that the Nigerian 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.220
 these pieces 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.130
 but I went down to the outer layers because it adds a 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.409
 as it is evident 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.570
 unibe of this difficulty 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.700
 that makes it more complicated special 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.189
 friend we arrive at the end by our soriano colombiana shakira 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.000
 there is a situation that does not present a pyramid 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.930
 when we tend the pyramid a very critical situation with we are 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.000
 solving for example if we see them kaka 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 then southern manhattan the upper layer those that ravages out superior 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.160
 if there is a well-placed list 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.380
 and that you only have to hit the tourists if the very common situation 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.010
 how this pyramid is solved 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.020
 that these two for example that are in place and now what to guide the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.460
 people your site 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.460
 do not have to spend the night in the inner streets, however 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.190
 in this the Bulgarian can have two edges two blocks of these 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.780
 and it's also paired 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.220
 only two 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.370
 and you have to ask the 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.670
 and that situation does not appear in this one 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.150
 to say that we were accessible in this pianist 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.200
 in this appointment 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.330
 Thus 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.820
 you have to do it well because more complex that involves movements of three layers 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.840
 exterior 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.820
 the charity of copper I think was pending 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.820
 is not designed to do that I do want good but good 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.379
 the movements are good percent sometimes clogging the outer layers 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.619
 Stop especially if you have this a little misaligned 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:16.609
 they get stuck 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.839
 these are you taking away or falling 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.549
 but those who are floating 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.199
 they are simply placed by species 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.439
 camp nou when surely they are where they are because they are 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.389
 compressed costs face 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:34.419
 percents the top parts backpack the pyramids these presences can not be 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.809
 pull well with your finger because it deforms accuse 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.159
 calamaro 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.439
 but let's go for the rest 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.519
 I'm counting on this puzzle how they resolve or how men like 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.309
 colors yours 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.439
 so much is the first step 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.659
 what are you doing? 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.909
 in pairs my ultimate goal is reduced to a pyramid 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.520
 if we do not rotate the outer layers we never imagine that we are 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.259
 slowing down 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.099
 and that we are never able to weep 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
 if we do not start very well you can testino 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.319
 ovelar percent today the expo of the exquisite 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.929
 so we are treating it for all purposes it is just like this one 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:19.040
 is exactly the same as if it turns out that he lied to the one who did not 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.039
 We do no twist of the outer layers 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.849
 in 2011 I have to solve it to solve it is 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:29.330
 get a state 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.140
 messy of this pyramid that means that it's tortilla people 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.019
 paired 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.609
 the leader for example red 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.819
 yellow like me that so much different from javascript 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.539
 so the tasks not because this is not pregnant totes my goal is 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:45.989
 that all the pieces that are 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.650
 to treat something as one to treat it as one and solve it as 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.359
 the pyramid as if it were a stack of what the step is to match 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.519
 all these 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.100
 pairings in stable and larger pairs 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.409
 this time yellow yellow green 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.759
 match all the exquisite 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.109
 and so against the pieces 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.269
 the first step 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.549
 is to match 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:07.669
 they're here 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.789
 which 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:14.159
 this is what it would be let's see the crowding put the face down pressure 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.520
 by 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.309
 what they would be 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:17.939
 percent 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.699
 these 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:21.779
 I'm here 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.400
 yellow and red 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.069
 they're here 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:26.110
 with this form 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.639
 these little triangles united by issues that have to see little that you are or 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.350
 you are not here 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.840
 well these protests with yellow 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.170
 yellow blue 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.840
 this required that they do not cause these 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.159
 he matched all this step is simple he feels of tutoring 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.270
 I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.639
 what can be done if not desired and not simply if it still scala 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.639
 I travel external scales and fear is doing nothing because we do not have any 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.439
 more complicated 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:56.739
 p we match all these parties is tested opted to this team 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.389
 PerÃ³n, this one is attentive to how all of us who feel steps match 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.599
 little corner 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.069
 it's also simple 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.839
 in fact it is a step that we could leave for the end 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:09.839
 because it is reduced to make turns of outer layers 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:16.460
 that loosened for example of the outer layer turning corners affect them are 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.630
 everything that happens if you can go down to skating swallows pattern second place 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.730
 so that it is clearer that each time there is a green pearl blue 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.270
 after the cup 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.009
 once we have for example this block this block 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.130
 solved destiny tas as soon as we complain the third block the fourth set son 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.999
 automatically 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:38.710
 it's the good thing 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.139
 without details and greater importance is the last step and the most complicated 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.379
 is to match the missing pieces 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:49.089
 well once we have in slices the tas these 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:50.200
 and the tunitas 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.219
 we can undo the cube and without fear because 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.219
 because he does not object but the expenses 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.509
 these clues cites advantages never rooms match 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.619
 caught texts etc 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:06.050
 2 we can undo what we can to avoid it 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.830
 mental we look at the outer faces nothing happens 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.580
 then indepabis to match the ones that remain these little things that jolie 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.119
 in the role of 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:18.159
 of these here is green that is wrong and I or red this fish and techniques 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:23.069
 would be this is the fifth manila fulham in the culture teams sorry I tivo 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:24.219
 your partner all 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.229
 the ones with this pyramid 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.379
 because there are six unambiguous signs 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:30.559
 axel 6 

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:32.529
 a porn 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:35.139
 one for Laura on the island 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.139
 and what will happen is that we are going to reach a situation 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.949
 a Nepalese to program some form 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.479
 we are solving this series these little ones we all do and when we 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:47.629
 there are two 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.389
 we do not know how to solve it by that python algorithms that we are 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.139
 applying another one is undone and we're always going to have two 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.869
 you do not have to go through a look 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:58.580
 you make the edges in a cube four by four 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.290
 what do you do all satire that are two but if you keep applying what happens 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.990
 pipe lovers of those who sum who already had were cast 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.389
 we will see it 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:10.710
 and for that we will need then a long algorithm an algorithm of 39 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.779
 movements 

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:14.539
 and it can be broken down to understand it better 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:18.550
 percent in two algorithms in a combination of the algorithms twice 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.580
 magonismo twice another and third time 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.279
 then another plus and all that can be cost cured and monago complex 

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:26.029
 of 39 movements 

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.899
 and these what in the last case that would already be solved that is the case 

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:31.330
 complicated that this pyramid pyramid does not appear 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.969
 but good sometimes at the same time is not 

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:37.219
 for long recent tutorial and already the gentile I will teach how how 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:38.710
 hide these 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.839
 corners 

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:43.589
 Which one goes up in time because such an iconic wine, because nothing - the scientist
