 The team I brought today is a drink. 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.410
 delicious that I really like to include 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.500
 in my day besides super practice of 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.769
 do and only talking 2 nights of fruit 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.230
 red esmuti for those who do not know is 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.150
 fruit or chilled with 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.420
 creamy texture that can be made with 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.969
 ice or ice cream and orkut 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.340
 but as the boss fitch's proposal and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.300
 help them make a practical recipe and 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.399
 healthy 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.260
 I brought this recipe here with 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.690
 functional ingredients 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.690
 instead of making ice cream ourselves 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.899
 we will use the skimmed yogurt and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.110
 I will also add the protection 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 to leave the enamel but the technician 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.160
 I even want to dedicate this recipe 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.590
 that all athletes to practitioners 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.510
 physical activity and you are 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.430
 watching my video to make the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.650
 you will need a mix of 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.720
 red fruits I've separated here 50 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.820
 grams of blackberries and 50 grams of strawberries 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.600
 frozen but you have the option to make 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.830
 with raspberry cherry release the first 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.720
 that you want 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.600
 The cool thing to do with the pussies and socks 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.240
 is that they are rich in antioxidants 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.750
 besides witches and - we have here 200ml 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.790
 of skimmed egg and three to less than five 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.710
 grams of shia seed to let 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.290
 with more revenue work our 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.180
 The last church in jequié 1 in protein is 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.670
 he who will make our enamel 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.159
 What protein are we going to prepare? 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.159
 Let's put first and deforested eggs 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.090
 the frozen berries 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:02:00.150
 bush the almond and last here our 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.150
 it's protein 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.259
 I'll process another 20 to 30 seconds 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.080
 approximately or even the ingredients 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:21.370
 would incorporate 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:23.050
 here we have a well textured drink 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.070
 creamy 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.070
 you can observe 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.900
 it is super practical to make healthy and 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.860
 best is rich in protein and sun 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.050
