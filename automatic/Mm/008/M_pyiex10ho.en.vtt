00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.130
 the ford focus comes in three 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.480
 bodywork of no less than ten 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.019
 engines are available at 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.780
 catalog 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.309
 here our compact goes into eco mode and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.809
 yes ford like many others 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.330
 builders give way to small fashion 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.130
 compressed turbo engines here the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.640
 compact does receive a small 3 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.080
 125 horsepower strong turbo cylinders 1 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.560
 liter is the cubic capacity of this 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.390
 compact 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.710
 then necessarily we are entitled to 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.050
 ask us some questions about 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 abilities of this car it is nothing 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.020
 quite the contrary since this block would 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.579
 even rather pleasant especially down 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.910
 regime where the turbo plays perfectly his 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.890
 role 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.180
 another advantage unlike the others 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.010
 three cylinders that we have for habit 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.840
 to hear this one is really 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.789
 discreet and the vibrations are rather 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.190
 content with a six-speed box 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.410
 and a stop system start the focus 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.390
 consumes on average 1.5 liters 100 km in 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.620
 mixed cycle 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.030
 on the road the focus is always showing 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.680
 equally effective and adopt a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.879
 healthy and pleasant road behavior 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.199
 Another advantage is its suspension comfort 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.160
 the driving position offered by the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.899
 focus is really top 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.549
 driving the driver enjoys a 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.890
 good feeling and the gearbox falls 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.180
 ideally at hand the design of the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.740
 dashboard is a bit complicated and 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.189
 we sometimes have a little trouble getting there 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.530
 find 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.330
 some buttons are too small 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 the finish as for it is not very 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.259
 flattering we still find a lot 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.479
 of hard plastics for equipment 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.070
 the titanium version offers air conditioning series 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.350
 auto the automatic ignition of the lights and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.560
 Wipers a multifunction display 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.180
 or a cruise control 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.250
 the focus is not famous for its 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.720
 habitability the bench accepts 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.770
 willingly three passengers but the most 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.200
 big will not be very comfortable 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.390
 indeed the rear space turns out a little 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.970
 too confined ditto for the volume of 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.960
 trunk with 363 liters the latter remains 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.869
 set back from the others 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.780
 models of the category our ford focus 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.789
 1 liter sci 125 horses equipped with the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.360
 titanium finish is displayed at 22000 at 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.250
 500 euros 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.409
 know that a less powerful version of the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.759
 1 liter 100 horses is in the catalog at 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.179
 from 19 thousand six hundred and fifty 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.770
 euros 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.770
 always for the 5-door models
