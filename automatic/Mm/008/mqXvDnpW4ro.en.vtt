00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:09.740
 Hello everyone, are you on the channel with your words 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.799
 you afon and today to me here spontaneously 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.710
 would like to say omega omega this 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:19.010
 a city that is built in an asteroid in 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.400
 space among other tuned why 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.949
 I wanted to say well, in the process of 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.619
 shooting second season total 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.199
 the principle of turmoil and the flood of another work 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.570
 and so on came such a desire 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.390
 do something like introductory pedi and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.820
 I wanted to do something similar by 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.000
 the first part but somehow it did not reach 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.270
 in that but so studied and now we 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.750
 handle and invite you to video 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:52.090
 Omega excursion grim gangster 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.090
 city ​​which is built to deliver 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.090
 It is officially unknown who found and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.990
 who founded omega after extinction 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.940
 there 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.430
 but what is known is also only our tribute 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.860
 this asteroid they gathered to mine from 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 it is zero element and other heavy 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.920
 metals 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.410
 but it was impossible because the mountain 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.930
 this asteroid was very very strong 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.150
 and in the end this is mining 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.780
 turned out to be unprofitable sell not 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.390
 disappeared gone thousands of years omega being 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.580
 among other similar asteroids start 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.550
 crack split during collisions 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.000
 and up to the other races the mining of all these 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.970
 resources become easy to mine that's what 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.610
 happened to these steroids with omega 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 before the start of the main trilogy mass 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.970
 effect'a 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.190
 the whole atmosphere on omega is the most view itself 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.100
 the fact that this city is built and you 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.680
 build among other deep asteroids 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.660
 space I find quite romantic and 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.050
 maybe some of you all the same 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.850
 noticed that the second part of the mass effect 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.280
 in places very much like you 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.700
 you will be a cyberpunk penny mr visually 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.560
 so that's exactly omega she's still 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.280
 as close as possible to cyber punk here 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.250
 we have 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.860
 dark lighting a lot of dark 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.230
 flowers one big club toy omega 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.020
 in charge of 1 asari 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.850
 thugs everywhere mercenaries secrets 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.130
 corporations but this is actually very 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.590
 seems like some kind of cyberpunk and probably 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.470
 if you take all these decorations 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.910
 change character models and so on 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.040
 can you do some cyber 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.350
 banking plot and whoever I noticed 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.530
 I think general and artists in bioware 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.600
 still its job well or especially 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.260
 when among them was casey hudson who 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.700
 Unfortunately 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.700
 gone from biawar 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.840
 let's take the story of us first when having sex 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.450
 I just liked the spectrum 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.879
 so on most of all possible 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.700
 resources from this side of the same life charge 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.370
 this asteroid flew different 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.590
 corporations private entrepreneurs well and 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.840
 it so happened that they became 90 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.700
 criminals of all stripes and varieties 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.480
 after some time all free space 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.470
 set up ended steel structure 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.260
 built even higher 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.510
 which ultimately created this one 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.959
 famous silhouette on copper which looks like 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.079
 on mushroom 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.239
 Irina cosmic jellyfish who like all 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.879
 various fossils that remained 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.400
 after paton from the bowels of the astroid end 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.560
 the result has been reworked into a resource or what 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.170
 and served as the basis for the construction 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.540
 constructions and buildings which covers 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.239
 every meter of space on this 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.819
 asteroid station in turn had 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.129
 unusual designs still elegant 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.609
 kind of developed and built quite 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.819
 spontaneously all private traders there 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.079
 migrant migrant workers and other peoples and 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.780
 organizations call or there their 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.569
 buildings and sometimes even whole sections 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.849
 without a general plan and without reporting only 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.849
 from the fact that he wanted so much 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:12.130
 and that's exactly how omega turned into 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.130
 such a flying city among asteroids 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.470
 Here is the official story of the appearance 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.990
 founding copper of this city you trend 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.229
 a city that really looks like 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.199
 some kind of ghetto in space where everyone rolls 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.600
 gangsters all kinds of outcasts who wanted 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.340
 start over and there is no 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.470
 there is no single law 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.900
 governments just everyone 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.560
 any dirty thug there 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.960
 own area 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.120
 He is the roof of the area if someone 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.280
 something doesn't like him there kicks out or 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.770
 just thrown into space on the bottom 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.289
 floors of the local club by life in general 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.449
 hanging out grumbling and probably nobody in 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.910
 the whole galaxy would not recommend you 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.310
 omega as a permanent place 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.710
 residence because this place is dirty 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.820
 dangerous but in its own way all the same 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.940
 attracting 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.699
 and romantic on it all if you 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.860
 I liked this format of the introduction of pedi 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.620
 in the mass effect universe write about it 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.380
 in the comments show friends and sister 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.320
 like put subscribe so on 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.050
 will there be more release in the process of shooting 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.479
 the season itself and so on we are not yet 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.750
 I know everything depends on you and your 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.750
 feedback
