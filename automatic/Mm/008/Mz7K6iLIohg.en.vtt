there are like engravings kind of like I
don't<00:06:37.490> know<00:06:37.700> how<00:06:37.820> to<00:06:37.880> describe<00:06:38.060> it<00:06:39.010> there<00:06:40.010> are

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
don't know how to describe it there are

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
don't know how to describe it there are
some<00:06:40.479> like<00:06:41.479> branches<00:06:42.139> and<00:06:42.470> leaves<00:06:43.430> and<00:06:43.880> the

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
some like branches and leaves and the

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.710 
some like branches and leaves and the
bird<00:06:44.419> is<00:06:44.780> just<00:06:45.050> really<00:06:45.650> really<00:06:45.800> nice<00:06:46.100> design

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
bird is just really really nice design

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.110 
bird is just really really nice design
so<00:06:47.720> looks<00:06:48.380> like<00:06:48.470> that<00:06:48.740> this<00:06:48.919> I<00:06:49.310> think<00:06:50.000> it's

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
so looks like that this I think it's

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.150 
so looks like that this I think it's
called<00:06:50.330> oxygen<00:06:50.960> top<00:06:51.350> at<00:06:51.560> least<00:06:51.710> that's<00:06:51.950> what

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
called oxygen top at least that's what

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.890 
called oxygen top at least that's what
it<00:06:52.190> says<00:06:52.310> and<00:06:52.789> suppose<00:06:53.180> have<00:06:53.389> a<00:06:53.419> really<00:06:53.690> good

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
it says and suppose have a really good

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.740 
it says and suppose have a really good
