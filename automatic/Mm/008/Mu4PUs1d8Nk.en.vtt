00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.840 
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack over
this<00:02:29.760> side<00:02:29.970> there's<00:02:30.239> nothing<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.519> on<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.670> top

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
this side there's nothing and on the top

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.130 
this side there's nothing and on the top
we<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.030> another<00:02:33.299> microphone<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:34.079> noise

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
we have another microphone for noise

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.440 
we have another microphone for noise
cancellation<00:02:34.950> now<00:02:35.489> there<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.850> no<00:02:36.000> expandable

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
cancellation now there is no expandable

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.750 
cancellation now there is no expandable
memory<00:02:36.570> but<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.260> g<00:02:37.410> flex<00:02:37.560> does<00:02:37.890> come<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.190> 32gb

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
memory but the g flex does come to 32gb

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.039 
memory but the g flex does come to 32gb
so<00:02:39.060> i<00:02:39.090> think<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.360> should<00:02:39.540> be<00:02:39.600> enough<00:02:39.900> for

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
so i think that should be enough for

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.010 
so i think that should be enough for
most<00:02:40.200> are<00:02:40.760> coming<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.880> back

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
most are coming to the back

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.830 
most are coming to the back
rid<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:45.300> around<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.380> back<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:47.840> where

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
rid of this so around the back is where

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.510 
rid of this so around the back is where
the<00:02:49.020> rest<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.620> buttons<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:52.040> LEDs<00:02:53.040> are<00:02:53.250> so

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
the rest of the buttons and LEDs are so

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.840 
the rest of the buttons and LEDs are so
we<00:02:53.670> have<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:54.410> volume<00:02:55.410> rocker<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.580> course

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
we have a volume rocker and of course

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.000 
we have a volume rocker and of course
the<00:02:57.000> power<00:02:57.210> button<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.410> g<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.770> have

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
the power button just like the g to have

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.820 
the power button just like the g to have
it<00:02:59.160> around<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.520> back<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.540> as<00:03:00.930> i<00:03:01.140> think<00:03:01.440> an<00:03:01.560> ion

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
it around the back and as i think an ion

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.040 
it around the back and as i think an ion
sensor<00:03:02.040> seems<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.060> an<00:03:03.180> honest<00:03:03.390> answer<00:03:03.600> and

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
sensor seems like an honest answer and

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.860 
sensor seems like an honest answer and
we<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.970> camera<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.780> LED<00:03:07.020> flash<00:03:07.350> on

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
we have the camera and the LED flash on

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.280 
we have the camera and the LED flash on
this<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.080> course<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.590> back<00:03:10.800> is<00:03:12.290> covered

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
this is of course the back is covered

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.400 
this is of course the back is covered
with<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:14.180> special<00:03:15.180> coating<00:03:15.420> which<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.050> supposed

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
with a special coating which is supposed

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.320 
with a special coating which is supposed
to<00:03:16.620> resist<00:03:17.010> scratches<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:17.670> we<00:03:17.850> will<00:03:17.970> test<00:03:18.180> that

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
to resist scratches so we will test that

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.870 
to resist scratches so we will test that
out<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.870> bit<00:03:19.080> ok<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.100> before<00:03:20.310> we<00:03:20.610> wrap<00:03:20.760> up

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
out in a bit ok so before we wrap up

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.550 
out in a bit ok so before we wrap up
this<00:03:21.030> unboxing<00:03:21.240> or<00:03:21.900> let's<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:22.320> take<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> look

this unboxing or let's just take a look
at<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.340> one<00:03:23.580> feature<00:03:23.850> which<00:03:24.210> is<00:03:24.510> as<00:03:25.500> famed

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
at this one feature which is as famed

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.160 
videos all over the internet so let's
just<00:03:30.990> try<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.440> flex<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.950> phone<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:33.300> CT

just try and flex the phone and the CT

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.880 
just try and flex the phone and the CT
bounces<00:03:34.530> back<00:03:34.710> up<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.950> lot<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:36.380> in<00:03:37.380> sound<00:03:37.710> to

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
bounces back up a lot but in sound to

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.020 
bounces back up a lot but in sound to
them<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.460> say

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.149
