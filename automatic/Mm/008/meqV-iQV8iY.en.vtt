00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
because you know I could I could really

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.420 
because you know I could I could really
get<00:03:22.640> better<00:03:23.330> ones<00:03:23.690> now<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.050> I'm<00:03:24.410> much<00:03:25.040> more

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
I'm better at breeding now than I used

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.460 
I'm better at breeding now than I used
to<00:03:28.160> be<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.820> know<00:03:28.910> I<00:03:28.940> go<00:03:29.239> for<00:03:29.420> IVs<00:03:29.900> now<00:03:30.170> and

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
to be I you know I go for IVs now and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.310 
to be I you know I go for IVs now and
not<00:03:30.620> just<00:03:30.890> nature's<00:03:31.370> that's<00:03:31.700> what<00:03:31.880> I<00:03:32.290> before<00:03:33.290> I

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
not just nature's that's what I before I

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.320 
not just nature's that's what I before I
used<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.830> only<00:03:34.100> breed<00:03:34.340> for<00:03:34.550> nature's<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:35.000> had<00:03:35.180> no

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
used to only breed for nature's I had no

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.210 
used to only breed for nature's I had no
idea<00:03:35.480> how<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.870> get<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.170> correct<00:03:36.440> IVs<00:03:37.040> or

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
idea how to get the correct IVs or

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.880 
idea how to get the correct IVs or
anything<00:03:37.430> like<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.150> I'll<00:03:39.140> bet<00:03:39.320> that<00:03:39.380> if<00:03:39.739> I

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
anything like that so I'll bet that if I

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.240 
anything like that so I'll bet that if I
go<00:03:40.130> for<00:03:40.519> IVs<00:03:41.510> then<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.500> Polly<00:03:42.709> toads<00:03:42.980> will

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
go for IVs then the Polly toads will

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.890 
go for IVs then the Polly toads will
become<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.760> truly<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.239> force<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.780> be<00:03:44.810> reckoned

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
become a truly a force to be reckoned

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.820 
become a truly a force to be reckoned
with<00:03:45.350> but<00:03:46.220> anyway<00:03:46.580> um<00:03:46.850> I<00:03:47.300> was<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.050> I<00:03:48.350> go<00:03:48.590> for<00:03:48.800> a

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
with but anyway um I was a I go for a

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.039 
with but anyway um I was a I go for a
hypnosis<00:03:49.190> on<00:03:49.549> Lucario<00:03:50.060> because<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.900> way<00:03:51.019> I

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
hypnosis on Lucario because the way I

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.410 
hypnosis on Lucario because the way I
see<00:03:51.230> it<00:03:51.590> Typhlosion<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.760> about<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.060> be<00:03:53.180> dead

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
see it Typhlosion is about to be dead

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.960 
see it Typhlosion is about to be dead
anyway<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.530> doesn't<00:03:54.799> really<00:03:54.920> matter<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.790> my

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.930 
but uh it goes from shadow claw doesn't
it<00:05:46.780> does<00:05:46.960> I<00:05:47.170> think<00:05:47.200> decent<00:05:48.100> damage<00:05:48.310> but<00:05:48.790> it

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
it does I think decent damage but it

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.160 
it does I think decent damage but it
doesn't<00:05:49.210> really<00:05:49.330> do<00:05:49.480> enough<00:05:49.780> to<00:05:49.810> really

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
doesn't really do enough to really

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.200 
doesn't really do enough to really
amount<00:05:50.590> to<00:05:50.680> anything<00:05:50.950> and<00:05:51.520> anyway<00:05:51.850> I<00:05:51.880> go<00:05:52.000> for<00:05:52.180> a

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
amount to anything and anyway I go for a

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.720 
amount to anything and anyway I go for a
focus<00:05:52.720> blast<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.620> you<00:05:54.130> know<00:05:54.250> with<00:05:54.370> my<00:05:54.490> wide

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
focus blast and you know with my wide

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.600 
focus blast and you know with my wide
lens<00:05:55.030> it<00:05:55.330> hits<00:05:55.570> and<00:05:56.070> then<00:05:57.070> I<00:05:57.100> knock<00:05:57.490> out

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
lens it hits and then I knock out

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.140 
lens it hits and then I knock out
Weavile

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
Weavile

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.970 
Weavile
and<00:05:58.300> then<00:05:58.960> he<00:05:59.140> goes<00:05:59.260> for<00:05:59.470> another<00:05:59.500> close

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
and then he goes for another close

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.150 
and then he goes for another close
combat<00:06:00.280> with<00:06:00.520> Lucario<00:06:01.180> and<00:06:01.750> I<00:06:02.530> think<00:06:02.950> does<00:06:03.070> he

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
combat with Lucario and I think does he

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.300 
combat with Lucario and I think does he
knock<00:06:03.340> this<00:06:03.490> one<00:06:03.670> out<00:06:03.850> yes<00:06:04.390> he<00:06:04.540> does<00:06:04.660> okay

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
knock this one out yes he does okay

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.410 
knock this one out yes he does okay
that's<00:06:06.310> probably<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:06.760> other<00:06:06.880> reason<00:06:07.300> why

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
that's probably the other reason why

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.090 
that's probably the other reason why

that surf did so well is because he had

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.950
