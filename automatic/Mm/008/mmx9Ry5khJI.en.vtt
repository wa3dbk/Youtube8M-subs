00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
there and not only that but it actually

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.600 
there and not only that but it actually
has<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.110> little<00:04:52.349> bit<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.680> low<00:04:52.889> profile<00:04:53.400> as<00:04:53.580> a

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.430 
has a little bit of a low profile as a
result<00:04:54.060> because<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.360> pulls<00:04:54.720> so<00:04:54.930> much<00:04:55.110> space

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
result because it pulls so much space

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.490 
result because it pulls so much space
right<00:04:56.340> in<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.610> toe<00:04:56.789> box<00:04:56.870> right<00:04:57.870> through<00:04:58.110> here

right in the toe box right through here

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.709 
right in the toe box right through here
because<00:04:59.250> it's<00:04:59.430> so<00:04:59.610> wide<00:04:59.849> here<00:05:00.389> they<00:05:00.569> can

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
because it's so wide here they can

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.480 
because it's so wide here they can
actually<00:05:00.750> compensate<00:05:01.409> and<00:05:01.830> still<00:05:02.039> adjust<00:05:02.370> the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
actually compensate and still adjust the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.399 
actually compensate and still adjust the
fit<00:05:02.699> and<00:05:02.849> make<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.150> right<00:05:03.330> even<00:05:03.930> though<00:05:04.199> it<00:05:04.289> has

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
fit and make it right even though it has

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.339 
fit and make it right even though it has
a<00:05:04.440> lower<00:05:04.680> profile<00:05:05.190> from<00:05:05.400> tongue<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:05.789> tell<00:05:06.349> so

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
a lower profile from tongue to tell so
