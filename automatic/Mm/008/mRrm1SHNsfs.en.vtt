00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.940
G'day everyone.
Daniel O'Grady here and welcome to another

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.520
Wasabicars video.
Thank you so much for joining me because this

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.610
is perhaps my proudest moment; to present
to you this car, an Isuzu Statesman DeVille.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.780
I thought until 2 or 3 weeks ago, or a month
ago, or whenever I saw it, that I would never

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.030
see this car.
Seriously, this car is the unicorm of all

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.030
unicorns.
This is a country that crushes their cars

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.030
after 10 to 15 years, the rust is severe.
How could it have survived to this day?

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.030
It is a miracle.
I saw it about a month or two ago. I had seen

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.480
a picture of it on a blog, it was a bad picture.
I tried to get more information, and the guy

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.450
deleted the blog post.
And, that was it. The... what do you call

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.749
it?
The lead went cold... The trail went cold.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:53.469
That's it!
Anyway, I persevered and I kept asking people.

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.890
It was a friend of a friend at a car show
who lives down where it was, and he confirmed

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.150
that this car truly did exist, and I was over
the bloody moon.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.290
The following week I was down there, overnight
trip there and back.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.150
Hundreds and hundreds of kilometres, and lots
of can coffee, but it was worth it.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.670
It was just amazing.
Guys, I love Holdens. I LOVE HOLDENS, I love

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.920
old Holdens.
I don't really care much for newer Holdens.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.980
Sorry.
The fact that the company is going to stop

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.050
producing cars doesn't really break my heart
at all.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.180
All of the cars that I loved have already
been built.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.180
Basically the cars from the 60's and 70's,
and that's what this car is.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.170
Back when I was in high school I was mad for
HQ Holdens.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.670
Always have been, always will be.
That is the car for me.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.700
That is the car I want in my driveway, a HQ
Holden.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.270
And, that there is one in Japan, on the island
that I live on

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:01.939
... just... fills me with joy and hapiness
and contentment and relief and everything

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.850
else.
I'm just stoked about this. Oh my god, my

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.860
mind is blown.
Looking at the car you'll of course notice

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.010
a few different things about it.
It's got the fender-mounted side mirrors.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.129
It has little marker lights below the Stateman
DeVille badges on the front fender.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.430
It also has an Isuzu by GMH badge on the boot
lid there.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.560
And, I'm not really sure.... see those reversing
lights down there?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.290
Are they on the HQ Holdens in Australia, and/or
New Zealand, and/or South Africa, and/or Southeast

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.709
Asia?
I don't really know how far the HQ spread

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.840
around the world.
Certainly it never saw North America, and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.810
I doubt any made it to Europe.
I'm sure there are variations around the place,

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.909
but this one indeed has those lights, those
badges.

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:58.120
Also, the Isuzu Statesman DeVille has some
pretty hardcore cloth interior.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.040
Check it out.
Look at the pattern on those seats.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.239
That is just amazing.
It sort of looks teal, or it could be the

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.810
tint on the window.
Actually, I know for a fact that the interior

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.330
was called Ash.
I know that because I have the brochure of

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.190
the car right here.
Isuzu Statesman DeVille by GMH.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.160
Yeah, it's still in plastic.
I did have a look at it.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.490
There's a fella, what's his name?
He's a golfer.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.840
Tiger Woods.
Nah, that's not him.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.300
Jack Nicklaus? Jack Nicholson?
Ho. Jack Nicklaus!

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.370
Jack Nicholson's the actor.
That's right.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.480
Anyway, back in the day Jack Nicklaus was
advertising these Holden Statesmans in Japan.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.349
Well, Isuzu Statesmans. Sorry.
There he is, looking all happy and sophisticated.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:53.170
No doubt, Japan being the golf-mad country,
snapped these cars right up.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.080
Not true!
Actually, They only bought a couple of hundred

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.709
of them.
240... the number escapes me at the second,

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.870
but anyway not many of these cars were ever
brought over.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.760
Wow, that is blowing my mind even now. Even
weeks and weeks after seeing it.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.079
Unreal.
Agh, I wish I got to see under the bonnet.

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:22.019
It of course has the 308 cu V8 engine produced
by Holden, which made its debut in '69 with

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.110
the HT Monaro (the HT range.)
Wow. I'm just so pumped and excited about

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.740
it.
Question of the day is, what would make you

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.000
as happy and excited as I feel right now.
Let me know in the comments below.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I would love to read that, and I will of course
read them.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.090
So, do that.
Also, grab a WasabiCars sticker because now

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.750
they are even more awesome that I've seen
a HQ Statesman DeVille in Japan.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.580
Man! I'm just over the moon, guys.
That you so much everyone.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.820
Grab a sticker, leave a comment, and see you
on Facebook, or Google+, or Instagram, or

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.330
not Twitter so much.
I check it very, very rarely.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:10.380
I'm gonna pull the pin.
Take it easy. Goodbye.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:25.280
G'day, g'day, g'day, g'day, g'day.
... adjust my balls...

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.719
G'day, g'day, g'day, g'day...
