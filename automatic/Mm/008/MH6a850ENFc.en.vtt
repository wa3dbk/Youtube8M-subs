downgrade from last year's model but how

downgrade from last year's model but how
does<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.100> compare<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> galaxy<00:00:42.180> s6<00:00:42.719> well<00:00:43.230> in

does it compare to the galaxy s6 well in

does it compare to the galaxy s6 well in
this<00:00:43.469> video<00:00:43.739> we're<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.399> take<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> look<00:00:44.730> at

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
this video we're going to take a look at

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
this video we're going to take a look at
five<00:00:45.120> reasons<00:00:45.420> why<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> galaxy<00:00:46.440> s6<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.070> better

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
five reasons why the galaxy s6 is better

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:57.030 
five reasons why the galaxy s6 is better
than<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.789> HTC<00:00:48.420> One<00:00:48.660> m9

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.560 

so<00:00:58.040> I<00:00:58.100> mentioned<00:00:58.550> battery<00:00:58.880> life<00:00:59.059> performance

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
so I mentioned battery life performance

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.750 
so I mentioned battery life performance
in<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.020> beginning<00:01:00.470> well<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:01.040> m9<00:01:01.340> actually

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
in the beginning well the m9 actually

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.970 
in the beginning well the m9 actually
reduce<00:01:02.180> battery<00:01:02.449> life<00:01:02.720> compared<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.530> m8

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
reduce battery life compared to the m8

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.430 
reduce battery life compared to the m8
for<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:04.820> typical<00:01:05.210> use<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.659> m8<00:01:05.960> lasts<00:01:06.200> on

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
for a typical use the m8 lasts on

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.719 
for a typical use the m8 lasts on
average<00:01:06.470> seven<00:01:06.950> hours<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.460> 12<00:01:07.670> minutes

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
average seven hours and 12 minutes

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.210 
average seven hours and 12 minutes
whereas<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.330> m9<00:01:08.720> only<00:01:09.140> lasts<00:01:09.380> six<00:01:09.740> hours<00:01:09.920> and

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
whereas the m9 only lasts six hours and

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.940 
whereas the m9 only lasts six hours and

typical real life usage and even though
the<00:01:16.940> galaxy<00:01:17.330> s6<00:01:17.660> has<00:01:17.810> larger<00:01:18.380> screen

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
the galaxy s6 has larger screen

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.890 
the galaxy s6 has larger screen
resolution<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.430> a<00:01:19.580> smaller<00:01:19.970> battery<00:01:20.390> it's

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
resolution and a smaller battery it's

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.200 
resolution and a smaller battery it's
still<00:01:21.170> last<00:01:21.350> longer<00:01:21.830> than<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.130> m9<00:01:22.520> with<00:01:23.090> an

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
still last longer than the m9 with an

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.090 
still last longer than the m9 with an
average<00:01:23.330> use<00:01:23.659> of<00:01:23.840> seven<00:01:24.170> hours<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.650> 14

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.620 
average use of seven hours and 14
minutes<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.030> first<00:01:26.210> reason<00:01:26.360> why<00:01:26.570> the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
minutes so the first reason why the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.990 
minutes so the first reason why the
galaxy<00:01:27.229> s6<00:01:27.619> is<00:01:27.830> better<00:01:28.070> than<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.369> m9<00:01:28.759> is

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
galaxy s6 is better than the m9 is

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.580 
galaxy s6 is better than the m9 is
simply<00:01:29.300> because<00:01:29.660> of<00:01:29.690> its<00:01:29.960> battery<00:01:30.380> life

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
simply because of its battery life

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.590 
simply because of its battery life
performance<00:01:31.009> reason<00:01:31.970> number<00:01:32.060> two<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.450> the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
performance reason number two is the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.600 
performance reason number two is the

tests the only test that the m9 was
faster<00:01:46.880> on<00:01:47.030> was<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.479> google<00:01:47.810> voice<00:01:47.990> test<00:01:48.320> and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
faster on was the google voice test and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.440 
faster on was the google voice test and
even<00:01:49.039> then<00:01:49.190> it<00:01:49.340> was<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:49.729> few<00:01:50.090> milliseconds

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
even then it was like a few milliseconds

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.960 
even then it was like a few milliseconds
so<00:01:51.380> if<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.530> want<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.740> much<00:01:51.920> faster<00:01:52.160> crispy

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
so if you want a much faster crispy

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.580 
so if you want a much faster crispy
phone<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.479> you're<00:01:53.570> deciding<00:01:53.840> between<00:01:54.110> both

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
phone and you're deciding between both

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.770 
phone and you're deciding between both
of<00:01:54.770> these<00:01:54.920> then<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.580> galaxy<00:01:56.000> s6<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.570> your

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
of these then the galaxy s6 is your

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.870 
of these then the galaxy s6 is your
obvious<00:01:57.200> choice<00:01:57.470> next<00:01:58.280> reason<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.759> the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
obvious choice next reason is the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.669 
obvious choice next reason is the
resolution<00:01:59.630> now<00:01:59.899> I'm<00:02:00.080> not<00:02:00.110> going<00:02:00.349> to<00:02:00.410> say<00:02:00.560> it's

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
resolution now I'm not going to say it's

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.260 
resolution now I'm not going to say it's
better<00:02:00.830> because<00:02:01.160> it<00:02:01.550> has<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.700> bigger<00:02:02.119> screen

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
better because it has a bigger screen

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.180 
better because it has a bigger screen
because<00:02:03.050> that<00:02:03.200> becomes<00:02:03.289> a<00:02:03.679> personal

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
because that becomes a personal

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.100 
because that becomes a personal
preference<00:02:04.459> instead<00:02:05.390> I'm<00:02:05.479> going<00:02:05.569> to<00:02:05.660> say<00:02:05.869> that

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
preference instead I'm going to say that

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.109 
preference instead I'm going to say that
it's<00:02:06.289> better<00:02:06.470> because<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:07.130> has<00:02:07.310> more<00:02:07.340> pixels

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
it's better because it has more pixels

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.449 
it's better because it has more pixels
the<00:02:08.599> m9<00:02:08.869> stuck<00:02:09.110> with<00:02:09.259> their<00:02:09.410> 1080p<00:02:10.039> display

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
the m9 stuck with their 1080p display

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.449 
the m9 stuck with their 1080p display

sharper<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.680> give<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.040> even<00:02:16.819> though<00:02:16.910> it's<00:02:17.060> not

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
reason is because of its camera no doubt

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.940 
reason is because of its camera no doubt
the<00:02:43.940> galaxy<00:02:44.360> s6<00:02:44.720> has<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:45.020> much<00:02:45.319> better<00:02:45.560> camera

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
the galaxy s6 has a much better camera

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.160 
the galaxy s6 has a much better camera
than<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.220> m9<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.879> fact<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.569> has<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.959> best

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170
