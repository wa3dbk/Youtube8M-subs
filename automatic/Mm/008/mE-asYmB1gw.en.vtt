00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
really really and yeah so I guess I can

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.490 
really really and yeah so I guess I can
control<00:04:55.910> it<00:04:56.090> at<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.300> same<00:04:56.480> time<00:04:56.690> but<00:04:56.990> I<00:04:57.020> let<00:04:57.470> it

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
control it at the same time but I let it

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.070 
control it at the same time but I let it
get<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.250> best<00:04:58.430> of<00:04:58.580> me<00:04:58.640> sometimes<00:04:58.810> due<00:04:59.810> to<00:04:59.960> the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
get the best of me sometimes due to the

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.810 
get the best of me sometimes due to the
fact<00:05:00.230> that<00:05:00.410> it's<00:05:00.650> just<00:05:00.740> easier<00:05:01.130> that<00:05:01.190> way<00:05:01.370> it's

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
fact that it's just easier that way it's

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.280 
fact that it's just easier that way it's
just<00:05:02.000> easier<00:05:02.270> if<00:05:02.330> I<00:05:02.420> break<00:05:02.600> a<00:05:02.660> couple<00:05:02.900> things

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
just easier if I break a couple things

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.620 
just easier if I break a couple things
including<00:05:03.830> maybe<00:05:04.010> a<00:05:04.100> couple<00:05:04.310> faces<00:05:04.880> that's

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
including maybe a couple faces that's

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.630 
including maybe a couple faces that's
fine<00:05:05.900> and<00:05:06.110> dandy<00:05:06.230> to<00:05:06.500> me<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.070> and<00:05:07.370> that's

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
fine and dandy to me and and and that's

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.300 
fine and dandy to me and and and that's
not<00:05:07.880> what<00:05:08.000> I<00:05:08.030> really<00:05:08.300> want<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.510> be<00:05:08.660> but<00:05:09.500> it

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.800 
not what I really want to be but it
doesn't<00:05:10.700> concern<00:05:10.970> me<00:05:11.030> enough<00:05:11.390> for<00:05:11.600> me<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.780> want

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
doesn't concern me enough for me to want

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.270 
doesn't concern me enough for me to want
to<00:05:12.020> change<00:05:12.230> it<00:05:12.380> because<00:05:12.530> that's<00:05:12.980> who<00:05:13.130> I<00:05:13.190> am
