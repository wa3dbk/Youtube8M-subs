on it has the most perfect balance of

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.850 
on it has the most perfect balance of
absorbing<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.480> soaking<00:03:20.840> in<00:03:21.019> and<00:03:21.320> yet<00:03:21.620> there's

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
absorbing and soaking in and yet there's

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.550 
absorbing and soaking in and yet there's
still<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.160> layer<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:23.390> continues<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.140> stay<00:03:24.350> on

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
still a layer that continues to stay on

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.890 
still a layer that continues to stay on
top<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.980> skin<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.280> hydrate<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.810> I

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
cream is some of it needs to be absorbed

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.170 
cream is some of it needs to be absorbed
clearly<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.100> it<00:03:34.160> can<00:03:34.250> hydrate<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:34.790> get<00:03:34.970> and

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
clearly so it can hydrate and get and

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.430 
clearly so it can hydrate and get and
get<00:03:35.269> in<00:03:35.330> there<00:03:35.510> but<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.750> other<00:03:35.870> part<00:03:36.110> of<00:03:36.140> it

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
get in there but the other part of it

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.720 
get in there but the other part of it
it<00:03:36.680> needs<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:36.920> stay<00:03:37.100> on<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.310> surface<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.640> little

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
it needs to stay on the surface a little

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.150 
it needs to stay on the surface a little
bit<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.239> that<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.900> hydration<00:03:39.110> continues<00:03:39.890> and

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
bit so that the hydration continues and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.910 
bit so that the hydration continues and
