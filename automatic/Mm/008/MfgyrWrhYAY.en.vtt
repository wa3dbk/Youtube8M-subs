00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.910
 to make the fondas we need sponges sun clouds and is for example 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.159
 let iva have white and pink separately 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.919
 also and very well because for example the one of mercadona you also have to 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.829
 tajonar estero the cometa united by that cut that it with the scissors with which 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.960
 lose a little more time 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.310
 icing sugar of the brand for example sugar mills 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.760
 this brand clesa that also suits us very well 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.880
 let's now stop the ingredients 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.060
 the first will be the sponges 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.110
 in this case I have the separate races of white smart active as I have 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.290
 Said before 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.290
 you have to look at very well this year 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.060
 what we have in nuns will be twice as much sugar 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.110
 If I put on the farm little grass I have to put 400 grams of sugar 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.620
 glas 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.560
 let's think now sugar 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.060
 that normally 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.590
 sift 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.730
 At the time of this stellar look with the zonda we are going to deposit it so that it does not 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.730
 get buffon gives a lot more clever 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.200
 then 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.460
 What I'm going to do is put a little bit of water on the little ones 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 mosques 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.939
 because now we are going to activate it in the microwave for a few seconds for example 30 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.200
 seconds 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.240
 to make them soft 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.120
 the next make a volcano 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.850
 so his face that the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.350
 I put there the chosen one, besides the requinto, it's like 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.340
 if you operate a little percent on the set as in this case well 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.610
 withdrawing with a little icing sugar trying not to touch them because 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.610
 tsonga highly sticky 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.450
 now with patience and without touching it much 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
 damon mixing a little 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.279
 with patience as a building 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:23.129
 trying to make the adjective gypsy orb all the glass sugar that is very 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.969
 heavy 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.799
 until he does not fear although the beyond will not be full hands 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.349
 let's be a little bit of what it lacks 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.629
 a little bit still 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.699
 both weapons and we throw sugar because if necessary 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.499
 we almost have lezama 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:49.549
 we already have our most thoroughly pink we can tape 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.519
 Now I'm going to teach how to extend the fontÃ¡n without it being noticed 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.529
 pick up knee milk 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:01.139
 as you see 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.379
 we are giving him 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.059
 the return and it has kept a little sugar on each side 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.189
 is the best way to prevent them from staying 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:17.219
 and here we have our made sheet to make use of it 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.799
 camps
