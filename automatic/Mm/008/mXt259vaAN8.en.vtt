 paper flower and you will need 10 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:11.080
 pieces of such a paper circle 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.540

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.430
 such a circle it and increase half 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.840
 centimeter and that's such a small circle 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.810
 with a diameter of 2 centimeters from these circles we 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.090
 we will make petals of it we will 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.280
 do the foundation and this will serve 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.160
 cores beyond that you'll need 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.309
 glue i will use this one 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.589

 do petal need to put paper 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.949
 circumference with a diameter of 7 coolant on 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.769
 table 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.760
 then we add this circle by 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:01.209
 two diameters 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:06.509
 first so and then not opening 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:06.509
 the circle is put on the other center 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.120
 then open the circle here in Odessa 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.080
 these are clearly visible 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.880
 diameters and so center i will now 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.880
 make two arcs 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:45.450
 and now turn the circle and here 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:49.009
 we add these arc margins by reverse 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.009
 side of the same diameter 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.780
 with the remaining circles with a diameter of 7 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:17.240
 glorify centimeter do exactly the same 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.850
 our petals are ready now we will them 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.560
 glue to the base for this inflict 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.560
 some glue on the base 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.890
 evenly distribute glue 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.750
 don't reach the brim 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:03:01.420
 then take the petals and glue gently to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.420
 base surfaces 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.040
 I stuck the petals left to stick 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.420
 core only 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:57.280
 for this we apply some glue 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:59.180
 center and using your index finger 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.720
 we press the core 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.720
 same way 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:18.550
 remove excess paper flower glue 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.700
