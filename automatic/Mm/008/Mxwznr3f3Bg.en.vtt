00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it was bad because that was probably

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.710 
it was bad because that was probably
what<00:01:19.950> was<00:01:20.070> happening<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.000> sometimes<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.600> did

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
what was happening but sometimes it did

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.539 
what was happening but sometimes it did
work<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> when<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.409> did<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.799> actually<00:01:23.369> worked

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
work and when it did it actually worked

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.670 
work and when it did it actually worked

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
the card one down part of that though is

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.249 
the card one down part of that though is

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
same button you take a picture with and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.859 
same button you take a picture with and
it<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.060> start<00:02:09.270> recording<00:02:09.599> your<00:02:09.660> video

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.119 
it will start recording your video
that's<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.170> something<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.709> didn't<00:02:11.099> like

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
that's just something I didn't like

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.460 
that's just something I didn't like
about<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.459> wish<00:02:11.610> there's<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.910> dead

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
about I wish there's a dead

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.140 
about I wish there's a dead
video<00:02:12.890> button<00:02:13.160> on<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.640> will<00:02:13.820> say<00:02:14.000> though

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
video button on it I will say though

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
video button on it I will say though
it's<00:02:14.240> kind<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.480> weird<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.720> use<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> camera

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
it's kind of weird to use the camera

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.810 
it's kind of weird to use the camera
without<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.440> viewfinder<00:02:15.830> or<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.310> screen<00:02:16.550> on<00:02:16.670> so

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
without a viewfinder or a screen on so

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.650 
without a viewfinder or a screen on so
you<00:02:16.910> can<00:02:17.030> actually<00:02:17.060> see<00:02:17.390> what<00:02:17.570> you're

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
you can actually see what you're

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.330 
you can actually see what you're
recording<00:02:17.930> unless<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.680> course<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:18.950> do<00:02:19.070> use<00:02:19.250> it

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
recording unless of course you do use it

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.100 
recording unless of course you do use it
with<00:02:19.430> your<00:02:19.550> smartphone<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.540> then<00:02:20.660> also<00:02:20.840> it's

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
with your smartphone and then also it's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.110 
with your smartphone and then also it's
round<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.130> normal<00:02:22.460> camera<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.970> have

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
round to so a normal camera you have

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.910 
round to so a normal camera you have
like<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.600> line<00:02:24.020> where<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.350> can<00:02:24.500> tell<00:02:24.710> if<00:02:24.740> it's

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
like a line where you can tell if it's

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.620 
like a line where you can tell if it's
crooked<00:02:25.100> or<00:02:25.340> not<00:02:25.460> but<00:02:25.820> this<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.120> round<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:26.510> you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
crooked or not but this is round so you

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.760 
crooked or not but this is round so you
can't<00:02:27.020> really<00:02:27.230> tell<00:02:27.410> which<00:02:27.500> way<00:02:27.650> you're

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
can't really tell which way you're

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.560 
can't really tell which way you're
holding<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.550> just<00:02:28.700> have<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:29.000> like<00:02:29.270> really

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
holding it you just have to like really

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.760 
holding it you just have to like really
pay<00:02:29.690> attention<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.230> make<00:02:30.470> sure<00:02:30.620> you're

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
pay attention and make sure you're

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.290 
pay attention and make sure you're
holding<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.130> straight<00:02:31.310> but<00:02:31.730> again<00:02:32.000> what<00:02:32.150> made

camera<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.320> packs<00:02:36.590> really<00:02:37.040> really<00:02:37.430> good

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
camera that packs really really good

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.980 
camera that packs really really good
quality<00:02:37.730> I'm<00:02:38.210> really<00:02:38.420> excited<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.780> see<00:02:38.870> what

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
quality I'm really excited to see what

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.090

these<00:02:39.080> type<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.380> cameras<00:02:39.620> are<00:02:39.680> gonna<00:02:39.740> be<00:02:39.950> like

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
these type of cameras are gonna be like

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.740 
these type of cameras are gonna be like
in<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.310> future<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:41.030> as<00:02:41.240> of<00:02:41.390> right<00:02:41.510> now<00:02:41.720> I

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
in the future just as of right now I

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.940 
in the future just as of right now I
don't<00:02:41.960> think<00:02:42.080> it's<00:02:42.260> fast<00:02:42.470> enough<00:02:42.680> for<00:02:42.800> me

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950

don't think it's fast enough for me
again<00:02:43.550> maybe<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:43.970> good<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.180> see<00:02:44.360> es
