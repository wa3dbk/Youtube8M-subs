 Percent here was created by hand quote 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.769
 he lacks what i've personally never heard and what i would have in 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.949
 Basically not going to find years and although the suits said a lot 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.220
 Good luck and she said yes I was not lucky I have a lot 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.730
 worked 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.869
 one is often lucky to be able to work that one must not forget there 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.210
 I am then ridiculous as a quote and above all we German 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.330
 against being too busy and so disciplined 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.050
 the winner of the camera here in this series percent as extra price is Jan 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.960
 Kruger but the prosecutors work a lot but they do not play the role 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.730
 Duty percent percent 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.100
 Malley really hard-working German actor 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.720
 the on is a great woman with ease speaking beauty talent 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.460
 I have known her since she was 15 and in Paris we are neighbors my photo studio 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.810
 means is probably the linden trees framed 7 and her apartment is number 11 and 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.670
 sometimes in view 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.189
 and sometimes in the middle of the night bombers are suddenly in the other game 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.479
 from the work explained on their calculator Stetler one makes if only over 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.220
 Fun only shots because in summer we sit on the street from the studio 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800
 and it's like being in a village 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.950
 or the first time that I saw then what a photo of l there I was 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.760
 not the photographer so I called standing next to a big chair often in this 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.610
 Little girls did not mean older ages and there she was 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.810
 50 became 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.200
 sat with 7 8 at the media giant planning and why but you only saw the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.080
 in the way something had percent what some did not have a fresh percent 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.090
 a 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.969
 News show she was not a node CYP 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.809
 the girls around them when these portals forget what no one of them 

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:51.290
 World is 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.400
 but Andy has made a wonderful career 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.680
 she also has something different as an actress she has one 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.380
 I rarely speak languages 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.420
 "Saw my life 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.930
 may also be good german english french but i have 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.200
 strangely enough to speak to both speeches 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.859
 the one in France 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:12.149
 Everyone in France considers them each a Frenchwoman 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:17.159
 Thank god, they do not exist as eleven percent typical German blonde like 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.469
 Henny Porten or Denmark and so they will not act Sundern them 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:25.090
 he really belongs to it and 11 her English also wonderful and 12 me 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:27.649
 I have to admire that 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.839
 For example, I do not do that in Germany every year 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.129
 Roberto Schlange says that the best thing about Germany has been 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.889
 The beginning was spokeswoman for the first time and that was a completely different case 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.319
 also a much tragic case i hope that percent like Jan's career 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.199
 not a tragic end will take because I imagine that is on for 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.919
 Flights were 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.169
 and that 's why I'm glad that she could give herself the golden camera 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.219
 was a great idea by HÃ¶rzu to remember the ones I love and percent 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:54.790
 admiration
