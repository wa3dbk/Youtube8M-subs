00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.160 

well<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.160> mission<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:11.150> obvious<00:02:11.510> this

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
well this mission it's obvious this

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.990 
well this mission it's obvious this
mission<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:12.770> have<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.100> try<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.340> escape

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
maybe you can lease to it so that's the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:48.390 
maybe you can lease to it so that's the
move

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.870 

so<00:02:49.400> look<00:02:49.610> back
