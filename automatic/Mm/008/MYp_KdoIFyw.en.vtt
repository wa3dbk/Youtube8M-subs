00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 hello today we are preparing 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.870
 hare in a slow cooker or when 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.870
 we are under pressure 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.500
 the most delicious part of the hare 1 onion 1 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.529
 big carrot 400 grams sour cream 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.560
 sunflower oil for roasting flour salt 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:33.220
 bay leaf and pepper here are a mixture of 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.460
 different peppers and now what do we need 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:43.210
 is grate the carrot on the grater 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:47.950
 eggs from the start of a carrot that's such a bunch 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.950
 It turned out with us just right and next 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.430
 we will cut the onion finely and 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:01:01.350
 so starting to cut onions we cut it 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.350
 in half and make further cuts 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 so we cut the onion and now go 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.010
 now we take pieces of meat and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.010
 we roll them down in dough 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.780
 but sprinkle them with salt rubbing 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.780
 turn over 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.230
 repeat the same with the following 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.230
 release rubbed with salt 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.960
 we forget the whole thing to pose 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.760
 it is important to roll the hare well here 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.069
 most of the meat pieces back back 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.069
 hips 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.750
 In my opinion this is one of the most delicious. 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.440
 parts hare 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.510
 there is no more large amount of meat in 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.700
 difference let's say hare series which 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.860
 enough specific preparations and 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.750
 have a smack because there on 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.000
 small amount of meat is enough 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.890
 a large number of bones are obtained and 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.420
 they require completely different seasonings 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.150
 or other preparation but about this you 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.590
 make another video and now we 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.460
 we cook such local ones 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.460
 pieces of hare 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.660
 so almost everything is ready and envy 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.500
 almost the entire raid about Salina 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.860
 pepper and we already come to the next 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.860
 stage 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.820
 just a little bit left 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:37.580
 then when the hare and put in a slow cooker 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:39.350
 you can add a little more pepper and so 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.850
 now we fry onion until golden 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.740
 colors after that we fry the carrot 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.110
 put it out for 5 minutes and maybe 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.770
 add carrots to onions and fry 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.650
 all instead 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:57.140
 and here we are to fire to any stile . 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.650
 now go to the bunny roasting on 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.650
 skillet 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.110
 so you can turn 15 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:27.690
 this is what we do at Putinâ€™s birth 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.690
 got such a nice color 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:34.799
 continue to fry . the other side 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:49.750
 Now we lay everything out by the way 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.400
 If you do not have the same Multivarki 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.370
 the most can be done in the ordinary 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.690
 pan 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.080
 now we just put it all in 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.840
 the cup is undoubtedly the slow cooker 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:07.180
 put this tasty delicious piece 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:13.020
 bunny and behind him another such they already 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:17.250
 I want to eat them and add a layer again 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.250
 carrots and onions 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.030
 now put another piece of bunny 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.970
 followed by another one yes fry on 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.009
 skillet them short enough in 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.530
 around 5 minutes until crispy 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:06:15.680
 crust and now lay out on top 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:06:20.139
 Picchu sour cream on all the top add 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.139
 salt 1 tsp 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:33.760

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:37.820

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.460
 also add some water and here we are 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.460
 put in a slow cooker now we have it 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.990
 turn on for an hour twenty if you will 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.900
 cook in a regular saucepan then 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.710
 cooking will take one and a half two hours 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.660
 about 10 minutes before readiness 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.080
 it will be necessary a bay leaf 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:59.620
 add and actually say everything and so 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.620
 close and turn on the slow cooker 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.990
