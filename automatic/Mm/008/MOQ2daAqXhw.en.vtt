00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.420
 Though it is Pendora animation of this week 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:15.560
 I would like to introduce Chikita 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.620
 I usually noticed that I did not use the back eye 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.360
 We will introduce a little bit of things that are easy to do if you pay attention to these points 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.470
 I think 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:28.100
 If it is area, animation is quite common so I can not touch there 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.250
 I would like to introduce three attached to the point 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:35.550
 It is a grip but first I'm the first one 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.420
 This is how you grip yourself 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.220
 Instead of putting 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:49.860
 Remove such Fu in a little is better to or supported by the Sambo or supported by Japan 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:53.450
 I think that it is easy to put in power, so put a force and do not lose the swing of the opponent 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.150
 Mind we arrived at the place that he able to produce 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.420
 Next is the second one 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.100
 Oh yeah 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.090
 After all 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.090
 Point the tip of the racket to the platform before entering 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.270
 First, this was not when the racket 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.550
 When the city that does not touch Nde Saab low 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.040
 And still it would enter the Fu say that I thought that it is impossible to hit the ball 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.930
 Because 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.720
 After pointing the center of the racket to the platform 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.960
 I think that I want you to take care that have Rutte 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.900
 Though it is the third one at the end 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.470
 Is that I'll rely on it racket tip is a ball 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:40.300
 Korewama Table Tennis Though Answers I'm doing well, even something 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.960
 It is easy to put the racket around in the center because it rotates 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:49.600
 There is a point that it is easy to put out a strong ball 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:53.040
 By all means I think that it is the Tteyuu Chiquita made power if you stick out for this three 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.040
 Please try a challenge 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.520
 1 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.520
 No 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.890
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.890
 Ah ah ah ah
