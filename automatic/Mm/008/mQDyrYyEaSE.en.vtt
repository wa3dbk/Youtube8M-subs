00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:06.830
 What you talk about is that you are Luis. 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.600
 we are there for another expensive gameplay in 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.820
 full in fact today we are 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.830
 doing the tests there and I'm going 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.020
 show a very funny denominator 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.530
 I find it expensive if I've seen those 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.540
 Gangster cars , good face. 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.750
 My flight trying to fix that business. 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:29.330
 of the wheels lift yours now 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:32.780
 feel at the time the O those appearing 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.989
 Paul, this is still good here. 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.210
 My head is still good I'm with a 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.210
 two face denominator in the country 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:49.160
 dominator 2 it on the front springs 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.360
 dude and that's what it's like to wrap dude 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.800
 You 'll see what's going to happen now. 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.079
 I've done this test before but I think 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.350
 Funny and I think it's worth sharing 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.140
 today in the tests of is the face for who 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.879
 that the staff do not work is expensive and 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:08.829
 I do not think it's hard to do a mold 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.829
 but the psychiatrist looks at the flying face 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.549
 noh chip 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.760
 It's all for the guy to fix that one. 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.360
 bug that the truck will not turn 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.460
 when you are doing a lot of strength and such right 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.050
 now I'll show you now that 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.890
 he is turning around doing a lot of 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.540
 force 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.790
 until it's turning upside down that the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.620
 denominator is too high then you have 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.060
 that finding a middle ground 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.820
 But look at the face, let's try here in the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.610
 climb coal align it here on the rise 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.990
 we see that going to look at that will have the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:54.540
 truck รณ รณ already steep animal crawls 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:08.000
 first accelerates everything that can accelerate 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:08.000
 Oh grandpa's gonna do it. 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:24.930
 look this goes from the height the strength that this 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:26.970
 business is doing, will you look at peace? 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.840
 now start climbing look only at 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:37.410
 distance from the work is expensive to use again 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:45.530
 will vote the original mp the control of 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.530
 clutch accelerated to suffer and culture 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.650
 but the good thing is that he turns even 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.560
 making force so it's a matter of time 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.080
 until I find a denominator in which he 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.310
 give account to push and turn these 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.310
 tense moments 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.569
 But that's it, guys, a video from today. 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.530
 was to show and if this test that 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.829
 I'm doing there on a flight, right? 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.230
 will show you how some expensive 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.140
 can help improve 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:33.159
 driveability on trucks 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:35.170
 Look at this, by the way, do not you 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.720
 This is to prove to you guys that 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.390
 have to sort things out 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.670
 disadvantage of it all here face is looks 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.170
 only the first is the expensive height and another 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:54.030
 It's not every time you 're catching on. 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:59.409
 also then have poor car coefficient 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.900
 Linne back but the guy bright side 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:07.739
 at least it's already turning, there's no 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.739
 some talk Grandpa Gangster 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.420
 O beauty guys that's it then we 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.010
 It's staying here and this was a video. 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:27.600
 Tuesday morning 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.600
 hug everyone around big hug and even the bad ii
