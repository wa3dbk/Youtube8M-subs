00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.299
 hi again what you intend first greet the entire rock of 50 or 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.019
 show that they are the dick were going to be the first ones that are going to depart with the box 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:09.629
 with this video 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.690
 well this time again criticized something that I do not like 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.490
 it's about those characters who get their ass coca cola when they see 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.429
 a shit called him haha ​​weights that were in vogue when the mobile t 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.229
 in particular this one but what a fucking shit is this if even a baby takata more 

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:27.819
 big and pretty and of course more comfortable 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.339
 you have to be stupid to be proud with shit of this caliber 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.570
 look at what high competition suspensions 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.680
 if even the pier of a body of the rural box has better pint 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.820
 but let's not kid ourselves 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.390
 the suspensions are not important the most important thing is that the motorcycle runs 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.739
 that's why it brings good tires that look like rods and excellent brakes 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.950
 drum ceramics 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.130
 there is my farm a lot of glue for you to like this motorcycle crap cag in 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.790
 the whore 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.990
 Kenya is nice neither comfortable nor safe 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.670
 but the worst of all is that this rabble thinks that it is the best motorcycle to trick 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.980
 since they are governed by the law the less they weigh the more they run 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.720
 the more moderate flipaos opted for the air tournament a 20 miku min 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.070
 Send eggs the way to complicate the life that these assholes have 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.990
 since you can see more black than corn and dear action to find 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.280
 this fucking carburetor 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.240
 but of course this charge is the cock and I block his canada as well as it is my cradle and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.060
 it has more performance than a 28 opo 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.920
 his escape par excellence is the race 16 no matter which cylinder you carry 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.590
 the most important thing is that you put that escape 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 because the friend of the cousin of the neighbor of the villain who came from the neighborhood his rose 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.780
 rectified 100 and was the bike that ran the most around 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.260
 I shit on the bitch that hurts not to have given a chuza in all 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.340
 Morros the first time he said such bullshit 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.210
 as for the transmission it is clear that it has to be bad yes 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.969
 since the other brands are for ignorant people who do not understand mechanics 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.270
 not happy with this 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.200
 the most experts in the matter decide to mount a motor of aerocas 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.420
 because of course for the air engine crap there are no pieces as cucumbers as the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.690
 nhm replica 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.079
 the pink salaíto of 80 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.449
 you have to be silly to ride the mim of betim which is twice as expensive and runs 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:15.579
 just like a rose 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.399
 because the most important thing about a cylinder is that it has filed the transfers 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:24.429
 you have to be living varnish for some time to come to think about this but in the end it is 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:26.639
 what's out there loose 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.579
 we follow 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.810
 then how this engine is more handsome than the air 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.090
 we can put everything in competition 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.300
 like the Greek and the 80 crankshaft 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.400
 he removed b range 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.510
 because if it's expensive 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.219
 by cojones has to be good 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.090
 the bad plates and do not think about mounting others because they do not yield 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.839
 half 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:48.419
 Since we already have a much better cylinder than the black tour, we can already assemble a 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:53.279
 21 8 22 of the ortho as much and with tiny chewing gums to suck us 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:54.079
 much 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.540
 without forgetting the bad filter and 13 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.599
 some claim that the motorcycle earned horses 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.120
 we can not pour any oil any more like the carrefour 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.379
 so the best thing is that we buy a ts hole that is one of the best 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.799
 and they come back very well 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.010
 as I said earlier the escape that best goes to our preparation is 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.099
 the race 16 since if you put any other the bike was not the same and not 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.339
 will have strength 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.969
 to put the icing on the cake the best thing we can do is lighten the 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.760
 ignited serially with a cute 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.640
 what they say that unbalances the crankshaft is a lie even if you have 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.850
 that the best thing that you can put is the bad rotor and as with the rotor the 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.860
 motorbike gains a lot of strength because you put some developments that do not know what 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.729
 brand 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.869
 bad and of course 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.400
 well we already have a small considerable 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.999
 that according to him account of bike that took without regular 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.779
 take me 150 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:49.529
 As I carry more pasta I will invest that a motorcycle is worth it and I am a 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:53.609
 little asshole then I'll throw more money still impose this is shabby 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.149
 first remove the spotlights and fiber from the hollow 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.059
 that others will not see me 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.909
 And what else gives 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.260
 while I see, it's enough because I'm so smart and like so many cocks that 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.749
 I'm never going to take a car ahead and that I get on the highway 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.749
 to demonstrate my low IQ 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:16.189
 Having said that, we will keep tuning the bike so that it is as close as possible 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:20.620
 so we went down to the Chinese on the corner and bought some swords from 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.210
 brown colors such as yellow and orange phosphorite 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.960
 if we want to make it replicate to leisure the black that is the host and will remain speck 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.969
 kotova apa 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.159
 once painted 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.440
 it's time to cover all the shrimp 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.479
 that come out when the paint cracks 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.050
 with the stickers that came with the pieces 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.889
 that is to say 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.740
 we will fill the whole bike with stickers of bad if any other like that of engines 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.300
 cosworth 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.740
 repsol letter x but race yasuní 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.660
 without forgetting the marijuana leaf for the front and the typical tribal you 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.660
 It is uglier than a Chinese man eating lemons 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.990
 it's almost finished 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.830
 you just need a stereo in the trunk 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.479
 as expensive as possible and put neons up in the anal rectum 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.199
 once in the street the story repeats itself we find the typical 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.300
 neighborhood ronaldiño 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.939
 that ronaldinho is a motorcycle rider 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:10.610
 that's why I say it 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.129
 host fucking I have a lot of balls when I see these kids over 12 with 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.020
 this casket with wheels that when you take any center base you will take for 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.729
 ass 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.680
 over these comedians are going around throwing themselves jakos where more people there 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.810
 so you can tell them how silly you are 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.380
 but good, after all, the cap prevents anything from happening to your head 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:33.899
 if this were not enough they go around pecking with everyone and when 

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:36.639
 you give them a missed 15 with your apportionment 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.889
 They start to eat your ass saying that as everything is better to top you say 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.389
 that there are several equals and that he has no cattle because he was going with force rollers 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.389
 xd xd xd xd xd xd xd 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.860
 postscript this is cinematic fiction 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.050
 I do not have anything personal against anyone 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.750
 If you get stung by something, it will be like that. Repeat unloading your fury on
