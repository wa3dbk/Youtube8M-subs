00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
strings but only lets the one ring out

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.939

that he wants to play so when he does

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.720 
that he wants to play so when he does
that<00:00:20.100> he<00:00:20.250> goes<00:00:21.920> he's<00:00:22.920> hitting<00:00:23.220> all<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.580> them

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
that he goes he's hitting all of them

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.630 
that he goes he's hitting all of them
but<00:00:23.939> only<00:00:24.439> the<00:00:25.439> ones<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.800> want<00:00:26.039> are<00:00:26.279> ringing

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.830 
but only the ones you want are ringing
out<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.939> that's<00:00:27.090> really<00:00:27.269> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> give<00:00:27.720> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
out and that's really going to give you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.370 
out and that's really going to give you
the<00:00:28.260> first<00:00:28.439> shot<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.859> sound<00:00:29.099> versus<00:00:30.140> it<00:00:31.140> just

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the first shot a sound versus it just

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.770 
the first shot a sound versus it just
doesn't<00:00:31.710> sound<00:00:32.239> like<00:00:33.239> what<00:00:33.480> you're<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
doesn't sound like what you're going to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:44.590 
doesn't sound like what you're going to
want<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> sound<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.410> so

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.690 

so<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.660> come<00:00:45.840> over<00:00:45.870> top<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.530> thumb<00:00:46.770> hit

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
so you come over top with the thumb hit

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.300 
so you come over top with the thumb hit
the<00:00:47.850> top<00:00:48.060> string<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.480> then<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.650> bar<00:00:49.890> three

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
the top string and then you bar three

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.210 
the top string and then you bar three
strings<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.880> middle<00:00:51.120> there

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
strings in the middle there

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.520 
strings in the middle there
then<00:00:53.880> do<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.060> hammer-on<00:00:54.540> up<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> nine<00:00:57.530> then

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
then do a hammer-on up to the nine then

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.470 
then do a hammer-on up to the nine then
bring<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.740> whole<00:00:59.100> formation<00:00:59.580> down<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
bring that whole formation down to the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
bring that whole formation down to the
five

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.480 

and<00:01:19.500> he<00:01:19.560> does<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> fill<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> end

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
and he does the fill at the end

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.539 
and he does the fill at the end
that's<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.729> five<00:01:23.909> seven<00:01:24.270> five<00:01:24.390> seven<00:01:25.549> then

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that's just five seven five seven then

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.280 
that's just five seven five seven then
you<00:01:26.640> slide<00:01:26.970> back<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.450> after<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.229> repeat

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
you slide back up after that to repeat

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.039 
you slide back up after that to repeat
and<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.149> is<00:01:33.299> different<00:01:33.630> because<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and this one is different because it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:47.559 
and this one is different because it
slides<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.280> nine<00:01:43.399> so<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.580> again<00:01:44.850> goes

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:02:09.800 

and<00:01:48.569> up<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.869> other<00:01:58.259> fill<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.720> then

other fingers draped across to mute

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.250

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
top again and then we're going to hammer

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:56.180 
top again and then we're going to hammer
on<00:02:42.299> up<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> 10

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.890 

and<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.850> fill<00:02:57.090> here<00:02:59.660> to<00:03:00.660> end<00:03:01.260> up<00:03:01.440> with<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:02.900> at

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and the fill here to end up with that at

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:21.220 
and the fill here to end up with that at
the<00:03:04.110> 8th<00:03:16.010> finish<00:03:17.010> like<00:03:17.250> we<00:03:17.400> did<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.610> other<00:03:17.760> one

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.760 

then<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.440> next<00:03:22.710> part<00:03:23.150> up<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.450> seven<00:03:25.170> nine<00:03:25.440> nine

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
then the next part up to seven nine nine

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:35.480 
then the next part up to seven nine nine
seven<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.640> then<00:03:27.300> these<00:03:27.450> two<00:03:27.660> open<00:03:34.160> so<00:03:35.160> then<00:03:35.310> at

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
seven and then these two open so then at

00:03:35.490 --> 00:04:03.699 
seven and then these two open so then at
the<00:03:35.670> end<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.000> one<00:03:53.240> then<00:03:54.240> this<00:03:54.540> chord<00:03:54.870> is

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:15.550 

you<00:04:04.709> put<00:04:04.950> your<00:04:04.980> pinkie<00:04:05.459> up<00:04:05.490> there<00:04:05.760> on<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:05.970> ten

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.630 

and<00:04:16.560> this<00:04:16.770> one<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.040> really<00:04:17.190> kind<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.520> just

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
and this one you really kind of just

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.730 
and this one you really kind of just
strum<00:04:18.030> through<00:04:18.299> it

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.909 

so<00:04:24.699> let's<00:04:24.850> do<00:04:24.940> that<00:04:25.000> again<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:25.539> this<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:25.919> thumb

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
so let's do that again so this is thumb

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.080 
so let's do that again so this is thumb
over<00:04:27.069> the<00:04:27.190> top<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:27.960> 1214<00:04:28.960> new<00:04:29.710> bar<00:04:29.979> 12<00:04:30.669> 12

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
over the top on the 1214 new bar 12 12

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.529
