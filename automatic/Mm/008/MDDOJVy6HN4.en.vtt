we've just looked at I'd like for you to

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.680 
we've just looked at I'd like for you to
look<00:00:10.039> at<00:00:10.219> the<00:00:10.430> closed<00:00:10.700> cavity<00:00:11.209> bag<00:00:11.450> molding

look at the closed cavity bag molding
operation<00:00:12.559> that<00:00:12.710> we're<00:00:12.830> pretty<00:00:12.980> proud<00:00:13.190> of

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
operation that we're pretty proud of

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.579 
operation that we're pretty proud of
that's<00:00:14.059> the<00:00:14.179> department<00:00:14.750> where<00:00:14.900> we<00:00:14.929> build<00:00:15.349> all

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589 
that's the department where we build all

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.790 
that's the department where we build all
of<00:00:15.620> the<00:00:15.919> hatches<00:00:16.759> the<00:00:17.270> lids<00:00:17.570> virtually<00:00:18.500> all<00:00:18.650> of

advantages of CBM are many one of which

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.369 
advantages of CBM are many one of which
is<00:00:49.159> it<00:00:49.790> allows<00:00:50.150> us<00:00:50.479> to<00:00:50.750> mold<00:00:51.080> and

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
is it allows us to mold and

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.399 
is it allows us to mold and
strategically<00:00:52.129> place<00:00:52.400> the<00:00:52.640> fiberglass

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
strategically place the fiberglass

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.810 
strategically place the fiberglass
exactly<00:00:54.409> like<00:00:54.589> we<00:00:54.799> want<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.220> for<00:00:55.670> that

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
exactly like we want it for that

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.539 
exactly like we want it for that
specific<00:00:56.479> part<00:00:56.720> you<00:00:57.559> can<00:00:57.710> understand<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:58.489> a

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
specific part you can understand that a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.219 
specific part you can understand that a
trailer<00:00:58.939> fender<00:00:59.330> perhaps<00:00:59.750> would<00:01:00.049> have<00:01:00.080> a

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
trailer fender perhaps would have a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.039 
trailer fender perhaps would have a
different<00:01:01.220> laminate<00:01:01.670> schedule<00:01:02.239> than<00:01:02.720> a<00:01:02.750> live

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
different laminate schedule than a live

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:04.960 
different laminate schedule than a live
wheel<00:01:03.290> would<00:01:03.589> so<00:01:04.100> we're<00:01:04.250> able<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.610> do<00:01:04.790> this

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
wheel would so we're able to do this

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.450 
wheel would so we're able to do this
because<00:01:05.269> we're<00:01:05.689> doing<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.110> over<00:01:06.500> our<00:01:06.950> inside

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
because we're doing it over our inside

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.359 
because we're doing it over our inside
and<00:01:07.729> mold<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.479> then<00:01:08.929> we<00:01:09.109> just<00:01:09.350> add<00:01:09.649> a<00:01:09.679> silicone

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
and mold and then we just add a silicone

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.690 
and mold and then we just add a silicone
bag<00:01:10.609> pull<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.450> vacuum<00:01:11.750> on<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:12.409> we<00:01:13.189> can<00:01:13.310> control

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
bag pull a vacuum on this we can control

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.359 
bag pull a vacuum on this we can control
the<00:01:13.909> resin<00:01:14.329> and<00:01:14.420> glass<00:01:14.630> ratio<00:01:15.229> very<00:01:15.890> precisely

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
the resin and glass ratio very precisely

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.270 
the resin and glass ratio very precisely
using<00:01:16.880> this<00:01:17.539> process<00:01:18.079> let<00:01:18.829> me<00:01:18.890> show<00:01:19.070> you<00:01:19.130> a

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
using this process let me show you a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.160 
using this process let me show you a
little<00:01:19.340> bit<00:01:19.729> about<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:20.329> couple<00:01:20.840> things<00:01:21.020> that

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
little bit about a couple things that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.410 
little bit about a couple things that
really<00:01:21.439> give<00:01:21.679> us<00:01:21.799> an<00:01:21.920> advantage<00:01:22.280> one<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.329> the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
really give us an advantage one of the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.800 
really give us an advantage one of the
advantages<00:01:24.079> in<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.770> CC<00:01:25.159> BM<00:01:25.520> method<00:01:26.119> is<00:01:26.270> that

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
advantages in the CC BM method is that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.529 
advantages in the CC BM method is that
we<00:01:26.929> can<00:01:27.079> use<00:01:27.259> a<00:01:27.289> continuous<00:01:28.130> strand<00:01:28.460> mat<00:01:28.820> which

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
we can use a continuous strand mat which

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.450 
we can use a continuous strand mat which
means<00:01:29.869> that<00:01:30.140> there<00:01:30.409> we<00:01:31.070> can<00:01:31.249> make<00:01:31.399> a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
means that there we can make a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.580 
means that there we can make a
lightweight<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.090> very<00:01:32.509> strong<00:01:32.590> material

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
lightweight and very strong material

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.219 
lightweight and very strong material
because<00:01:34.159> it<00:01:34.280> doesn't<00:01:34.609> have<00:01:34.759> any<00:01:34.789> cut<00:01:35.240> ends<00:01:35.689> it

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
because it doesn't have any cut ends it

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.319 
because it doesn't have any cut ends it
goes<00:01:36.259> continuously<00:01:37.219> through<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:37.850> laminate

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
goes continuously through this laminate

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.679 
goes continuously through this laminate
schedule<00:01:38.869> another<00:01:39.590> thing<00:01:39.920> we<00:01:40.069> have<00:01:40.249> a<00:01:40.280> core

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
schedule another thing we have a core

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.630 
schedule another thing we have a core
that<00:01:41.689> gives<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.229> heat<00:01:43.100> barrier

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
that gives a heat barrier

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.730 
that gives a heat barrier
oh<00:01:43.789> no<00:01:44.090> if<00:01:44.359> it's<00:01:44.509> over<00:01:44.749> a<00:01:44.780> Live<00:01:44.990> Well<00:01:45.229> lid<00:01:45.469> or<00:01:45.710> a

cooler lid we have a foam core very
rigid<00:01:49.009> urethane<00:01:49.850> core<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:50.479> then<00:01:50.899> we're<00:01:51.049> able

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
rigid urethane core and then we're able

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.309 
rigid urethane core and then we're able

and<00:02:01.999> we've<00:02:02.450> talked<00:02:02.719> about<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.109> pultrusion

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and we've talked about the pultrusion

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.190 
and we've talked about the pultrusion
process<00:02:03.829> on<00:02:04.579> how<00:02:04.609> we've<00:02:05.420> integrated<00:02:05.689> that

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
process on how we've integrated that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.230 
process on how we've integrated that
pultrusion<00:02:06.709> throughout<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.880> Ranger

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
pultrusion throughout the Ranger

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.900 
pultrusion throughout the Ranger
manufacturing<00:02:09.110> process<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.520> piece<00:02:10.759> of

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
manufacturing process this piece of

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.080 
manufacturing process this piece of
pultrusion<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:12.250> strategically<00:02:13.250> located<00:02:13.460> in

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
pultrusion is strategically located in

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.690 
pultrusion is strategically located in
this<00:02:14.540> lid<00:02:14.840> core<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.470> what<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.100> does<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.460> ties

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
this lid core and what it does it ties

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.070 
this lid core and what it does it ties
the<00:02:16.970> sides<00:02:17.300> together

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
the sides together

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.870 
the sides together
this<00:02:18.440> was<00:02:18.590> probably<00:02:18.770> going<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.460> be<00:02:19.550> an<00:02:19.640> area

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
this was probably going to be an area

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.600 
this was probably going to be an area
where<00:02:20.570> there's<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.810> lid<00:02:21.380> shot<00:02:21.740> it's<00:02:22.340> going<00:02:22.550> to

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
where there's a lid shot it's going to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.940 
where there's a lid shot it's going to
tie<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.850> surface<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.810> bottom<00:02:23.960> make<00:02:24.770> that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
tie the surface to the bottom make that

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.370 
tie the surface to the bottom make that
very<00:02:25.190> durable<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.540> already<00:02:26.900> showed<00:02:27.170> you

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
very durable and we already showed you

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.620 
very durable and we already showed you
they<00:02:27.620> screw<00:02:27.950> retention<00:02:28.520> ability<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
they screw retention ability of the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.330 
they screw retention ability of the
pultrusion<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.800> we<00:02:30.920> don't<00:02:31.040> have<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.220> worry

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
pultrusion so we don't have to worry

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.190 
pultrusion so we don't have to worry
about<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.670> screws<00:02:32.000> pulling<00:02:32.420> out<00:02:32.600> on<00:02:32.990> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
about the screws pulling out on the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.080 
about the screws pulling out on the
various<00:02:33.500> hardware<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.190> we're<00:02:34.310> using<00:02:34.550> on

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
various hardware that we're using on

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.950 
various hardware that we're using on
these<00:02:35.390> lids

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960
