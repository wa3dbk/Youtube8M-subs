so it's muted we just lay it down a
little<00:00:42.600> bit<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.079> mutes<00:00:43.290> out<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> string

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
little bit so it mutes out that string

little bit so it mutes out that string
not<00:00:44.040> fretting<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.570> you're<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.020> play

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
them all in sequence on accident it

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.600 
them all in sequence on accident it
would<00:00:47.640> sound<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> only<00:00:50.190> these<00:00:50.370> two

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
would sound like this so only these two

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.600 
would sound like this so only these two
ring<00:00:50.850> out
