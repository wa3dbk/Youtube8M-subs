welcome to this short tutorial on
building<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.570> telephone<00:00:04.200> box<00:00:04.910> first<00:00:05.910> let's

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
building a telephone box first let's

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.900 
building a telephone box first let's
draw<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:07.020> base<00:00:07.170> plate<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:08.040> our<00:00:08.280> telephone<00:00:08.790> toe

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
draw the base plate of our telephone toe

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.560 
draw the base plate of our telephone toe
box<00:00:09.090> as<00:00:09.300> on<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.110> plate<00:00:10.349> our<00:00:10.650> PC<00:00:11.280> monitor<00:00:11.849> will

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
box as on this plate our PC monitor will

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.980 
box as on this plate our PC monitor will
lie<00:00:12.690> flat<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.320> its<00:00:13.469> back<00:00:13.650> as<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.940> monitor<00:00:15.330> you

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
lie flat on its back as a monitor you

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.890 
lie flat on its back as a monitor you
could<00:00:16.170> use<00:00:16.350> your<00:00:16.590> flat<00:00:16.949> screen<00:00:16.980> or<00:00:17.490> laptop<00:00:18.210> but

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
could use your flat screen or laptop but

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.590 
could use your flat screen or laptop but
it<00:00:19.020> may<00:00:19.170> be<00:00:19.230> difficult<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.949> insert<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.430> as<00:00:20.699> most

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
it may be difficult to insert it as most

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.529 
it may be difficult to insert it as most
laptops<00:00:21.869> do<00:00:22.439> not<00:00:22.590> open<00:00:22.769> up<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.539> 180-degree

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
laptops do not open up to a 180-degree

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.200 
laptops do not open up to a 180-degree
flat<00:00:25.230> angle<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.699> may<00:00:26.849> want<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.119> use

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
flat angle and then you may want to use

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.689 
flat angle and then you may want to use
it<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> control<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.500> text<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.250> software

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it to control the text and the software

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.630 
it to control the text and the software
so<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.420> ended<00:00:31.050> up<00:00:31.170> buying<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.769> cheapest<00:00:32.430> money
