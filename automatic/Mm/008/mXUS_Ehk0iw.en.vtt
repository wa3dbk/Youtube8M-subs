 Friends, make a nice Christmas tree today. 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.590
 What should I do if only in the tree 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.590
 2 is the Pent 5 dimension 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.550
 U 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:08.590
 It takes a lot of money to build an English framework. 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:12.610
 No, I do not pay. 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:17.070
 Now blind not say 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.070
 Jean Y'all take this space laced 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.920
 Your problem will be a very nice tree. 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.549
 wh 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.010
 Okay. Let 's make it. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.159
 I need a lot of trouble at the moment. 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:54.230
 So ready to do this, then expand the party so it expands 1 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:03:00.409
 It's about passion. After you've done this 10 times like this 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:05.510
 Fold this triangle from the end of the line . 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:09.170
 Stones in the following self-folding is an ot, such as Idaho 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:14.100
 This two-column pillars will already be born. 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:19.450
 Let's do it like this . 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:25.180
 Vertical Pantheon Pro is simply a must for science 5 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:28.750
 We need to bring this to find so little toad made one pillar 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:34.209
 The b model has prepared me like this . 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:38.860
 Make it. You have a point like this . Pointed point. 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:47.140
 It's a little wider portion sandwiched do so on the part of 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:50.739
 Oh oh oh so well displayed, and then once again fall into the vertical Fern tape 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:57.400
 If you wake up like this 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:04:01.090
 When you turn on the girl, it's much bigger than the advertisement . 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.079
 Like two pillars of a tree, I complete two of them. 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.120
 I have to prepare my newspaper again. 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:11.290
 The pillars prepared for enthusiasm. 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.700
 I need about three of these to make these branches. 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:22.680
 This is somehow stretched so when you create the three pillars in the next chapter about nwadun 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:29.940
 Like a young man next to his make up 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:34.620
 I've developed so repeatedly and then paste it into the tape captured by the last preceding stated yogeo 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:38.759
 I need a lot of these criteria. 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.900
 Our friends, if you want to make a very big tree, you have to prepare a lot. 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.050
 559 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:48.300
 We can make as many arrangements as our friends want. 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:53.699
 There are so many things to do when you prepare so many. 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.620
 Now you have to attach this thorn to the second attic column. 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.810
 We were there during our sleep. 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.960
 I'll set up a pillar in this barrel. 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:07.550
 Prepare yourself after your own 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:13.130
 Fill in this after the locals. 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:19.220
 That's why I keep filling in the magazine that keeps the core of experience . 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:24.680
 Even I'm very much needed, however, and with so see you then 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:29.120
 A friend who does not have a lot of hard work should get a little more for his friends. 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.960
 This configuration was not followed or the plan 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.960
 Good now
