and i went over is the fact and i didn't
even<00:01:51.280> do<00:01:51.400> it<00:01:51.430> there<00:01:51.900> sometimes<00:01:52.900> i<00:01:53.110> forget<00:01:53.800> to

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
even do it there sometimes i forget to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.220 
even do it there sometimes i forget to

do it but if you use three on these

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.760 
do it but if you use three on these
bottom<00:01:56.620> FS<00:01:56.980> you<00:01:57.760> can<00:01:57.940> kind<00:01:58.150> of<00:01:58.210> control

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
bottom FS you can kind of control

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.520 
bottom FS you can kind of control
the<00:02:00.490> sound<00:02:00.730> as<00:02:00.940> it<00:02:01.060> gets<00:02:01.180> bigger<00:02:01.480> better<00:02:02.290> than

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
the sound as it gets bigger better than

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.110 
the sound as it gets bigger better than
doing<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.220> side<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.610> your<00:02:03.730> hand<00:02:03.910> like<00:02:04.000> this

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
doing the side of your hand like this

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.300 
doing the side of your hand like this
this<00:02:04.510> is<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.690> little<00:02:04.900> bit<00:02:05.080> harder<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.710> control

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
this is a little bit harder to control

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.469 
this is a little bit harder to control
that<00:02:06.520> sound<00:02:06.820> it<00:02:07.030> wants<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.720> be<00:02:07.870> one<00:02:08.220> broad<00:02:09.479> idea

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
that sound it wants to be one broad idea

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.060 
that sound it wants to be one broad idea
going<00:02:10.750> forward<00:02:11.170> let's<00:02:11.320> try<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.650> again<00:02:11.710> this

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
going forward let's try that again this

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.650 
going forward let's try that again this
is<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:12.460> important<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:12.970> reason<00:02:13.000> i'm<00:02:13.300> spending

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
is so important the reason i'm spending

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.780 
is so important the reason i'm spending
so<00:02:13.780> much<00:02:13.930> time<00:02:13.960> on<00:02:14.260> just<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.680> line<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.250> because

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
so much time on just one line is because

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.580 
so much time on just one line is because
this<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.300> important<00:02:16.690> each<00:02:16.840> one<00:02:17.110> has<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.470> be

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
this is so important each one has to be

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.850 
this is so important each one has to be
a<00:02:18.010> gradation<00:02:18.640> higher<00:02:19.120> than<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.780> previous<00:02:19.960> one

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.410 

now<00:02:23.860> make<00:02:24.100> sure<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.310> use<00:02:24.580> enough<00:02:24.610> weight<00:02:25.060> okay

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
now make sure you use enough weight okay

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:37.140 
now make sure you use enough weight okay
here<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:25.690> go

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.580 

I'm<00:02:38.150> getting<00:02:38.420> too<00:02:38.570> loud<00:02:38.750> too<00:02:38.990> quick<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.440> this

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
I'm getting too loud too quick and this

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.050 
I'm getting too loud too quick and this
