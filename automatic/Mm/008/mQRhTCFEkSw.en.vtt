00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.390
 of the channel is going to be about which range a 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.410
 flash game based on html5 unit player 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.920

 comments and leave 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.260
 so this is the page of the program he is 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.840
 practically from the click games really cool 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.549

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.580
 I was chosen by the camera here for you guys. 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.420
 is to view but is only google browser 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.000
 chrome 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.060
 usually the home page as 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.509
 You can see that it's my character and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.070
 basically the game is based on what 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.820
 based more or less on the idea of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.939
 minecraft that is the characters in shape 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.030
 cube in this game as you can see 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.030
 which has several rooms that people 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.299
 create you can also create for 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.880
 you can kids rooms are 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.600
 distributed golden cubes and cubes of 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.479
 silver 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.909
 the gold globes are worth them for 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.399
 you buy more rare items and the cubes 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.979
 silver for less rare items is that 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.000
 In this video I'll teach you. 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.310
 teaching not giving a good setback the same 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.009
 gameplay of the game for you to have a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.899
 idea but if you want me then I 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.500
 I give an explanation of how to customize 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.510
 the character of how you create a room 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.660
 How do you do more or less? 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.350
 basically things here any 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.290
 doubt 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.930
 Again, just send me an MP or put 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.700
 a comment below the video then 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.670
 Let's go to the game. 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.820
 op you can access any room is 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.090
 only rooms that are being played the most 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.959
 now this time we will see 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.250
 here on this team is simpsons 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.940
 let's get into that entered the simpsons 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.530
 here you will click play now and 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.170
 then you click play now if 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.030
 you do not have unit player installed it 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.620
 will be there is only you to click it 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.030
 It will be there, it's a matter of ten seconds. 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.770
 to be able to do this 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.770
 depending on your internet connection 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.660
 with the video is is that basically the key 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.710
 of the little ones that can give space 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.780
 jumps and the game is practically going up well 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.850
 cool the graphics brought a game hebe and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.500
 There are many things to do and you earn well. 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.520
 short said it is practically a pvp 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.830
 server 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.900
 pv is a general killing these 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.180
 face requirements 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.200
 A game tip is always you pick up a 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.520
 cannon win henrich kills 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.970
 here is a chat you can say that such 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.480
 My idea is more forward but for 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.380
 Do not waste time creating a 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.840
 channel room so we can combine 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.330
 some live.com with you there than 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.240
 like channel that likes that will enjoy 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:03.240
 The game we make a live, we can 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.860
 put in on the channel is so I'll go 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.100
 I'm going to give you a little straw here. 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:14.760
 of the game pp so you have an idea 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:17.970
 my friends here 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:24.750
 Here I am holding the microphone. 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:27.600
 It's very power to play. 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.450
 rich and explain to you and the same 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:36.260
 time that is an item to be able to 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:40.650
 take the 1 with sonic bin if he loads it 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.870
 Good shot at killing 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.870
 here you learn thabda to see who 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.030
 with the highest score and who has 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.880
 this total score 10 currently by 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:56.340
 died on a map then let's go here 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.580
 here as you can see is a game is 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.180
 basically pretty cool because you can 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:07.910

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.910
