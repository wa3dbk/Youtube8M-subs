00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.110
 mind they are animal lovers 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.650
 a member of the aviv and england foundation infiltrated the circus 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.530
 I go to these scenes I remember 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.620
 these images are from the gasca brothers circus 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.090
 the same where they are thinking to take their children tomorrow Sunday 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.150
 the mayor of valverde 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.440
 is 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 as 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 but it's still below 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.460
 so this is the way the gasca brothers circus protects the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.400
 animals 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.860
 it is necessary not to have me euro hours to understand that they are not only big 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.690
 violators of animal rights if not what premeditated way and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.640
 liar they place posters in the public light where they say they support the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 you will kill 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.079
 if it was known that in the circus is mistreating animals of the day the circus 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.630
 I am I believe that no 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.870
 they are not the same ponies that later they did not allow me to be recorded 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.870
 it will be that the blows are noticed 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.080
 sergio pino advise the animal abuse that many circuses sometimes give 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 I think that is what is important 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.870
 It is important 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.990
 the circuses 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.060
 they do not even take into account the natural habitat or even the climate in which 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.339
 these animals would normally have been born and live 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.989
 instead of wandering on the African plain under the sunrise sun 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:22.539
 This king of the jungle huddles in a metal container under a snow 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.179
 ice cream maker 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:29.179
 a polar bear has to change the vast frozen desert a world in which 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:34.099
 would marry and nothing life for a cage in the back of a truck under a 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.499
 suffocating heat with only a small homemade fan to keep cool 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.699
 in many cases animals die due to abuse or adverse 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.269
 conditions in which they live in these mobile prisons 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.989
 like this giraffe that died in its absurd and inexplicable sentence 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.060
 but the circus 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.189
 makes sure that the public does not know about his death 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.019
 but how to remove such a large animal without the public noticing 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.659
 here is the answer 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.659
 they quartered 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.889
 we know that other animals feel just like humans 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.689
 they feel afraid loneliness 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:21.019
 which animal would choose to live in captivity if it had a choice 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.170
 our wise and honest decision to never visit this kind of 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.310
 shows could be the difference and the noble life of thousands of animals 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.689
 subjected to injustice 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.900
 I beg you not to take your children to witness this unknown 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.930
 show
