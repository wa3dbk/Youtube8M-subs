first off they should stop with all the
live-action<00:01:52.280> stuff<00:01:53.530> doesn't<00:01:54.530> seem<00:01:54.649> like<00:01:54.830> it's

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
live-action stuff doesn't seem like it's

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.820

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
this won't suck introducing new

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.140 
this won't suck introducing new
characters<00:04:30.530> just<00:04:30.950> something<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.370> don't<00:04:31.610> like<00:04:31.730> I

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
characters just something I don't like I

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.430 
characters just something I don't like I
would<00:04:32.510> like<00:04:32.540> a<00:04:32.690> season<00:04:33.140> where<00:04:33.200> all<00:04:33.380> the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
would like a season where all the

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.620 
would like a season where all the
contestants<00:04:34.130> which<00:04:34.760> they<00:04:35.030> have<00:04:35.240> been<00:04:35.450> done

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
contestants which they have been done

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.380 
contestants which they have been done
yet<00:04:35.960> basically<00:04:36.800> what<00:04:36.980> I<00:04:37.010> mean<00:04:37.310> mean<00:04:37.850> is<00:04:38.440> with<00:04:39.440> a

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
yet basically what I mean mean is with a

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.620 
yet basically what I mean mean is with a
they<00:04:41.990> with<00:04:42.980> each<00:04:43.520> season<00:04:43.820> they<00:04:44.030> introduce<00:04:44.420> a

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
they with each season they introduce a

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.660 
they with each season they introduce a
few<00:04:44.900> more<00:04:45.050> characters<00:04:45.680> so<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.310> was<00:04:46.490> thinking

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
few more characters so I was thinking

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.090 
few more characters so I was thinking
why<00:04:47.180> not<00:04:47.420> have<00:04:47.810> all<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.140> characters<00:04:48.680> compete

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
why not have all the characters compete

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.160 
why not have all the characters compete
in<00:04:49.250> one<00:04:49.850> season<00:04:50.320> it<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:52.610> would<00:04:52.880> allow<00:04:53.170> the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
in one season it it would allow the

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.980 
in one season it it would allow the
characters<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:54.830> get<00:04:55.220> some<00:04:55.550> development<00:04:56.480> like

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
characters to get some development like

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.170 
characters to get some development like
each<00:04:57.200> season<00:04:57.500> gives<00:04:57.920> some<00:04:58.670> of<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.820> characters

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
each season gives some of the characters

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.910 
each season gives some of the characters
even<00:04:59.390> more<00:04:59.630> development<00:05:00.200> even<00:05:00.560> if<00:05:00.740> they<00:05:00.860> were

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
even more development even if they were

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:11.850 
even more development even if they were
just<00:05:01.220> an<00:05:01.340> original<00:05:01.850> season
