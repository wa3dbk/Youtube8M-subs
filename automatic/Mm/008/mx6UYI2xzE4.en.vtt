00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.150

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.880
 thrifty and it's like you can 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.470
 Ripple your hair in just five minutes 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.570
 and the truth well I love this idea 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.610
 because I'm not much to invest 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.620
 time the hair the truth sometimes 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.900
 price two thousand five minutes more for the 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.820
 mornings or what do you tell me those plans that 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.430
 they look at the last minute and you are at home 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.829
 without fixing then do not worry because 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.620
 in this tutorial we will learn how to last 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.629
 your hair in 5 minutes so if you 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.210
 you want to know that you're watching this 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.640
 video for this tutorial is necessary 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.499
 you have dry hair and very well 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.629
 brushed remember that brushing 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:54.129
 always starts from the bottom up 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.129
 not to burst your tips 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.720
 since we throw our perfectly 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.970
 hair what we will do is make a tail 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.220
 of high horse among the highest 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.510
 better and we will help ourselves with a brush and 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.510
 a link to hold 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.600
 people 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.520
 and here comes the part of the procedure 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.189
 what we will do is divide our tail 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.049
 of horse in two sections and those two 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.670
 we are going to divide them into sections 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.520
 sections that you want me for example 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.830
 I divided my tail into four sections 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.500
 because I do not want curls so 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.630
 defined and marked and apart I do not have 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.970
 a lot of hair but you can do 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.040
 the sections that you want and what 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.050
 we will do is go grab the sections and 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.110
 undulate them the way you have 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.920
 regularly either with a clamp for 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.150
 curls or a straightened iron now 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.640
 remember that it is very important always 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.980
 use a heat shield and what 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.200
 I did I was leaving my hair clip 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.599
 very few seconds because I did not want some 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.910
 so marked curls I wanted something rather 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.099
 very natural but that will depend on the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.110
 taste that you want if you love them very 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.110
 defined or you want them very loose 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.110
 since undulating all your horse's tail 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.390
 what we will do to finalize will be to put 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.530
 a fixative spray to last us a lot 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.180
 more time 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.090
 our curls or our hair 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.130
 wavy and after that the only thing that 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.410
 We will make it loose our hair like 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.210
 we can see they have created very waves 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.250
 natural in our hair and going to 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.320
 depend on how long you left your 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.540
 pincer in the hair in mine this 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.790
 it was a very natural look and waves 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.950
 barely marked but if you leave it 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.530
 much longer your curls will be much 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.240
 more marked and if so, remember that 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.190
 you have to derail them to make it look 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.970
 a very natural look I hope you have them 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.970
 liked a lot 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.310
 Well I hope you liked it a lot 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.050
 this tutorial the truth is super 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.480
 simple what I love is that we 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.180

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.400
