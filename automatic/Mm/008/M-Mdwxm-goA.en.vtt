00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
of that Permatex

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.790 
of that Permatex
I'm<00:03:18.269> going<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.630> put<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.989> right<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.470> there

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
I'm going to put that right in there

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.020 
I'm going to put that right in there
this<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:22.820> but<00:03:23.820> they're

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
this this is this is the but they're

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.810 
this this is this is the but they're
right<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.720> gap<00:03:25.140> right<00:03:25.320> there<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.220> this

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
right in that gap right there and this

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.160 
right in that gap right there and this
is<00:03:26.880> set<00:03:27.239> up<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.680> crankcase<00:03:29.130> pressure

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
is set up and the crankcase pressure

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.240 
is set up and the crankcase pressure
will<00:03:31.170> not<00:03:31.560> be<00:03:31.830> enough<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.489> where<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.910> this

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
will not be enough to where that this

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.210 
will not be enough to where that this
leaks<00:03:35.250> all<00:03:36.019> no<00:03:37.019> no<00:03:37.260> no<00:03:37.290> gasket<00:03:38.040> goes<00:03:38.250> here

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
leaks all no no no gasket goes here

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.720 
leaks all no no no gasket goes here
and<00:03:40.220> also<00:03:40.580> on<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.330> on<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.959> on<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:43.040> UH<00:03:43.069> neck<00:03:43.400> on

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
and also on the on the on the UH neck on

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.520 
and also on the on the on the UH neck on
that<00:03:43.880> case<00:03:44.150> goes<00:03:44.569> all<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.840> way<00:03:44.989> around<00:03:45.410> right

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
that case goes all the way around right

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:57.430 
that case goes all the way around right
there<00:03:54.970> it's<00:03:55.970> quite<00:03:56.270> a<00:03:56.300> bit<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.750> difference<00:03:57.200> in

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
there it's quite a bit of difference in

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.309 
there it's quite a bit of difference in
this<00:03:58.160> in<00:03:58.459> this<00:03:58.760> mating<00:03:59.239> surface<00:03:59.720> on<00:03:59.930> some

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
this in this mating surface on some

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.979 
this in this mating surface on some
engine<00:04:01.040> so<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.370> do<00:04:01.670> want<00:04:01.910> this<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.150> be<00:04:02.480> kind<00:04:02.750> of

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
engine so you do want this to be kind of

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.800 
engine so you do want this to be kind of
kind<00:04:03.830> of<00:04:04.010> thick<00:04:04.280> but<00:04:04.940> but<00:04:05.209> not<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:05.540> not

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
kind of thick but but not so not

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.290 
kind of thick but but not so not
wasteful<00:04:06.440> don't<00:04:07.220> don't<00:04:07.489> be<00:04:07.610> wasting<00:04:08.150> this

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
wasteful don't don't be wasting this

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.320 
wasteful don't don't be wasting this
context<00:04:09.610> okay<00:04:10.610> that's<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:13.030> think<00:04:14.030> that'd<00:04:14.180> be

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
context okay that's I think that'd be

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.680 
context okay that's I think that'd be
enough<00:04:16.389> it's<00:04:17.389> so<00:04:17.540> simple<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.260> stop<00:04:18.739> a<00:04:18.979> or<00:04:19.639> leak

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.330 

and<00:04:23.690> then<00:04:24.229> now<00:04:24.410> we're<00:04:24.590> now<00:04:24.710> we're<00:04:24.770> now<00:04:25.130> let's

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
and then now we're now we're now let's

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.610 
and then now we're now we're now let's
fit<00:04:25.520> that<00:04:25.700> on<00:04:25.880> there<00:04:26.150> I'll<00:04:26.990> put<00:04:27.169> that<00:04:27.320> grease

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
fit that on there I'll put that grease

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.250 
fit that on there I'll put that grease
up<00:04:27.830> in<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.070> inner<00:04:28.479> got<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.690> up<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:30.020> there

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
up in the inner got that up on there

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.790 
up in the inner got that up on there
that's<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:31.130> no<00:04:31.639> paint<00:04:31.970> here<00:04:32.389> no<00:04:33.350> paint<00:04:33.650> on

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
that's this no paint here no paint on

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.490 
that's this no paint here no paint on
none<00:04:34.040> of<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.250> mating<00:04:34.460> surfaces<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.600> you<00:04:36.320> put

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
none of the mating surfaces and you put

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.580 
none of the mating surfaces and you put
that<00:04:36.530> right<00:04:36.770> opinion<00:04:37.190> like<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.700> and<00:04:38.590> those

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
that right opinion like that and those

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.080 
that right opinion like that and those
are<00:04:40.240> make<00:04:41.240> sure<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.690> those<00:04:42.310> shims<00:04:43.310> are<00:04:43.789> are

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
are make sure that those shims are are

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.330 
are make sure that those shims are are
not<00:04:44.660> touching<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.410> crack<00:04:45.680> cake<00:04:45.979> the

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
not touching the crack cake the

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:54.750 
not touching the crack cake the
crankshaft<00:04:51.160> will<00:04:52.160> find<00:04:52.550> some<00:04:52.970> lock<00:04:53.330> washers

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
crankshaft will find some lock washers

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.170 
crankshaft will find some lock washers
but<00:04:55.760> I'm<00:04:55.910> going<00:04:56.180> I'm<00:04:56.479> going<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.840> assemble<00:04:57.110> this

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
but I'm going I'm going to assemble this

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.640 
but I'm going I'm going to assemble this
dead<00:04:59.180> tight<00:04:59.830> at<00:05:00.830> this<00:05:01.160> point<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:02.410> then<00:05:03.410> make

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
dead tight at this point and then make

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:25.530 
dead tight at this point and then make
sure<00:05:03.680> that<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:05.120> shims<00:05:05.479> are<00:05:05.810> correct

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:38.910 

turn<00:05:26.540> it<00:05:26.720> up<00:05:26.900> tap<00:05:32.320> very<00:05:33.320> good<00:05:34.930> very<00:05:35.930> good<00:05:36.050> very

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.860 

good

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:50.620 

okay<00:05:46.330> yes<00:05:47.330> and<00:05:48.730> then<00:05:49.730> the<00:05:49.910> amount<00:05:50.150> of<00:05:50.330> shims

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
okay yes and then the amount of shims

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.460 
okay yes and then the amount of shims
that<00:05:51.190> it's<00:05:52.190> just<00:05:53.150> that<00:05:53.810> they<00:05:53.990> and<00:05:54.170> that's<00:05:54.260> the

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
that it's just that they and that's the

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.110 
that it's just that they and that's the
reason<00:05:54.770> I<00:05:54.860> did<00:05:55.040> it<00:05:55.160> like<00:05:55.280> this<00:05:55.490> right<00:05:55.730> here<00:05:56.000> is

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
reason I did it like this right here is

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.630 
reason I did it like this right here is
there<00:05:56.780> there<00:05:57.110> is<00:05:57.140> just<00:05:57.560> no<00:05:57.770> reason<00:05:57.800> for<00:05:58.520> me<00:05:58.610> to

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
there there is just no reason for me to

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.190 
there there is just no reason for me to
quote<00:05:59.030> you<00:05:59.360> how<00:06:00.170> many<00:06:00.230> shims<00:06:00.770> are<00:06:01.100> used<00:06:01.490> here

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
quote you how many shims are used here

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.670 
quote you how many shims are used here
because<00:06:03.200> it<00:06:03.590> will<00:06:03.680> be<00:06:03.770> different<00:06:04.010> on<00:06:04.310> everyone

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
because it will be different on everyone

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.840 
because it will be different on everyone
and<00:06:06.680> that's<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:07.130> reason<00:06:07.550> that<00:06:07.580> you<00:06:07.940> can<00:06:09.850> Emery

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
and that's the reason that you can Emery

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:17.140 
and that's the reason that you can Emery
the<00:06:11.600> part<00:06:12.590> of<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:14.210> crankshaft<00:06:14.780> for<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:16.150> for

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
the part of the crankshaft for the for

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.660 
the part of the crankshaft for the for
this<00:06:17.360> babbitt<00:06:17.810> bernie<00:06:18.050> is<00:06:18.320> you<00:06:18.620> can<00:06:18.860> Emery<00:06:19.430> or

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
this babbitt bernie is you can Emery or

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.440 
this babbitt bernie is you can Emery or
or<00:06:20.210> you<00:06:20.510> can<00:06:20.750> work<00:06:20.930> that<00:06:21.290> smaller<00:06:21.850> and<00:06:22.850> just

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
or you can work that smaller and just

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.160 
or you can work that smaller and just
take<00:06:23.660> a<00:06:23.690> shim<00:06:24.050> out<00:06:24.290> as<00:06:24.880> long<00:06:25.880> as<00:06:26.090> it's<00:06:26.330> not<00:06:26.630> too

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
take a shim out as long as it's not too

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.340 
take a shim out as long as it's not too
small<00:06:27.410> that<00:06:27.590> the<00:06:28.310> bird<00:06:28.550> would<00:06:28.820> be<00:06:29.030> wore<00:06:29.350> too

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
small that the bird would be wore too

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.680 
small that the bird would be wore too
wide<00:06:30.680> this<00:06:31.550> way<00:06:33.550> but<00:06:34.550> that<00:06:34.730> that<00:06:35.000> feels<00:06:35.360> really

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
wide this way but that that feels really

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.610 
wide this way but that that feels really
really<00:06:36.140> good<00:06:36.430> really<00:06:37.430> good<00:06:37.810> if<00:06:38.810> you<00:06:39.080> could<00:06:39.320> if

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
really good really good if you could if

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
I'm going to fit the other side and then

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.990 
I'm going to fit the other side and then
then<00:06:49.640> then<00:06:50.000> I<00:06:50.030> will<00:06:50.390> put<00:06:51.230> four<00:06:52.160> lock<00:06:52.550> washers

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
then then I will put four lock washers

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.790 
then then I will put four lock washers
here<00:06:53.330> and<00:06:53.630> that's<00:06:53.990> another<00:06:54.290> thing<00:06:54.410> that's

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
here and that's another thing that's

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.170 
here and that's another thing that's
another<00:06:55.780> another<00:06:56.780> part<00:06:57.410> as<00:06:58.190> to<00:06:58.700> maybe

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
another another part as to maybe

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.450 
another another part as to maybe
different<00:06:59.630> gear<00:06:59.780> models<00:07:00.260> or<00:07:00.380> something

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
different gear models or something

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.480 
different gear models or something
not<00:07:02.270> I<00:07:02.300> don't<00:07:02.480> think<00:07:02.690> all<00:07:03.110> all<00:07:03.770> of<00:07:04.130> them<00:07:04.280> came

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
not I don't think all all of them came

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.820 
not I don't think all all of them came
from<00:07:04.520> the<00:07:04.820> factory<00:07:05.180> with<00:07:05.270> a<00:07:05.480> block<00:07:06.410> washer

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
from the factory with a block washer

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.030 
from the factory with a block washer
here<00:07:07.420> the<00:07:08.420> way<00:07:08.570> that<00:07:08.840> evened<00:07:09.260> up<00:07:09.380> right<00:07:09.650> there

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.040 
here the way that evened up right there

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.130 
here the way that evened up right there
I<00:07:10.370> may<00:07:10.700> not<00:07:10.880> put<00:07:11.090> a<00:07:11.120> lock<00:07:11.390> washer<00:07:11.600> there<00:07:11.990> on

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.140 
I may not put a lock washer there on

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.480 
I may not put a lock washer there on
second<00:07:12.590> thought<00:07:12.770> because<00:07:12.980> that<00:07:13.130> looks<00:07:13.310> pretty

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490 
second thought because that looks pretty

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.460 
second thought because that looks pretty
good<00:07:13.640> and<00:07:14.300> I<00:07:14.360> don't<00:07:14.540> like<00:07:14.690> lock<00:07:14.900> washers<00:07:15.290> no

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
good and I don't like lock washers no

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:23.130 
good and I don't like lock washers no
way<00:07:15.730> sure<00:07:16.730> but<00:07:17.450> let's<00:07:19.450> let's<00:07:20.450> proceed<00:07:20.690> to<00:07:20.990> the

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
way sure but let's let's proceed to the

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.340 
way sure but let's let's proceed to the
to<00:07:24.140> the<00:07:24.290> other<00:07:24.410> side<00:07:25.480> and<00:07:26.480> now<00:07:26.990> I<00:07:27.020> know<00:07:27.169> that

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:27.350 
to the other side and now I know that

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.860 
to the other side and now I know that
side<00:07:27.890> over<00:07:28.100> there<00:07:28.220> I<00:07:28.669> know<00:07:28.880> that<00:07:29.330> I<00:07:29.450> know

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:29.870 
side over there I know that I know

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.900 
side over there I know that I know
I<00:07:29.900> know<00:07:30.020> this<00:07:30.410> side<00:07:30.710> right<00:07:30.950> here<00:07:31.010> feels<00:07:31.520> really

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:31.910 
I know this side right here feels really

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.570 
I know this side right here feels really
good<00:07:32.090> I<00:07:32.150> like<00:07:32.540> that
