about this field is this has a history
of<00:00:24.900> white<00:00:25.230> mold<00:00:25.499> which<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> disease<00:00:26.429> caused

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
of white mold which is a disease caused

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.319 
of white mold which is a disease caused
by<00:00:26.759> Sclerotinia<00:00:27.630> sclerotium<00:00:28.880> now<00:00:29.880> we've<00:00:30.150> had

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
by Sclerotinia sclerotium now we've had

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.600 
by Sclerotinia sclerotium now we've had
a<00:00:30.390> pretty<00:00:30.659> cool<00:00:31.050> spring<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.340> wet

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
a pretty cool spring in a very wet

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.340 
a pretty cool spring in a very wet
spring<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.660> disease<00:00:33.989> has<00:00:34.170> been<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
spring and so this disease has been a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.950 
spring and so this disease has been a
problem<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.280> field<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.730> year<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.840> if

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
problem in this field this year and if

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.480 
problem in this field this year and if
you<00:00:37.079> step<00:00:37.320> back<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.590> kind<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.070> look<00:00:38.220> across

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
you step back and kind of look across

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.100 
you step back and kind of look across
the<00:00:38.790> field<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.390> see<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.720> beginning

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the field we can see the beginning

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.500 
the field we can see the beginning
stages<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.740> white<00:00:40.950> mold<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> flagging<00:00:42.390> or

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
stages of white mold with a flagging or

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
stages of white mold with a flagging or
wilting<00:00:42.930> submit<00:00:43.320> symptom<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> top<00:00:44.550> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
wilting submit symptom up at the top of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.290 
wilting submit symptom up at the top of
the<00:00:44.820> plant

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the plant

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.870 
the plant
so<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.110> flagging<00:00:46.680> or<00:00:46.800> wilting<00:00:47.220> is<00:00:47.370> probably

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
so this flagging or wilting is probably

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.910 
so this flagging or wilting is probably
the<00:00:48.090> best<00:00:48.330> primary<00:00:48.690> symptom<00:00:49.290> symptom<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the best primary symptom symptom that

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.760 
the best primary symptom symptom that
you'll<00:00:50.220> see<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.670> white<00:00:50.940> mould<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.840> soybean

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
you'll see of white mould in soybean

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.430 
you'll see of white mould in soybean
at<00:00:53.610> first<00:00:53.970> there<00:00:54.390> are<00:00:54.420> other<00:00:54.750> diseases<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
at first there are other diseases that

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.190 
at first there are other diseases that
could<00:00:55.830> be<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.040> problem<00:00:56.780> causing<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.870> symptom

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
could be a problem causing this symptom

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.230 
could be a problem causing this symptom
and<00:00:58.470> so<00:00:58.620> you'll<00:00:58.950> want<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.370> actually<00:00:59.550> move<00:01:00.000> down

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
and so you'll want to actually move down

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.820 
and so you'll want to actually move down
towards<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> base<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.200> plant<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.620> see

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
towards the base of the plant to see

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.030 
towards the base of the plant to see
what<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.430> actually<00:01:02.850> causing<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.390> problem

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
what is actually causing the problem

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.520 
what is actually causing the problem
once<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.129> move<00:01:05.369> down<00:01:05.670> towards<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.780> base<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.350> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
once we move down towards the base it is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
once we move down towards the base it is
readily<00:01:07.829> evident<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.880> white<00:01:09.690> mold

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
readily evident that we have white mold

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.660 
readily evident that we have white mold
you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.740> see<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:12.090> white<00:01:12.420> fluffy<00:01:13.430> mycelium<00:01:14.430> or

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you can see the white fluffy mycelium or

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.260 
you can see the white fluffy mycelium or
the<00:01:15.150> body<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.690> fungus<00:01:16.080> actually<00:01:16.470> causing

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
the body of the fungus actually causing

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.460 
the body of the fungus actually causing
damage<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.510> on<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> plants<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.230> you<00:01:19.320> can

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
damage here on the plants and you can

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.950 
damage here on the plants and you can
see<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.800> white<00:01:20.240> fluffy<00:01:21.240> growth<00:01:21.510> that<00:01:21.780> gives

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
see that white fluffy growth that gives

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.200 
see that white fluffy growth that gives
white<00:01:22.260> mold<00:01:22.500> its<00:01:22.710> name<00:01:22.920> you'll<00:01:23.550> also<00:01:23.790> notice

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
white mold its name you'll also notice

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.870 
white mold its name you'll also notice
that<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.260> symptom<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.800> see<00:01:26.040> down<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.640> at<00:01:26.760> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that the symptom we see down here at the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.810 
that the symptom we see down here at the
base<00:01:27.060> includes<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.200> bleached<00:01:28.560> almost<00:01:29.520> paper

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
lesion on the main stems will actually

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.050 
lesion on the main stems will actually
girdle<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.940> plant<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:37.229> disrupts<00:01:37.830> the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
girdle the plant which disrupts the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.850 
girdle the plant which disrupts the
vasculature<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.510> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.049> soybean<00:01:40.500> plant

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
vasculature the of the soybean plant

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.649 
vasculature the of the soybean plant
which<00:01:41.070> leads<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> wilting<00:01:42.150> symptom<00:01:42.510> that

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
which leads to the wilting symptom that

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.399 
which leads to the wilting symptom that
you<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.140> at<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.350> top<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.080> see<00:01:46.260> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you see up at the top so we see the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.620 
you see up at the top so we see the
lesions<00:01:46.830> right<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.190> at<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> r5<00:01:47.940> growth<00:01:48.299> stage

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
lesions right now at the r5 growth stage

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.680 
lesions right now at the r5 growth stage
but<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.619> infections<00:01:50.250> actually<00:01:51.210> take<00:01:51.450> place

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
but the infections actually take place

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.140 
but the infections actually take place
earlier<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.950> season<00:01:53.159> during<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.729> R<00:01:53.940> 1
