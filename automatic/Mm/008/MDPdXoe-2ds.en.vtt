00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
batteries I've noticed that it will

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.240 
batteries I've noticed that it will
recharge<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.840> want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> say<00:01:28.650> about<00:01:28.770> two

hours<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> W<00:01:31.170> batteries<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:31.619> still

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
hours and the W batteries will still

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.590 
hours and the W batteries will still
have<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> charge<00:01:32.220> left<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.880> before<00:01:33.329> what<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
have a charge left to it before what a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 
have a charge left to it before what a
reason<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.049> seems<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.470> either<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.250> voltage

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
reason it seems like either the voltage

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.149 
reason it seems like either the voltage
changes<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.470> once<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.560> gets<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> lift<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> little

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
changes or once it gets to lift a little

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.410 
changes or once it gets to lift a little
so<00:01:38.400> many<00:01:38.579> milliamp<00:01:38.939> hours<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.329> your

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
so many milliamp hours and your

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.990 
so many milliamp hours and your
batteries<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.520> doesn't<00:01:41.700> charge

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
batteries here it just doesn't charge

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.399 
batteries here it just doesn't charge
the<00:01:42.119> phone<00:01:42.240> anymore<00:01:42.570> it'll<00:01:42.960> tell<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
only happens I found when the batteries

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.050 
only happens I found when the batteries
were<00:01:50.130> low<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:51.170> again<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.320> use<00:01:52.380> these<00:01:52.590> with

were low so again you can use these with

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.399 
were low so again you can use these with
new<00:01:54.060> double-a<00:01:54.329> batteries<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.780> recommend<00:01:55.229> using

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
new double-a batteries I recommend using

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.060 
new double-a batteries I recommend using
it<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.280> rechargeable<00:01:57.829> side<00:01:58.829> we<00:01:58.920> can

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
it with the rechargeable side we can

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.370 
it with the rechargeable side we can
recharge<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.549> save<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> lot<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.149> money<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
recharge it save a lot of money on the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.649 
recharge it save a lot of money on the
back<00:02:01.530> end<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:03.030> again<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.299> gets<00:02:03.360> really
