00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.210

scissors<00:01:19.570> but<00:01:20.140> this<00:01:20.350> one<00:01:20.590> is<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.770> little<00:01:20.979> bit

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
scissors but this one is a little bit

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.100 
scissors but this one is a little bit
more<00:01:21.399> difficult<00:01:21.940> than<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.240> bicycles<00:01:22.780> in<00:01:22.990> my

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
more difficult than the bicycles in my

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.050 
more difficult than the bicycles in my
opinion<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:24.190> reason<00:01:24.550> for<00:01:24.700> that<00:01:24.759> is<00:01:25.030> because

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
opinion the reason for that is because

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.120 
opinion the reason for that is because
when<00:01:25.539> you<00:01:25.600> do<00:01:25.750> five<00:01:25.990> for<00:01:26.170> scissors<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:27.009> have

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
when you do five for scissors you have

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.919 
when you do five for scissors you have
to<00:01:27.250> hold<00:01:27.490> your<00:01:27.729> legs<00:01:27.909> straight<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.479> that<00:01:28.539> can

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
to hold your legs straight and that can

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.020 
to hold your legs straight and that can
be<00:01:29.020> challenging<00:01:29.200> for<00:01:29.470> some<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.030> after
