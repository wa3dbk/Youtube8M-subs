00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello through youtube I am your friend 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.980
 angel montiel and today yes gentlemen finally 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.070
 they left the unicorns no longer exist 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.610
 this time we have a dragon a dragon 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.770
 Chinese gentlemen who represents the mighty 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.529
 yuxin 3 x 3 speed and I think not 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.980
 need more cover letter this 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.660
 cube that nothing more and nothing less power 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.109
 say openly that the lord 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.430
 colinvers broke the world record with 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.040
 a cube exactly like this one 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.620
 get the good guys get the good thing 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.559
 spirit bears the world record that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.680
 broke Mr. oliver went with a 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.610
 cube of the brand yuxin model three by 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.000
 three yes and I was curious I was pretty 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 curious to know what this cube was like in the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.730
 real life how was I going to get to Mexico to 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.379
 through our link page that you 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.690
 left in the description part of 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.440
 this video so they can 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.420
 see him check it out and it was curious to notice 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.540
 why they broke the world record 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.060
 with this cube and let's be honest to the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.210
 first turns at the first laps 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.130
 we immediately give account because 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.549
 they broke the world record with the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.930
 juke without three for three super smooth twist 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.149
 a brutal but brutal corner cut 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.720
 higher than 47 degrees centigrade 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:37.649
 See how it cuts the corner after 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.020
 of the 47 degrees of inclination is one 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.950
 of the cubes with the largest cut of corners 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.080
 in the history of rubik cubes and the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.590
 truth is that when you take them out one of the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.100
 box comes very very loose is is a cube 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.860
 whose factory setting is very bad and I 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.229
 I pass them as a tip because if you 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.710
 they buy a look without three for three and they 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.690
 comes very loose do not despair no no no 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.540
 do not be bothered the adjustment what 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.960
 quickly and see why 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.300
 pope to not so much but once adjusted and 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.880
 well lubricated the cube stops copying and 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.610
 becomes a beast to break 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.680
 babies see how you have this problem of 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.600
 Turin corner but also good 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.570
 corner twist but I must also be 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.650
 honest influences a lot on the part of the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.960
 adjustment the cube itself has a performance 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.050
 monstrous and it's very good to see how the 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.810
 m layer without any problem turns without 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.630
 clog any other of the layers in the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.930
 simple designs of the cube we can 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.760
 see how the edges are completely 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.490
 rounded those times are over in 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.770
 those that the cubes were square if by 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.040
 ironic that it seems the cubes are no longer 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.959
 squares are now completely 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.700
 rounded in all its parts if 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.770
 we take into account that all the edges 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.650
 they have this form already a semicircle 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.870
 closed we can notice why it has 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.180
 both cut corners the piece of 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.209
 center is a circle completely the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.150
 edges are completely a circle not 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.569
 a half circle and he 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.480
 it's brutal abysmal we dismantled our 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.180
 yuxin three times three we notice their pieces 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.849
 in high fucking definition e 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.489
 immediately we realize that 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.010
 The corner of the design of the 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.530
 pieces of the way long and then we 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.439
 we started asking about the successful 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.079
 that turned out to be putting this little 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:38.420
 tab here to keep the 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.120
 stability of the cubes I think that 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.170
 goes beyond stability I think 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.359
 it's very similar to stopping the corner 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.889
 twist not the corner twist that took away 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.430
 the world record to Felix in his 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:56.150
 moment we see here this design that we 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.489
 grants a double stopper against the pope or 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.730
 I mean this cube is designed to be 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.590
 terribly fast, extremely fast and 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.950
 at the same time your feet are designed 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.260
 so that hamÃ¡s pop has this piece for 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.859
 stop the priest or and then another 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.760
 pill up to make more stable and 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:18.120
 these small and incredible edges that 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.120
 stand out 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.210
 I want us to pay close attention 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.060
 because these edges that highlight these 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.699
 little things that are here help 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.880
 that between the pieces there is no 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:36.870
 significant difference and produces a 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.979
 Exquisite softness in all parts 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.740
 it is a very smooth very fast turn and that is 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.160
 Exclusive model of the juke model without 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.860
 three for three gentlemen we are before the 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.229
 cube of the world record we should not 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.930
 taking it lightly has cost me 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:58.440
 I work pretty hard to get used to him 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.940
 because it is very fast and it seems to turn 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.639
 very fast however there is something in it 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.720
 that personally does not end with me 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.340
 convince me I do not know what is owed maybe 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.860
 if you already have a look without three 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.720
 for three leave me your comments in the 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.850
 in the part down here in the box 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.850
 comments so that to know your 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.010
 opinion about yuxin 3 x 3 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.940
 yes it is very good if you have a cut of 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.830
 brutal corners 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.530
 if they broke the world record with him 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.110
 Yes it is very good but very good but there 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.170
 something that does not end up convincing me 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.160
 time is the custom to always use moi 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.750
 or what has me doubtful but is 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.060
 magnificent and understandable at first sight 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.200
 already first turns because the lord 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.620
 colinvers made 5.25 seconds in his 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.260
 brutal destruction of the record 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.850
 I leave you with our review of the 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.400
 joxin 3 x 3 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.100
 remember we will be here transmitting 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.160
 the best reviews of the cubes more 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.530
 novelties and I am angel montiel and we 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.710
 We see in the following reviews Chau 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.710
 bye
