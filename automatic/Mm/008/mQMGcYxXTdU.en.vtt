sure<00:03:03.930> she<00:03:04.139> would<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.470> what<00:03:04.709> would<00:03:04.859> she<00:03:04.980> be

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010

on<00:03:16.760> Basketball<00:03:17.760> Wives<00:03:18.680> because<00:03:19.680> shake<00:03:20.130> is

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
on Basketball Wives because shake is

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.160 
on Basketball Wives because shake is
really<00:03:20.609> into<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.239> if<00:03:21.359> I<00:03:21.540> was<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.870> stripper

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
really into it and if I was a stripper

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:34.390 
really into it and if I was a stripper
is<00:03:22.440> one<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.799> them<00:03:23.329> she'd<00:03:24.329> probably<00:03:24.660> be<00:03:28.069> worse

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.700 

because<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.580> know<00:03:35.730> was<00:03:36.210> just<00:03:36.320> she's<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:37.350> hot

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
because you know was just she's just hot

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.690 
because you know was just she's just hot
so<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.810> think<00:03:39.810> she<00:03:39.960> can<00:03:40.140> back<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.560> up<00:03:42.650> well

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
so I think she can back it up well

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.250 
so I think she can back it up well
