00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.160 

so<00:01:56.470> here's<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.950> rubber<00:01:57.189> band<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:58.390> realized

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
so here's the rubber band and I realized

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.230 
so here's the rubber band and I realized
after<00:01:59.799> I<00:02:00.159> did<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.460> hairstyle<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.060> I

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
after I did the hairstyle that I

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.120 
after I did the hairstyle that I
probably<00:02:01.540> should<00:02:01.899> have<00:02:01.930> used<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.590> ponytail

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
probably should have used a ponytail

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.630 
probably should have used a ponytail
holder<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:04.060> would<00:02:04.329> have<00:02:04.450> secured<00:02:05.049> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
holder it would have secured the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.010 
holder it would have secured the
ponytail<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.820> bit<00:02:07.090> better<00:02:07.329> than<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.840> rubber

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
ponytail a bit better than the rubber

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.620 
ponytail a bit better than the rubber
band<00:02:08.319> cuz<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.560> rubber<00:02:08.830> band<00:02:09.130> was<00:02:09.640> just<00:02:09.670> too<00:02:10.239> thin

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
band cuz a rubber band was just too thin

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.870 
band cuz a rubber band was just too thin
and<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.929> didn't<00:02:11.260> really<00:02:11.410> secure<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.250> as<00:02:12.400> much

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
and it didn't really secure it as much

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.960 
and it didn't really secure it as much
as<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:13.209> wanted<00:02:13.599> to<00:02:13.840> but<00:02:14.530> after<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.459> see<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
as I wanted to but after you see the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.110 
just kind of tighten the two strand flat
twist<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:31.600> it'll<00:02:31.810> be<00:02:32.370> secure<00:02:33.370> enough<00:02:33.610> to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
twist so that it'll be secure enough to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.150 
twist so that it'll be secure enough to
be<00:02:34.269> in<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.660> top<00:02:34.989> portion<00:02:36.480> ponytail<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:39.040> I'm

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
be in the top portion ponytail so I'm

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.920 
be in the top portion ponytail so I'm
taking<00:02:39.340> another<00:02:39.880> rubber<00:02:40.150> band<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.569> I<00:02:40.660> just

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
taking another rubber band and I just

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.770 
taking another rubber band and I just
doubled<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.470> rubber<00:02:41.680> bands<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.160> make<00:02:42.430> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
doubled the rubber bands to make it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.449 
doubled the rubber bands to make it
thicker<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:44.200> like<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.680> said<00:02:44.739> I<00:02:44.980> probably

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
thicker but like I said I probably

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.030 
thicker but like I said I probably
should've<00:02:45.940> used<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.450> actual<00:02:47.049> ponytail<00:02:47.650> holder

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
should've used a actual ponytail holder

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.320 
should've used a actual ponytail holder
for<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.400> hairstyle

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.740 

and<00:02:56.190> after<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.220> do<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.150> basically

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and after I do that that is basically

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.050 
and after I do that that is basically
the<00:02:59.050> finished<00:02:59.440> product<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.070> just<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.640> double

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
the finished product is just a double

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.240 
the finished product is just a double
ponytail<00:03:01.630> one<00:03:01.900> ponytail<00:03:02.230> on<00:03:02.410> top<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.130> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
ponytail one ponytail on top of the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.060 
ponytail one ponytail on top of the
other<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:04.210> also<00:03:04.420> wanted<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.900> add<00:03:05.230> more

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
other and I also wanted to add more

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.030 
other and I also wanted to add more
bobby<00:03:06.340> pins<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.000> top<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.810> secure<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.860> and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
bobby pins to the top to secure it and

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.150 
bobby pins to the top to secure it and
so<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.910> can<00:03:10.120> make<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.510> flat<00:03:10.840> twist<00:03:11.380> at<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.740> top

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
so it can make the flat twist at the top

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.770 
so it can make the flat twist at the top
look<00:03:12.460> a<00:03:12.670> bit<00:03:13.030> flatter<00:03:15.300> so<00:03:16.300> this<00:03:16.570> is<00:03:16.600> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
look a bit flatter so this is the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.350 
look a bit flatter so this is the
finished<00:03:17.230> product<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.520> hope<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:19.150> guys
