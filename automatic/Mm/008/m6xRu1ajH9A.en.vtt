00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:12.599
 show before, I want to cut 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.690
 For a short time , this is the mark to show 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.640
 I have the whole line here now 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.910
 that's what it's going to be 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.130
 unknown of the pants here that listens 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.259
 Creation blow there we will not 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.239
 because you were just folding like that 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.950
 here only is folded and here on the 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.410
 last money line is cut 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.910
 now it may be that you see that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.280
 maybe a little bit that here 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.920
 pants a bit unevenly 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.190
 but I do these irregularities 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.370
 Do not pants with me , I'll go here 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.090
 six here I have 65 cm and have here 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 I'm 6 again 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.220
 That's a bit of a feeling where I am 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.650
 I think it was more so 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.150
 put it in a straight line 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.520
 I will not necessarily line 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.989
 this bow that is in here 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.399
 also take over in the new cut 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.199
 because in my opinion this is a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.880
 Manufacturing tolerance where people say 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.250
 no problem but I cut 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.750
 just just like that and I head-sitting 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.570
 marked and now I show you how 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.159
 Just make this his ruler 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.380
 how to do that relatively easily on the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.900
 back transmits and indeed beat that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.970
 here always around and you look about 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.790
 that you have such a nice one here 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:29.299
 has parallel stripes and then go 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.299
 I here here so a line there 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.090
 and there on the other side 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.150
 make no mistake here so 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.460
 together 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.100
 slim here so I can together here 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.960
 also mark that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.360
 sometime mark here again 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.659
 Mark the trousers so now 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.010
 turn around then you see I have the ones here 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.470
 whole line and needs only 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:03.450
 connect and have automatically on the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.659
 front and back lines the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.080
 fit together and then 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.080
 can cut or fold can 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.410
 that was it to mark 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.840
 The same thing still has to be done on the second leg 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.190
 happen and then as I said on the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.410
 cut lower edge 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.599
 It can also be when the jeans are just around 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.730
 a trace must be cut that you 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.190
 before the original seam to split 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.019
 you have to because you do not lose so much 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.700
 could be here now here now 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.590
 but if they knew then you 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.040
 would then one would have to forearm on 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.620
 separate 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.360
 and there re-draw only one 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.440
 part of these and of this original 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.440
 saw away
