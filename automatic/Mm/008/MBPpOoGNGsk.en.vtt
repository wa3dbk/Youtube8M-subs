00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
placing down that spawning pool looks

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.039 
placing down that spawning pool looks
like<00:01:39.010> it<00:01:39.100> was<00:01:39.159> pretty<00:01:39.280> quick<00:01:39.610> actually<00:01:40.020> yeah<00:01:41.020> I

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
like it was pretty quick actually yeah I

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.649 
like it was pretty quick actually yeah I
mean<00:01:41.290> it's<00:01:41.549> generally<00:01:42.549> typical<00:01:43.030> nowadays<00:01:43.450> to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
mean it's generally typical nowadays to

they<00:01:45.909> can<00:01:46.150> those<00:01:46.330> drones<00:01:46.799> interestingly<00:01:47.799> are

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
they can those drones interestingly are

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.499 
they can those drones interestingly are
actually<00:01:48.430> quite<00:01:48.580> strong<00:01:49.119> in<00:01:49.150> one-on-one

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
actually quite strong in one-on-one

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.749 
actually quite strong in one-on-one
combat<00:01:49.780> against<00:01:50.409> Marines<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.070> other<00:01:51.310> small

combat against Marines and other small

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.870 
combat against Marines and other small
units<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.979> most<00:01:53.979> players<00:01:54.130> are<00:01:54.460> relying<00:01:54.790> a

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
little bit more on that but neste

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.920
