excuse<00:01:34.770> me<00:01:34.860> these<00:01:34.979> mines<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.540> like<00:01:36.540> four<00:01:36.810> or

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
excuse me these mines and like four or

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.899 
excuse me these mines and like four or
five<00:01:36.990> explosions<00:01:37.740> yet<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.460> still<00:01:38.790> go

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
five explosions yet you know still go

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.850 
five explosions yet you know still go
off<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.329> afterwards<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.650> it's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
off right afterwards so I think it's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.100 
off right afterwards so I think it's
like<00:01:41.009> two<00:01:41.220> or<00:01:41.369> three<00:01:41.400> per<00:01:42.030> proximity<00:01:42.960> mine

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
like two or three per proximity mine

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.050 
like two or three per proximity mine
which<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.350> awesome<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.820> pop

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
which is awesome it's not just one pop

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.569 
which is awesome it's not just one pop
so<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.810> gives<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> lot<00:01:46.409> more<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.280> know

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
so it gives you a lot more it's you know

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.770 
so it gives you a lot more it's you know
kind<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.909> explains<00:01:48.210> why<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.659> only

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
kind of explains why you can only

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.539 
kind of explains why you can only
purchase<00:01:49.020> five<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.649> these<00:01:49.710> things<00:01:50.040> because<00:01:50.220> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
purchase five of these things because I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.859 
purchase five of these things because I
think<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.090> take<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.540> three<00:01:51.720> or<00:01:51.810> four

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
think you can take like three or four

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
think you can take like three or four
vehicles<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:52.860> each<00:01:53.040> single<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.640> i

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
vehicles with each single one so i

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.609 
vehicles with each single one so i
believe<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> launchers<00:01:55.049> around<00:01:55.320> seventy

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
believe the launchers around seventy

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.959 
believe the launchers around seventy
five<00:01:55.710> thousand<00:01:56.250> dollars<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.880> you're

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
five thousand dollars when you're

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.910 
five thousand dollars when you're
playing<00:01:57.149> GTA<00:01:57.509> online<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.079> each<00:01:58.380> proximity

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
playing GTA online and each proximity

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.710 
playing GTA online and each proximity
mines<00:01:59.070> roughly<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> thousand<00:02:00.540> dollars

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
mines roughly a thousand dollars

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.450 
mines roughly a thousand dollars
I<00:02:01.780> believe<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.260> limit<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.650> your<00:02:02.680> launcher<00:02:03.280> is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
I believe the limit to your launcher is

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.850 
I believe the limit to your launcher is
10<00:02:03.760> or<00:02:03.880> 15<00:02:04.300> and<00:02:04.600> for<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.200> mines<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.590> believe

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
10 or 15 and for the mines I believe

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.490 
10 or 15 and for the mines I believe
