the side of the tablet this is running
Android<00:01:11.220> 4.2<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.580> believe<00:01:13.120> and<00:01:13.330> it's<00:01:13.720> got<00:01:13.900> a

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
Android 4.2 I believe and it's got a

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.130 
Android 4.2 I believe and it's got a
quad-core<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:15.040> dual-core<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:16.140> MediaTek

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
quad-core a dual-core a MediaTek

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.649 
quad-core a dual-core a MediaTek
processor<00:01:17.400> let's<00:01:18.400> just<00:01:18.490> check<00:01:18.790> that<00:01:18.970> out<00:01:19.030> back

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
processor let's just check that out back

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.830 
processor let's just check that out back
over<00:01:19.840> here<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.580> what's<00:01:21.700> running<00:01:21.850> android<00:01:22.299> 4.2

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
over here so what's running android 4.2

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.500 
over here so what's running android 4.2
point<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.770> star<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:24.700> actually<00:01:25.030> hoping<00:01:25.330> to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
point to a star is actually hoping to

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.039 
point to a star is actually hoping to
get<00:01:25.720> KitKat<00:01:26.590> onto<00:01:27.010> their<00:01:27.130> devices<00:01:27.430> into<00:01:28.000> q2<00:01:28.299> so

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
get KitKat onto their devices into q2 so

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.800 
get KitKat onto their devices into q2 so
that's<00:01:29.200> when<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.470> can<00:01:29.619> probably<00:01:29.920> expect<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
that's when you can probably expect to

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.780 
that's when you can probably expect to
arrive<00:01:31.930> on<00:01:32.320> this<00:01:32.860> it<00:01:33.040> has<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:33.220> standard

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
arrive on this it has a standard

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.750 
arrive on this it has a standard
definition<00:01:34.330> display<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.470> is<00:01:35.619> IPS<00:01:36.070> with<00:01:36.369> fairly

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
definition display it is IPS with fairly

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.969 
definition display it is IPS with fairly
decent<00:01:37.180> viewing<00:01:37.570> angles<00:01:37.900> around<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.680> bottom

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
decent viewing angles around the bottom

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.640 
decent viewing angles around the bottom
here<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.190> can<00:01:39.400> see<00:01:39.580> we<00:01:39.729> have<00:01:39.760> is<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.780> single

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
here you can see we have is a single

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.649 
here you can see we have is a single
speaker<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.220> there's<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.729> microphone<00:01:43.450> for

speaker and there's the microphone for

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.660 
speaker and there's the microphone for
noise<00:01:43.720> cancelling<00:01:44.380> right<00:01:44.530> over<00:01:44.770> here<00:01:45.070> the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
noise cancelling right over here the

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.789 
noise cancelling right over here the
acer<00:01:45.939> iconia<00:01:46.090> b1<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.689> a<00:01:46.900> budget<00:01:47.350> tablet<00:01:47.680> so

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
acer iconia b1 is a budget tablet so

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.890 
acer iconia b1 is a budget tablet so
it's<00:01:47.920> coming<00:01:48.159> in<00:01:48.250> at<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.400> very<00:01:48.700> budget<00:01:49.060> price<00:01:49.360> so

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
it's coming in at a very budget price so
