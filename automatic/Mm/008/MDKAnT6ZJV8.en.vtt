00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.289
 let's mentally fast forward to 18 years 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.929
 back most likely you involuntarily asked 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.840
 My question is what should I do there? 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:22.210
 the times of my early childhood or then 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.250
 I did not have exactly September 30 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.440
 In 1997, the first part was published. 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.320
 legendary post apocalyptic rpg 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.170
 fallout series designed by a black 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.600
 and asturias in the introductory video to us 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.390
 tell the background of the game war for 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.800
 oil residues between China and the United States 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.520
 ended by mutual massed 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.160
 by nuclear strikes in 2077 a large 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.200
 part of the population of the world died out however 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.660
 some Americans still managed 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.480
 survive in shelters each one 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.149
 accommodated about a thousand people after order 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.200
 in shelters watched rangers operation 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.079
 fallout 1 takes place in 2161 and 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.420
 covers southern california our main 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.970
 the hero is one of the inhabitants of the asylum 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.729
 13 according to the asylum plan should open 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.010
 only 200 years after the war but 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.110
 due to lack of water, the caretaker instructs 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.570
 our hero to come to the surface 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.400
 find a water chip so as a shelter 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.100
 there were no contacts with the outside world 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.200
 the caretaker sent the refugee 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.260
 the only known place on the map 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.700
 haven 15 by the time being 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.630
 chip limited 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.580
 we are given 150 days or 250 cases if 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.650
 the main character will be able to negotiate with 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.290
 merchants about water supply and shelter 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.840
 one of the most important features of the game 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.390
 its subject is called 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.310
 futurism reader retro futurism this 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.710
 term which means submission 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.560
 people of the fifties sixties on 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.079
 future 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.790
 and this is so because despite the fact that 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.920
 game actions take place in the distant 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.009
 future environment is too much like 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.570
 America 50s at the very beginning us 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.119
 provide an opportunity to create your 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.009
 character give him the name bti distribute 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.679
 characteristics or choose from three 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.810
 available coming out of the refuge you are free 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.330
 explore the vast game world and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.209
 the only restriction will be those 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.590
 150 days in search of a chip moving 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.650
 between locations in the game is carried out 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.069
 using the card initially to the player 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.970
 known location 2 haven 13 and 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.250
 15 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.739
 but in the course of the game we will discover everything 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.200
 more and more locations also during 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.690
 traveling through the wastelands can stumble 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.810
 to random events and characters from 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.549
 ordinary merchants to aggressive 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.709
 super mutants with miniguns in cities 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.930
 you can communicate with the residents thereby 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.480
 learn from them what is happening around and 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.549
 receive quests from them quests in this 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.580
 the game is nothing during their passage 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.860
 you will have a pretty hard time but 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.500
 not the fact that you will be able to pass this or 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.630
 another task now is the internet 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.519
 but when he was for the elect 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.920
 had to look for a passage in 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.250
 special books and gaming magazines 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.019
 if the game was given to you by a friend with probability 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.260
 80 percent of his home phone 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.850
 torn from your calls oh yes quests 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.700
 also have several ways 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.440
 passing a great help to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.989
 restart the game is n't it 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.540
 fallout very ambiguous mechanics 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.790
 the game on the locations occurs in real 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.350
 time with the help of pi battle can 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.810
 ride out a certain period 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.180
 time when moving between locations 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.549
 game menu accelerated battles go to 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.220
 step by step the one who start the fight 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.410
 get the first turn advantage 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.109
 Further, the sequence of the game is determined 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.519
 character action derivative 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.889
 characteristic hurry 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.590
 the player is able to conduct a normal attack 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.870
 either he can aim and hit at 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.239
 certain part of the opponent's body 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.670
 some weapons have several 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.590
 attack modes for example automata can 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.569
 shoot a single shot or 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.760
 the queue 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.900
 the game presents the player with a large list 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.569
 of opportunities 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.670
 you can search cabinets tables corpses 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.189
 people and animals can try 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.980
 rob any character can 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:12.230
 trade with characters any creature 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.170
 can be attacked with both fists and 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.030
 weapons even on any character can 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.340
 use different objects with 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.410
 certain consequences for example 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.840
 if you use alcohol on a person 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.630
 drink then his perception will decrease 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.400
 thereby making it easier to rob your 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.830
 character develops as 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.320
 gaining experience points which are given 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.340
 for completing quests getting important 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.889
 information 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.639
 successful application of skills and for any 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.740
 murder 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.470
 when the refugee gets 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.509
 regular level his health points 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.490
 points are also increased which 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.979
 can be spent on improving skills 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.380
 every three or four levels player 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.210
 can choose special perks which 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.669
 improve quality and ability 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.009
 character can not fail to note the system 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.900
 karma characterization of the hero who 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.060
 varies depending on perfect 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.580
 the hero of action at the beginning of the game on 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.770
 neutral during quests 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.259
 the player gets a moral choice 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.120
 what to do in any given situation 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:14.240
 complete with confidence we can say 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.759
 that fallout is the perfect lpg which 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.039
 It gives the player the freedom to pass acts 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.380
 which you can not do about what 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.400
 modern role-playing games remains only 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:31.840
