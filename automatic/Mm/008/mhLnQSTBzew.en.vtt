take<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:17.930> gears<00:00:18.170> off<00:00:18.410> and<00:00:18.650> show<00:00:18.770> you<00:00:18.890> how<00:00:19.010> it

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
take the gears off and show you how it

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.050 
take the gears off and show you how it
works<00:00:19.280> yeah<00:00:19.850> are<00:00:20.090> the<00:00:20.539> L<00:00:20.720> AM<00:00:21.039> five<00:00:22.039> and<00:00:22.520> fifteen

works yeah are the L AM five and fifteen

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.970 
works yeah are the L AM five and fifteen
pound<00:00:23.390> stuffers<00:00:24.230> are<00:00:25.420> essentially<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:26.600> same

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
pound stuffers are essentially the same

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.040 
pound stuffers are essentially the same
just<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.100> little<00:00:28.580> bigger<00:00:28.699> in<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:28.910> other<00:00:29.060> but<00:00:29.960> I

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
just a little bigger in the other but I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.639 
just a little bigger in the other but I
want<00:00:30.260> to<00:00:30.350> show<00:00:30.500> you<00:00:30.560> how<00:00:30.859> to<00:00:31.430> change<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.000> gears

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
want to show you how to change the gears

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.680 
want to show you how to change the gears
on<00:00:33.649> these<00:00:34.239> periodically<00:00:35.239> they<00:00:35.750> slipper<00:00:36.500> or

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
on these periodically they slipper or

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.280 
on these periodically they slipper or
pop<00:00:38.690> for<00:00:38.930> some<00:00:38.960> reason<00:00:39.910> and<00:00:41.020> people<00:00:42.020> seem<00:00:42.260> to

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
pop for some reason and people seem to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.410 
pop for some reason and people seem to
struggle<00:00:42.860> with<00:00:43.040> how<00:00:43.700> to<00:00:43.730> change<00:00:44.149> them<00:00:44.390> so

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
struggle with how to change them so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.120 
struggle with how to change them so
we're<00:00:45.260> going<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.410> go<00:00:45.559> through<00:00:45.800> that<00:00:45.950> procedure

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
we're going to go through that procedure

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.200 
we're going to go through that procedure
today<00:00:46.960> I've<00:00:48.250> removed<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.370> couple<00:00:49.670> pieces<00:00:49.850> off

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
today I've removed a couple pieces off

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.110 
today I've removed a couple pieces off
of<00:00:50.390> this<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.840> simplify<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.649> procedure<00:00:52.120> but

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
of this to simplify the procedure but

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.690 
of this to simplify the procedure but
basically<00:00:53.770> everything<00:00:54.770> has<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.370> come<00:00:55.399> out

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
basically everything has to come out

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:23.310 
basically everything has to come out
through<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:55.940> bottom<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:57.290> have<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.800> take

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.889 

and<00:01:24.320> it's<00:01:25.130> easiest<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:26.030> slide<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:26.690> out

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
and it's easiest just to slide this out

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.870 
and it's easiest just to slide this out
now<00:01:27.740> I've<00:01:27.979> taken<00:01:28.340> off<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:30.430> piston<00:01:31.430> down<00:01:31.640> here

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
now I've taken off the piston down here

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.240 
now I've taken off the piston down here
just<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.299> simplify<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.840> for<00:01:33.229> today<00:01:33.380> remember

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
just to simplify this for today remember

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.770 
just to simplify this for today remember
the<00:01:34.399> piston<00:01:34.759> would<00:01:34.880> be<00:01:35.030> on<00:01:35.149> there<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:35.630> that

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
the piston would be on there but that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.600 
the piston would be on there but that
should<00:01:36.170> slide<00:01:36.530> right<00:01:36.560> off<00:01:36.830> with<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.220> piston

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
should slide right off with the piston

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.670 
should slide right off with the piston
out<00:01:37.729> of<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:37.970> this<00:01:38.479> is<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.810> shaft<00:01:39.049> that<00:01:39.350> we<00:01:39.500> have

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
out of it this is the shaft that we have

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.340 
out of it this is the shaft that we have
to<00:01:39.920> get<00:01:40.039> off<00:01:40.190> now<00:01:40.580> you'll<00:01:41.509> notice<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:42.050> shaft

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
to get off now you'll notice this shaft

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.609 
to get off now you'll notice this shaft
has<00:01:42.649> a<00:01:42.679> groove<00:01:43.039> down<00:01:43.069> it<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:43.929> it<00:01:44.929> stops<00:01:45.289> right

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
has a groove down it and it stops right

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.749 
has a groove down it and it stops right
here<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:47.899> can't<00:01:48.259> go<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:48.979> way<00:01:49.159> because<00:01:49.429> it

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
here so you can't go that way because it

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.279 
here so you can't go that way because it
will<00:01:49.850> catch<00:01:50.030> in<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.300> gears<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:50.750> has<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:51.110> come

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
will catch in the gears it has to come

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.430 
will catch in the gears it has to come
down<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:52.399> this<00:01:53.240> can<00:01:53.420> be<00:01:53.569> done<00:01:53.600> simply<00:01:54.110> by

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
down and this can be done simply by

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.639 
down and this can be done simply by
cranking<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.240> mechanism<00:01:56.240> down<00:01:59.500> and<00:02:00.500> you

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
cranking the mechanism down and you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.200 
cranking the mechanism down and you
should<00:02:00.830> see<00:02:01.039> it's<00:02:01.220> going<00:02:01.549> down<00:02:01.729> into<00:02:02.119> the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
should see it's going down into the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.889 
should see it's going down into the
gears<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:04.700> should<00:02:04.909> fall<00:02:05.149> off<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.539> bottom

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
gears and it should fall off the bottom

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:20.530 
gears and it should fall off the bottom
here<00:02:06.049> personally

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.720 

and<00:02:20.959> screw<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.439> and<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:21.980> can<00:02:22.159> see<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.610> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
and screw it and you can see that the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.550 
and screw it and you can see that the
groove<00:02:23.030> onthis<00:02:23.299> goes<00:02:23.810> all<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.110> way<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.379> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
groove onthis goes all the way to the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.500 
groove onthis goes all the way to the
top<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:25.400> stops<00:02:25.640> at<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:25.939> bottom<00:02:26.299> and<00:02:26.420> that's

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
top the stops at the bottom and that's

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.569 
top the stops at the bottom and that's
why<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.290> come<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.650> way<00:02:27.709> now<00:02:28.400> your

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
why you have to come this way now your

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.710 
why you have to come this way now your
gears<00:02:28.879> are<00:02:29.269> simply<00:02:29.959> set<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.439> here<00:02:30.879> your<00:02:31.879> larger

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
gears are simply set in here your larger

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.149 
gears are simply set in here your larger
gear<00:02:32.989> has<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:34.430> brass<00:02:34.790> bushing<00:02:35.890> or<00:02:36.890> if<00:02:36.980> you're<00:02:37.129> on

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
gear has a brass bushing or if you're on

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.430 
gear has a brass bushing or if you're on
the<00:02:37.340> top<00:02:37.549> of<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.849> and<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:38.629> takes<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.049> brunt

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
the top of it and this takes the brunt

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.589 
the top of it and this takes the brunt
of<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.099> of<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.879> thrust<00:02:41.209> when<00:02:41.450> you're

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
of the of the thrust when you're

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.910 
of the of the thrust when you're
stopping<00:02:43.599> your<00:02:44.599> arms<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:45.049> little<00:02:45.170> gear<00:02:45.500> simply

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
stopping your arms a little gear simply

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.440 
stopping your arms a little gear simply
slides<00:02:46.250> out<00:02:47.440> there<00:02:48.440> is<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.650> nylon<00:02:49.579> bushing<00:02:50.209> that

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
slides out there is a nylon bushing that

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.720 
slides out there is a nylon bushing that
fits<00:02:51.200> in<00:02:51.379> here<00:02:51.560> like<00:02:51.769> that<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:52.519> see

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
fits in here like that and you can see

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.720 
fits in here like that and you can see
the<00:02:52.879> end<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.239> right<00:02:53.269> there<00:02:54.730> occasionally

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the end of it right there occasionally

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.379 
the end of it right there occasionally
this<00:02:56.720> will<00:02:57.049> require<00:02:57.379> a<00:02:57.530> spacer<00:02:58.430> which<00:02:59.150> will

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
this will require a spacer which will

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.030 
this will require a spacer which will
move<00:02:59.659> this<00:03:00.579> this<00:03:01.720> gear<00:03:02.720> over<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.409> the<00:03:03.560> left<00:03:03.769> and

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
move this this gear over to the left and

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.740 
move this this gear over to the left and
force<00:03:04.609> it<00:03:04.790> into<00:03:05.889> the<00:03:07.090> large<00:03:08.090> gear<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.480> little

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
force it into the large gear a little

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.390 
force it into the large gear a little
bit<00:03:08.870> further<00:03:09.139> and<00:03:09.379> if<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.560> put<00:03:09.769> it<00:03:09.889> up<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.190> on

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
bit further and if you put it up that on

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.190 
bit further and if you put it up that on
there<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.819> can<00:03:11.000> see<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.450> disc<00:03:11.659> is<00:03:11.870> stitched

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
there you can see the disc is stitched

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.050 
there you can see the disc is stitched
further<00:03:12.470> over<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.859> the<00:03:12.950> left<00:03:13.159> now<00:03:13.639> this<00:03:13.790> unit

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
further over to the left now this unit

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.819 
further over to the left now this unit
doesn't<00:03:14.540> need<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:14.989> I'm<00:03:15.139> going<00:03:15.409> to<00:03:15.470> take<00:03:15.650> it

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
doesn't need it so I'm going to take it

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.490 
doesn't need it so I'm going to take it
back<00:03:16.010> off<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:17.329> I'll<00:03:17.510> show<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.840> how<00:03:18.019> they<00:03:18.290> have

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
back off and I'll show you how they have

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.399 
back off and I'll show you how they have
to<00:03:18.680> be<00:03:18.709> aligned<00:03:19.450> okay<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:20.750> let's<00:03:20.959> put<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:21.230> back

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
to be aligned okay so let's put it back

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.809 
to be aligned okay so let's put it back
together<00:03:21.590> here<00:03:22.069> we're<00:03:22.250> going<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.400> set<00:03:22.670> this

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
together here we're going to set this

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:32.099 
together here we're going to set this
gear<00:03:23.090> in<00:03:23.329> here<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.699> then<00:03:25.699> we're<00:03:25.910> going<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.239> run

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.610 

up<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.290> rod<00:03:33.500> back<00:03:33.739> up<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:35.120> get<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.359> aligned<00:03:35.629> it

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
up the rod back up to get it aligned it

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.569 
up the rod back up to get it aligned it
was<00:03:36.799> running<00:03:36.980> up<00:03:37.129> so<00:03:37.370> far<00:03:38.500> by<00:03:39.500> hand<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:40.250> then

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
was running up so far by hand and then

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.330 
was running up so far by hand and then
it<00:03:40.879> has<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.930> line<00:03:42.139> up<00:03:42.349> with<00:03:42.379> that<00:03:42.590> key<00:03:43.069> way

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
it has to line up with that key way

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.080 
it has to line up with that key way
right<00:03:43.639> there<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.389> once<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:46.609> groom<00:03:46.910> is

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
right there so once the the groom is

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.000 
right there so once the the groom is
lined<00:03:47.359> up<00:03:47.510> with<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.959> with<00:03:48.319> the<00:03:48.440> shaft<00:03:48.650> you

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
lined up with the with the shaft you

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.280 
lined up with the with the shaft you
simply<00:03:49.639> continue<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.480> twist<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:53.629> sometimes

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
simply continue to twist and sometimes

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.240 
simply continue to twist and sometimes
it<00:03:54.440> catches<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.859> little<00:03:55.010> bit<00:03:55.220> coming<00:03:55.430> through

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
it catches a little bit coming through

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.710 
it catches a little bit coming through
reduce<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.560> handle<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.910> you'll<00:04:00.240> see<00:04:00.510> the

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
reduce the the handle and you'll see the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.040 
reduce the the handle and you'll see the
shaft<00:04:01.250> back<00:04:02.250> through<00:04:02.520> that<00:04:02.670> Center<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.570> you

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
shaft back through that Center and you

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.780 
shaft back through that Center and you
use<00:04:04.290> or<00:04:04.590> put<00:04:04.770> back<00:04:04.950> together<00:04:05.130> now<00:04:05.520> what's

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
use or put back together now what's

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.090 
use or put back together now what's
critical<00:04:06.330> in<00:04:06.480> this<00:04:06.630> process<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.890> this

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
critical in this process is that this

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.820 
critical in this process is that this
gear<00:04:08.460> here<00:04:09.110> meshes<00:04:10.460> with<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:12.390> big<00:04:12.570> gear<00:04:12.900> yes

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
gear here meshes with the big gear yes

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.640 
gear here meshes with the big gear yes
where<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:15.000> two<00:04:15.330> gears<00:04:15.570> come<00:04:15.959> together<00:04:16.109> where

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
where the two gears come together where

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.440 
where the two gears come together where
they<00:04:16.769> where<00:04:17.040> they<00:04:17.070> start<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.519> battle<00:04:17.850> if<00:04:18.239> you

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
they where they start to battle if you

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.740 
they where they start to battle if you
push<00:04:19.170> that<00:04:19.200> in<00:04:19.620> too<00:04:19.890> far<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:20.579> gear<00:04:21.299> will<00:04:21.570> not

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
push that in too far that gear will not

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.290 
push that in too far that gear will not
work<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.290> will<00:04:22.350> Clank<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.460> bang<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:24.030> just

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
work it will Clank and bang and just

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.450 
work it will Clank and bang and just
tear<00:04:24.540> everything<00:04:24.840> up<00:04:25.110> if<00:04:25.560> it's<00:04:25.770> off<00:04:25.950> too<00:04:26.190> far

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
tear everything up if it's off too far

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.180 
tear everything up if it's off too far
it<00:04:26.820> will<00:04:26.970> actually<00:04:27.210> see<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.830> skipping

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
it will actually see it and and skipping

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.210 
it will actually see it and and skipping
tooth<00:04:29.520> during<00:04:29.760> during<00:04:30.350> stuffing<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.500> then

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
tooth during during stuffing and then

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.240 
tooth during during stuffing and then
you'll<00:04:32.460> destroy<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.120> gear<00:04:33.300> now<00:04:34.260> put<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.220> back

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
you'll destroy the gear now put it back

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.400 
you'll destroy the gear now put it back
together<00:04:35.550> is<00:04:36.060> simply<00:04:36.450> a<00:04:36.480> matter<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:36.930> reversing

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
together is simply a matter of reversing

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.480 
together is simply a matter of reversing
what<00:04:37.860> we<00:04:38.160> did<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.490> take<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:38.820> apart<00:04:40.010> put<00:04:41.010> it<00:04:41.190> back

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
what we did to take it apart put it back

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.940 
what we did to take it apart put it back
in<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:42.180> it's<00:04:42.390> not<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.810> bottom<00:04:43.169> and<00:04:43.470> and
