00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.750
 hello you remember the madness 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.510
 performance by stefan trautner at 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.950
 mountain diet where he as a pilgrim 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.140
 the sidecar legend claus 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.930
 KlaffenbÃ¶ck won the race 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.330
 I have in other visitors shows he 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.060
 us with his driver josef saddler like 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.020
 a f1 team is set up and how to 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.020
 so that is fast 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.220
 the sidecar is ahead for itself 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.770
 a skilled motorsport fan one 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.350
 Special challenge not motorcycle 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.620
 not formula cars a merge of 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.170
 two worlds of racing one gets 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.240
 a motor of a thousand and screwed 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.460
 all around the technology a sports car 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.210
 However, prototypes do without this 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.340
 fourth wheel 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.790
 so that the whole looks flat 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.890
 pressed the motorcycle with sidecar 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.010
 strange construction this three lane 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.710
 rocket performance verne motorcycle 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.160
 braking forces like a car pulling up speed 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.930
 like a dtm bolide but let's josef 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.930
 tell silly his story 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.620
 we demand international german 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.600
 championship in the period 1 thereby proved 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.610
 I am now through the company years 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.540
 yourself to this result in a fast 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:52.080
 about ammo the keywords like 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:57.210
 we provide for disposal arouse 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.430
 ask technical side looks 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.600
 so far very good 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.670
 The material is a monocoque chassis 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.890
 from airplane aluminum 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.649
 It consists of the main shaft with and 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.479
 integrated children in the middle then goes the 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.450
 main space of the partially rearwardly as 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.610
 represented behind it is neither take 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.230
 including redirection it was actually 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.050
 the whole story is our main one 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.530
 creates and makes rain to the sidecar this 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.000
 student shaft the air is beginning 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.000
 that is not good 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.140
 The bottom outlet is at the front of two 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.010
 astonishingly well , you can do that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.800
 handlebars need 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.690
 It also works on the brake you can 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.430
 Of course, by influencing the radl 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.890
 simply the most recent example right course 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.840
 or left course is then you can 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:53.350
 of course the profit stable 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 For example, if we are in a right turn on the 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.430
 brake then it is very stable ones 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.980
 then overtaken by the brake 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.700
 so was the weight of the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.590
 left side 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.900
 I found that to overtake that is 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.930
 right now than in the past across the 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.720
 common and immediately be on the gas that you 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.489
 again other post on the rear wheel left 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.230
 over is exactly the opposite there you have gas 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.200
 give that the two the weight behind 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.810
 even more accurate one 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.420
 asking price there so before the of 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.239
 the axis trainer writes weekdays 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.709
 slow down more 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.080
 I think I'm west of the other one 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.560
 what all the passenger tomorrow is all about 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.470
 Now it is important to you why this is important 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.810
 drive straight ahead why is it about the 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.480
 But walking now shows us stephan 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.480
 which indicates prepared as a passenger 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.290
 for help 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:12.420
 He just brakes his hands on mine 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.420
 goodness that the delay 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.870
 the legs 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.330
 you still have to brake in front of you 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.740
 right curves 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:39.060
 The court demands that he offer grip 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:44.120
 Curve exit straight back to brakes 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.120
 again left curve says 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.110
 so who wants to ride there times
