00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
good day ladies and gentlemen I'm Tom

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.919 
good day ladies and gentlemen I'm Tom
and<00:00:02.340> today<00:00:02.370> I<00:00:02.730> want<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.060> talk<00:00:03.210> about<00:00:03.389> printer

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
and today I want to talk about printer

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.900 
and today I want to talk about printer
calibration<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.009> especially<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.700> the

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
calibration and especially about the

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.089 
calibration and especially about the
ways<00:00:06.060> that<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.509> can<00:00:06.690> screw<00:00:06.930> things<00:00:07.080> up<00:00:07.350> now

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
ways that you can screw things up now

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.879 
ways that you can screw things up now
first<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.790> all<00:00:08.880> let<00:00:09.269> me<00:00:09.360> take<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.570> step<00:00:09.809> back<00:00:09.889> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
first of all let me take a step back the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.650 
first of all let me take a step back the
RepRap<00:00:11.160> project<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.910> there<00:00:12.179> for<00:00:12.360> pretty<00:00:12.540> much

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
RepRap project and there for pretty much

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.749 
RepRap project and there for pretty much
the<00:00:12.750> entire<00:00:12.960> hobby<00:00:13.740> grade<00:00:14.009> 3d<00:00:14.400> printing

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
the entire hobby grade 3d printing

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.029 
the entire hobby grade 3d printing
market<00:00:15.120> started<00:00:15.809> out<00:00:15.929> as<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.170> dive<00:00:16.529> into<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
market started out as a dive into the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.550 
market started out as a dive into the
unknown<00:00:17.210> nobody<00:00:18.210> had<00:00:18.359> done<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.630> before<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:19.470> was

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
unknown nobody had done it before it was

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.349 
unknown nobody had done it before it was
basically<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> idea<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.609> hey<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.210> is

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
basically the idea of hey this is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.330 
basically the idea of hey this is
something<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.020> absolutely<00:00:22.199> doable<00:00:22.830> now

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
something that is absolutely doable now

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.429 
something that is absolutely doable now
that<00:00:23.550> patents<00:00:24.029> are<00:00:24.119> gone<00:00:24.330> without<00:00:24.840> anybody

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
that patents are gone without anybody

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.529 
that patents are gone without anybody
really<00:00:25.740> being<00:00:25.920> afraid<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.820> complexity<00:00:27.510> of

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
really being afraid of the complexity of

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.759 
really being afraid of the complexity of
the<00:00:27.900> entire<00:00:28.170> project

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the entire project

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.740 
the entire project
so<00:00:29.310> people<00:00:29.849> started<00:00:30.179> building<00:00:30.390> these

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
so people started building these

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.930 
so people started building these
monstrosities<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.710> 3d<00:00:31.949> printers<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.550> were

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
monstrosities of 3d printers that were

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.120 
monstrosities of 3d printers that were
the<00:00:33.239> RepRap<00:00:33.600> Darwin<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.290> later<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.800> cells

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
the RepRap Darwin and later the cells

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.880 
the RepRap Darwin and later the cells
and<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.730> first<00:00:36.000> pressure<00:00:36.360> metal<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.620> they

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and the first pressure metal and as they

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.530 
and the first pressure metal and as they
ran<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.250> problems<00:00:38.730> they<00:00:38.969> came<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.510> with

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
ran into problems they came up with

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.900 
ran into problems they came up with
impromptu<00:00:40.110> solutions<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.070> many<00:00:41.850> of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
impromptu solutions to them many of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.459 
impromptu solutions to them many of
these<00:00:42.059> solutions<00:00:42.360> are<00:00:42.690> still<00:00:42.960> being<00:00:43.170> passed

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
these solutions are still being passed

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.709 
these solutions are still being passed
around<00:00:43.680> today<00:00:44.160> even<00:00:44.550> though<00:00:44.820> there<00:00:45.149> were<00:00:45.300> only

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
around today even though there were only

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.869 
around today even though there were only
really<00:00:46.050> intended<00:00:46.500> clutches<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.730> your

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
really intended clutches to get your

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
really intended clutches to get your
print<00:00:48.180> quality<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:49.050> parts<00:00:49.440> from

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
print quality and your parts from

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.310 
print quality and your parts from
unusable<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.539> bad<00:00:51.719> compared<00:00:52.260> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
unusable to really bad compared to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.889 
unusable to really bad compared to
today's<00:00:52.710> standards<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.430> they<00:00:54.300> still<00:00:54.629> work

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
today's standards but they still work

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.750 
today's standards but they still work
for<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.559> case<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.309> must<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.670> good

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
for that one case so they must be good

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.569 
for that one case so they must be good
right<00:00:57.090> well<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.410> much<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> these

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
right well not so much one of these

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.189 
right well not so much one of these
clutches<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.239> would<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.840> finally

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
clutches that I would like to finally

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.990 
clutches that I would like to finally
put<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> rest<00:01:01.739> today<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> process<00:01:02.910> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
put to rest today is the process of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.329 
put to rest today is the process of
calibrating<00:01:03.870> your<00:01:04.379> steps<00:01:04.860> per<00:01:05.070> millimeter

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
calibrating your steps per millimeter

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.820 
calibrating your steps per millimeter
setting<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.090> any<00:01:06.299> axis<00:01:06.689> other<00:01:07.020> than<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
setting for any axis other than the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.280 
setting for any axis other than the
extruder<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> usual<00:01:09.479> process<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
extruder now the usual process for that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
extruder now the usual process for that
involves<00:01:10.920> printing<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.460> 10<00:01:11.760> millimeter<00:01:12.030> test

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
involves printing a 10 millimeter test

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.020 
involves printing a 10 millimeter test
cube<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.020> adjusting<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.560> firmers<00:01:14.159> XY

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
cube and then adjusting the firmers XY

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
cube and then adjusting the firmers XY
and<00:01:15.450> often<00:01:15.869> also<00:01:15.990> z<00:01:16.380> steps<00:01:16.680> per<00:01:16.920> millimeter

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and often also z steps per millimeter

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.910 
and often also z steps per millimeter
values<00:01:17.820> until<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.810> cube<00:01:19.170> measures<00:01:19.560> exactly

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

doesn't already sound wrong to you well
let<00:01:29.159> me<00:01:29.280> bring<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> car<00:01:29.909> analogy<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.630> know

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
let me bring in a car analogy I know

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.630 
let me bring in a car analogy I know
some<00:01:31.350> people<00:01:31.619> hate<00:01:31.770> those<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.520> know

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
some people hate those but you know

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.600 
some people hate those but you know
haters<00:01:33.090> got<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> say<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.500> drive<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.829> car<00:01:35.040> most<00:01:35.430> of

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
haters got a say you drive a car most of

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.640 
haters got a say you drive a car most of
us<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.630> notice<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.500> always

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
us do and you notice that it always

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.340 
us do and you notice that it always
seems<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.070> pull<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> left<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.350> obviously

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
seems to pull to the left so obviously

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
seems to pull to the left so obviously
you<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.130> doing<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.729> makes

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you just is doing because that makes

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
you just is doing because that makes

might actually be a valid idea to
calibrate<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.980> steps<00:03:26.250> per<00:03:26.549> millimeter<00:03:26.880> for

X&amp;Y since like I said half a percent is
going<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.750> make<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> noticeable<00:03:31.230> difference<00:03:31.560> in
