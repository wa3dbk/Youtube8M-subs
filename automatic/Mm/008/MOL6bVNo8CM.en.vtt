okay I'm gonna make this video for every
Barbie<00:00:06.120> 20<00:00:06.629> owner<00:00:07.160> that<00:00:08.160> has<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.910> power<00:00:09.150> FC<00:00:09.960> that

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
Barbie 20 owner that has a power FC that

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.709 
Barbie 20 owner that has a power FC that
won't<00:00:10.830> work

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
won't work

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.289 
won't work
this<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.900> what<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.110> had<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.769> just<00:00:14.340> finally<00:00:14.759> got<00:00:14.969> it

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
this is what I had I just finally got it

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.740 
this is what I had I just finally got it
started<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:16.170> doing<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:17.090> you<00:00:18.090> know<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.390> Idol

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
started it's doing the you know the Idol

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.700 
started it's doing the you know the Idol
the<00:00:18.840> ten<00:00:19.050> minute<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.500> told<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> ten<00:00:20.460> minute

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
the ten minute I told and the ten minute

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.099 
the ten minute I told and the ten minute
AC<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.490> ten<00:00:23.699> minute<00:00:24.000> rear<00:00:24.150> defrost

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.290 

she's<00:00:28.109> finally<00:00:28.439> working<00:00:29.240> what<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.269> had<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.689> do

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
she's finally working what I had to do

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.770 
she's finally working what I had to do
was<00:00:33.300> take<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.780> jumper<00:00:34.290> wire<00:00:34.530> from<00:00:35.090> pen<00:00:36.090> 58

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
was take this jumper wire from pen 58

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.619 
was take this jumper wire from pen 58
which<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:39.800> and<00:00:40.800> 58<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.730> battery<00:00:42.300> power<00:00:42.930> supply

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
which is and 58 is battery power supply

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
which is and 58 is battery power supply
because<00:00:45.629> when<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:45.989> was<00:00:46.320> trying<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.890> reader

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
because when I was trying the reader

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
because when I was trying the reader
here<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:47.789> only<00:00:48.030> saying<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.570> six<00:00:48.899> bolts<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
here was only saying like six bolts and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.639 
here was only saying like six bolts and
my<00:00:49.980> power<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:51.000> seat<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.600> my<00:00:51.750> ABC<00:00:52.469> are

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
my power of seat here my ABC are

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.540 
my power of seat here my ABC are
wouldn't<00:00:53.070> turn<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.809> ran<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.500> wire

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.020 

the<00:00:58.940> positive

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
the positive

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.390 
the positive
the<00:01:01.750> only<00:01:01.900> problem<00:01:02.440> is<00:01:02.560> with<00:01:02.800> that<00:01:02.830> is<00:01:03.340> that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
the only problem is with that is that

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.620 
the only problem is with that is that
the<00:01:03.760> hand<00:01:04.410> commander<00:01:05.910> stays<00:01:06.910> on<00:01:07.240> when<00:01:07.510> the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
the hand commander stays on when the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.490 
the hand commander stays on when the
cars<00:01:07.900> not<00:01:08.200> off<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:10.230> obviously<00:01:11.230> there's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
cars not off so obviously there's

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.590 
cars not off so obviously there's
something<00:01:11.950> wrong<00:01:12.070> with<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.340> main<00:01:12.490> power<00:01:13.420> wire

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
something wrong with the main power wire

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.950 
something wrong with the main power wire
so<00:01:14.440> maybe<00:01:14.650> we'll<00:01:14.860> just<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:16.270> if<00:01:16.300> we<00:01:16.420> can<00:01:16.510> run<00:01:16.840> it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
so maybe we'll just see if we can run it

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.070 
so maybe we'll just see if we can run it
to<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.110> toggle<00:01:17.500> switch<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:19.600> something<00:01:19.780> like

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
to a toggle switch or something like

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.110 
to a toggle switch or something like
that<00:01:20.140> so<00:01:20.650> just<00:01:20.920> flip<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.400> switch<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.910> start

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
that so just flip the switch and start

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.770 
that so just flip the switch and start
the<00:01:22.270> car

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
the car

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.710 
the car
but<00:01:23.530> I'm<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:24.640> happy<00:01:24.880> because<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:25.420> finally

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
but I'm so happy because it's finally

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.470 
but I'm so happy because it's finally
running<00:01:26.110> I<00:01:28.200> ordered<00:01:29.200> some<00:01:29.530> GTR<00:01:30.310> injectors<00:01:31.060> and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
running I ordered some GTR injectors and

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.420 
running I ordered some GTR injectors and
I'm<00:01:32.020> going<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.200> show<00:01:32.410> you<00:01:32.470> how<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.770> install

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
I'm going to show you how to install

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.260 
I'm going to show you how to install
them<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:35.650> also<00:01:35.830> instead<00:01:36.400> of<00:01:36.460> using<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.850> GTR

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
them and I also instead of using a GTR

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.810 
them and I also instead of using a GTR
resistor<00:01:37.869> pack<00:01:38.110> I'm<00:01:38.440> using<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.950> six-cylinder

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
resistor pack I'm using a six-cylinder

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.600 
resistor pack I'm using a six-cylinder
onto<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.330> cord<00:01:40.690> resistor<00:01:41.260> pack<00:01:41.470> show<00:01:42.400> you<00:01:42.460> how

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
onto a cord resistor pack show you how

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.640 
onto a cord resistor pack show you how
to<00:01:42.670> wire<00:01:42.910> that<00:01:43.210> in<00:01:43.530> we're<00:01:44.530> also<00:01:44.650> getting<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.220> a

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
to wire that in we're also getting a a

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:55.290 
to wire that in we're also getting a a
brand<00:01:47.650> new<00:01:47.890> manifold<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.800> GT<00:01:50.800> 35<00:01:51.430> turbo<00:01:54.300> and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
brand new manifold and a GT 35 turbo and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.180 
brand new manifold and a GT 35 turbo and
maybe<00:01:55.600> if<00:01:55.810> I<00:01:55.930> can<00:01:56.080> convince<00:01:56.410> my<00:01:56.590> wife<00:01:56.619> maybe

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
maybe if I can convince my wife maybe

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.790 
maybe if I can convince my wife maybe
we'll<00:01:57.340> get<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.520> side<00:01:58.240> mount<00:01:58.630> intake<00:02:00.450> manifold

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
we'll get a side mount intake manifold

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.010 
we'll get a side mount intake manifold
so<00:02:02.800> other<00:02:03.400> than<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:03.670> man<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.119> am<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:04.780> really

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
so other than that man I am just really

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.410 
so other than that man I am just really
happy<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:07.140> my<00:02:09.149> power<00:02:10.149> FC<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:10.989> working

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
happy that my power FC is working

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.040 
happy that my power FC is working
everything<00:02:13.420> looks<00:02:13.690> good

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.860 

love<00:02:17.680> it
