00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
automatically

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.809 
automatically
I<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:07.259> always<00:02:07.469> override<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.489> want<00:02:08.729> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
I can always override that if I want to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.229 
I can always override that if I want to
say<00:02:09.000> well<00:02:09.330> Chris<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.160> know<00:02:11.160> what<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.670> think

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
say well Chris you know what I think

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.340 
say well Chris you know what I think
Ian<00:02:12.450> should<00:02:12.629> go<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.870> his<00:02:12.989> place

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
Ian should go in his place

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.890 
Ian should go in his place
for<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.590> first<00:02:13.860> rotation<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:15.540> do<00:02:15.720> that

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
for this first rotation I can do that

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.950 
for this first rotation I can do that
and<00:02:16.140> actually<00:02:16.260> override<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.280> soccer<00:02:17.580> dad<00:02:17.960> okay

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
and actually override in soccer dad okay

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.140 
and actually override in soccer dad okay
so<00:02:19.020> even<00:02:19.980> though<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.310> have<00:02:20.460> automatic

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
so even though you have automatic

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.880 
so even though you have automatic
settings<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.050> option<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.590> override

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
settings you have the option to override

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.070 
settings you have the option to override
that

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
that

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.890 
that
so<00:02:25.080> that's<00:02:25.260> your<00:02:25.410> rotation<00:02:26.510> now<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:27.690> time<00:02:27.870> to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
so that's your rotation now it's time to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.670 
so that's your rotation now it's time to
actually<00:02:28.290> play<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.500> game<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:31.080> we<00:02:31.200> see<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> few

actually play the game so we see a few

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.030 
actually play the game so we see a few
new<00:02:31.890> things<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.910> screen<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:34.410> area<00:02:34.830> here

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
new things on this screen this area here

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.790 
new things on this screen this area here
replaces<00:02:35.520> your<00:02:35.640> stopwatch<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.260> tells<00:02:37.560> you

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
that you're doing the first rotation of

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.750 
that you're doing the first rotation of
eight<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.830> your<00:02:40.830> start<00:02:41.160> time<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.550> end<00:02:41.640> time

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.460 
eight and your start time and end time
for<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.390> rotation<00:02:44.960> here's<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:46.020> button<00:02:46.260> for

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
for that rotation here's a button for

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
this is my next rotation button so when

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.980 
this is my next rotation button so when

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
I reach the end of a rotation this is

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.860 
I reach the end of a rotation this is
how<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.140> bring<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.830> next<00:03:02.130> set<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.540> kids<00:03:03.540> onto

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
option let's say with Ethan I could

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.410 
option let's say with Ethan I could
actually<00:03:39.740> substitute<00:03:40.740> him<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.820> again<00:03:42.090> soccer

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
actually substitute him and again soccer

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.000
