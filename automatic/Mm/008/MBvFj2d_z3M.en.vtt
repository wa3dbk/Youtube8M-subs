00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 They are very nice these jellies 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.040
 precious what material we are going to need 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.099
 today as we can see some 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.200
 Very nice gelatins are things and so 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.580
 Now, yes, this one sees them and they think that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.039
 they are plastic but I will not occupy a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.020
 very simple recipe that is jelly from 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.269
 milk aha and this will use it 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.830
 Vegetable colors at home can 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.840
 use any recipe that you 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.869
 have milk gelatin and also 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.460
 essences let's go it's going to be very simple of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.370
 use 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.629
 yes because we are going to use some 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.670
 droplets of essence either cinnamon or 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.579
 strawberry for our products if 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.300
 for example 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.320
 we have syringes here as the most 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.180
 wide needle true for example that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.129
 we have normal ones if this one is already 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.140
 call cattete which is for example for 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.239
 make this jello slam one of the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 larger ones are called catheters by the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.019
 hole there's a just bigger one before 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.720
 to go making our material 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.280
 go buy our dear geriatricians 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.689
 what you recommend you can use the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.970
 same agenda as if it can be used 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.740
 clear and we finished working and now 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.119
 yes we can this you can go back to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.680
 use the same normal syringe to the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.869
 we go perfectly fine for example 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.000
 here we go elaborate the red color are 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.220
 some droplets of red already 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 forces as a base must also carry 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.880
 a white color very well there 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.490
 remember that also to elaborate this 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.990
 type of gelatin we need this that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.630
 our jelly because it is not even very 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.970
 hot or very cold cold because if 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 it is cold the needle is covered and if it is 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.110
 hot, it's going to ruin our 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.299
 gelatin we go to a poinsettia now 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.770
 that the season of Christmas then for 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.880
 that you can now give them a gift 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.159
 your guests 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.170
 brothers to his mom so that he looks 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.549
 lady the exact this December 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.619
 look for example here we elaborate 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.520
 we have the color red and we are going to elaborate 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.350
 also around here a yellow color that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.840
 is to do I do not know if they locate that then 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.600
 always Christmas Eve has some 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.450
 Yellow pistils makes the medium pure 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.519
 just do it then over here and a 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.650
 once we fill here you can see that we are 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.690
 preparing our yellow color in 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.610
 issue of amounts that you recommend 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.860
 for example if we are going to make a 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.080
 gelatine of this size for example for 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.790
 make that gelatin in price is 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.650
 excellent because for example for 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.170
 we make that gelatin and already 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.450
 very good quality pay us I think that 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.209
 in 40 pesos or so and that kind of 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.930
 Gelatine can be sold up to 150 a 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.580
 200 pesos 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.319
 other than that they will be hands can 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.239
 do business then here we go to 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.829
 make a small gelatin and then 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.030
 Now, be careful so that 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.250
 see in the technique that is the most 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.239
 important for example here we elaborate 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.239
 the first pistils 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.200
 is 1 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.050
 2 as far as I'm going, I'm going 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.110
 forming the figure and I'm going and I'm going now 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.000
 if they inject affecting the color and there 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.040
 it is staying inside and we are going to 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.129
 elaborate what are the petals already of the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.120
 Christmas Eve very well we started to form 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.120
 some triangles 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.720
 there's our jelly prince in 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.560
 what we have this is one this is a 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.720
 good night 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.880
 yes but the type of gelatin goes to the base 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.540
 is a normal normal water curtain that 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.890
 it must be lemon than we want in 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.840
 prey lemon now I want to clarify a 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.030
 thing like that there are many people who have 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.680
 bought these jellies and the truth is 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.020
 that if we receive calls and they tell us 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.260
 hey you know that gelatin is very 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.720
 pretty but it is very bad knows packs 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.240
 know but this one has no essence it does not have 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.430
 nothing is not guaranteed to be 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.020
 in this course that we are going to impart that 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.970
 these gelatins that are taken from there 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.040
 from the first class they will take them 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.050
 very nice from the first class in 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.030
 that they do not know how to make anything of gelatin and 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.600
 apart they will take them with very good 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.320
 taste 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.840
 we flipped it very well and here we have 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.670
 a new and new remains on this side 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.610
 exactly now what do you think we elaborate 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.690
 a rose perfection osella for a rose 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.910
 and we're going to make it white very well 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.800
 and good one thing also important is 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.200
 that in the course we teach, they are 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.170
 teaches to work with flowers 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.330
 in two ways to make the flowers 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.940
 pure needle base of pure syringes and 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.870
 another base of teaspoons and sticks there 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.750
 come on let's make the ajÃ¡ roses 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.160
 and I say the rose has three techniques 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.620
 also in a technique where I'm 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.950
 elaborating with the pure needle and other 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.340
 technique is with spoons with pallets if 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:46.930
 it is not destroyed good I'm seeing which 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.880
 is the technique so that it is not challenging 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.590
 when they also take the course they say hey 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.480
 the gelatin is breaking up from above 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.940
 it does not matter the gelatin or for example 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.530
 and if we have to chop you have to 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.410
 open a little bit because we are 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.720
 injecting then yes yes petals and 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.330
 it does not matter if it opens or something because 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.010
 final we place the fund on 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.380
 background as you can see in the others a 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.910
 pink or red background and that's when one 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.460
 he says hey how they put the flower 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.140
 I do not know where it is now we have our 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.150
 finished pink so that fan the 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.490
 camera yes then now it is a 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.710
 very precious gelatin a white rose and 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.900
 already the color test that you have 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.480
 make this sandino gelatin 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.880
 around more or less of about 52 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.240
 weights and this type of gelatin are worth 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.370
 around 10 to 20 pesos some other 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.540
 tip to make another tip for now 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.540
 yes a lot of patience 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.340
 exact next when they go and take 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.400
 the course most people say 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.620
 wow this serves to relax me or is served 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.050
 as a therapy we are going to apart from that they are going to 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.940
 learn or are benefits are going to 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.200
 learn are going to be gifts are going to 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.000
 have fun and friends will relax 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.430
 see how he is doing the third 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.280
 flower this is a pen that giving a 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.950
 carnation 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.630
 and this and not because it basically looks 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.080
 simple will have to be learned and 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.210
 practice it really come either with you 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.090
 or start doing it if you ever already 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.770
 have practiced at home well now 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.630
 open and make other types of colors that 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.960
 if we could be and we have now the 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.330
 carnation and then now I know that any 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.660
 flower perfectura flower and to get to 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:32.250
 work lady at home to your business 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.250
 gift in the end I was going to go
