00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.639
I'm Lorraine Owens, and my daughter just moved
into her first apartment.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.349
It needs help.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.620
It needs some decoration really bad.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.250
And, unfortunately, I'm not a decorator.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.560
So I called P. Allen Smith, and he has agreed
today to come here and help me, thankfully,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.540
to make this apartment Jessica's first dream
apartment, hopefully.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.710
Hi, Lorraine.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.890
Hey, Allen.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.920
So good to see you.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.920
Good to see you too.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.680
What do you have up your sleeve here?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.230
Oh, I need your help.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.760
I think we can surprise her, and it will be
beautiful, and she'll love it.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.939
Well, do your magic.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.489
Alright, let's have a look.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.570
So, Allen, this is it.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.780
Nice size room, Lorraine.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.780
It is.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.390
It has a nice feel to it.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.530
Good bones.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.689
I really wanna do something nice for her.

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.420
What about her color preferences?

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.580
What does she like?

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.940
I know she likes, well, I was looking over
here -- she loves aqua.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.940
She loves blue.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.840
She loves her little lamp that she purchased
herself.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.140
So she obviously likes things that are related
to the ocean or nautical themes.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.140
She does.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.140
That kinda thing?

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.140
She does.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.770
So, Lorraine, do you have some sort of budget
in mind for this?

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.159
Yes, I do, actually.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.250
Maybe, nothing over $1,000.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.880
If you can get even a little under that, even
better.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.999
Right, right, maybe the $700 - $800 range?

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.799
That would be perfect.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.200
Okay, great.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.609
I know.

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.159
What a difference, huh?

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.990
Oh my gosh -- this so amazing!

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.990
I know it, I know it.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.990
I can't believe it either.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.290
I love it.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.619
Thank you so much!

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:49.619
Oh my god.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.549
I love it, too, honey, but I didn't do it
myself.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.549
What?

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.549
No, I had some help.

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.729
Definitely had some help.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:56.729
Surprise!

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.790
Hi, how are you?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.850
So good to see you.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.090
And you too.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.090
Hey, Lorraine.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.560
Thank you so much.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.799
Ooh, you like?

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.799
It looks fantastic.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.729
And, Lorraine, the good news is that we were
able to do it within our budget.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.290
Great, that's the best part of it, god.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.030
But, you know, how we're you able to do that
with all of this, Allen?

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.010
Well, you know, we had to be very thrifty.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.400
We found some cool stuff at Target.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.690
We also hit some secondhand stores and got
creative on some things.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.621
Yeah, so I think it's worked out really well.

00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:26.100
I'm really happy with it.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.910
So why don't I give you a little tour of your
new space.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.910
Great!

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.780
But if you look over here on this wall, I
mean, you know, you remember there wasn't

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.349
a whole lot going on over here.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.099
Now it just seemed to me that, you know, if
you could have your television over there

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.129
and we could use this mantle piece as a focal
point because I really like those blue tiles.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.750
Your mom said you really liked them and that
you loved vintage, so we kinda tried to go

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.190
with that theme and mix it up with some modern
things.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.300
I grouped four mirrors, one slightly blue
in color.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.350
The other, slightly sort of okra in color.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.360
So that helped with our theme.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.739
And then we found these two little stools.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.209
It seemed like if you have people over, you
needed a little more seating.

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.709
Sofa's nice, but you needed a little extra.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.459
Then over here, you really needed another
piece of furniture.

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.800
And you don't have a lot of space so we built
this console just out of some 2x4s and some

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.049
extra wood that we had, covered it with a
piece of fabric.

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.079
I think it looks pretty good.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.250
The color works great.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.480
And then for the wall hanging, hey, we got
one of your books.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.150
We wanted to personalize it.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.329
Your mom said you really loved Through the
Woods.

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.329
I can't believe you remembered.

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.670
I know, isn't that great.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.960
We just had that blown up.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.390
You know, it was a tiny picture, but we had
it blown up with the color of the room with

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.390
the blue.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.390
So it worked out really well.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.830
Now as you recall, here, there was absolutely
nothing on this wall, but it just seemed to

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.230
make sense that a wall shelf like this really
works because you don't have a lot space to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.230
walk.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.019
Now the little touch of red and gold, I think,
helps pop.

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.599
And then you can put all kinds of natural
objects and things on it just like a sort

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.959
of an old fashioned eterges.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:52.959
Yeah.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:53.959
I love it.

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:54.959
And some shells.

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.930
You're mom told me that you love anything
from the ocean.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:57.930
Absolutely.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.930
Great.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.930
And here's a little bird nest.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.430
And, of course, you gotta have some house
plants, right?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.430
Of course.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.430
Yeah.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.430
Well, let's step over here.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.329
I just wanna show you this wall because this
is the widest wall in the room.

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.230
What we did is we started with the window
treatment.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.390
Really felt like you needed something a little
lighter and airier.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.900
And by using a light fabric, it makes the
room feel much larger.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.270
We wanted the room to feel bigger and so that
really helps a lot.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.710
The sofa: Well, we kept the sofa, obviously,
but we went to Target and we found a slip

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.710
cover.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.710
Look how great it looks.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.710
Oh my god.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.710
And we found those throw pillows at Target
as well.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.180
So I think they all really resonate with the
colors here.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.550
And then the lamps on either side -- well,
thanks to your mom, she made that contribution

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.650
from the house.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.740
So, thank you for letting us use those here.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.569
No problem, they look better here.

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.250
I do think they look very good.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.550
So that helped save the day.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.740
And then, of course, we used some platters.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.900
You can see over here, three platters on either
side, vintage platters.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.960
Again, that sort of cream color.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.400
And then the coffee table -- you had no top
for it.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.400
Oh no.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400
I think it was time for a top.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.430
So I had some extra boards at the farm, and
so what we did is we just had them put together

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.430
like this.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.520
I think it's gonna make a great top.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.240
It's larger now so you can play games.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.970
And the other thing that's cool is under here
for storage for you DVDs and CDs.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.590
You have four of these baskets under here
for storage.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.889
So, hey, in a small space, you need storage
ideas.

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:20.889
Absolutely.

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:21.889
Yeah.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.990
And then, decided that the Oriental rug didn't
really fit where we were going here.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.389
You needed something a little more modern
and the color needed to work.

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.970
So we found this really cool rug at Target.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.440
So I think it all comes together really well.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.850
Allen, thank you so much.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:34.850
Oh, you're welcome, sweetie.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.850
It's beautiful.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.850
You deserve it.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.850
Thank you so much.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.850
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.850
And thanks for the opportunity, Lorraine.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.850
Thank you, Allen.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.850
It's better than I could've ever expected.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.400
Hey, we need to do another one.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.819
Hey, if you've got makeovers that you've done,
we'd love to see the before and afters.

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:50.520
Make sure you subscribe to eHow Home.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:06:26.650
Hey, we even have fresh apples for you.
