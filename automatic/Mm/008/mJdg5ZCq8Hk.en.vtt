00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:11.219
 Hello, you have entered the category field 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.620
 polyethylene boot mat what is it 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.400
 It means it doesnâ€™t mean that you are cunning 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.730
 how much is this just so called 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.289
 polyethylene space splat 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.880
 trunk mat have it goes in black 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.980
 color as a rule 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:35.809
 here he comes with a rim he material 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.129
 tight looks inexpensive but tasteful 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.510
 can withstand temperatures up to 35 degrees 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:46.200
 the average doesn't burst what to do then 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.829
 principle not replace it also falls 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.020
 you can think like a pipe 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.020
 cooler somehow he does not burst 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.620
 In principle , each model has its own 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.019
 trunk unit we may have variations 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.549
 pattern on the carpet here let's go 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.170
 some corners 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.110
 or diamonds past the cubes 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.939
 not matter the patterns and molds from 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 this does not change the sky wars gray 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.890
 remains carpet specifically for each 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.820
 model but there is still 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:28.670
 floor mats boot mat polyurethane 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.670
 you are already coming dear 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:41.549
 trunk mat for a foreign car 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.619
 they are also going to the rim a little 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.229
 another drawing as I said it is not 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.720
 doesn't matter they go 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:56.460
 polyurethane what is the main difference 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.690
 differences from polyethylene so that my 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.619
 parents annoying is that 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.940
 plastic boot 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.880
 arrival is possible and skating 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.819
 cargo on the trunk will not be ordered 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.680
 create a nasty big 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.060
 here the surface was such 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.630
 plan that let's say nothing here 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.269
 new york 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.760
 You put as ruz as was and 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.650
 stayed the same has since build 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.430
 he is also so small in principle 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.860
 principle, if you have money, order 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.860
