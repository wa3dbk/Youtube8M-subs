00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.839
 very good everything was fine and we are 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.520
 playing well ex suspense that 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.920
 you will probably remember until this 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.410
 DDN race x sorry for the delay 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.269
 because it's the hardest one that played 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.920
 until now that is when I played it already 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.330
 I said it was harder than I played and 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.550
 So far I have not tried anything else 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.470
 difficult so let's go to it effort 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.290
 all this career on camera at first 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.450
 person for everyone god oh god 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.490
 I thought get ignoring the 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.350
 race they say to 360 I got it I think 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.790
 and if I believe that it is cured in the end we are going to 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.050
 pass first is doing little horse 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.700
 many people do not know that you have to 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.890
 make horses and in first person is 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.240
 very rare to do it but well you see that 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.250
 it does not even arrive right now so 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.230
 I hope it can be completed because 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.180
 are many of these careers are 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.890
 xbox 360 races that then have 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.480
 happened to that rise so maybe at 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.150
 change the distances and that there are some 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.239
 races that are impossible to complete 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.829
 I'm not sure my god is the truth is 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.920
 that looks impossible this we will see how 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.920
 goes 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.310
 I do not know why I always appear with the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.960
 house looking back 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.670
 to see blue horse 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.030
 in my case this I think you can not 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.030
 get 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.780
 or do not ask me how I got it 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.550
 going very close to the edge so I'm going 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.680
 to continue I will load you in the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.620
 description also that if I find it 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.000
 also that is important but that is 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.760
 keep in mind that it is very very 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 complicated for them 360 was good 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.630
 it did not stick its complicated parts 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.490
 obviously but I'm not sure so 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.860
 you can complete it in xbox one because 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 and to the first ramp if that person 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.890
 in short let's take advantage of that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.010
 managed to pass that game continue 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.870
 with the race because she is very pretty 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.400
 Beware of that, I know that there is a 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.930
 heap 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.640
 oh my god what luck I had there 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.380
 because it's very difficult to jump I do not know 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.660
 when I jump and when there's no follow 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.490
 example takes this website better at first 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.680
 putada person is not wearing a helmet 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.119
 I know if I can remove it right now 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.530
 least I can not take it off and I'll look at it 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.290
 or if you can not leave in the comments 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.730
 better because it's already nice to see go with 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.910
 helmet and such but it looks very dark 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.570
 well also adjust the brightness 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.610
 previously that is not like the 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.110
 first race that I raised of mx yes 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.920
 that would be much darker because it has still 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.950
 to adjust the brightness 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.569
 but wins or better care to do it with 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.099
 glasses or something that simply looks with 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.420
 the color tone that if not what 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.069
 you knew when wearing glasses you see a 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.810
 dark poquillo in the color of the glasses 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.750
 that bear placed where a point 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.550
 if you wear purple glasses 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.160
 so with colorful and even handsome in 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.540
 truth we go there and with this race 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.819
 she is beautiful in the first person 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.860
 is also a bit unusual bikes in 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.290
 first person because you do not even see 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.330
 what they are to what you are grabbing 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.550
 I practically do not know anything but it's 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.150
 handsome because if you feel that you drive a 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.920
 bike, well, it's not beautiful, let's go 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.420
 do this ramp I do not know if I would get it 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.430
 It is very cool going to try to make 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.150
 back flip 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.680
 I get the impression that we are going less than 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.480
 that goes a lot slower when doing the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.609
 horse that in the 360 at least in 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.500
 first person now I can not 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.700
 change because the whole career is like that in 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.879
 first person 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.769
 but at least I think here since it does not 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.090
 advances more seriously I think I'm like this 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.550
 that is impossible 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.660
 in good order tempt him one last time 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.670
 If I do not change my career and 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.610
 we will continue in another to vary a 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:27.780
 Little does a couple of races in a video 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.780
 I do not want to make another career 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.439
 good guys we continue with the part and 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.060
 playing antigravity world race in this 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.249
 career also the explicit view a 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.810
 lots of races already already marked like this 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.639
 that what will be much more beautiful in 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.980
 first person for example is in the 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.569
 fright and by the stop or you already saw it and 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.519
 Cezanne shed and time the king will be 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.139
 so what if you have not seen you go to 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.849
 flipar or we have to go by the wall 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.280
 all the time and in first person going to 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.049
 be a bar already from the host so let's go 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.159
 to see how this goes like the race 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.569
 previous outside that has some 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.280
 defects having changed the 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.760
 distances and good to be next come 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.860
 from the 360 but we'll see 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.659
 to see or my god what dizzy I 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.019
 I'm just going to try to go straight 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.939
 because I do not see shit carefully or 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.799
 this race also that's why I'm 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.320
 playing without music without having exposed or 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.669
 my God, what husband have this, are you? 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.109
 watching without music also its why 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.910
 you are listening to what radio is 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.410
 game but soon they come down and we do not go 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.419
 shut up I tell you that I upload gameplays no 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.729
 music I'm still looking new 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.590
 music worked I do not know I do not know how many 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.330
 turns is this is that is this 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.190
 it tides a lot and it's really not so 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.720
 funny are they really cool more in third 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.210
 person because you see the car is this 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.710
 same side but fuck as way and 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.430
 sorry for the cut before but not only 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.660
 I had gone to hell but that 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.220
 sorry I'm a little bad and this is 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.470
 being every two times three because it does not stop 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.230
 to comment and is that I am like that and I hate you 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.330
 is that it enters the parking top 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.010
 anyway I do not even get the wall 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.050
 well I'm going to the ground to see if 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.910
 I get up or something is that sometimes 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.530
 they are higher up sometimes lower and neither 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.080
 I do not even know if I'm seeing the points 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.360
 of control this is an incredible greater and 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.620
 today I think the race is over 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.750
 in short guys I hope you liked 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.160
 these two careers is probably in 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.300
 the description I'm not sure because I do not 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.310
 I have them saved but I will try 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.390
 look for them so good 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.160
