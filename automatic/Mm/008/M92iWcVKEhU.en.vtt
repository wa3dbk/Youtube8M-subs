understand<00:02:53.489> like<00:02:53.730> what<00:02:54.030> else<00:02:54.209> could<00:02:54.420> they<00:02:54.630> do

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
understand like what else could they do

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.009

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
but it's a shocker Nintendo always goes

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.780 
but it's a shocker Nintendo always goes
out<00:02:58.140> their<00:02:58.320> way<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.530> their<00:02:58.680> e3<00:02:58.890> presentations

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
just doing at endo direct but i got

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.060 
just doing at endo direct but i got
feeling<00:03:06.840> it's<00:03:06.930> gonna<00:03:07.050> be<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.230> really<00:03:07.470> good<00:03:07.800> one

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
feeling it's gonna be a really good one

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.190 
feeling it's gonna be a really good one
and<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.610> think<00:03:08.910> maybe<00:03:09.150> one<00:03:09.480> more<00:03:09.630> third-party

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200
