00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
interesting so when this lives at the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.010 
interesting so when this lives at the
archives<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> glass<00:00:48.690> case

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
archives is it in like a glass case

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.470 
archives is it in like a glass case
behind<00:00:49.440> 78<00:00:50.100> vaults<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:56.030> of<00:00:57.030> course<00:00:57.270> we're<00:00:57.420> in

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
behind 78 vaults like of course we're in

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.420 
behind 78 vaults like of course we're in
the<00:00:57.539> middle<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.350> amazing<00:00:59.160> two-day

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the middle of a really amazing two-day

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.830 
the middle of a really amazing two-day
precedent<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> kick<00:01:00.180> off<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> 60th

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
precedent to kick off the 60th

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.529 
precedent to kick off the 60th
anniversary<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.730> guess<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.180> of

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
anniversary and it's I guess not all of

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.450 
anniversary and it's I guess not all of
that<00:01:03.660> unlike<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.320> Disneyland<00:01:04.830> first<00:01:05.070> opened

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that unlike when Disneyland first opened

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.850 
that unlike when Disneyland first opened
yeah<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> mean<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.780> look<00:01:06.990> around<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.619> trees

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
yeah I mean if you look around the trees

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.160 
yeah I mean if you look around the trees
have<00:01:08.010> gotten<00:01:08.250> bigger

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
have gotten bigger

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.330 
have gotten bigger
