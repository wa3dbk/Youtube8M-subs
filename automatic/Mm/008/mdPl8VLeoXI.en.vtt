 dead when we get home I'm going to 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.650

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.420
 main 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.050
 I think something happens to me 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.330
 and normally it does not do that 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.349
 calm 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.340
 God 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.470
 A) Yes 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.810
 he was hysterical like a bar of 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.530
 peanut I've scored several spasms of 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.090
 pain salty chris computer 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.309

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.250
 contracted sigras fever is what 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.250
 very good since you replace that eye 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.690

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.870
 feeling like when whores 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.280
 all this mission has been crazy 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.839
 first we landed on cigar axis to 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.210
 help the king connect against the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.420
 radical dwarfs although it seemed more 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.860
 well stable dwarfs 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.140
 I realized that you noticed 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.880
 then when we were towing in the sun 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.380
 artificial a lunar dragon put on 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.210
 too affectionate and we had moments 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.659
 well with our aft engines 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.720
 and sometimes a queue grew if a 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.400
 queue to the promo you do not see it helps me 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.680
 I wear my pretty face and the crusts of 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.580
 pig to the bus stop and do 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.950
 like I was never here 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.980

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.900

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.880
 we were talking yes and suddenly 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.460
 appears an old man with pork rinds and 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.830
 He begins to tell us his life like this and I have 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.360
 seen a bus right there I'm not sure 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.040
 of what we just saw a kind of 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.720
 spectral phenomenon maybe there was a 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.899
 true alien here yes but the reader 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.360
 he says he was human and very emotional 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.630
 you have seen those powers god I think that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.429
 He was an emotional Lord that nobody has 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.380

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.050

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.450

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.400
