00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:18.650
 Because the sound cut out of the play origination was finished in 8 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.039
 I would like to adhere to this even with Kimose logger 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.039
 not 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:01.109
 The cylinder and Haujin I this place mousse games of back and forth in Usa 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.109
 Because it adhered 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.429
 What should I do ? 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.790
 Maybe it should be something like this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.040
 I can not say anything a little more, but for now 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.400
 This time a 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.740
 Oh dear 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:13.190
 Will also be in the form of far Toko that can assembly of the first issue 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.570
 Then I will paint the next cat 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.570
 I hope to do it 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.270
 Well, it should be that 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.440
 From here the form is positive Plum code 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.400
 I think I should extend it. 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.510
 Though I think that if let's go in some cases a little 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.810
 It took another chopper 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.900
 The level of difficulty is over, but it may be a bit difficult for the first-time users 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.200
 This time is good here 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.200
 Yes 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:55.750
 Yes Well, I think it in and hope I get the painting of Nekokumi rose engine 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:58.140
 It is a demonic double-sided tape behind with something of a æ¥Š 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.140
 5 pieces 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.150
 Make it up 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:10.040
 Hey paint is because it will have a thought behind the sound of this engine 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.040
 I think it will be easier 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.560
 Yes it is 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.750
 I gave a possession 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:28.530
 I would like to paint the engine a use It should be noted that this 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:31.010
 It is said that 2 is said to be black and black matte black and you want to paint the whole of the dozens once 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.010
 think 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.600
 First, a little more Juryo from where it was secluded cat 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.850
 Let me go 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.690
 I wonder if I should go to bed 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.560
 Yes 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:17.139
 With such a feeling, it's the first place to get stuck 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.980
 I will paint it 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.950
 I'll finally have a love part 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.760
 I think I should go to paint sitter sleeping 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.760
 I think so 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:50.810
 Is the sound left unpainted from various angles? 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.810
 To check 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.009
 I think if you do 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.950
 Yes 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:04.960
 Just go and feel like this with this cylinder 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.390
 Well I think I should be able to do so with a cylinder part 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.630
 With this sound housing 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.880
 The place around this circle is ok 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.330
 If you go out silver or British 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:22.250
 In-flight meal 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.250
 Well , I think it will be in the form of painting, so I think that the current stage is good in this state 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.090
 I have also watched the personality and also the time to Kirk 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.840
 Oh dear 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:37.870
 5 is only good to our Oite is dedicated to another cat If those to now 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:41.370
 From dry to stop the tool in the do anything good or sponge but whether what was rounded roots that year 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.370
 I think I want to wait 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:06.889
 A little fine place splashing each other this time of production while using as much as possible generation Karaoma center 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:11.509
 Even 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:18.529
 It may not be from comets, but may use enamel color a little 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:21.249
 Well as much as possible this time an easy-to-use Well paint anyone and would like to proceed with production using 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.249
 I think you 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:50.580
 Well then I want to wait for the hardship like this to happen a little earlier 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.580
 I think
