00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.549
 during the after we decided not to 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.600
 tell you about the background of this investigation 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.890
 because finally we do not see 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.940
 evidence we have no record on 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.099
 does not have to be we do not have any 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.509
 official documents but against that 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.059
 worth to be decrypted under a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.949
 another angle that will interest our 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 buyers nothing that about readers of 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.910
 football journals of the France team 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.350
 is just before this goal before you 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.699
 go to bursting with his just a word 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.560
 still six months I him too I 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.630
 I was expecting 2 more is when the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.830
 cover and black do not know why you 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.720
 know it makes me even more scared already 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.980
 I was afraid before me of qatar after 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.510
 everything I read right there left there 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.040
 you really have to be afraid so with the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.780
 cover with black cover i 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.700
 do not tell you there I thought it was over 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.760
 we were not far from the end of the end and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.710
 so I read ok well ok ok so the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.210
 nice deal we would have basically tried to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 corrupt guys who were going to vote 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.500
 for the World Cup or more than attempted 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.230
 outright they received sorrel for 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.660
 to vote in a sense why not no but 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.219
 why not it's just how 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.409
 are awarded legion and the cuts of the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.760
 world since forever 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.900
 so certainly this is for everyone so it's 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.100
 true it may be cynical what I 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.299
 say and it's not because everyone 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.820
 the fact that it must be done 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.869
 except that well ben here are the Cathars and 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.070
 are not more cons than the others they 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.530
 are launched in the system they have 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.119
 saw that it worked like that bah yes 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 I even have the impression that there are some 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.360
 construction sites in the Paris region 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.830
 is attributed that way so it's 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.790
 unhappy but but I believe they 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.619
 so when we know how that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.240
 the fifa gilbert works you know it 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 better me in every country 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.079
 the guys who vote who are dudes 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.329
 unknown how many cases have been 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.189
 revealed by books of the types that you 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.140
 give a suitcase yes to whom it changes the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.579
 life who did not refuse it because 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.350
 it's all human nature with 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.689
 people with different cultures 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.500
 some ultra developed countries where there are 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.000
 also had recent scandals 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.229
 resounding 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.870
 remember to do it in salt lake 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.450
 city where there 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.760
 how to make juan ossio antonio 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.250
 challenge that's why the islands and jo 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.990
 atlanta and the jo de atlanta with coca 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.930
 cola they did not pass coca who bought 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.490
 the jo in French sailing by a good yes 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.560
 but once again we can tell you 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.330
 there we can tell you yeah but it's not 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.270
 because the others are because ben 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.830
 yes ok but I have to tell me what 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.450
 what time is it 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.920
 reunites to change the world and the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.140
 human nature what because we're going 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.410
 try to come what I have 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.450
 the impression that 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.800
 there is not a hint of cynicism I 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.840
 do not see what can be opposed to his 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.460
 subsidiary other argument is that they 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.440
 were basit bodies there still kills one 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.000
 word is true you say it I promise after 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.020
 it may have been given also a country that 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.580
 was perhaps one of the only ones able to 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.830
 assume the organization of a cup of 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.360
 world currently with the crisis had 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.890
 maybe the united states what is it 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.660
 there were others as possible country 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.990
 maybe australia which by the way 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.720
 to have some sydney jo's 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.830
 releases they will do it russia 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.959
 are they going to organize too 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.370
 So here there are how many countries we 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.150
 was on the street behind the organization 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.069
 big events 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.260
 international because ultimately 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.000
 you can not assume the deficits 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.280
 with colossal deficits 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.750
 Well, that's it, I 'm waiting for you 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.580
 remember I say that while I said 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.310
 here that if it was going to Qatar I would stop 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.140
 my career in 2022 zoomit 2020 will be 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.069
 already here is support is that's why 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.959
 besides why I was not taking 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.190
 a lot of risks and that yeah I 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.630
 did not find it good that it happens 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.890
 in a country not tradition of football 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.630
 yes it may be a bit conservative 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.130
 like vision but hey it was done in 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.180
 japan in korea yeah that's for sure I 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.350
 prefer when it's in brazil 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.090
 Argentina in football countries 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.800
 but good after all if other countries 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.760
 must discover the football we go 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.050
 there what then 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.120
 and I now tell you backwards 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.420
 decor you know that france football 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.739
 has had before we will say the property of the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.780
 golden ball that he launched that is 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.890
 become an important event in the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.470
 football world we love we do not like 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.260
 stay like that and france football has been 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.019
 asked by the fifa to make it a 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.880
 even bigger event fifa 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.040
 France football so a kind of john 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.040
 a kind of joint venture was set up 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.420
 place between fifa and france foot 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.860
 but it turns out that it made even more 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.180
 crazy attacks for fifa this is 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.610
 as if you had an impact on 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.690
 wading I get there but is actually 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.040
 it turns out that on particular the 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.530
 last delivery of the gold ball france 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.150
 football was not happy at all 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.640
 the way the fifa has treated it is to 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.590
 to say that we consider France foot that 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.910
 today does not count more than 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.959
 other media and that the golden ball 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.519
 what was the france football gold ball 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.560
 the show today a gold balloon 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.510
 fifa and that the terms of the contract with 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.650
 fifa are not respected and in fact 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.489
 there his tata that this code sent to the fifa 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.190
 why it would not be just the 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.510
 france football's response to fifa a 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.380
 sort of account settlement versus 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.970
 the golden ball can also 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.690
 interpret it like that and I ask myself 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.680
 another question 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.740
 France football that sells to fans of 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.240
 football supporters france football 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.560
 consciousness anyway that the qatar in 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.479
 some measure to save football 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.190
 French because without the arrival of 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.330
 binh sport qatarie chain that actually 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.280
 automatically increase 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.650
 substantially what was expected 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.390
 latest TV rights is also handed 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.300
 afloat the psg revive the ps 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.890
 completely waited for the qatar it takes 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.770
 to say it like it's the qatar saved the 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.900
 French football on these 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.520
 deserve ikea that does not really prevent 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.440
 in cyber months his method no but then 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.930
 after no but then after that prevents 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.940
 not it's more a hindsight would that be what 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.980
 because it's true that behind this 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.750
 folder there is where there are many others 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.910
 anguish I was very surprised 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.510
 see that tf1 jt tonight that one 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.770
 of m6 have devoted a little topic to this 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.450
 article of france football it happens 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.670
 still very very rarely that jt 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.650
 talk about France football to talk about that 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.970
 to say what deep down quickly in 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.470
 the little low subject he had 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.310
 maybe bought the world cup so 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.910
 we come back to what was said 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.270
 previously 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.310
 there the scoop but why the question 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.750
 which arises why suddenly the jt gets 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.910
 put the qatar to buy a truck 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.400
 because what has to underlying 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.350
 all this is the current fear and this 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.520
 old fantasy that qatar is in the process 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.780
 to buy France it's true that the 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.690
 qatar has shares in enormously 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.030
 40 40 vernon cac companies that 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.830
 they bought a lot of buildings in 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.210
 in Paris invested in the 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.860
 suburbs in real estate 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.020
 and it's true that there is a whole fantasy 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.460
 which revolves around throwing 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.350
 dozens of laps of that today the 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.450
 Cathars and the qatari and the qatar is 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.280
 one is a country historically very much linked to 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.110
 France not that France sarko 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.730
 but all the recent governments of 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.320
 left or right yet hollande 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.480
 one of the first personalities he 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.810
 received after his election it was mid 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.670
 August 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.860
 it was the prince of qatar who was 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.630
 the elysée so to continue to make 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.100
 business 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.360
 after behind I think we are not 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.350
 more stupid than others we read all 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.090
 the items of qatar who who can 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.330
 fund terrorist networks 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.310
 there are a lot of fantasies powered 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:38.410
 to the qatar's turn of the true things of the 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.700
 things less true but finally good there are 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.960
 so much to say in those cases what what
