00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.890

 today a recipe of the hour today you will 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.150
 learn how to make breaded shrimp 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.160
 but I already made a horse recipe here 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.210
 in my blog that was bed for nothing 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.949
 because the tupi 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.660
 about the type of bank that the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.420
 We will now do we already did 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.190
 the empanada of the Japanese restaurant 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.989
 imposes on you nothing that becomes a ball 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.250
 so the camaro and you will see that it is 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.890
 easy to do 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.440
 It's all the fun, the secret is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.020
 everything there in the horse inpa not in the like 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.039
 You go to him and you'll see him now. 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.360
 the friends 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.160
 so let's start our good personal 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.899
 recipe, remembering that all credits 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 stay in the video description on youtube 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.010
 so what I did I bought here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.230
 camera a gray that is the gray shrimp 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.390
 normal né that sells in the market 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.080
 You see no detail and I did 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 I took the cone off him and took the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.909
 as you have already learned in the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.040
 My Video shrimp with cream cheese that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.960
 You do not remember how someone is doing. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.180
 up here you never spoke out of the corner 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.820
 asked the senate to look back 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.159
 So now that you play well and you miss 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.680
 There are no more people here. 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.689
 our our cut deeper to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.970
 leave in the ideal format to make 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.670
 continue to drill any format 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.729
 You pick up here and then you 'll see how 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.229
 You make a cut like that. 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.630
 so I took my knife that is 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.090
 but it's only because it 's very good and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.880
 I just do not cut you to the end. 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.790
 also you will cut only the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.070
 enough for him to open it too 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.229
 will it open almost as if 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.360
 Be a butterfly, shall we say so? 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.549
 so when you open he lets you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.680
 separate money from each dish as if 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.659
 he was a scorpion to zinho then is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.210
 because you cut right then mp 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.270
 He spoke here as a scorpion then okay 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.100
 Okay, I'll make another you what touch 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.830
 the cut I made for myself asking him 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.229
 I'm going to do another one. 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.380
 cut here and do not come to the end alone 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.960
 enough for you to open then 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.560
 Come on, I 'll just cut it. 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.990
 now I open here a little fight of his 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.630
 and let it stop here as if it were a 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.490
 scorpion also when the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.260
 People are going to do this at all and we will 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.420
 then the next step you learn to 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.680
 make the mass of the contested 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.690
 Good guys, now that we 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.910
 just left all the cameroons 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.640
 here in the chosen format what 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.620
 People make people get one chopped one. 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.020
 very light of just a little salt there 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.020
 on top of him a spice was just for 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.420
 I know the camaro getty images are salty 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.830
 in all this myth santal but it is legal 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.350
 play because only in it a little bit of 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.850
 Also pepper for just one goes 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.940
 give a little more taste in it will stay 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.620
 a little key to be tasty now 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.270
 that we already have a temperature of them 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.190
 with salt and pepper the people 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.950
 now prepare the secret of this appointment that 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.150
 mass you make us make the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.090
 People pick up our wheat flour here. 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.910
 to change one with a little fight here in the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.739
 And we're going to play now and 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.230
 normal and we will not mix 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.450
 stores and then plays a little more 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.430
 I care for you not to mess all 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.350
 Your kitchen is now incorporated. 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.870
 here is more in note that it was not daughter 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.700
 now body stores from fetching a 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.310
 pinch of salt to give a little taste 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.220
 mass and return and we will also plan 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.280
 incorporating the sun is also good for us already 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.010
 bought the pharmacy on the wall the salt 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.280
 We'll come with an egg, just look at the egg. 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.290
 how to lay an egg and also the oil that 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.459
 is a little bit really and will help 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.260
 put it if understood, then let's put it 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.950
 the egg and now will give another little stir 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.080
 a little more generous, let's go 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.000
 Good, now we'll throw the water 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.400
 give a break so maybe you do not have 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.900
 that the sun would be 50 m then I will 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.970
 playing slowly the muse of the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.640
 half of it and we'll have a 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.019
 And I'm going to show it to you now. 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.810
 you a point she has to reach 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.090
 so he's playing by gradually adding 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.170
 and until we get to that point we're just you 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.780
 now 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.299
 8 will resign until the mass reaches this 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.329
 point here what you second time 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.080
 running slowly also play C is 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.460
 This is the point you have to reach. 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.830
 remembering that we only put the 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.550
 yeast a few minutes before you and 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.160
 fry 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.440
 so leave it until the time you 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.450
 to visit when you are military 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.240
 the yeast mixture and then begins his 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.800
 then fry the oil 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.020
 good staff then the other secret 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.780

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.150
 We 'll put our 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.250
 tool that our maceió as 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.680
 to incorporate mixing all over the island 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.830
 How wonderful and how are we going to do it? 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.050
 People going to pass a horse here. 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.550
 He screams until he calls the hopscotch yes 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.620
 but without browning 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.440
 we will take the spirit out of the 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.050
 mother created laws or 30 seconds that the 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.450
 people will try again 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.360
 Okay so you get your chameleon here. 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.280
 way of mass passage or gives a 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.830
 asked him to let a 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.140
 A little bit of maximum let's leave 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.300
 I did not choose mass day and then we 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.300
 life gets very easy, huh? 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.380
 I tried to put at most two trucks 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:37.800
 since it is not to cool the 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:39.900

 people take it and leave it here waiting 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.820
 and then we will do the others until 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:57.000
