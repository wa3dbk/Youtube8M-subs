00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 as it was we made contact with london 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.230
 with our partner Carlos Cons 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.960
 legaspi carlos then you have us 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.260
 talking about football but I know there's 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.600
 other things is that there was a lot of activity 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.130
 in the press room or in the ibc as you 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.750
 they call with a lot of athletes so 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.680
 count the charges we are given with 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.680
 really good night 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.400
 this is rafa hector and they say it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 I expected more in that in that debut of the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.350
 Mexican team let's see how it goes 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.660
 now with Senegalese and Swiss that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.489
 true also tied and well then 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.550
 mexico will be closing the activity of 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.870
 the group stage in cardiff there in what 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.519
 that is Welsh we are going to move to the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.699
 entity to this day here in the center 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.559
 of the press there was a lot of movement 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.659
 introduced the Serbian team for example 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.970
 with its best representatives and good 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.290
 precisely on that there is a controversy 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.239
 of which we are going to talk about we are going to 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.879
 remember more quickly four ago 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.739
 years in the 100 meters butterfly michael 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.809
 phelps arrived practically at the same 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 time that milorad cavic this serbian that 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.380
 he took the silver medal but go 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.200
 it was very controversial he talks to us 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.539
 precisely on that and highlights that the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.280
 problem is that the company that is the 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.320
 stopwatches or the one that clocked 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.830
 competitions is the same one that sponsors 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.830
 Michael Phelps 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.540
 look 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.360
 and yesterday he scored 6 and nobody sees 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.670
 for me 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 ah 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.580
 Well, there's the Cadiz thing that says 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.850
 the problem is not michael but the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.070
 sponsor who governs 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.050
 precisely all the time or all the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.330
 timing in swimming too 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.130
 was here roger federer that a 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.840
 difference four years ago arrives 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.330
 as the world number one makes 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.580
 precisely in beijing as he arrived and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.800
 he lost there that title he was wearing 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.990
 for four years since the games 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.300
 Athenian Olympians this entire cycle was 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.520
 the number one in the world he talks to us about 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.190
 precisely the difference between 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.140
 before and now and also the one that lost 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.090
 a few weeks ago just the number one 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.260
 from the world novak djokovic answered this 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.590
 question that we could do in the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.549
 action 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.549
 for two because we have been 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.999
 we could continue in other tournaments and 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.040
 we wanted here I think we're very much 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:06.549
 more prepared here than we were 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.549
 in Beijing 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.269
 because the generations are 55 years old 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.519
 I had to adapt my game to the 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.129
 new generations to be able 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.680
 face the new players in the 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.269
 tournaments 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.960
 and I am very satisfied with how he has 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:28.930
 Progressed in the last five years 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.440
 in such vehicles for clean but on 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.470
 regime 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:39.370
 extend green is likely the worst 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.370
 information door of the sun 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.569
 Well, there are the two best tennis players 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.810
 in this moment of the planet regrets 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.900
 in many circumstances the absence of 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.970
 rafa nadal is eradicated with some 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.130
 fellow Spanish journalists and then 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.360
 they regret that it is not because also the 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.340
 Spanish team since we already saw it 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.080
 also lost one for being honest in 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.060
 is in this debut in the games 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.860
 Olympic Games' is that it is getting complicated 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.510
 everything for the delegation among those who 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.370
 that responsibility of 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.650
 get a medal now in tennis 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.480
 david ferrer and fernando verdasco that we 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.190
 could he give these words also what 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.049
 we grab here in the press center 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.140
 we talked with him and this what he told us 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.940
 exclusively for the good fans is 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.280
 a hard draw but I think all the 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.580
 world has a hard drawing of the box is 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.970
 very difficult 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.430
 let's see us try to give our best and 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.610
 I hope that it arrives that arrives far but 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.960
 well as I say it is a difficult picture and 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.550
 maybe you can do it well get away 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.219
 how to lose in the first rounds 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.139
 because every game will be complicated and 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:44.180
 we will try to do it 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.280
 best possible if it is clear that 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.969
 but it will be amazing but it's something 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.009
 complicated because there is greenish 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:53.930
 because you want to remove some of the pressure 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.879
 very good memories you have of the tournament 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.669
 acapulco and he says he would love it 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:02.090
 come back every year to play there in 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.610
 mexico because rafa then nothing else ready 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.740
 for the inauguration tell us Carlos 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.599
 precisely what happens with integration is 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.969
 they have filtered some little things out there that 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.750
 of the countryside etc. and so on 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.500
 tell us what they have known 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.500
 you please 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.850
 the reality is that we know little what 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.030
 it has been circulated is that they went up 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.710
 some videos to youtube to other sites 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.350
 of the internet and the organizing committee 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.850
 managed to remove what was shown in the 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.130
 photos is that there is a kind of 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.800
 highway in what would be the track 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.230
 Olympic and in a simulation of what 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.810
 is anyone london London this wheel 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.810
 of fortune but go they tried to 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.460
 keep it a lot a lot in secrecy it 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.190
 talk that will be participating 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.460
 mohamed Ali and the organizing committee denied 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.870
 that is going to be chris today this cyclist 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.300
 because of the figures they had in 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.460
 beijing the one that lights the torch that 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.810
 it will be a decision that will be made until 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.930
 final and that probably not even 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.120
 be someone who has to do with the 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.010
 sport if it is that good will be let me 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.260
 we just know he was participating in the 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.520
 closing ceremony there in beijing 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.130
 when he takes the courier, it's like 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.220
 we will see that it is presented in a few hours 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.500
 here in london we are very aware 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.050
 and we hope to have a report tomorrow 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.160
 of what this ceremony is 27 million 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.080
 pounds which was reversed in this 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.000
 what filmmaker danny has prepared 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.170
 boyle recognized in the whole world good 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.350
 carlos we will be on the lookout for 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.880
 supposed good night thank you granola 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.140

 watching here also half television 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.730
 Well, practically nothing is missing 16 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.730
 hours with 8 minutes
