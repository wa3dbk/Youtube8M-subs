00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.460
 the 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.400
 all people and i want you 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.489
 today a relatively special knife again 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.510
 let's imagine, that's it 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.150
 so-called by the company linder the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.930
 pharma means all this I tell long 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.100
 No more is in the 50s 60s 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.000
 for the American and Canadian 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.680
 developed market 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.470
 Looks like this is a construction 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.960
 you can see now back here so 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.399
 he is done angularly and goes 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.250
 then hopefully a screw stuck 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.500
 Pulled because they keep the camera over again 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.920
 I think I'm stuck one time 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.390
 quite nice little detour knife and 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.619
 especially what I think is broken 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:39.729
 State again a great thing 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:43.060
 december looks so easy 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.060
 piece of driftwood 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.080
 so 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.730
 the bite is always so beautiful now 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.800
 relaunched by Linder 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.510
 been a limited edition so there 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.990
 are equal to a few 2000 pieces none 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.410
 I do not know the world right now 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:29.040
 and are hand forged sound from the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.690
 but want to get rid of these old stock 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.370
 I think it's just cool uhrig knows 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.310
 maybe one or the other of 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.860
 grandpa or father and are somewhere 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.000
 rusts in the corner is located or 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.300
 grabbed a bit wobbly 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.120
 there you are as a child not that 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.350
 you can still tighten the thing 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.170
 even if it works you can get here 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:57.350
 behind the back of the whole thing 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.260
 pull and fix is ​​not a knife to 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.140
 emphasize or fell to the trees 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.660
 but I'll say a picture or work 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.910
 when you see fish later then the 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.140
 fresh with except met all times 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:19.050
 his purposes have gone through a bit 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.769
 like blade maria rod in s-shape and 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.660
 yes really quite intervene for me 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:29.250
 now just as said back 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:32.550
 so brass barrel and leather and brass 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:37.860
 In between, a funny little board 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:42.300
 knife so I think it's quite funny 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.160
 made says is in the 50s 60s export 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.459
 to america a few are also with us 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.280
 landed 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:55.069
 very important part 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.069
 and as I said after cutting work 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:12.220
 the part can be super use 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.430
 Let's get to the leather sheath that is 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.710
 Now as I said not the brüller but 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:27.890
 As I said, its purpose is here 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.800
 secured with rivets that you can not clean 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:35.450
 cuts and I think the thing has 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.080
 just something nostalgic that 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.080
 is working 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.419
 that linda pharma 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.819
 exclude fish 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.910
 quite simply here at the back 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.910
 insert heidi at the fin 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.259
 here the bubble 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.590
 or as bait 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.189
