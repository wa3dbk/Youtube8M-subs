00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
huh I mid-table they're over there by

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.650 
huh I mid-table they're over there by
the<00:00:02.970> lamp<00:00:04.730> no<00:00:05.730> no<00:00:05.970> don't<00:00:06.180> change<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.480> lights

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
the lamp no no don't change the lights

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.950 
the lamp no no don't change the lights
Oh<00:00:06.839> cheese<00:00:07.140> laughs<00:00:11.000> now<00:00:12.000> my<00:00:12.240> calibration<00:00:12.630> is

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
Oh cheese laughs now my calibration is

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.660 
Oh cheese laughs now my calibration is
at<00:00:13.080> least<00:00:13.230> online<00:00:14.160> but<00:00:14.460> I've<00:00:14.549> already

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
at least online but I've already

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.250 
at least online but I've already
calibrated<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.480> don't<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.750> time<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.109> do

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
calibrated and I don't have time to do

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.510 
calibrated and I don't have time to do
it<00:00:16.550> so<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.869> what<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:19.949> wanted<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.250> show<00:00:20.400> we

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
it so I so what we wanted to show we

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.759 
it so I so what we wanted to show we
just<00:00:20.699> took<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.939> demo<00:00:21.180> almost<00:00:21.570> as<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.230> add

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
just took this demo almost as is and add

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.419 
just took this demo almost as is and add
it<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:26.420> add<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.830> graphical<00:00:28.830> user<00:00:28.920> interface

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
it in add it in graphical user interface

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.060 
it in add it in graphical user interface
all<00:00:29.939> right<00:00:30.359> video<00:00:31.199> user<00:00:31.410> interface<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:31.949> now

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
all right video user interface so now

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.920 
all right video user interface so now
when<00:00:32.250> i<00:00:32.279> move<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> sword<00:00:32.820> around<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.809> my

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
when i move the sword around with my

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.229 
when i move the sword around with my
hand<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:35.370> moves<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> sword<00:00:36.000> on

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
hand you can see it moves the sword on

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.200 
hand you can see it moves the sword on
the<00:00:36.480> screen<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.530> cannot<00:00:37.860> actually<00:00:38.820> tilt

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the screen and we cannot actually tilt

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.150 
the screen and we cannot actually tilt
it<00:00:39.450> category<00:00:39.989> let<00:00:40.290> me<00:00:40.350> switch<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.920> one

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it category let me switch to this one

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.209 
it category let me switch to this one
here<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.090> room<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:43.100> can<00:00:44.100> actually

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
here in this room I can actually

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.979 
here in this room I can actually
interact<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.850> these<00:00:44.940> bubbles<00:00:45.390> by<00:00:45.719> moving

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
interact with these bubbles by moving

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.790 
interact with these bubbles by moving
the<00:00:46.079> sword<00:00:47.899> you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.050> chop<00:00:49.320> them<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the sword you can chop them and then a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.470 
the sword you can chop them and then a
pop<00:00:50.070> or<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.820> tap<00:00:51.030> them<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.390> then

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
pop or you can just tap them and then

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.319 
pop or you can just tap them and then
move<00:00:51.750> I'll<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.739> pop<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.340> them<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.180> then

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
move I'll just pop some of them and then

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.729 
move I'll just pop some of them and then
we<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.629> other<00:00:54.809> object<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.469> pick<00:00:55.620> up

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
we have this other object if I pick up

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.170 
we have this other object if I pick up
this<00:00:55.829> object<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> ball<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
this object this is like a ball and a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.849 
this object this is like a ball and a
chain<00:00:57.449> Nichelle's<00:00:58.320> kind<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> physical

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
chain Nichelle's kind of a physical

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.880 
chain Nichelle's kind of a physical
simulation<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:01.140> want<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> lower<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> life<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
simulation you want to lower the life a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.290 
simulation you want to lower the life a
little<00:01:02.039> bit<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.520> don't<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.180> guys

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
little bit I don't know I can you guys

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:12.950 
little bit I don't know I can you guys
see<00:01:07.189> okay<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.180> thing<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> we're<00:01:12.780> really

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
see okay so the thing is we're really

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
see okay so the thing is we're really
tracking<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.590> ball<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.040> 3d<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.939> know

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
tracking this ball in 3d because we know

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.090 
tracking this ball in 3d because we know
its<00:01:15.240> size<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.840> advance<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.799> actually

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
its size in advance so I can actually

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.460 
its size in advance so I can actually
spin<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> ball<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> third<00:01:18.900> dimension<00:01:19.080> if

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
spin the ball in the third dimension if

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.929 
spin the ball in the third dimension if
I<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> thing<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> chain<00:01:20.790> will

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
I get the thing going the chain will

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.149 
I get the thing going the chain will
really<00:01:21.150> start<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> whip<00:01:21.630> around<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> 3d

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
really start to whip around like a 3d

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.719 
really start to whip around like a 3d
change<00:01:23.460> should<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.619> kind<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.159> is

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
change should and and that kind of is

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.760 
change should and and that kind of is
subtle<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.299> very<00:01:27.509> important<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.619> do

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
subtle but very important that we can do

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 
subtle but very important that we can do
that<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.130> know<00:01:29.329> if<00:01:30.329> otherwise<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.900> just

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that you know if otherwise if you just

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.800 
that you know if otherwise if you just
have<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.500> D<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.860> always<00:01:32.130> moving<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
have to D it's always moving like this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.600 
have to D it's always moving like this
so<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.960> third<00:01:34.170> dimension<00:01:34.590> really<00:01:34.829> makes<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
so that third dimension really makes it

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.410 
so that third dimension really makes it
feel<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> whale<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.290> imagine<00:01:38.150> never<00:01:39.150> really

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
feel like a whale I imagine never really

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.460 
feel like a whale I imagine never really
used<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> flail<00:01:40.460> but<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.990> other<00:01:43.259> neat

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
used the flail but and the other neat

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.719 
used the flail but and the other neat
thing<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> showed<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.610> this

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
thing is we kind of showed with this

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.910 
thing is we kind of showed with this
demo<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> rigid<00:01:46.259> object<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.770> that's

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
demo this is a rigid object and that's

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.030 
demo this is a rigid object and that's
like<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.329> articulated<00:01:48.329> object<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.740> still

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
like a articulated object but it still

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.069 
like a articulated object but it still
feels<00:01:50.220> neat<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.970> good<00:01:51.180> control<00:01:51.479> interface

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
feels neat in a good control interface

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.230 
feels neat in a good control interface
to<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.250> don't<00:01:53.369> always<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.909> map

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
to do it so you don't always have to map

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.270 
to do it so you don't always have to map
literally<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.079> something<00:01:55.439> object<00:01:56.130> it's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
literally to something object it's

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.740 
literally to something object it's
exactly<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.390> map<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
exactly what you have you can map it to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.060 
exactly what you have you can map it to
something<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.350> makes<00:01:58.530> sense<00:01:58.880> so

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
something that just makes sense so

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.490 
something that just makes sense so
that's<00:02:02.060> controllable<00:02:02.690> so<00:02:02.990> now<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.140> can<00:02:03.200> do<00:02:03.440> it

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
that's controllable so now I can do it

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.580 
that's controllable so now I can do it
but<00:02:03.710> at<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.950> same<00:02:04.130> time<00:02:05.260> really<00:02:06.260> get<00:02:06.470> going

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
but at the same time really get going

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.340 
but at the same time really get going
here<00:02:06.920> then<00:02:08.440> let's<00:02:09.440> go<00:02:09.560> back<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.770> this<00:02:09.979> room<00:02:10.190> I

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
here then let's go back to this room I

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.540 
here then let's go back to this room I
can<00:02:12.350> do<00:02:12.470> all<00:02:12.709> three<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.130> them<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.400> can

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
can do all three of them and you can

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.949 
can do all three of them and you can
actually<00:02:16.700> light<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.240> candle<00:02:17.510> with<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
actually light that candle with the

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.750 
actually light that candle with the
porch<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.860> me<00:02:19.010> when<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.220> move<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.490> torch

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
porch and this me when I move the torch

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.070 
porch and this me when I move the torch
at<00:02:20.000> cast<00:02:20.330> shadows<00:02:20.840> I'm<00:02:21.740> so<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.510> this

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
at cast shadows I'm so so this is this

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.150 
at cast shadows I'm so so this is this
was<00:02:24.230> showing<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:24.770> already<00:02:24.980> had<00:02:25.130> this

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
was showing that we already had this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160 
was showing that we already had this
demo<00:02:25.610> already<00:02:25.940> created<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.360> show<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.570> real<00:02:26.900> game

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
demo already created to show a real game

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.710 
demo already created to show a real game
like<00:02:27.470> graphics<00:02:28.160> we<00:02:28.820> slapped<00:02:29.180> all<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
like graphics we slapped all this the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.540 
like graphics we slapped all this the
tough<00:02:29.930> up<00:02:30.080> over<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.500> top<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.220> still

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
tough up over the top of that and still

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.850 
tough up over the top of that and still
made<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.760> run<00:02:32.000> real<00:02:32.450> time<00:02:32.630> when<00:02:33.500> we<00:02:33.590> did<00:02:33.739> this

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
made it run real time when we did this

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.470 
made it run real time when we did this
demo<00:02:34.160> originally<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:34.670> was<00:02:34.700> 30<00:02:35.150> frames<00:02:35.390> per

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
demo originally it was 30 frames per

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.350 
demo originally it was 30 frames per
second<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.110> when<00:02:36.950> people<00:02:37.190> try<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.489> they<00:02:38.000> feel

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
second and when people try it they feel

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.060 
second and when people try it they feel
the<00:02:38.510> lag<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.989> little<00:02:39.230> bit<00:02:39.350> too<00:02:39.500> much<00:02:39.620> they<00:02:39.830> feel

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
the lag a little bit too much they feel

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.680 
the lag a little bit too much they feel
as<00:02:40.280> they<00:02:40.400> go<00:02:40.550> it's<00:02:40.730> really<00:02:40.970> precise<00:02:41.300> but<00:02:41.570> it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
as they go it's really precise but it

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.780 
as they go it's really precise but it
just<00:02:41.810> has<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.410> little<00:02:42.530> too<00:02:42.680> much<00:02:42.830> like<00:02:42.950> when<00:02:43.730> he

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
just has a little too much like when he

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.180 
just has a little too much like when he
got<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.060> 60<00:02:44.570> Hertz<00:02:44.720> camera<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.320> feels<00:02:45.739> so<00:02:46.010> much

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
got the 60 Hertz camera it feels so much

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.240 
got the 60 Hertz camera it feels so much
better<00:02:46.570> so<00:02:47.570> it's<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.410> huge<00:02:48.440> difference<00:02:48.980> from

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
better so it's a huge difference from

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.310 
better so it's a huge difference from
the<00:02:49.400> 30<00:02:49.610> Hertz<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.000> 60<00:02:50.330> Hertz<00:02:50.510> for<00:02:51.170> that

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
the 30 Hertz to the 60 Hertz for that

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.509 
the 30 Hertz to the 60 Hertz for that
kind<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.620> stuff<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:53.570> uh<00:02:54.190> switch<00:02:55.190> back<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.400> the

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
kind of stuff so uh switch back to the

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.230 
kind of stuff so uh switch back to the
talk<00:02:56.230> please
