crucible<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.099> how<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.460> craft<00:00:08.940> stuff<00:00:09.210> using

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
crucible and how to craft stuff using

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.280 
crucible and how to craft stuff using
the<00:00:09.690> crucible

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
the crucible

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.379 
the crucible
so<00:00:10.920> first<00:00:11.160> up<00:00:11.340> will<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.550> want<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.759> get<00:00:11.880> what

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
on makan go to the alchemy tab on the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.310 
on makan go to the alchemy tab on the
left<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.580> find<00:00:17.850> night<00:00:18.359> all<00:00:18.539> night<00:00:18.750> all<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.230> the

left and find night all night all is the
most<00:00:19.500> basic<00:00:20.449> research<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.810> do<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.109> it

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
most basic research we can do and it

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.470 
most basic research we can do and it
will<00:00:22.769> help<00:00:22.949> create<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> more<00:00:23.910> crucible<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
will help create a more crucible and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.000 
will help create a more crucible and
using<00:00:24.779> our<00:00:24.900> crucible<00:00:25.289> without<00:00:25.560> burning<00:00:25.740> our

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
using our crucible without burning our

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.599 
using our crucible without burning our
house<00:00:26.160> down<00:00:26.900> so<00:00:27.900> let's<00:00:28.109> get<00:00:28.199> into<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.529> click<00:00:29.310> to

get the research note stick the research
note<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.130> your<00:00:32.189> table<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.180> scribing

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
note in your table with your scribing

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.900 
note in your table with your scribing
tools<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
tools and as you see here it's just a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.080 
tools and as you see here it's just a
basic<00:00:36.120> lux<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.899> ignis<00:00:37.440> Ignace<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.160> lux<00:00:38.399> join

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
basic lux and ignis Ignace and lux join

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.410 
basic lux and ignis Ignace and lux join
very<00:00:39.960> simply<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.149> stick<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
very simply like that so if I stick a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.049 
very simply like that so if I stick a
Lux<00:00:42.660> there<00:00:43.010> that's<00:00:44.010> joint<00:00:44.309> if<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.610> stick<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> look

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
Lux there that's joint if I stick a look

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.610 
Lux there that's joint if I stick a look
Ignace<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.230> ignis<00:00:46.739> there<00:00:46.980> ya<00:00:48.469> na<00:00:49.469> take

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
Ignace there and ignis there ya na take

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.100 
Ignace there and ignis there ya na take
this<00:00:49.800> Ignace<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.030> there<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.390> then

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
this Ignace there and there and then

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.750 
this Ignace there and there and then
what<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.620> join<00:00:52.980> them<00:00:53.160> just

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
what can I do join them just

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.729 
what can I do join them just
sticklebacks<00:00:54.180> between<00:00:54.449> them<00:00:54.570> boom<00:00:55.379> there<00:00:55.710> we

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
sticklebacks between them boom there we

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.160 
sticklebacks between them boom there we
go<00:00:55.949> night<00:00:56.219> all<00:00:56.399> discovered<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.750> night<00:00:58.020> on

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
go night all discovered so with night on

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.189 
go night all discovered so with night on
your<00:00:58.379> invent<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.370> hotbar<00:00:59.840> learn<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.989> by

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
your invent in your hotbar learn it by

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.520 
your invent in your hotbar learn it by
research<00:01:01.770> completing<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.960> form

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
research completing so now when you form

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.740 
research completing so now when you form
a<00:01:04.589> nomicon<00:01:04.890> night<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.700> has<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> shiny<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.570> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
a nomicon night or has a shiny bit and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.899 
a nomicon night or has a shiny bit and
if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.530> click<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.890> again<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.520> show<00:01:08.729> us

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
if you click it again it will show us

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.840 
if you click it again it will show us
how<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.299> creat<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.650> let's<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
how to creat it so let's get on to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.370 
how to creat it so let's get on to
making<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> crucible<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.720> crucible<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
making a crucible so for crucible you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.469 
making a crucible so for crucible you
will<00:01:16.500> want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.680> make<00:01:16.740> sure<00:01:17.479> nothing's

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
will want to make sure nothing's

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.420 
will want to make sure nothing's
farmable<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.040> should<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.700> safe<00:01:21.200> but

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
farmable I think this should be safe but

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.070 
farmable I think this should be safe but
we'll<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> wait<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.420> won't<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.780> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
we'll have to wait and see won't we so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.039 
we'll have to wait and see won't we so
first<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.220> want<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> make<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> cauldron<00:01:27.049> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
first up you want to make a cauldron to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.300 
first up you want to make a cauldron to
make<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> cauldron<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.770> basically<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310

same<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.020> iron<00:01:31.020> legs<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.560> opposite<00:01:31.950> way

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
same as a iron legs but opposite way

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.340 
same as a iron legs but opposite way
around<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:33.180> will<00:01:33.360> make<00:01:33.479> cauldron<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350

used so with your cauldron you want to

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840 
used so with your cauldron you want to
make<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.840> fire<00:01:46.140> pit<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.890> lava<00:01:47.100> pit<00:01:47.369> so

make a little fire pit or a lava pit so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.359 
make a little fire pit or a lava pit so
sticks<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.720> never<00:01:48.840> act<00:01:48.990> down<00:01:49.159> like<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.280> up

then<00:01:52.229> next<00:01:52.470> put<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.070> cauldron<00:01:53.490> above<00:01:53.880> it

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
then next put your cauldron above it

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.889 
then next put your cauldron above it
like<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.759> fire<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.329> heating<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
like that so the fire is heating the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.499 
like that so the fire is heating the
cauldron<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:59.009> make<00:01:59.820> sure<00:01:59.850> you've<00:02:00.090> got<00:02:00.119> wand

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
cauldron then make sure you've got wand

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.109 
cauldron then make sure you've got wand

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
right-click the cauldron this will turn

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.819 
right-click the cauldron this will turn
it<00:02:06.210> into<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.420> crucible<00:02:06.810> using<00:02:07.409> some<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.710> your

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
it into a crucible using some of your

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.820 
it into a crucible using some of your
vis<00:02:09.020> next<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.080> want<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> put<00:02:10.349> some<00:02:10.470> water<00:02:10.590> in

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
vis next you want to put some water in

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.240 
vis next you want to put some water in
it

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
it

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.920 
it
so<00:02:12.460> this<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.730> our<00:02:12.820> cauldron<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.600> all<00:02:13.750> set

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
so this is our cauldron this is all set

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.900 
so this is our cauldron this is all set
up<00:02:13.960> it's<00:02:14.680> got<00:02:14.860> little<00:02:14.980> ingredients<00:02:15.580> it's<00:02:15.760> got

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
up it's got little ingredients it's got

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.190 
up it's got little ingredients it's got
is<00:02:16.060> heated<00:02:16.510> if<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:17.260> hear<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.970> wait<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.390> see

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
is heated if you hear to wait for it see

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.750 
is heated if you hear to wait for it see
that<00:02:20.380> that's<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.920> burning<00:02:21.160> me<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:21.610> because

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
that that's it burning me but because

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.190 
that that's it burning me but because
I'm<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.120> creative<00:02:22.330> mode<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:22.780> not<00:02:22.870> doing<00:02:23.080> any

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
I'm in creative mode it's not doing any

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.150 
I'm in creative mode it's not doing any
damage<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:26.290> now<00:02:26.410> let's<00:02:26.620> look<00:02:26.680> back<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.070> our

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
damage so now let's look back in our

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.100 
damage so now let's look back in our
Foreman<00:02:27.430> our<00:02:27.520> makan<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.420> research<00:02:28.810> from

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
Foreman our makan so the research from

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.360 
Foreman our makan so the research from
night<00:02:29.260> or<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.940> need<00:02:31.120> Ignace<00:02:31.750> Lux<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.890> Paddy

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
night or is we need Ignace Lux and Paddy

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.450 
night or is we need Ignace Lux and Paddy
and<00:02:33.640> put<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.180> potentia

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
and put in potentia

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.450 
and put in potentia
we've<00:02:37.060> glowstone<00:02:37.510> dust<00:02:37.570> afterwards<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:39.130> first

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
we've glowstone dust afterwards so first

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.430 
we've glowstone dust afterwards so first
we<00:02:39.610> want<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.820> get<00:02:39.970> these<00:02:40.180> aspects<00:02:40.780> inside<00:02:41.230> it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
we want to get these aspects inside it

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.150 
we want to get these aspects inside it
so<00:02:42.280> Ignace<00:02:42.820> of<00:02:42.970> Lux<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:44.230> can<00:02:44.500> be<00:02:44.680> from<00:02:45.010> a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
so Ignace of Lux that can be from a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.460 
so Ignace of Lux that can be from a
torch<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.850> believe<00:02:46.320> if<00:02:47.320> we<00:02:47.530> look<00:02:47.680> at<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.830> torch

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
torch I believe if we look at a torch

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.130 
torch I believe if we look at a torch
get<00:02:50.470> some<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.800> them<00:02:51.570> on<00:02:52.570> it

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
get some of them on it

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.570 
get some of them on it
so<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:54.840> torch<00:02:55.840> will<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:56.320> give<00:02:56.470> us<00:02:56.590> lux<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.130> we

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
so a torch will just give us lux and we

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.570 
so a torch will just give us lux and we
needed<00:02:57.790> how<00:02:58.090> many<00:02:58.240> Lux<00:02:58.480> was<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.810> free<00:02:59.470> lux<00:02:59.680> so

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
needed how many Lux was it free lux so

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.550 
needed how many Lux was it free lux so
free<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.880> these<00:03:01.000> torches<00:03:01.420> will<00:03:01.540> do<00:03:01.660> but<00:03:02.440> I

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
free of these torches will do but I

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.660 
free of these torches will do but I
wouldn't<00:03:02.770> put<00:03:02.890> them<00:03:03.040> in<00:03:03.160> yet<00:03:03.340> make<00:03:03.550> sure

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
wouldn't put them in yet make sure

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.220 
wouldn't put them in yet make sure
you've<00:03:03.790> got<00:03:03.940> all<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.450> resources<00:03:04.870> before

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
you've got all of the resources before

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.860 
you've got all of the resources before
you<00:03:05.320> put<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.370> coal<00:03:07.030> will<00:03:07.510> give<00:03:07.720> us

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
you put it in so coal will give us

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.890 
you put it in so coal will give us
Ignace<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.680> potentia<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.720> we<00:03:10.959> get<00:03:11.250> 8<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.400> them

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
Ignace and potentia so we get 8 of them

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.090 
Ignace and potentia so we get 8 of them
we<00:03:13.900> needed<00:03:15.090> free<00:03:16.090> potentia<00:03:16.600> free<00:03:16.989> agnes<00:03:17.320> i

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
we needed free potentia free agnes i

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.940 
we needed free potentia free agnes i
went<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.700> bit<00:03:18.790> overboard<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:19.959> coal<00:03:20.320> gives<00:03:20.769> to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
went a bit overboard so coal gives to

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.070 
went a bit overboard so coal gives to
potential<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.670> Ignace<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.090> we<00:03:22.180> need<00:03:22.300> to

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
potential and to Ignace so we need to

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.390 
potential and to Ignace so we need to
coal<00:03:23.350> have<00:03:24.300> free<00:03:25.300> torches<00:03:25.800> so<00:03:26.800> first<00:03:27.070> we<00:03:27.250> put

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
coal have free torches so first we put

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.699 
coal have free torches so first we put
the<00:03:28.860> coal<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:31.420> if<00:03:31.660> with<00:03:32.230> your<00:03:32.380> goggles<00:03:32.650> are

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.720 
see it drain that potentia so you want
to<00:04:08.290> be<00:04:08.380> quick<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:09.070> want<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.370> make<00:04:09.459> sure<00:04:09.489> you've

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
to be quick you want to make sure you've

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.000 
to be quick you want to make sure you've
got<00:04:09.970> all<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.239> ingredients<00:04:10.330> beforehand<00:04:11.170> so

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
got all the ingredients beforehand so

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.610 
got all the ingredients beforehand so
that's<00:04:12.190> how<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.340> use<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.580> crucible<00:04:12.940> I<00:04:13.870> did<00:04:14.500> it

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
that's how to use a crucible I did it

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.199 
that's how to use a crucible I did it
quite<00:04:14.830> efficiently<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.580> quite<00:04:15.730> effectively

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
quite efficiently and quite effectively

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.909 
quite efficiently and quite effectively
so<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:16.510> didn't<00:04:16.750> notice<00:04:16.989> any<00:04:17.140> like<00:04:17.380> purple

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
so you didn't notice any like purple

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.240 
so you didn't notice any like purple
stuff<00:04:18.220> spew<00:04:19.000> out<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.359> top<00:04:19.600> but<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.560> can<00:04:20.890> go

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
stuff spew out of the top but it can go

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.750 
stuff spew out of the top but it can go
wrong

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
wrong

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.750 
wrong
for<00:04:22.090> example<00:04:23.039> chuck<00:04:24.039> that<00:04:24.220> in<00:04:24.340> there<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.700> then

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
for example chuck that in there and then

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.590 
for example chuck that in there and then
just

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
just

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.590 
just
I'm<00:04:26.140> right<00:04:26.530> in<00:04:26.650> there<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.640> then<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:27.850> know<00:04:28.240> just

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
I'm right in there and then I know just

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.190 
I'm right in there and then I know just
stick<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.780> in<00:04:28.930> there<00:04:30.720> stick<00:04:31.720> some<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:31.990> that

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
stick that in there stick some of that

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.270 
stick that in there stick some of that
and<00:04:32.500> boom<00:04:33.780> look<00:04:34.780> at<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:35.680> purple<00:04:36.100> stuff

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
and boom look at that that purple stuff

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.320 
and boom look at that that purple stuff
is<00:04:36.460> flux<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.960> will<00:04:38.140> some<00:04:39.100> of<00:04:39.220> it's<00:04:39.370> like<00:04:40.060> air

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
is flux it will some of it's like air

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.000 
is flux it will some of it's like air
basically<00:04:41.080> it<00:04:41.170> floats<00:04:41.410> to<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.560> top<00:04:41.650> of<00:04:41.920> the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
basically it floats to the top of the

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.200 
basically it floats to the top of the
ceiling<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.310> it'll<00:04:42.550> stick<00:04:42.730> there<00:04:42.880> for<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.030> bit

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
ceiling and it'll stick there for a bit

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.290 
ceiling and it'll stick there for a bit
and<00:04:43.390> some<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.140> it<00:04:44.260> spills<00:04:44.890> over<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:46.060> best<00:04:46.210> way

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
and some of it spills over the best way

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.360 
and some of it spills over the best way
to<00:04:46.390> get<00:04:46.600> rid<00:04:46.720> of<00:04:46.780> it<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.080> I've<00:04:47.170> noticed<00:04:47.590> it's

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
to get rid of it that I've noticed it's

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.290 
to get rid of it that I've noticed it's
just<00:04:48.580> place<00:04:48.730> a<00:04:48.760> block<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.180> it<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.740> smash<00:04:51.100> it

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
just place a block on it and smash it

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.320 
just place a block on it and smash it
and<00:04:53.040> then<00:04:54.040> to<00:04:54.160> empty<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:54.520> crucible<00:04:54.880> if<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.150> want

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
and then to empty a crucible if you want

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.440 
and then to empty a crucible if you want
to<00:04:55.450> empty<00:04:55.690> it<00:04:55.810> from<00:04:56.170> aspects<00:04:57.070> just<00:04:57.760> shift<00:04:58.120> and

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
to empty it from aspects just shift and

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
to empty it from aspects just shift and
right<00:04:59.200> click<00:04:59.260> again<00:04:59.650> on<00:04:59.710> it<00:04:59.890> and<00:05:00.900> there<00:05:01.900> gets

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
right click again on it and there gets

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.620 
right click again on it and there gets
rid<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.710> all<00:05:02.920> the<00:05:03.070> aspects<00:05:03.520> put<00:05:03.790> loads<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.270> flux

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
rid of all the aspects put loads of flux

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.170 
rid of all the aspects put loads of flux
spews<00:05:05.020> out<00:05:05.280> so<00:05:06.280> like<00:05:06.430> I<00:05:06.460> said<00:05:06.580> get<00:05:06.850> rid<00:05:06.880> of<00:05:07.060> it

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
spews out so like I said get rid of it

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.980 
spews out so like I said get rid of it
just<00:05:07.210> place<00:05:08.020> place<00:05:08.500> place<00:05:08.530> place<00:05:09.040> place<00:05:09.990> smash

all<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.630> flux<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:19.990> gone<00:05:20.200> I'm<00:05:20.830> sure<00:05:21.070> it<00:05:21.250> did<00:05:21.400> no

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
all the flux is gone I'm sure it did no

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.320 
all the flux is gone I'm sure it did no
harm<00:05:21.730> to<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.480> area<00:05:23.470> at<00:05:23.680> all<00:05:23.950> so<00:05:24.760> the<00:05:24.880> reason<00:05:25.210> we

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
harm to the area at all so the reason we

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.290 
harm to the area at all so the reason we
learn<00:05:25.480> flat<00:05:25.840> at<00:05:26.080> night<00:05:26.470> or<00:05:26.620> is<00:05:27.370> because<00:05:28.060> it's<00:05:28.210> a

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
learn flat at night or is because it's a

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.040 
learn flat at night or is because it's a
better<00:05:30.000> replacement<00:05:31.000> for<00:05:31.450> fire<00:05:31.690> or<00:05:31.900> lava

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
better replacement for fire or lava

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.630 
better replacement for fire or lava
because<00:05:32.710> it<00:05:32.830> can't<00:05:33.100> burn<00:05:33.730> the<00:05:34.120> wood<00:05:35.370> but<00:05:36.370> it

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
because it can't burn the wood but it

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.640 
because it can't burn the wood but it
also<00:05:36.820> counts<00:05:37.240> as<00:05:37.300> a<00:05:37.390> heat<00:05:37.570> source<00:05:37.720> so<00:05:38.470> if<00:05:38.530> we

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
also counts as a heat source so if we

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.170 
also counts as a heat source so if we
put<00:05:38.830> that<00:05:38.980> there<00:05:39.250> I<00:05:39.460> don't<00:05:39.790> know<00:05:39.850> just<00:05:40.060> stick

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
put that there I don't know just stick

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:47.700 
put that there I don't know just stick
that<00:05:40.210> there<00:05:40.890> if<00:05:41.890> we<00:05:42.010> get<00:05:42.160> some<00:05:42.400> water<00:05:46.140> this<00:05:47.140> see

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
that there if we get some water this see

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.760 
that there if we get some water this see
the<00:05:48.250> night<00:05:48.460> all<00:05:48.610> is<00:05:48.640> heating<00:05:48.970> it<00:05:49.090> up<00:05:49.380> so<00:05:50.380> that's

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
the night all is heating it up so that's

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.370 
the night all is heating it up so that's
basically<00:05:51.730> the<00:05:51.850> tutorial<00:05:52.420> I<00:05:52.600> hope<00:05:53.050> you<00:05:53.110> guys
