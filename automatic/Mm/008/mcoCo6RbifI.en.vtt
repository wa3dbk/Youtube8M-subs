this<00:01:45.920> is<00:01:46.130> done<00:01:46.340> for<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.700> learn<00:01:46.880> function<00:01:47.390> or

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
this is done for the learn function or

00:01:47.720 --> 00:02:13.080 
this is done for the learn function or

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
controllers lots of ways in which you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.780 
controllers lots of ways in which you
can<00:02:17.960> assign<00:02:18.260> commands<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.430> software

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
can assign commands and the software

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.730
