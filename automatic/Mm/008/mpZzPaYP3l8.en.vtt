operates is you have to hold place one

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.710 
operates is you have to hold place one
on<00:00:22.199> each<00:00:22.470> side<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:23.490> well<00:00:23.789> as<00:00:23.939> there's<00:00:24.180> controls

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
on each side as well as there's controls

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.470 
on each side as well as there's controls
on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> opposite<00:00:25.410> side<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.760> vacuum<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
on the opposite side for the vacuum and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.900 
on the opposite side for the vacuum and
put<00:00:27.660> an<00:00:27.750> airfield<00:00:28.099> this<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.429> back<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
put an airfield this is the back of the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.269 
put an airfield this is the back of the
air<00:00:30.300> feed<00:00:30.539> folder<00:00:30.929> there<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:32.070> three

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
air feed folder there are three

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.100 
air feed folder there are three
different<00:00:32.460> controls<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:33.870> one

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
different controls here you have one

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.830 
different controls here you have one
that's<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> white<00:00:35.040> paper<00:00:35.430> guide<00:00:35.840> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that's for the white paper guide the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.709 
that's for the white paper guide the
second<00:00:37.230> one<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.770> air<00:00:38.040> visit<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.300> adjusts

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
second one is for air visit this adjusts

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.600 
second one is for air visit this adjusts
the<00:00:39.809> air<00:00:40.050> flow<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.860> either<00:00:41.040> increase

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the air flow so you can either increase

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.229 
the air flow so you can either increase
or<00:00:41.879> decrease<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.840> amount<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.500> air<00:00:43.710> flow

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
or decrease the amount of air flow

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.389 
or decrease the amount of air flow
depending<00:00:45.239> upon<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.899> stack<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> paper<00:00:47.219> that

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
depending upon the stack of paper that

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.520 
depending upon the stack of paper that
she<00:00:47.550> load<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.000> say<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> hopper<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
she load and say the hopper and then the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.410 
she load and say the hopper and then the
last<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.370> vacuum<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.090> what

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
last one is the vacuum this is what

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660 
last one is the vacuum this is what
actually<00:00:51.629> pulls<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.010> sheets<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
actually pulls in the sheets one at a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.090 
actually pulls in the sheets one at a
time<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.110> gauge<00:00:55.770> there

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
time and then you have the gauge there

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.260 
time and then you have the gauge there
which<00:00:57.030> lets<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.570> how<00:00:58.910> how<00:00:59.910> much<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
which lets you know how how much of a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.950 
which lets you know how how much of a
vacuum<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.930> pulling<00:01:02.059> one<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.239> are

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
vacuum that is pulling one we are

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.320 
vacuum that is pulling one we are
showing<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.409> back<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
showing this back here this is the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.730 
showing this back here this is the
second<00:01:06.689> full<00:01:06.869> Nick<00:01:07.080> that's<00:01:07.229> look<00:01:07.409> at<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.650> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
second full Nick that's look at it in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.429 
second full Nick that's look at it in
the<00:01:07.860> back<00:01:08.360> when<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.510> need<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> make<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the back when you need to make the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.230 
the back when you need to make the
adjustment<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> type<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.580> foliage<00:01:11.880> which

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
adjustment for the type of foliage which

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.090 
adjustment for the type of foliage which
to<00:01:12.360> produce<00:01:12.479> let's<00:01:12.930> say<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.320> case<00:01:13.380> we're

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to produce let's say in this case we're

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.460 
to produce let's say in this case we're
going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.369> doing<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.850> letter<00:01:15.119> pull<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
going to be doing a letter pull so I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.469 
going to be doing a letter pull so I
want<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> set<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.130> at<00:01:17.310> s<00:01:17.549> which<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.270> right

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
want to set it at s which is right

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.410 
want to set it at s which is right
behind<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.990> bar<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> set<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.210> on

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
behind this bar here and so I set it on

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.960 
behind this bar here and so I set it on
either

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
either

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.740 
either
side<00:01:22.440> for<00:01:23.440> analytical<00:01:24.040> so<00:01:24.970> I<00:01:25.030> got<00:01:25.210> it<00:01:25.330> set<00:01:25.510> here

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
side for analytical so I got it set here

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.380 
side for analytical so I got it set here
and<00:01:25.930> I'm<00:01:26.050> just<00:01:26.350> gonna<00:01:26.440> load<00:01:26.710> this<00:01:26.890> into<00:01:27.390> this

this is the exit area of the paper

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.260 
this is the exit area of the paper
folder<00:01:35.710> there<00:01:36.370> is<00:01:36.400> this<00:01:36.670> guide<00:01:36.910> that's

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
folder there is this guide that's

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.350 
folder there is this guide that's
printed<00:01:37.690> for<00:01:37.930> your<00:01:38.140> convenience<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:40.210> you

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
printed for your convenience all you

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.090 
printed for your convenience all you
have<00:01:40.480> to<00:01:40.600> do<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.900> simply<00:01:41.230> reference<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.860> type

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
have to do is simply reference the type

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.830 
have to do is simply reference the type
of<00:01:42.130> fool<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:43.090> need<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.300> produce<00:01:43.450> and

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
of fool that you need to produce and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.840 
of fool that you need to produce and
then<00:01:44.350> this<00:01:44.530> sheath<00:01:44.890> size<00:01:45.160> that<00:01:45.490> you're<00:01:45.670> using

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
then this sheath size that you're using

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.420 
then this sheath size that you're using
so<00:01:46.480> in<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:46.660> case<00:01:46.870> we<00:01:47.050> have<00:01:47.170> letter<00:01:47.380> as<00:01:47.950> equal

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
so in this case we have letter as equal

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.630 
so in this case we have letter as equal
double<00:01:48.880> half<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.270> then<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.080> single<00:01:50.380> hole<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
double half and then the single hole and
