over<00:05:35.289> here<00:05:35.439> to<00:05:35.529> the<00:05:35.559> side<00:05:38.759> as<00:05:39.759> you<00:05:39.939> can<00:05:39.969> see<00:05:40.210> it

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
over here to the side as you can see it

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.389 
over here to the side as you can see it
does<00:05:40.689> have<00:05:40.719> all<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.110> emissions<00:05:41.289> crap<00:05:42.189> on

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:42.399 
does have all the emissions crap on

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:44.040 
does have all the emissions crap on
there<00:05:42.610> which<00:05:42.789> I<00:05:43.059> want<00:05:43.509> to<00:05:43.569> try<00:05:43.659> to<00:05:43.719> get<00:05:43.869> rid<00:05:43.990> of

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
there which I want to try to get rid of

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.619 
there which I want to try to get rid of
all<00:05:44.199> that<00:05:44.379> it's<00:05:44.589> an<00:05:44.649> 85<00:05:45.009> and<00:05:45.039> I<00:05:45.339> think<00:05:45.610> I<00:05:45.849> think

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:46.629 
all that it's an 85 and I think I think

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.239 
all that it's an 85 and I think I think
I<00:05:46.689> can<00:05:46.809> get<00:05:46.899> away<00:05:46.990> with<00:05:47.289> taking<00:05:47.619> all<00:05:47.919> that<00:05:48.099> off

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:48.249 
I can get away with taking all that off

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:51.450 
I can get away with taking all that off
so<00:05:49.180> I'm<00:05:49.270> not<00:05:49.419> not<00:05:50.409> positive<00:05:50.889> I<00:05:50.979> don't<00:05:51.039> think<00:05:51.399> it

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
so I'm not not positive I don't think it

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.290 
so I'm not not positive I don't think it
has<00:05:51.580> to<00:05:51.669> go<00:05:51.759> through<00:05:51.939> the<00:05:52.029> emissions<00:05:52.479> test

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
has to go through the emissions test

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:02.239 
has to go through the emissions test
yeah<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:55.389> can<00:05:55.509> see<00:05:55.629> the<00:05:55.749> electric<00:05:56.050> choke<00:05:59.729> yeah

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:02.249 
yeah you can see the electric choke yeah

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:09.449 
yeah you can see the electric choke yeah
so<00:06:04.139> pretty<00:06:05.139> decent<00:06:07.830> do<00:06:08.830> you<00:06:08.919> have<00:06:09.039> to<00:06:09.159> fix<00:06:09.339> the

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:09.459 
so pretty decent do you have to fix the

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:11.070 
so pretty decent do you have to fix the
radiator<00:06:09.729> eventually<00:06:10.360> it<00:06:10.479> doesn't<00:06:10.719> leak<00:06:10.869> very

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
radiator eventually it doesn't leak very

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.739 
radiator eventually it doesn't leak very
bad<00:06:11.289> at<00:06:11.469> all<00:06:11.559> it's<00:06:11.889> just<00:06:12.209> it's<00:06:13.209> just<00:06:13.270> a<00:06:13.449> very

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:13.749 
bad at all it's just it's just a very

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:16.320 
bad at all it's just it's just a very
very<00:06:13.839> small<00:06:14.830> small<00:06:15.219> pinhole<00:06:15.520> that<00:06:15.969> likes<00:06:16.180> to

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
very small small pinhole that likes to

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.459 
very small small pinhole that likes to
drip<00:06:16.629> every<00:06:17.020> once<00:06:17.229> in<00:06:17.289> a<00:06:17.379> while<00:06:17.729> and<00:06:18.809> I<00:06:19.809> have

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469 
drip every once in a while and I have

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.939 
drip every once in a while and I have
tried<00:06:20.889> to<00:06:20.979> seal<00:06:21.219> it<00:06:21.339> up<00:06:21.430> a<00:06:21.520> little<00:06:21.639> bit<00:06:22.949> it's

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
tried to seal it up a little bit it's

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.379 
tried to seal it up a little bit it's
like<00:06:24.009> this<00:06:24.219> it's<00:06:24.490> drivable<00:06:24.849> you<00:06:25.240> can

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
like this it's drivable you can

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.079 
like this it's drivable you can
definitely<00:06:25.659> drive<00:06:25.809> it<00:06:25.930> all<00:06:26.050> you<00:06:26.229> want

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:27.089 
definitely drive it all you want

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.249 
definitely drive it all you want
in<00:06:28.089> fact<00:06:28.270> sometimes<00:06:28.479> it<00:06:28.689> doesn't<00:06:28.869> even<00:06:29.020> leak

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 
in fact sometimes it doesn't even leak

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.079 
in fact sometimes it doesn't even leak
at<00:06:29.379> all<00:06:29.559> just<00:06:30.099> every<00:06:30.309> once<00:06:30.369> in<00:06:30.580> a<00:06:30.669> while<00:06:30.699> a<00:06:30.789> drop

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:31.089 
at all just every once in a while a drop

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:33.749 
at all just every once in a while a drop
comes<00:06:31.360> out<00:06:32.219> all<00:06:33.219> right<00:06:33.309> there<00:06:33.490> around<00:06:33.580> that

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
comes out all right there around that

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:39.329 
comes out all right there around that
fitting<00:06:34.119> right<00:06:34.689> below<00:06:34.930> it<00:06:35.459> so<00:06:36.459> anyhow<00:06:38.339> yeah

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:39.339 
fitting right below it so anyhow yeah

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:43.219 
fitting right below it so anyhow yeah
