00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.529
 she touched this no rush like a 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.990
 new video for minecraft 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.809
 he steals 360 edition for startup 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.270
 of a new series dallas remains the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.270
 tutorial this week for dummies 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.070
 so 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.740
 so today I'm going to show you 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.840
 the basics of restraint then everything 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:34.090
 first there are controllable objects 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.000
 then go in wood and doors in 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.880
 iron 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.680
 here and there and that's all as long as the 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.739
 open the wooden door can be 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.290
 open or closed finally manipulate to the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.240
 hand 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.810
 while the iron gate these sites there 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.830
 controllers 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.830
 that is to say 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.400
 Alas 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.500
 January 7 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.110
 forgiveness thought rigging 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.430
 So here is our company 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.310
 began once they are 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.330
 directly under the door or below 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.479
 I did that maybe in a 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.700
 next video and so we can not 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.440
 open it by hand it is necessary to have 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.930
 a controller and besides I'm going in 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.190
 speak right now 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.520
 then already beats a controller we have the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.520
 the sink 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.670
 who can be between two who can be 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.890
 handled in two ways this might 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.010
 to be a field if they do not send 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.320
 course at the circuit and reaches his target 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.750
 that is to say the iron gate he can 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.180
 to be lit and their current voices 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.690
 to get to his destination and that is 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.340
 there yet these stakes repeats 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:14.690
 after we have the button then the button 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.690
 must be placed on a block 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.310
 and I'll explain that to you 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.849
 same place 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.849
 alain 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.530
 the button activates a current 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.050
 for a fraction of that because 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.540
 few seconds for herman 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.940
 and now closes not useful for 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.990
 the tunes clients restos them reset the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.160
 button reset not the experts and takes this 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.160
 that I wanted I would like to say 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.880
 after we have controllers his plate 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.360
 wooden pressure and pressure card 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.360
 worse 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.100
 she takes 2.1 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.750
 importance to make 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.880
 yes it works with the wooden door 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.170
 as well 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.210
 it works with all objects 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.980
 controllable so here against yes 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.640
 in fact it does not have to be in melee 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.640
 thus I'll go 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.379
 far from the circuits 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.760
 and so 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.890
 the lap the wooden compression she can 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.580
 be activated anyway with the 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.220
 player's weight 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.470
 See that I recognize his tone of 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.290
 bubble 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.530
 it is also with the point of mitts 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.740
 that could be thrown on the plate 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.180
 had pressure stone she is not activated 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.510
 not when I throw a step on 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.319
 and so here it can be activated that 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.739
 thanks to lift with a player's point 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.599
 So these were the objects we 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.489
 probable and controlling objects 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.489
 I hope this first video 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:11.019
 very very very short explanation you 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:13.629
 will have pleased and so at the next so I 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.200
 think have published an everyday I 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:19.770
 will see 107 1 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:25.110
 I 'll do that I'll do it randomly 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.750
 sorry and that's it so I hope that 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.100
 this video will have pleased you 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.060
 do not hesitate to leave a gem a 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.220
 comment or subscribe that will make me 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.870
 even more pleasure 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.870
 and so here is tao
