00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.850
 oily skin or who suffer 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.140

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.090
 our nose is from nose to nose 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.430
 nose 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.990
 we have cheeks from nose to hair growth 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.330
 the area around the eyes we avoid for the area 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.150
 there are many others around the eyes 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.720
 masks that I have on the channel 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.759
 also you can see the video on the channel 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.530
 in which it is told how correctly 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.820
 put masks under the eyes 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.860
 what to do what not to do 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.150
 so and our chin from the middle 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.310
 beard to ear 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.660
 we, too, but the traffic police and the area so much 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.180
 here is a little under the nose 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:36.190
 you can anoint we all put on our mask 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:39.430
 and now we wait 15 minutes everything went 15 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.220
 minutes I washed the mask all 15 minutes was 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.810
 a very pleasant feeling due to the fact that 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.700
 warm mint from the face was very warm that 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.610
 I can say the skin is really very 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.730
 soft but I had homemade cream 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.680
 very fat that is they really 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.010
 soaked the skin but it's clear that 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.670
 first time this mask does not help 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.840
 make masks at least once a week 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.940
 can alternate 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.820
 that is, there are so many masks for 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.250
 fading and aging skin masks from 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.410
