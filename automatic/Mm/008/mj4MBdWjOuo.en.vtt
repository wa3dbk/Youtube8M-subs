alright<00:00:04.779> youtubers<00:00:05.350> I<00:00:05.620> had<00:00:05.980> a<00:00:06.010> request<00:00:06.310> to

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670 
alright youtubers I had a request to

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.240 
alright youtubers I had a request to
shoot<00:00:07.300> a<00:00:07.390> video<00:00:07.799> showing<00:00:08.799> uh<00:00:09.190> an<00:00:09.730> entire<00:00:11.250> loop

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
shoot a video showing uh an entire loop

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.980 
shoot a video showing uh an entire loop
or<00:00:13.440> basically<00:00:14.440> a<00:00:14.559> train<00:00:15.250> operation<00:00:15.990> having

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
or basically a train operation having

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.640 
or basically a train operation having
the<00:00:17.170> train<00:00:17.760> go<00:00:18.760> through<00:00:19.090> the<00:00:19.240> entire<00:00:20.230> track

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
the train go through the entire track

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.490 
the train go through the entire track
and<00:00:22.020> how<00:00:23.020> it<00:00:23.170> automates<00:00:23.650> all<00:00:24.160> of<00:00:24.370> the<00:00:24.580> hairs<00:00:25.500> on

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
and how it automates all of the hairs on

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.430 
and how it automates all of the hairs on
the<00:00:26.530> tortoises<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.630> I'm<00:00:28.960> going<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.170> do<00:00:29.289> that

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
the tortoises so I'm going to do that

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.519 
the tortoises so I'm going to do that
now<00:00:29.620> I<00:00:30.010> didn't<00:00:30.880> want<00:00:30.910> to<00:00:31.090> talk<00:00:31.270> about<00:00:31.660> this

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
now I didn't want to talk about this

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.880 
now I didn't want to talk about this
particular<00:00:32.850> SD<00:00:33.850> 60<00:00:34.360> which<00:00:35.230> is<00:00:35.469> an<00:00:35.679> a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
particular SD 60 which is an a

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.599 
particular SD 60 which is an a
thuringiensis<00:00:36.609> and<00:00:37.679> I<00:00:38.679> haven't<00:00:39.100> had<00:00:39.309> too<00:00:39.579> much

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
thuringiensis and I haven't had too much

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:44.610 
thuringiensis and I haven't had too much

I<00:00:50.850> built<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:52.800> NHO<00:00:53.800> layout<00:00:54.190> about<00:00:55.920> 15<00:00:56.920> years

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
I built the NHO layout about 15 years

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.950 
I built the NHO layout about 15 years
ago<00:00:57.249> 20<00:00:57.789> years<00:00:57.969> ago<00:00:58.409> and<00:00:59.409> it<00:00:59.559> was<00:00:59.710> DC<00:01:00.749> but<00:01:01.749> the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960

DCC<00:01:02.559> is<00:01:02.589> new<00:01:02.799> to<00:01:02.949> me<00:01:02.979> this<00:01:04.080> Genesis<00:01:05.760> has

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
DCC is new to me this Genesis has

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.570 
DCC is new to me this Genesis has
somewhat<00:01:07.390> of<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:08.100> characteristic<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.250> start

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
somewhat of a characteristic to start

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.510 
somewhat of a characteristic to start
that<00:01:10.150> I<00:01:10.540> don't<00:01:11.170> know<00:01:11.290> if<00:01:11.500> it's<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:12.250> needs

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
that I don't know if it's it needs

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.800 
that I don't know if it's it needs
break-in<00:01:13.090> or<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.850> there<00:01:16.030> could<00:01:16.210> be<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.390> problem

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
break-in or if there could be a problem

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.070 
break-in or if there could be a problem
with<00:01:16.960> it<00:01:17.080> but<00:01:18.010> it<00:01:18.250> seems<00:01:18.520> like<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.420> needs<00:01:19.480> a<00:01:19.870> lot

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
with it but it seems like it needs a lot

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.630 
with it but it seems like it needs a lot
of<00:01:21.090> speed<00:01:22.090> steps<00:01:22.510> or<00:01:22.810> voltage<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:24.280> get<00:01:24.520> it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
of speed steps or voltage to get it

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.590 
of speed steps or voltage to get it
going<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:26.020> will<00:01:26.230> not<00:01:26.910> when<00:01:27.910> you<00:01:28.000> break<00:01:28.270> out<00:01:28.480> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
going it will not when you break out the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.560 
going it will not when you break out the
throttle<00:01:28.870> to<00:01:29.500> speed<00:01:29.800> step<00:01:30.100> one<00:01:30.400> or<00:01:30.580> two<00:01:30.790> it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
throttle to speed step one or two it

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.450 
throttle to speed step one or two it
will<00:01:31.750> not<00:01:31.900> start<00:01:32.230> crawling<00:01:32.620> on<00:01:32.890> its<00:01:33.040> own

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
will not start crawling on its own

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.440 
will not start crawling on its own
I've<00:01:35.580> increased<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:37.200> CB<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.500> star<00:01:38.890> bolt<00:01:39.130> äj--

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
I've increased the CB to star bolt äj--

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.760 
I've increased the CB to star bolt äj--
but<00:01:40.840> all<00:01:40.960> that<00:01:41.140> does<00:01:41.410> is<00:01:41.440> make<00:01:41.980> it<00:01:42.580> start<00:01:42.970> at

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
but all that does is make it start at

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.280 
but all that does is make it start at
speed<00:01:44.770> step<00:01:45.100> one<00:01:45.400> but<00:01:45.910> at<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.210> point<00:01:46.540> the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
speed step one but at that point the

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.340 
speed step one but at that point the
voltage<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:47.890> high<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.280> it'll<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:49.350> tear

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
voltage is so high that it'll just tear

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.220 
voltage is so high that it'll just tear
off<00:01:50.380> at<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:51.160> scale<00:01:51.640> maybe<00:01:52.030> 20<00:01:52.540> or<00:01:52.570> 30<00:01:52.810> miles<00:01:53.080> an

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
off at a scale maybe 20 or 30 miles an

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.630 
off at a scale maybe 20 or 30 miles an
hour

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
hour

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.800 
hour
I'm<00:01:54.640> very<00:01:54.880> importat<00:01:55.390> if<00:01:55.570> achill<00:01:57.270> will<00:01:58.270> run

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
I'm very importat if achill will run

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.070 
I'm very importat if achill will run
this<00:01:58.930> train<00:01:59.260> around<00:01:59.530> and<00:02:00.510> if<00:02:01.510> any<00:02:01.690> of<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:01.930> guys

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
this train around and if any of you guys

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.760 
this train around and if any of you guys
out<00:02:02.350> there<00:02:02.409> have<00:02:02.770> comments<00:02:03.340> or<00:02:04.110> any<00:02:05.110> ideas<00:02:05.260> as

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
out there have comments or any ideas as

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.500 
out there have comments or any ideas as
to<00:02:05.800> what<00:02:06.370> could<00:02:06.640> be<00:02:06.700> wrong<00:02:06.970> with<00:02:07.030> it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
to what could be wrong with it

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.440 
to what could be wrong with it
maybe<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.289> needs<00:02:08.409> more<00:02:08.530> break-in<00:02:09.190> or<00:02:09.519> maybe<00:02:09.759> I

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
maybe it needs more break-in or maybe I

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.690 
maybe it needs more break-in or maybe I
think<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.140> do

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
think you do

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.630 
think you do
with<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> gears<00:02:12.500> please<00:02:13.500> comment<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.069> let<00:02:14.370> me

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
with the gears please comment and let me

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.730
