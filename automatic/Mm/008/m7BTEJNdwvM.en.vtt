brilliance strikes me like a bolt of
lightning<00:00:34.100> maybe<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.399> maybe<00:00:35.930> not<00:00:38.239> suddenly

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
lightning maybe so maybe not suddenly

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.139 
lightning maybe so maybe not suddenly
I'm<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.390> oh<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> don't<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.320> too<00:00:40.530> many<00:00:40.620> ideas

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
I'm like oh I don't have too many ideas

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.959 
I'm like oh I don't have too many ideas
let's<00:00:42.379> let's<00:00:43.379> try<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.739> let's<00:00:44.430> go<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
let's let's try that let's go for it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.400 
let's let's try that let's go for it
actually<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> think<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.079> might<00:00:46.260> be<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
actually I think this might be the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.350 
actually I think this might be the
double<00:00:46.649> battle<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.129> unzip<00:00:47.520> undoes<00:00:47.969> me<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> was

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
double battle that unzip undoes me I was

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.959 
double battle that unzip undoes me I was
not<00:00:48.480> expecting<00:00:48.750> any<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.260> these<00:00:49.379> guys<00:00:55.850> hmm<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
not expecting any of these guys hmm I

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.349 
not expecting any of these guys hmm I
didn't<00:00:57.329> think<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> fire<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.020> VGC<00:00:58.440> I

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
didn't think I like to fire was VGC I

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.920 
didn't think I like to fire was VGC I
guess<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.390> don't<00:01:00.780> know<00:01:02.390> do<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:03.629> lucky

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
guess I don't know do you think lucky

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.359 
guess I don't know do you think lucky
could<00:01:04.080> work<00:01:04.439> over<00:01:04.680> ambipom<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.250> some

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
could work over ambipom with some

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.859 
could work over ambipom with some
electrical<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.090> Dunsparce<00:01:06.299> yeah<00:01:06.659> I've<00:01:06.750> been

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
electrical and Dunsparce yeah I've been

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.170 
electrical and Dunsparce yeah I've been
using<00:01:07.049> lucky<00:01:07.530> instead<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> ambipom<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:09.060> was

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
using lucky instead of ambipom that was

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.000 
using lucky instead of ambipom that was
just<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.510> strategy<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:10.080> back<00:01:10.260> when<00:01:10.290> fiction

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
just my strategy from back when fiction

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.740 
just my strategy from back when fiction
was<00:01:11.340> around<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.240> use<00:01:12.360> any<00:01:12.510> six

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
was around so now you can use any six

was around so now you can use any six

this is old and classic right here

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.630 
this is old and classic right here
that's<00:01:46.400> scary<00:01:46.730> though<00:01:48.130> double<00:01:49.130> discharge

lightening routing each other stats up

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.610 
lightening routing each other stats up
that's<00:01:53.330> an<00:01:53.450> old-school<00:01:53.660> gimmick<00:01:54.140> right<00:01:54.440> there

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
that's an old-school gimmick right there

that's an old-school gimmick right there
and<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.830> love<00:01:55.010> it<00:01:57.010> okay<00:01:58.010> so<00:01:58.070> now<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.520> think<00:01:58.670> it's

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
and I love it okay so now I think it's

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.790 
and I love it okay so now I think it's
this<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.080> either<00:02:00.170> going<00:02:00.410> to<00:02:00.470> be<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.590> regular

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
this is either going to be a regular

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.500 
this is either going to be a regular
metric<00:02:01.340> or<00:02:01.430> it's<00:02:01.550> going<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.790> involve<00:02:02.000> mega<00:02:02.330> now

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
metric or it's going to involve mega now

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.390 
metric or it's going to involve mega now
that<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.720> has<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.869> boost<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:06.770> wasn't<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.250> was

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
that it has a boost that wasn't that was

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.070 
that it has a boost that wasn't that was
an<00:02:07.490> interesting<00:02:07.729> open<00:02:08.209> right<00:02:08.360> there<00:02:08.570> two

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
an interesting open right there two

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.470 
an interesting open right there two
waters<00:02:09.440> versus<00:02:09.770> two<00:02:09.979> electrics<00:02:10.459> who<00:02:11.180> will<00:02:11.360> win

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
waters versus two electrics who will win

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.630 
waters versus two electrics who will win
now<00:02:14.480> let's<00:02:14.990> see<00:02:15.170> how<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.500> goes<00:02:15.800> man<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.550> was

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
now let's see how this goes man that was

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.590 
now let's see how this goes man that was
that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
that

spongebob and that's three turns right
there<00:04:15.120> PVC<00:04:15.720> doubles<00:04:16.370> there's<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.459> lot<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.639> ways

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
there PVC doubles there's a lot of ways

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.280 
there PVC doubles there's a lot of ways
you<00:04:17.850> can<00:04:18.060> play<00:04:18.150> VGC<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.720> can<00:04:18.900> go<00:04:18.989> with<00:04:19.169> the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
you can play VGC you can go with the

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.199 
you can play VGC you can go with the
hyper<00:04:19.500> sweeping<00:04:20.040> strategies<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:20.790> sometimes

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
hyper sweeping strategies and sometimes

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.350 
hyper sweeping strategies and sometimes
they<00:04:22.049> just<00:04:22.260> work<00:04:22.470> like<00:04:22.500> that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
they just work like that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.890 
they just work like that
that<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.389> think<00:04:24.570> that's<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.930> first<00:04:25.430> clean<00:04:26.430> game

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
that I think that's the first clean game

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.719 
that I think that's the first clean game
like<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.080> got<00:04:28.260> clean<00:04:28.500> swept<00:04:28.860> but<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:29.580> was<00:04:29.700> a

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
like I got clean swept but that was a

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.790 
like I got clean swept but that was a
messy<00:04:30.210> battle<00:04:30.540> with<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.840> dusclops<00:04:31.229> way<00:04:31.560> back

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
messy battle with that dusclops way back
