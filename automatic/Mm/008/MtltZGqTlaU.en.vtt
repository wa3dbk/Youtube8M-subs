why<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.020> waited<00:01:34.259> 10<00:01:34.560> years<00:01:34.860> right<00:01:35.189> well<00:01:35.670> my

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
why we waited 10 years right well my

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.870 
why we waited 10 years right well my
question<00:01:36.540> right<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.049> what<00:01:37.729> convinces<00:01:38.729> you

the<00:01:39.030> most<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:40.320> case<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.950> still

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the most that this case is still

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.330 
the most that this case is still
legitimate<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.210> opposed<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.899> being<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.590> CIA

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
legitimate as opposed to being a CIA

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.429 
legitimate as opposed to being a CIA
disinformation<00:01:45.180> setup<00:01:47.000> well<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.720> thing<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
disinformation setup well the thing that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.469 
disinformation setup well the thing that
I<00:01:49.770> thought<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.220> most<00:01:50.399> convincing<00:01:51.030> was<00:01:51.240> when

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
I thought was most convincing was when

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.539 
I thought was most convincing was when
Steve<00:01:51.840> Wilson<00:01:52.350> described<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:54.530> hangars
