in<00:00:42.239> half<00:00:42.270> years<00:00:43.170> ago<00:00:43.260> i<00:00:43.469> turned<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.890> round<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
in half years ago i turned it round and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.650 
in half years ago i turned it round and
painted<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> ends<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.969> get<00:00:45.059> rid<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> bark

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
painted the ends to get rid of the bark

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080 
painted the ends to get rid of the bark
the<00:00:46.469> problem<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.010> showed<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.399> time<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.910> time

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the problem that showed up time and time

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.240 
the problem that showed up time and time
again<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.840> from<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> shrinkage<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> wood

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
again was from the shrinkage as the wood

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.700 
again was from the shrinkage as the wood
dried<00:00:50.550> since<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> limb<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.930> intact<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> wood

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
dried since the limb was intact the wood

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.950 
dried since the limb was intact the wood
could<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.039> move<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> dried<00:00:53.960> consequently

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
could not move as a dried consequently

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080 
could not move as a dried consequently
was<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.410> growth<00:00:55.739> rings<00:00:56.070> delaminated<00:00:56.910> from

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
was like growth rings delaminated from

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.180 
was like growth rings delaminated from
each<00:00:57.210> other<00:00:57.539> you'll<00:00:58.140> catch<00:00:58.350> glimpses<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.890> this

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
each other you'll catch glimpses of this

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.310 
each other you'll catch glimpses of this
as<00:00:59.430> section<00:00:59.820> supply<00:01:00.149> off<00:01:00.359> during<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> turning

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
as section supply off during the turning

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.189 
as section supply off during the turning
I'd<00:01:02.070> use<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> liberal<00:01:02.789> amounts<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.270> CA<00:01:03.480> glue<00:01:03.600> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
I'd use a liberal amounts of CA glue to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.289 
I'd use a liberal amounts of CA glue to
retain<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.949> fill<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> gaps<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.790> stabilize

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
retain and fill the gaps and stabilize

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.570 
retain and fill the gaps and stabilize
the<00:01:06.330> wood<00:01:06.720> even<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.400> had<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
issues I'm starting the first egg I had

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.539 
issues I'm starting the first egg I had
turned<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> wood<00:01:13.710> round<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.280> turned

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
turned the wood round and turned

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.280 
turned the wood round and turned

wood<00:03:46.940> egg<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:47.359> is<00:03:47.540> enough<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.109> used<00:03:49.069> a<00:03:49.190> lot<00:03:49.400> of

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
wood egg this is enough I used a lot of

end<00:03:51.739> EA<00:03:51.890> turned<00:03:52.220> out<00:03:52.370> nice<00:03:52.579> I<00:03:52.850> think<00:03:53.180> I'll<00:03:53.299> make

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
end EA turned out nice I think I'll make

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.000 
end EA turned out nice I think I'll make
a<00:03:53.510> nest<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.989> eggs<00:03:54.140> from<00:03:54.380> different<00:03:54.799> woods

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
a nest of eggs from different woods

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.699 
a nest of eggs from different woods
maybe<00:03:55.910> that's<00:03:56.390> a<00:03:56.540> good<00:03:56.750> way<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.019> use<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.440> short

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
maybe that's a good way to use the short

maybe that's a good way to use the short
scrap<00:03:58.069> pieces<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.790> always<00:03:59.150> tend<00:03:59.420> to

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
scrap pieces that always tend to

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:19.840 
scrap pieces that always tend to
accumulate<00:03:59.870> in<00:04:00.319> my<00:04:00.769> shop

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.469 

well<00:04:20.850> here<00:04:21.060> we<00:04:21.180> are<00:04:21.209> started<00:04:22.139> out<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.470> make<00:04:22.680> two

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
well here we are started out to make two

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.740 
well here we are started out to make two
eggs<00:04:24.560> in<00:04:25.560> closed<00:04:25.919> containers<00:04:26.479> this<00:04:27.479> was<00:04:27.720> a

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
eggs in closed containers this was a

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.510 
eggs in closed containers this was a
tough<00:04:28.020> one<00:04:28.050> hadn't<00:04:28.740> done<00:04:28.860> one<00:04:29.039> for<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.310> while

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
tough one hadn't done one for a while

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.870 
tough one hadn't done one for a while
but<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:30.330> wood<00:04:30.570> was<00:04:30.810> really<00:04:31.350> tough

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
but the wood was really tough

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.950 
but the wood was really tough
miscalculated<00:04:32.880> on<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.060> few<00:04:33.300> things<00:04:33.539> like<00:04:33.780> the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
miscalculated on a few things like the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.590 
miscalculated on a few things like the
tenon<00:04:34.350> whatever<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.910> it's<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.180> little<00:04:36.389> bit

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
tenon whatever so it's a little bit

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.040 
tenon whatever so it's a little bit
different<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:37.080> evolved<00:04:38.030> it<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.270> tight<00:04:39.720> fit

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
different it evolved it is a tight fit

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.610 
different it evolved it is a tight fit
so<00:04:41.150> what<00:04:42.150> is<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.419> girls<00:04:42.630> is<00:04:42.870> this<00:04:43.020> an<00:04:43.199> egg<00:04:43.440> or

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
so what is it girls is this an egg or

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.170 
so what is it girls is this an egg or
what<00:04:43.919> is<00:04:44.039> it<00:04:44.190> ice<00:04:44.669> cream<00:04:45.030> ice<00:04:45.660> cream<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:47.150> balloon

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
what is it ice cream ice cream a balloon

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.590 
what is it ice cream ice cream a balloon
okay<00:04:48.990> whatever<00:04:49.680> it<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:50.400> they<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.300> make<00:04:51.449> it

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
okay whatever it is they can make it

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.730 
okay whatever it is they can make it
what<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:52.050> but<00:04:52.889> one<00:04:53.130> big<00:04:53.580> problem<00:04:53.940> remains

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
what it is but one big problem remains

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.000 
what it is but one big problem remains
so<00:04:55.740> far<00:04:55.979> only<00:04:56.220> one<00:04:57.260> well<00:04:58.260> how<00:04:58.380> many<00:04:58.440> do<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:58.800> need
