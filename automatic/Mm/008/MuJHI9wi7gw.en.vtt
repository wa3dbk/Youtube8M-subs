00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
bigger brands the only thing is that the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.910 
bigger brands the only thing is that the
quality<00:00:55.280> is<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.489> same<00:00:55.519> is<00:00:56.179> really<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.690> same

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
but the price is a fraction of those of

but has the brightness of a very
high-quality<00:01:41.730> guitar<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> only<00:01:42.600> thing<00:01:42.960> is

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
high-quality guitar the only thing is

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.410 
high-quality guitar the only thing is
that<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.410> would<00:01:44.100> expect<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.550> guitar<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.210> cost

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
that you would expect the guitar to cost

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.060 
that you would expect the guitar to cost
around<00:01:45.600> two<00:01:45.900> thousand<00:01:46.260> euro<00:01:46.440> but<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:46.740> doesn't

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
around two thousand euro but it doesn't

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.150 
around two thousand euro but it doesn't
cost<00:01:49.580> 1199<00:01:50.580> euros

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.400 

would<00:01:55.160> be<00:01:55.190> my<00:01:55.520> first<00:01:56.090> choice<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.570> fun<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:57.080> have

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
would be my first choice of fun to have

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.510 
would be my first choice of fun to have
that<00:01:57.710> sort<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.550> amount<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:59.000> money<00:01:59.510> to<00:01:59.660> spend

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
that sort of amount of money to spend

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.680 
that sort of amount of money to spend
it's<00:02:01.520> really<00:02:01.850> second<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.300> none

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
it's really second to none

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.830 
it's really second to none
while<00:02:03.550> bigger<00:02:04.550> companies<00:02:05.210> they<00:02:05.420> sort<00:02:05.780> of

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
while bigger companies they sort of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.360 
while bigger companies they sort of
drift<00:02:06.200> further<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.710> further<00:02:06.920> from<00:02:07.220> the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
drift further and further from the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.450 
drift further and further from the
legacy<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.210> they<00:02:08.360> created<00:02:08.720> by<00:02:09.460> cutting

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
legacy that they created by cutting

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.120 
legacy that they created by cutting
corners<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.850> cutting<00:02:11.330> costs<00:02:12.010> Eastman<00:02:13.010> is

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
corners and cutting costs Eastman is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.940 
corners and cutting costs Eastman is
going<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.460> other<00:02:13.520> way<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:13.820> they're<00:02:14.330> making

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
going the other way so they're making

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.170 
going the other way so they're making
relatively<00:02:15.950> cheap<00:02:16.190> guitars<00:02:16.550> they<00:02:16.790> start<00:02:17.090> from

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
relatively cheap guitars they start from

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.750 
relatively cheap guitars they start from
about<00:02:17.360> 400<00:02:17.690> euros<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:19.040> they<00:02:19.160> make<00:02:19.310> something

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
about 400 euros but they make something

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.840 
about 400 euros but they make something
like<00:02:19.880> this<00:02:20.260> which<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.410> think<00:02:21.530> closer<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
like this which is I think closer to the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.900 
like this which is I think closer to the
original<00:02:23.090> legacy<00:02:23.750> than<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:25.400> most<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.790> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
original legacy than that most of the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.240 
original legacy than that most of the
bigger<00:02:26.150> brands<00:02:26.450> do<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.050> they<00:02:27.500> still<00:02:27.950> charge

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
bigger brands do so they still charge

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.460 
bigger brands do so they still charge
you<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> lot<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.670> money<00:02:28.960> but<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.080> quality<00:02:30.440> is

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
you a lot of money but the quality is

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.000 
you a lot of money but the quality is
sort<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:31.370> know<00:02:31.420> slowly<00:02:32.420> decreasing<00:02:33.080> so

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
sort of you know slowly decreasing so

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.160 
sort of you know slowly decreasing so
