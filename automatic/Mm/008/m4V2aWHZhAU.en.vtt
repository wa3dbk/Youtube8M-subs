00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.030
 and then for this first 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.430
 percent 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.479
 for this first 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:08.499
 talk in this course 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.019
 george lever of the year 2009 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.949
 per cent we're going to look at certain terms to go 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.409
 percent getting familiar with these terms 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:20.310
 when we talk about cycles 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.310
 in shrinking training when we talk about myths and everything 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.830
 messi that the most positive micros and that that day 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.970
 a one week training mesocycle would be about a month 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.950
 of training macrocycle serious 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.920
 the union of several of those cycles 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.040
 annual cycles percent and five cycles 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.880
 multi-year when we talk about training cycles 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.050
 has to do 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.180
 because it is that they are cyclical approach because they have to do with 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.340
 the bony bony network responds a biological question 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.490
 if we can not do a cycle for a hundred without having 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.290
 in percent account how biorhythms are handled 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.969
 natural of people 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.940
 of human beings 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.680
 its biological foundation 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.310
 that is, through what we know about human physiology and biology 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.250
 e the training methods 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.990
 it means that they indicate a certain type of training 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.380
 in a certain type of training method 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.250
 and hence the word yes I think that for coaches this is very 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.300
 basic a paramedic nutritionists percent we have to cross for that 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.790
 know what we are talking about 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.020
 medical nutritionist and trainers 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.719
 although the basis of a multidisciplinary team in this we have to 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:36.350
 talk 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.050
 Relatively the same language and knowing what we are talking about to see what happens 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.620
 to be able to advise in order to guide 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.210
 percent to a certain person 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.090
 in a certain type of 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630
 physical activity day 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.780
 then as we said to earlier volume 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.250
 refers to the amount 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.479
 percent for example meter swims 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.280
 the kilometer traveled 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.119
 ec weights raised in a session of weights p multiply the lifted weight 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.220
 by the number itself would like for the number of serene to give a volume of 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.509
 training that we are going to see 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.709
 we go the dog in more detail 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.099
 as the Syrian course progresses 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.819
 percent the statistics in process that takes a statistic we have to 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.409
 to know 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.179
 volume and intensity workouts looks 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.129
 he knows himself by scoring 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.470
 In an agenda in a premise you have to write down everything to know what it is that 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.919
 it's happening that I deserve a certain area 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.309
 intensity 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.060
 this is a measure of 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.450
 of power 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.580
 of work 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.329
 percent in the formula of from potency we talk about 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.199
 force by distance over time be over time what the intensity swims 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.529
 percent and as we said before according to the intensity 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.469
 we have to go thinking 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.919
 what is happening inside the body before different types of 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.919
 stimuli the concept of predominance 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.620
 as we saw 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.480
 in this course to be a concept 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.549
 predominantly 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.249
 biochemical 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:11.500
 what mechanism 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.759
 per cent the jet is happening at this moment to this person that we are 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:22.029
 p indicating that you make a certain type of certain type of exercise 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:22.939
 stimulus 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.860
 percent we have to 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.329
 fix this word predominance 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.219
 percent e to understand the visits of the exercise 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:36.690
 and another concept that we are going to enter, let's focus on the next talk 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.119
 the next talk that increased his pressure the most 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.789
 to bioenergetics 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.569
 this concept to be fundamental that knows that now they have to work we record 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:45.020
 the act 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.529
 recent hits 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:50.199
 how serra basically synthesizes the at &amp; t 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.339
 always in biochemistry and physiology we talked 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:57.889
 how a molecule is synthesized as it is synthesized we took it how they are synthesized 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.000
 the amino acids 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.129
 how proteins are synthesized 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:02.620
 how it is synthesized 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.129
 that is when we studied in the faculty juan gelman the faculty of medicine and 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.779
 biochemistry nutrition 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.479
 there is a lot of synthesis 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:14.379
 how such a thing occurs here percent 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.070
 in exercise physiology we have to present 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.500
 special emphasis 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.879
 in how it is destroyed synthesizes 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:21.669
 strasser 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.810
 the fundamental biochemical concepts pin I noticed the ones that the recent one demanded 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.409
 xix 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:31.039
 every time it expires we become an athlete every time there is less 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.139
 a certain sport on television one ends discipline 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.150
 when finished if pinochetismo 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.480
 d the pedestrismo by the way you team 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.340
 let's think about the network without there being 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.059
 as if this recent this and related p 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.360
 what is being spent 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.370
 this 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.920
 one of the keys to exercise biochemistry 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.580
 one of the keys of biochemistry 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.460
 pimentel of the concepts of biochemical metabolism and biology 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.139
 applied salt exercise 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.509
 serra synthesizes 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:05.490
 the at &amp; t 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.240
 that being 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.309
 spent on a certain physical stimulus 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.699
 percent sixty and dinner at the end of these words start to lend 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:15.730
 Attention 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.970
 and now out there it seems a bit 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.199
 percent 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.080
 it seems so important 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.580
 this these words but they will see that as the course progresses 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.039
 Having these words in mind will facilitate the understanding of the 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.629
 exercise physiology 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:34.629
 then the next talk is going to be is an introduction 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.229
 to the energetic said
