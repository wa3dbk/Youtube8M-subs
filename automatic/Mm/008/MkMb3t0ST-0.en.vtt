00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
it all the corner so it should be stable

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.500 
it all the corner so it should be stable
like<00:05:18.370> this<00:05:18.760> and<00:05:20.760> when<00:05:21.760> you're<00:05:21.880> done<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.479> should

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
like this and when you're done it should

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.420 
like this and when you're done it should
look<00:05:22.870> like<00:05:23.110> this<00:05:24.070> and<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:26.380> do<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.800> zach<00:05:27.099> same

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430

thing to the other side too so you so

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.110 
thing to the other side too so you so
policies<00:05:34.120> of<00:05:34.330> paper<00:05:35.130> should<00:05:36.130> be<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:37.630> zacks<00:05:38.020> a
