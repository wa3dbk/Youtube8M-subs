I'm<00:00:09.480> still<00:00:09.660> just<00:00:09.719> gonna<00:00:09.929> assume<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.349> it's

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
I'm still just gonna assume that it's

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.740

one<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.679> my<00:00:10.740> neighbors<00:00:16.760> and<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.600> how<00:00:18.720> I

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
one of my neighbors and this is how I

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.000 
one of my neighbors and this is how I

get my black ops 2 to work
I<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.220> repeatedly<00:00:20.670> open<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.270> close<00:00:21.480> my<00:00:21.660> dish

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
I just repeatedly open and close my dish

they're going to commit suicide because

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.280 
they're going to commit suicide because
in<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.580> picture<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.330> looks<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.900> though<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
in this picture it looks as though the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.899 
in this picture it looks as though the
guys<00:01:28.439> wearing<00:01:28.770> an<00:01:28.950> exosuit<00:01:29.460> well<00:01:29.640> that's<00:01:29.790> what

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
guys wearing an exosuit well that's what

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.190

a<00:01:29.939> lot<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.150> people<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.479> assuming<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> me

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
a lot of people are assuming and to me

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.539 
a lot of people are assuming and to me
it<00:01:31.320> doesn't<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.619> look<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:31.920> an<00:01:32.130> exosuit

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
it doesn't really look like an exosuit

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.859 
it doesn't really look like an exosuit

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.660 
prefer anyway I guess I would have to go
with<00:02:34.959> no<00:02:35.110> exosuits<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.980> simply<00:02:36.250> because<00:02:36.400> the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
with no exosuits just simply because the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.190 
with no exosuits just simply because the

general public just doesn't want
exosuits<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:38.980> would<00:02:39.069> just<00:02:39.220> be<00:02:39.340> more

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
exosuits and it would just be more

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.130

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.770 
top of the fact that I was really hoping
for<00:02:42.519> a<00:02:42.579> world<00:02:42.760> at<00:02:42.879> war<00:02:42.909> too<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.540> I'm<00:02:43.629> getting

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
for a world at war too so if I'm getting

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.970 
for a world at war too so if I'm getting
black<00:02:44.079> ops<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.349> we're<00:02:44.500> not<00:02:44.560> gonna<00:02:44.709> have<00:02:44.890> an

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
black ops so we're not gonna have an

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.619 
black ops so we're not gonna have an
old-time<00:02:45.310> set<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.760> would<00:02:45.879> at<00:02:46.060> least<00:02:46.090> not<00:02:46.450> what

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
old-time set I would at least not what

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.300 
old-time set I would at least not what
EXO's<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.109> guess<00:02:47.260> it's<00:02:47.440> not<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.769> think<00:02:47.859> EXO

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
EXO's I guess it's not that I think EXO

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.770 
EXO's I guess it's not that I think EXO
suits<00:02:48.489> are<00:02:48.640> bad<00:02:48.760> for<00:02:48.940> Call<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.150> Duty<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:49.599> that

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
suits are bad for Call of Duty it's that

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.210 
suits are bad for Call of Duty it's that
it<00:02:49.959> just<00:02:50.170> doesn't<00:02:50.440> feel<00:02:50.650> like<00:02:50.709> Call<00:02:51.069> of<00:02:51.099> Duty

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
it just doesn't feel like Call of Duty

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.490 
it just doesn't feel like Call of Duty
with<00:02:51.489> EXO<00:02:51.970> suits<00:02:52.239> if<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.660> makes<00:02:52.870> any<00:02:53.019> sense

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
with EXO suits if that makes any sense

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.349 
with EXO suits if that makes any sense
well<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> Call<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:53.950> Duty<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.549> most<00:02:54.760> casual

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
well the Call of Duty is the most casual

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.940 
well the Call of Duty is the most casual
shooter<00:02:55.780> out<00:02:55.930> there<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.470> generic

drastically<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.280> probably<00:03:09.700> not<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:09.879> good<00:03:10.060> idea

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
drastically is probably not a good idea

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.000
