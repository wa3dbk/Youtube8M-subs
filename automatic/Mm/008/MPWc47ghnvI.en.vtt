00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
is what I really use to fuel the routine

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.610 
is what I really use to fuel the routine
I<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.690> I'll<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.289> use<00:00:55.440> any

I was really just like I'll like use any

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.810 
I was really just like I'll like use any
kind<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> bonding<00:00:56.250> moment<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.699> guys

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
kind of bonding moment that you guys

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.040 
kind of bonding moment that you guys
have<00:00:56.940> had<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.390> kind<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.660> look<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:57.870> each

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
have had and just kind of look at each

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.540 
have had and just kind of look at each
other<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.289> when<00:00:58.980> you're<00:00:59.100> doing<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.370> piece

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
other like when you're doing that piece

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.709 
other like when you're doing that piece
of<00:00:59.699> choreography<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:00.600> what

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
of choreography it's like that's what

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.709 
of choreography it's like that's what
you're<00:01:00.870> thinking<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:02.000> so<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.480> is

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you're thinking about so I think that is

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.380 
you're thinking about so I think that is
a<00:01:04.199> huge<00:01:04.710> factor<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.400> why<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:05.880> are<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
a huge factor to why they are that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.330 
a huge factor to why they are that
couple<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.380> know<00:01:07.500> oh<00:01:08.780> wow<00:01:09.810> um<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.799> did

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
couple to be you know oh wow um I did

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.230 
couple to be you know oh wow um I did
not<00:01:11.490> know<00:01:11.700> that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
not know that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.649 
not know that
yeah<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.650> shock<00:01:14.130> yeah<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> mean<00:01:15.600> I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
yeah that's a shock yeah but I mean I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.780 
yeah that's a shock yeah but I mean I
guess<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.290> could<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.250> chemistry

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
guess it could be because the chemistry

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.330 
guess it could be because the chemistry
yeah<00:01:18.479> whenever<00:01:19.080> we're<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.439> stage<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:20.040> always

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
yeah whenever we're on stage we always

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.249 
yeah whenever we're on stage we always
like<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.850> into<00:01:21.060> character<00:01:21.509> really<00:01:21.780> really

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
like get into character really really

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.469 
like get into character really really
quickly<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.220> comes<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.640> easily<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> both

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
quickly it comes really easily to both

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.020 
quickly it comes really easily to both
of<00:01:24.689> us<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.310> end<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.759> feeding

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
of us and then it we end up just feeding

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.289 
of us and then it we end up just feeding
off<00:01:27.210> each<00:01:27.270> other<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.259> forget<00:01:29.250> who<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.909> am<00:01:29.939> for
