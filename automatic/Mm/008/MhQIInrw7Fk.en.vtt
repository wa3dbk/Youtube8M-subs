00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
really I mean you know when I when a

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.809 
really I mean you know when I when a
public<00:02:39.409> figure<00:02:39.560> expresses<00:02:40.310> himself<00:02:40.430> or

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.429 
discussion negative or positive I've
learned<00:02:45.859> that<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:47.180> when<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:47.989> comes<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.349> my

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
learned that and when it comes to my

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.129 
learned that and when it comes to my
movies<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.889> know<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:50.000> accept<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.510> when

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
movies I know that and I accept it when

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.449 
movies I know that and I accept it when
it<00:02:51.230> comes<00:02:51.469> to<00:02:51.620> just<00:02:51.829> having<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.159> conversation

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
it comes to just having a conversation

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.330 
it comes to just having a conversation
about<00:02:52.879> things<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.359> matter<00:02:53.689> to<00:02:53.870> me<00:02:54.129> and<00:02:55.129> I

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
about things that matter to me and I

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.300 
about things that matter to me and I
assume<00:02:55.730> would<00:02:55.939> matter<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.739> others<00:02:57.739> also<00:02:57.919> I

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
assume would matter to others also I

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.369 
assume would matter to others also I
think<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.939> assumption<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.480> wrong<00:02:59.629> that<00:03:00.230> it

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
think the assumption is wrong that it

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.750 
think the assumption is wrong that it
matters<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.859> others<00:03:01.099> I<00:03:01.219> think<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.489> assumption

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
matters to others I think the assumption

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.459 
matters to others I think the assumption
should<00:03:01.939> be<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.329> matters<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.049> me<00:03:03.139> give<00:03:03.349> it<00:03:03.379> to
