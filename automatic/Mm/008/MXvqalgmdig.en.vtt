00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
because you could see all the starch see

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.050 
because you could see all the starch see

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
to the top you could skim off some of it

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.040 
to the top you could skim off some of it
if<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.930> like<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:49.390> not<00:04:50.390> necessary<00:04:50.870> it's<00:04:50.960> not

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
if you like to not necessary it's not

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.780 
if you like to not necessary it's not
going<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.230> change<00:04:51.320> its<00:04:51.500> flavor<00:04:51.740> but<00:04:52.130> it's<00:04:52.700> just

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
going to change its flavor but it's just

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.460 
going to change its flavor but it's just
nobody's<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.390> starch<00:04:53.630> content<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:54.170> little<00:04:54.290> bit

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
nobody's the starch content a little bit

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.980 
nobody's the starch content a little bit
so<00:04:55.250> we're<00:04:55.550> gonna<00:04:55.700> reduce<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.360> heat<00:04:56.510> on<00:04:56.720> this

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
so we're gonna reduce the heat on this

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.330 
so we're gonna reduce the heat on this
to<00:04:58.180> low<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.570> we're<00:05:00.260> gonna<00:05:00.350> cover<00:05:00.620> it<00:05:00.860> and

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
to low and we're gonna cover it and

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.390 
to low and we're gonna cover it and
we're<00:05:02.060> gonna<00:05:02.210> let<00:05:02.450> it<00:05:02.510> simmer<00:05:03.140> so<00:05:04.070> this<00:05:04.280> has

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
we're gonna let it simmer so this has

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.750 

so<00:05:56.420> we<00:05:56.540> have<00:05:57.010> some<00:05:58.010> sweetness<00:05:58.550> from<00:05:58.670> the

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
so we have some sweetness from the

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.010 
so we have some sweetness from the
pineapple<00:05:59.420> a<00:05:59.920> little<00:06:00.920> bit<00:06:01.700> of<00:06:02.270> spiciness<00:06:02.840> from

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
pineapple a little bit of spiciness from

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.500 
pineapple a little bit of spiciness from
the<00:06:03.440> pepperoni<00:06:04.190> it<00:06:04.460> ends<00:06:04.730> up<00:06:04.820> tasting<00:06:05.060> more

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
the pepperoni it ends up tasting more

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.620 
the pepperoni it ends up tasting more
like<00:06:05.780> bacon<00:06:06.530> it's<00:06:07.250> like<00:06:07.460> it<00:06:07.850> adds<00:06:08.000> a<00:06:08.120> smoky

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
like bacon it's like it adds a smoky

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.900 
like bacon it's like it adds a smoky
flavor<00:06:09.610> we<00:06:10.610> have<00:06:10.910> the<00:06:11.630> rice<00:06:11.840> and<00:06:12.230> the<00:06:12.560> beans

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
flavor we have the rice and the beans

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.230 
flavor we have the rice and the beans
it's<00:06:13.910> really<00:06:14.510> really<00:06:15.230> good

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
it's really really good

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.830 
it's really really good
so<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.390> pineapple<00:06:18.220> retains<00:06:19.220> a<00:06:19.610> bit<00:06:20.570> of<00:06:20.690> its

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
so the pineapple retains a bit of its

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.910 
so the pineapple retains a bit of its
texture<00:06:22.240> and<00:06:23.240> it<00:06:23.450> adds<00:06:23.690> a<00:06:23.870> bit<00:06:23.900> of<00:06:24.170> like<00:06:24.470> firm

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
texture and it adds a bit of like firm

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
texture and it adds a bit of like firm
bite<00:06:25.310> to<00:06:26.300> the<00:06:26.390> dish<00:06:26.570> because<00:06:27.580> obviously<00:06:28.580> the

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
bite to the dish because obviously the

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.840 
bite to the dish because obviously the
rice<00:06:29.120> and<00:06:29.330> the<00:06:29.390> beans<00:06:29.419> are<00:06:29.750> very<00:06:29.900> soft<00:06:30.140> and<00:06:30.850> the

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
rice and the beans are very soft and the

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.100 
rice and the beans are very soft and the
pepperoni<00:06:33.280> is<00:06:34.280> not<00:06:34.580> crunchy<00:06:35.540> because<00:06:35.930> it's

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
pepperoni is not crunchy because it's

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.170 
pepperoni is not crunchy because it's
obviously<00:06:36.440> been<00:06:36.650> cooked<00:06:36.860> in<00:06:36.980> the<00:06:37.070> water<00:06:37.310> wow

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
obviously been cooked in the water wow

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.720 
obviously been cooked in the water wow
this<00:06:38.360> is<00:06:38.540> really<00:06:38.960> really<00:06:39.680> good<00:06:39.890> I<00:06:40.130> don't<00:06:40.640> even

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
this is really really good I don't even

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.950 
this is really really good I don't even
think<00:06:40.880> it<00:06:41.090> needs<00:06:41.240> any<00:06:41.419> salt<00:06:41.510> and<00:06:41.810> pepper

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
think it needs any salt and pepper

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.390 
think it needs any salt and pepper
because<00:06:42.560> the<00:06:43.250> pepperoni<00:06:44.030> is<00:06:44.300> salty<00:06:44.660> and<00:06:45.400> the

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
because the pepperoni is salty and the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.830 
because the pepperoni is salty and the
only<00:06:46.550> thing<00:06:46.730> if<00:06:46.850> you<00:06:46.940> want<00:06:47.180> to<00:06:47.300> add<00:06:47.390> a<00:06:47.419> little

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
only thing if you want to add a little

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.740 
only thing if you want to add a little
bit<00:06:48.020> more<00:06:48.050> heat<00:06:48.500> to<00:06:48.770> it<00:06:48.919> because<00:06:49.750> these

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
bit more heat to it because these

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.400 
bit more heat to it because these
pepperoni<00:06:51.169> are<00:06:51.320> not<00:06:51.440> very<00:06:51.680> spicy<00:06:53.410> definitely

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
pepperoni are not very spicy definitely

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.620 
pepperoni are not very spicy definitely
add<00:06:54.980> some<00:06:55.250> hot<00:06:55.400> sauce<00:06:55.460> or<00:06:56.000> a<00:06:56.030> little<00:06:56.419> bit<00:06:56.540> of

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
add some hot sauce or a little bit of

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.090 
add some hot sauce or a little bit of
cayenne<00:06:56.780> pepper<00:06:56.960> and<00:06:57.710> that<00:06:57.800> would<00:06:57.950> up<00:06:58.070> the

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
cayenne pepper and that would up the

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.880 
cayenne pepper and that would up the
heat<00:06:58.400> motion<00:06:58.820> but<00:06:59.330> it's<00:06:59.479> perfectly<00:06:59.840> fine<00:07:00.110> how

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
heat motion but it's perfectly fine how

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.750 
heat motion but it's perfectly fine how
it<00:07:01.010> is<00:07:01.130> it's<00:07:01.430> just<00:07:01.640> really<00:07:01.790> a<00:07:02.120> more<00:07:02.660> mild<00:07:02.900> dish

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760
