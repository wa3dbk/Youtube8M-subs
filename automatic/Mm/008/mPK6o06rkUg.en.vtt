actually come out because I had a few
problems<00:00:11.880> with<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.590> recording

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
problems with it and the recording

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.700 
problems with it and the recording
software<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.429> had<00:00:14.549> an<00:00:14.639> error<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.570> might<00:00:16.440> have

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
software I had an error and I might have

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.980 
software I had an error and I might have
lost<00:00:16.890> everything<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> microphone<00:00:18.510> so

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
lost everything on the microphone so

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.429 
lost everything on the microphone so
what's<00:00:19.230> shoes<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:20.510> got<00:00:21.510> quite<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.720> few<00:00:21.930> flying

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
what's shoes I got quite a few flying

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.540 
what's shoes I got quite a few flying
things<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:24.710> electric<00:00:25.710> or<00:00:25.890> ice<00:00:26.130> would<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
things so electric or ice would be a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.120 
things so electric or ice would be a
good<00:00:26.699> choice<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.510> guess<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.680> I've<00:00:28.800> made<00:00:28.949> that

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
good choice I guess that I've made that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.709 
good choice I guess that I've made that
trick<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:31.880> tentacle<00:00:32.880> has<00:00:33.030> both<00:00:33.239> electric<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
trick and tentacle has both electric and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.850 
trick and tentacle has both electric and
ice<00:00:34.370> as<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.760> last<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.899> want<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> tanky

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
ice as for the last one I want the tanky

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.639 
ice as for the last one I want the tanky
Pokemon<00:00:38.280> really<00:00:38.430> says<00:00:38.820> Salomon's<00:00:39.420> or<00:00:40.200> miltank

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
Pokemon really says Salomon's or miltank

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.600 
Pokemon really says Salomon's or miltank
and<00:00:41.570> I<00:00:42.570> can't<00:00:43.410> expect<00:00:43.739> ice<00:00:43.920> beam<00:00:44.160> from<00:00:44.340> suicune

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so sigma beans for make a choice it's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.560 
so sigma beans for make a choice it's
not<00:01:26.010> fun<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> wave<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.240> my<00:01:27.360> choice

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
myths and ice beans probably my best bet

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.400 
myths and ice beans probably my best bet
here<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:39.310> if<00:02:40.090> they<00:02:40.210> use<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.390> psychic<00:02:40.810> move<00:02:40.990> and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
here and if they use a psychic move and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.440 
here and if they use a psychic move and
every<00:02:42.220> head<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.880> rewards<00:02:43.240> lack<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.380> water<00:02:45.450> but

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
every head and rewards lack of water but

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.440 
every head and rewards lack of water but
at<00:02:46.510> least<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.780> hit<00:02:47.050> ice<00:02:48.010> beam<00:02:48.280> comes<00:02:48.520> off<00:02:48.730> double

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
at least I hit ice beam comes off double

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.100 
at least I hit ice beam comes off double
effective<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.520> just<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.640> bit

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.220 

and<00:02:54.320> they<00:02:54.470> use<00:02:54.650> dragon<00:02:55.100> house<00:02:55.280> in

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230

and they use dragon house in

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
this time for another ice beam and

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.520 
this time for another ice beam and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
something like that since a boiler mask

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.240 
something like that since a boiler mask
them<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:25.930> they're<00:03:26.080> blaming<00:03:26.319> both<00:03:26.680> runners<00:03:27.010> out
