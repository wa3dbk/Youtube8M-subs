00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
you're like level 30 and use enchantment

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.940 
you're like level 30 and use enchantment
of<00:01:35.100> level<00:01:35.400> 7<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.509> it'll<00:01:36.930> take<00:01:37.140> seven<00:01:37.590> levels

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
of level 7 then it'll take seven levels

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.090 
of level 7 then it'll take seven levels
away<00:01:38.220> that's<00:01:38.850> how<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.030> works<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.799> why<00:01:40.799> didn't

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
away that's how it works and why didn't

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.969 
away that's how it works and why didn't
I<00:01:41.220> realize<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:42.390> later<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.829> now

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I realize it later on is that for now

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.280 
I realize it later on is that for now
the<00:01:44.579> only<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.090> reason<00:01:45.420> why<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.780> only<00:01:45.930> low

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the only the reason why it's only low

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.319 
the only the reason why it's only low
level<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.890> because<00:01:47.399> there<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:47.880> enough

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
level is because there is not enough

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.410 
level is because there is not enough
bookshelves<00:01:48.930> around<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.979> Chapman<00:01:50.820> table<00:01:51.210> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
bookshelves around the Chapman table and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.880 
bookshelves around the Chapman table and
since<00:01:51.840> we're<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.020> creative<00:01:52.500> mode<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.680> don't

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
since we're in creative mode I don't

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.280 
since we're in creative mode I don't
want<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> worry<00:01:53.399> about<00:01:53.490> leveling<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
want to worry about leveling up so that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.020

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
I would just be able to use it as many

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.480 
I would just be able to use it as many
times<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.570> want<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.320> here<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> put

yep<00:03:27.900> level<00:03:28.260> 26<00:03:29.150> okay<00:03:30.150> let<00:03:30.390> me<00:03:30.450> see<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.720> let<00:03:31.320> me

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
yep level 26 okay let me see this let me

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.259 
yep level 26 okay let me see this let me
see<00:03:31.590> if<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.769> could<00:03:31.829> actually<00:03:31.950> take<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.340> out<00:03:32.489> up

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
see if I could actually take it out up

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.810 
see if I could actually take it out up
26<00:03:33.840> over<00:03:33.989> 30<00:03:34.410> years<00:03:34.530> at<00:03:34.829> level<00:03:35.100> 30<00:03:35.280> i<00:03:35.370> can<00:03:35.609> see

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
26 over 30 years at level 30 i can see

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.690 
26 over 30 years at level 30 i can see
it<00:03:35.910> well<00:03:36.420> not<00:03:36.690> enough<00:03:36.959> books<00:03:37.170> just<00:03:37.560> yet<00:03:37.859> so<00:03:38.609> you

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
it well not enough books just yet so you

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.180 
it well not enough books just yet so you
I<00:03:39.120> think<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:40.019> doesn't<00:03:40.799> matter<00:03:40.920> if

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
I think you just doesn't matter if

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.310 
I think you just doesn't matter if
they're<00:03:41.459> actually<00:03:42.030> wide<00:03:42.390> it's<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:42.930> this

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
they're actually wide it's just this

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.440 
they're actually wide it's just this
matter<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.370> bookshelves<00:03:44.970> are<00:03:45.150> actually

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
matter if the bookshelves are actually

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.240 
matter if the bookshelves are actually
close<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.140> enchantment<00:03:46.620> table<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:46.980> you're

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
close to the enchantment table so you're

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.289 
close to the enchantment table so you're
gonna<00:03:47.340> have<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.670> be<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.850> little<00:03:48.060> bit<00:03:48.209> of

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
gonna have to be a little bit of

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.180 
gonna have to be a little bit of
claustrophobic<00:03:48.989> here<00:03:49.290> just<00:03:49.799> for<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:50.070> to

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
claustrophobic here just for you to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.949 
claustrophobic here just for you to
actually<00:03:50.340> make<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.730> work<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.600> think<00:03:51.720> that's

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
actually make it work so I think that's

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.300 
actually make it work so I think that's
enough<00:03:52.079> books<00:03:52.410> look<00:03:52.650> at<00:03:52.739> all<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:53.010> letters

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
enough books look at all the letters

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.560 
enough books look at all the letters
actually<00:03:53.489> going<00:03:53.790> into<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.120> book<00:03:54.299> that's

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
actually going into the book that's

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.479 
actually going into the book that's
actually<00:03:54.930> really<00:03:55.140> neat<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:56.010> let<00:03:56.220> me<00:03:56.250> see<00:03:56.400> if

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
actually really neat so let me see if

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.009 
actually really neat so let me see if
this<00:03:56.579> works<00:03:56.790> let<00:03:57.359> me<00:03:57.420> see<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.630> missing<00:03:57.750> busy

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
this works let me see the missing busy

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.789 
this works let me see the missing busy
yep<00:03:58.799> level<00:03:59.190> 30<00:03:59.400> there<00:03:59.850> we<00:04:00.030> have<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.799> even

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
yep level 30 there we have it and even

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.340 
yep level 30 there we have it and even
then<00:04:02.130> on<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.430> enchantment<00:04:02.880> table<00:04:03.049> it's<00:04:04.049> all

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
then on the enchantment table it's all

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.530 
then on the enchantment table it's all
randomized<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.519> don't<00:04:05.700> actually<00:04:05.910> get<00:04:06.299> what

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
randomized you don't actually get what

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.690 
randomized you don't actually get what
you<00:04:06.660> want<00:04:06.900> if<00:04:07.319> you<00:04:07.890> want<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.250> get<00:04:08.370> something

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
you want if you want to get something

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.580 
you want if you want to get something
that's<00:04:09.000> really<00:04:09.420> great<00:04:09.840> but<00:04:10.139> you<00:04:10.200> don't<00:04:10.380> get<00:04:10.500> it

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
that's really great but you don't get it

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.289 
that's really great but you don't get it
at<00:04:10.709> all<00:04:10.859> it's<00:04:11.310> not<00:04:11.459> because<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:12.120> did

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
at all it's not because you did

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.490 
at all it's not because you did
something<00:04:12.450> wrong<00:04:12.690> it's<00:04:12.959> because<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
something wrong it's because the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.400 
something wrong it's because the
enchantment<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:14.480> pretty<00:04:15.480> random<00:04:15.780> in<00:04:16.079> itself

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
enchantment it's pretty random in itself

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.969 
enchantment it's pretty random in itself
and<00:04:16.829> I'm<00:04:17.729> pretty<00:04:17.910> sure<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.389> I'm<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.680> may<00:04:19.919> be

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
and I'm pretty sure that I'm it may be

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.640 
and I'm pretty sure that I'm it may be
just<00:04:20.310> my<00:04:20.820> theory<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.720> probably<00:04:21.959> will<00:04:22.289> be<00:04:22.409> able

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
just my theory you probably will be able

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.649 
just my theory you probably will be able
to<00:04:22.710> actually<00:04:22.890> read<00:04:23.280> what<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.820> description<00:04:24.479> is

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
to actually read what the description is

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.690 
to actually read what the description is
I<00:04:24.870> don't<00:04:25.500> know<00:04:25.560> if<00:04:25.650> it's<00:04:25.800> changed<00:04:26.280> or<00:04:26.400> anything

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
I don't know if it's changed or anything

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.500 
I don't know if it's changed or anything
you<00:04:26.909> cannot<00:04:27.180> read

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
you cannot read

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.120 
you cannot read
chat<00:04:27.780> items<00:04:28.260> you<00:04:28.530> can<00:04:28.650> change<00:04:28.980> the

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
chat items you can change the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.800 
chat items you can change the
enchantment<00:04:29.550> of<00:04:29.640> items<00:04:29.940> but<00:04:30.300> I<00:04:30.330> think<00:04:30.600> there's

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
enchantment of items but I think there's

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.660 
enchantment of items but I think there's
something<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.680> just<00:04:32.010> don't<00:04:32.430> know<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.580> just

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
something I just don't know I just

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.970 
something I just don't know I just
honestly<00:04:33.210> I'm<00:04:33.750> just<00:04:33.810> speaking<00:04:34.380> out<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.830> what<00:04:34.950> I

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
honestly I'm just speaking out of what I

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.920 
honestly I'm just speaking out of what I
think<00:04:35.310> is<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.880> could<00:04:36.090> be<00:04:36.120> different<00:04:36.510> if

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
think is that it could be different if

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.170 
think is that it could be different if
you<00:04:36.990> were<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.560> choose<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:38.070> different<00:04:38.550> 32<00:04:39.150> a

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
you were to choose a different 32 a

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.720 
you were to choose a different 32 a
different<00:04:39.510> 30<00:04:39.690> but<00:04:40.110> regardless<00:04:40.260> it<00:04:40.950> if<00:04:41.550> you

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
different 30 but regardless it if you

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.310 
different 30 but regardless it if you
want<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:41.940> trouble<00:04:42.120> so<00:04:42.390> through<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.780> then<00:04:43.200> go

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
want to trouble so through that then go

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.800 
want to trouble so through that then go
right<00:04:43.530> ahead<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:44.070> just<00:04:44.580> say<00:04:44.760> that<00:04:45.030> it's<00:04:45.300> it's

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
right ahead I just say that it's it's

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.200 
right ahead I just say that it's it's
completely<00:04:46.500> random<00:04:46.890> all<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:47.730> is<00:04:47.820> it's<00:04:48.120> just

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
completely random all it is it's just

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.940 
completely random all it is it's just
you<00:04:48.600> may<00:04:48.780> get<00:04:48.960> what<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.230> want<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:49.560> may<00:04:49.740> not

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
you may get what you want you may not

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.040 
you may get what you want you may not
get<00:04:50.190> what<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.460> want<00:04:50.670> so<00:04:51.480> you're<00:04:51.750> pretty<00:04:51.930> much

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
get what you want so you're pretty much

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.540 
get what you want so you're pretty much
gambling<00:04:52.650> every<00:04:52.920> single<00:04:53.190> time<00:04:53.340> which

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
gambling every single time which

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.010 
gambling every single time which
actually<00:04:53.760> makes<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.120> game<00:04:54.270> fair<00:04:54.570> because<00:04:54.780> if

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
actually makes the game fair because if

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.980 
actually makes the game fair because if
it<00:04:55.140> actually<00:04:55.350> chooses<00:04:55.830> one<00:04:56.360> enchantment<00:04:57.360> over
