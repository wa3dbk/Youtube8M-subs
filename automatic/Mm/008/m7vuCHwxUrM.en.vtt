00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.820
 and at the end you got a caress the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.280
 ball is a fair affection but in the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.370
 crossbar but good are the things that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.260
 he has football but the truth is not 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.820
 happy because we had to win 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.170
 we came from a party that had 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.119
 fire very bad and good and we had to 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.250
 win over everything and the team delivery 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.679
 I think that we have to rescue him there 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.589
 things to improve of course but 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.779
 as I told you before how important it is 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.400
 is talking to him if you do not get something 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.310
 can you know more or less who was 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.560
 happy the pain yes yes we told ourselves 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.790
 congratulated for the delivery but that said 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.500
 I think you have to have peace of mind in 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.600
 this time supporting people as 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.460
 we have been having a day tuesday monday 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.200
 the court is always full then 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.330
 I think we owe ourselves what 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.700
 important that I think we have to 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.560
 trust everyone on the team I think that 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.480
 the most important thing here you can leave 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.640
 things are bad but good are a 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.130
 important matches that we all want 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.960
 win we want 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.510
 go as best as possible and we are all 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.920
 fighting for that more is to say that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.080
 there are things to improve can be explained 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.150
 because also against union because a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.770
 party so the truth awful aupa 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.960
 rhythm against national I good that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.409
 they raise again is there a 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.240
 Explanation 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.770
 you said the right word and we 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.200
 we are aware that he makes a match 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.670
 of 10 points and the other one of 1 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.310
 so I think you have to tell a 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.899
 regularly we talk a lot with the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.789
 coach among the teammates there 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.640
 things to correct I think we have to be 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.259
 more solid more orderly when playing 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.479
 both local and visitor 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.509
 handle the games the ball and I think 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.159
 that you have to follow along the way as 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.170
 when we went to local, everything must be 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.060
 keep that line that out there from 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.649
 visitor is costing us a bit with 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.709
 the bull all mud not so they are not left 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.360
 doubt if that is a bit also the 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.610
 things that are spoken of the environment of 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.799
 out I think sometimes some bad 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.329
 milk and they are also things of the club that 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.890
 they come out that does not do good to the 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.409
 institution then this is not a 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.909
 Coach House level us 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.670
 we are from the club so I think I 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.469
 annoying when you talk bullshit to 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.609
 hurt the institution and sometimes those 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.440
 same also and here inside then 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.539
 I think if we all want the club 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.829
 we have to pull all forward is 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.959
 both when the thing also when 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.150
 they are wrong, you throw something here, you're not bad, 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.769
 they lost games that the team did not play 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.510
 well but good among all I think that 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.270
 we have to take these things forward more 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.610
 clarito impossible max and thanks 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.610
 there was the clear beast as one
