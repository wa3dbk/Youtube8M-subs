and<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.949> tanker<00:00:20.310> Asia<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.820> also<00:00:20.869> equally

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and the tanker Asia is also equally

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.570

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
they're pegged on by these two pegs but

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.869 
they're pegged on by these two pegs but
as<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.530> said<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.010> don't<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:38.700> they're

supposed to come off so you can get the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.369 
supposed to come off so you can get the
effect<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.930> it's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
effect of it going like that but it's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.770 
effect of it going like that but it's
just<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.800> solid<00:00:47.100> piece<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.520> painted<00:00:47.910> plastic<00:00:48.510> so

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
just a solid piece of painted plastic so

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.410 
just a solid piece of painted plastic so
you're<00:00:48.989> not<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.680> get<00:00:49.950> any

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
you're not going to really get any

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.420 
you're not going to really get any
spinning<00:00:51.420> wheels<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:52.079> anything<00:00:52.289> cool<00:00:52.739> you

cannot get two yellow green and pink
there<00:01:02.910> they're<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.660> designed<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.170> come<00:01:04.379> out

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
there they're not designed to come out

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.679 
there they're not designed to come out
of<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.799> unfortunately<00:01:05.299> overall<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
of here unfortunately overall it is a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.289 
of here unfortunately overall it is a
nice<00:01:07.020> looking<00:01:07.500> ratio<00:01:07.950> big<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> blocky<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
nice looking ratio big and blocky it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.100 
nice looking ratio big and blocky it
does<00:01:09.780> split<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.820> fold<00:01:11.820> out<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.840> get

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
does split and fold out so you can get

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.390 
does split and fold out so you can get
some<00:01:13.770> curvature<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.270> Train<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
some curvature going on the Train and

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.130 
some curvature going on the Train and
then<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.790> also<00:01:18.030> has<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> couple<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:19.020> other

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
then it also has a couple of other

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.590 
then it also has a couple of other
features<00:01:19.470> or<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.340> should<00:01:20.790> say<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> couple<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.540> uh

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
carrier and to do that we will remove

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.000 
carrier and to do that we will remove
yellow<00:02:41.549> or<00:02:42.030> half<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.630> yellow<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.170> simply

attach car carrier raesha and then we

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.650 
attach car carrier raesha and then we

it<00:04:49.920> with<00:04:50.040> this<00:04:50.220> but<00:04:50.520> they'll<00:04:50.850> hit<00:04:51.240> so<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.920> can

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
it with this but they'll hit so you can

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.930 
it with this but they'll hit so you can
get<00:04:53.490> this<00:04:54.200> then<00:04:55.200> fold<00:04:55.740> out<00:04:55.980> these<00:04:56.250> clips<00:04:56.730> on

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
get this then fold out these clips on

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.610 
get this then fold out these clips on
both<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.540> booga<00:04:57.900> on<00:04:58.110> both<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.680> car<00:04:59.490> carrier<00:04:59.940> and

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.270 
both the booga on both a car carrier and
tanker<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:02.000> attach<00:05:03.000> them<00:05:03.450> to<00:05:05.420> blue<00:05:06.420> and<00:05:06.810> green

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
tanker and attach them to blue and green

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.330 
tanker and attach them to blue and green
so<00:05:08.280> as<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:08.940> can<00:05:09.090> see<00:05:09.150> we've<00:05:09.990> got<00:05:10.230> extra<00:05:11.040> long

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
so as you can see we've got extra long

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.740 
so as you can see we've got extra long
arms<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.180> then<00:05:12.630> these<00:05:13.380> guys<00:05:13.710> on<00:05:14.100> the<00:05:14.430> legs<00:05:14.750> so

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
arms and then these guys on the legs so

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.020 
arms and then these guys on the legs so
yeah<00:05:16.290> one<00:05:16.980> way<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.250> make<00:05:17.640> this<00:05:17.820> look

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
yeah one way to make this look

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.140 
yeah one way to make this look
completely<00:05:18.480> ridiculous

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
completely ridiculous

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.810 
completely ridiculous
another<00:05:20.900> long<00:05:21.200> arm<00:05:21.470> mode<00:05:21.740> is<00:05:22.010> simply<00:05:22.430> just

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
another long arm mode is simply just

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.730 
another long arm mode is simply just
putting<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.240> trains<00:05:23.540> right<00:05:23.900> on<00:05:24.050> top<00:05:24.290> of<00:05:24.320> pink

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
putting the trains right on top of pink

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.430 
putting the trains right on top of pink
and<00:05:24.860> yellow<00:05:25.010> so<00:05:25.760> we<00:05:26.210> have<00:05:26.390> equally<00:05:26.960> ridiculous

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
and yellow so we have equally ridiculous

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.000 
and yellow so we have equally ridiculous
here<00:05:28.210> next<00:05:29.210> we<00:05:29.360> can<00:05:29.540> give<00:05:29.690> him<00:05:29.870> very<00:05:30.290> long<00:05:30.680> legs

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
here next we can give him very long legs

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.300 
here next we can give him very long legs
so<00:05:31.670> we<00:05:32.000> can<00:05:32.180> either<00:05:32.650> pull<00:05:33.650> these<00:05:33.800> apart<00:05:33.860> again

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
so we can either pull these apart again

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.000 
so we can either pull these apart again
which<00:05:34.850> we'll<00:05:35.420> go<00:05:35.540> ahead<00:05:35.630> and<00:05:35.750> do<00:05:35.930> that<00:05:36.010> pull

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
which we'll go ahead and do that pull

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.350 
which we'll go ahead and do that pull
them<00:05:37.190> apart<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.730> then<00:05:38.090> attach<00:05:38.690> them<00:05:39.550> to<00:05:40.550> red
