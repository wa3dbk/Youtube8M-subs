00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
adjacent blocks to the cactus then

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.060 
adjacent blocks to the cactus then

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
finally we will place a sign here this

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.620 
finally we will place a sign here this
will<00:02:19.310> prevent<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.760> characters<00:02:20.150> from<00:02:20.269> growing

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
will prevent the characters from growing
