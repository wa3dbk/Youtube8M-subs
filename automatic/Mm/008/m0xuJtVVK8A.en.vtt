00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
delicate fibers that may not the person

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.780 
delicate fibers that may not the person
initially<00:00:12.690> unconscious<00:00:13.290> or<00:00:14.070> may<00:00:14.370> cause<00:00:14.610> them

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
initially unconscious or may cause them

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.450 
initially unconscious or may cause them
to<00:00:14.940> drop<00:00:15.179> but<00:00:15.330> when<00:00:15.509> they<00:00:15.660> drop<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.320> ground

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
to drop but when they drop to the ground

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.490 
to drop but when they drop to the ground
then<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.670> brain<00:00:17.880> goes<00:00:18.150> back<00:00:18.600> hits<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.289> ground

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
then the brain goes back hits the ground

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.279 
then the brain goes back hits the ground
and<00:00:20.189> as<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.490> stops<00:00:20.850> there<00:00:21.180> everything<00:00:21.990> shakes

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
and as it stops there everything shakes

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.439 
and as it stops there everything shakes
gives<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.890> violent<00:00:23.490> shake<00:00:23.760> like<00:00:24.150> when<00:00:24.330> you're

the range which basically is irreparable

the range which basically is irreparable
but<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.750> happens<00:01:07.110> after<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.799> real

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
but what happens after that's a real

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670 
but what happens after that's a real
problem<00:01:08.330> hemorrhages<00:01:09.330> occur<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:10.260> causes

more damage

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.130 
more damage
but<00:01:12.470> then<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.920> swelling<00:01:13.340> sensing<00:01:13.850> this<00:01:14.720> Fox

but then the swelling sensing this Fox

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.830 
but then the swelling sensing this Fox
won't<00:01:15.680> move<00:01:15.980> and<00:01:16.340> because<00:01:17.150> it's<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.540> fixed

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840

won't move and because it's in a fixed
Fox<00:01:18.110> as<00:01:18.800> a<00:01:18.860> brain<00:01:19.280> swells<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.810> pressure<00:01:21.050> in

Fox as a brain swells the pressure in

Fox as a brain swells the pressure in
the<00:01:21.380> brain<00:01:21.470> goes<00:01:21.710> up<00:01:21.860> that's<00:01:21.980> got<00:01:22.160> nowhere<00:01:22.400> to

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
the brain goes up that's got nowhere to

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.120 
the brain goes up that's got nowhere to
go<00:01:22.520> it's<00:01:22.940> in<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.180> box<00:01:23.360> if<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:24.410> skull<00:01:24.680> is<00:01:24.890> if

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
go it's in the box if the skull is if

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.060 
go it's in the box if the skull is if
the<00:01:25.400> skull<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:25.790> damaged<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.650> skull<00:01:27.890> is

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
the skull is damaged and so the skull is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.180 
the skull is damaged and so the skull is
broken<00:01:28.220> it's<00:01:28.910> not<00:01:29.180> going<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.420> expand<00:01:29.840> enough

broken it's not going to expand enough

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.980 
broken it's not going to expand enough
what<00:01:31.190> sometimes<00:01:31.550> happens<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.330> since<00:01:32.570> the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
what sometimes happens is since the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.770 
what sometimes happens is since the
pressure<00:01:33.350> goes<00:01:33.650> up<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.100> high<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.000> brain<00:01:35.390> will

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
pressure goes up so high the brain will

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.140 
pressure goes up so high the brain will
ooze<00:01:35.930> out<00:01:36.229> of<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.470> skull<00:01:36.830> so<00:01:37.160> brain<00:01:37.760> will<00:01:37.970> lose

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
ooze out of the skull so brain will lose

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.630 
ooze out of the skull so brain will lose
out<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.630> nose<00:01:38.840> brain<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:39.830> lose<00:01:40.100> out<00:01:40.369> of<00:01:40.550> the

out of the nose brain a lose out of the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.030 
out of the nose brain a lose out of the

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.940 
air or brain a lose out of the fracture
and<00:01:43.720> that's<00:01:44.720> that's<00:01:45.020> that's<00:01:45.590> pretty
