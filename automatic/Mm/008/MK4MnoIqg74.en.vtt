00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.340
 it's just look at this one already six cylinders 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.680
 lever is different now is seeing 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.730
 which is shorter and has less game, right? 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.380
 Look at the currency exchange and if there is air 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.480
 conditioning, although it was not that the 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:28.750
 There were souvenirs below the panel. 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.680
 good, not right now, and it accelerates a bit 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.239
 later on heavier second looks 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:41.140
 I have a better slingshot the footprint 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.480
 good and a good grip and remembering that 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.319
 will and nothing on the panel also in the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.190
 panel 

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:49.480
 only that fuel temperature 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.429
 speed 180 kilometers per hour and 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.120
 anything right 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.280
 we got up to rpm and he put it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.469
 prepared that is not original to count 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:06.670
 money here and here are the following people 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:08.890
 It's not like today's electronic injection 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.420
 You get the car hit today. 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.620
 You do not have any problem because it gives 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.320
 a cut in the river 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.680
 here is the following if you go through what the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.260
 promoter to touch us so had 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.330
 a hard finger that we called because 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.530
 when the pilot missed the march broke 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:30.160
 the engine then appeared there it is decided by 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.990
 a red light and it was because the engine 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.180
 passed of judas and gave birth motorcycle 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.760
 went from going because he broke the engine and 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.480
 it was like that 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.000
 Duck side ripping block motors pro day 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.100
 today the electronic injection has no more 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.020
 door all this but the carburetors was 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.410
 so and this place still here being 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.480
 if you accelerate too much from spinning 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.690
 He will break a lot He has to take 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.030
 careful here on time to speed up or 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.240
 remember that a rush to touch let's 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.900
 there first magic switched on the light 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:09.030
 red in stock sped the engine spin 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.030
 I'll pull the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.580
 already the third plus 1 to 1 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.849
 ah ah ah we're going to see this one six 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.739
 how long does it look? 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.790
 just one more little bit ahead 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.489
 heavier 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.310
 Look there, you have to turn. 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.620
 that will come a lot of direction to do 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.620
 over there 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:45.150
 but whoever goes to make the voice one more was the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:48.510
 I wish I knew the cylinder we like 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.720
 then the six cylinder 6 cylinder with 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.049
 this motorzÃ£o this tasty noise and 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.349
 Now let's try that super 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.209
 red machine by beautiful florida 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.109
 16 - cylinder engine and let's tube 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.700
 let's go 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.359
 I'm going to miss six here. 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.599
 cylinders beige color range four 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:12.720
 cylinders 2 of the same year, cute 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.060
 the brothers made their homesick too 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.180
 I was going to here now, look at the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.440
 most beautiful color gives a close aquino 4 and 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.200
 without red and special caprice in his 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.599
 Special palaia a series that the GM 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.459
 threw two doors right 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.049
 that also two pictures of her while 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.870
 that the cars were two more doors 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.139
 Then came the diplomat then with four 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.139
 doors 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.870
