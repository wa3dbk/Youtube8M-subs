00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.379
 hi friends is a cougar i am juan 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:09.050
 pablo opened the red and then today we have 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.290
 a special interview in a format 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.450
 different because the güero toñito garcía 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.799
 He invited us to his house to give us a 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.230
 straight to see if we can do the 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.390
 America match prediction cougars 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.360
 Saturday how was this myth for how 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.149
 are welcome to my cave this is the 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.910
 key is going to have caves now with whom 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:32.840
 let's play teach us and explain 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.450
 because he was looking at a 4-4-2 face that is 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.070
 the one that normally puma was used in 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.910
 then and in the tournament and well the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.450
 template the best is not up to date 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.460
 but let's work with peak with fer 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:54.400
 by right verón and pico luis fuentes 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.150
 goat romagnoli soap the spark 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.910
 louis and martín 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.290
 that would be your ideal eleven for him for 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.050
 Sunday tell me what's going on with the match 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.410
 yesterday what happened I did not see the truth 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.070
 pretty pretty even I think that the 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.650
 two teams played quite well 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.010
 but America had had one and the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.910
 He knew how to take advantage of not but good 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.300
 I totally trust my team and I believe 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.550
 what a big team is standing for challenges 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.130
 great then trust in the in the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.410
 comeback on Saturday for everything 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.970
 initial- let's go and we'll line up and 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.750
 I believe that we align ourselves to take 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.880
 also before to all luxury is that such not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.820
 do not stretch you so much we are 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.820
 leaving just today and I also think that 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.950
 pikolin saved there's a card 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.700
 rojita not yesterday I thought is that I see it 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.630
 how it slips 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.079
 that is , he slips and obviously that 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.500
 Street 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:03.170
 about no agreement has a lot that we 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.759
 will like to peak very well as in the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.979
 tournament I think this has been your best 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.810
 February in the story if the age 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.690
 made this reduction that we did not 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.489
 save one or two per game in the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.069
 community and is the one that had robbed them 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.680
 sangüesa that such in the angle that as 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.769
 how you live a game like yesterday 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.980
 quarterfinals and against the opponent do 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.360
 rhythm something more and then being basic in 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.610
 the tribune 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.730
 in the gallery obviously I think that 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.760
 I get more nervous outside than inside 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.640
 apart it's an impotence that does not 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.880
 you can do nothing or you can not solve 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.780
 in that at that time but they are good 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.140
 football stuff and I'm encouraged today I 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.010
 touched to be in our situation and there's 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.240
 that you really want to 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.980
 rehabilitation for the next tornado 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.570
 to be able to contribute everything with the team and not 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.570
 where I bring you cuts 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.800
 that of the fixed tactic that I made habitat 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.090
 I think it is absolutely right number 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.940
 of the goals of the last goals of 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.680
 foam against pachuca against one by 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.840
 another where javier courteous that already the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.360
 It has very made that they are on one side of 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.040
 corner shot center to second post 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.379
 vote 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.750
 another is the collection is very very good because 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.750
 normally as a goalie always 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.510
 you always wait until the last 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.510
 moment by any deviation equals and 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.940
 with any detour to does it is 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.489
 get look to see where it's seen yesterday not 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.530
 I know if you noticed or jazz is also something 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.819
 budget but suddenly you see 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.069
 a guy who incorporates very well the 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.209
 attack and also say that he arms him in 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.980
 attack I do not know if you like it very much and apart 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:04:00.060
 you know if you do them you have class and you're 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.609
 clear good combination luis garcía el 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.290
 center of javier cortés to the second post 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:09.690
 Luis Garcia recent from home and defined 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.540
 superb superb mining grade is the 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.049
 repetition 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.160
 and bravos again very well I'm going to start 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:27.400
 of sight never and he put a fierrazo 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:29.409
 just for a bookmark but see nothing more 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.050
 what a game and ccoo 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.919
 this is our luis garcia brings 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.919
 bravos among others 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.930
 we form rajoy also the repetition of 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.570
 the definition of bravo look more 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.169
 Cabrera fights the ball sends it to 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.050
 luis garcía that itches between 2 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.599
 bravo there is coming bravo by lawyer 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:01.029
 bravo bravísimo and meana more with that 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:02.800
 calm that a monkey taught today is with 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.629
 this pumas marker and I would be in 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.600
 semifinals we the colorados that 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:10.920
 let's go for those who go up 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.780
 Careful they did not nail us a nailed to 90 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:18.000
 the dive into a global says badly says 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.800
 Well, the truth is that the party was 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.360
 great 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.240
 and the ranch the whole game all 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.250
 complete 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.800
 and good at the end there is an oversight and we 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.430
 They scored a goal but well we did not 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.250
 this does not mean that Saturday goes 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:40.160
 a bit bad but the team knows how to play and 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.130
 I also have a few hours left 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.910
 of game 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.910
 to Barcelona 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.650
 but very well my beloved toñito 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.770

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.960

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.389

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:16.569
 invite people to support this 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.039
 it still does not finish us like it already 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:22.220
 I was commenting a big team is for 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:25.069
 for big challenges and I trust my 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.870
 comrades and in the team that goes that 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:28.729
 they will advance to the next round by 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.950

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.710
 pumas is going to come back 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:37.060
 That does not fit them, I'm John Paul 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.060
