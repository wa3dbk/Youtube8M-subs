vp tom gibbons gives us the interactive
tour<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.970> called<00:00:51.300> surface<00:00:51.750> computing<00:00:52.560> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
tour it's called surface computing and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
tour it's called surface computing and
you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.310> without<00:00:53.490> the<00:00:53.880> interface<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
you can do it without the interface of a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.850 
you can do it without the interface of a
mouse<00:00:54.900> so<00:00:55.200> the<00:00:55.380> object<00:00:55.770> recognition<00:00:57.860> how

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
mouse so the object recognition how

here and I can drag it in and when it
comes<00:01:07.469> time<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.770> pay<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.579> lay<00:01:08.789> down<00:01:08.820> your

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
comes time to pay just lay down your

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.419 
comes time to pay just lay down your
credit<00:01:09.630> card<00:01:09.899> divvy<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.469> bill<00:01:10.649> add<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.340> the

credit card divvy up the bill add in the

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:14.630 
credit card divvy up the bill add in the
tip<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.939> lead<00:01:12.920> under<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> screen<00:01:14.369> our

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
tip and lead under the screen our

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
tip and lead under the screen our
cameras<00:01:15.149> that<00:01:15.329> can<00:01:15.450> actually<00:01:15.630> see<00:01:16.140> what

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
cameras that can actually see what

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
cameras that can actually see what
you're<00:01:16.560> touching<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.130> then<00:01:17.219> the<00:01:17.310> computer

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
you're touching and then the computer

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.719 
you're touching and then the computer
reacts<00:01:18.210> creating<00:01:18.929> an<00:01:19.020> image<00:01:19.520> there<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.609> go

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
reacts creating an image there you go

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
reacts creating an image there you go
and<00:01:21.359> again<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:22.079> just<00:01:22.200> put<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.409> down<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and again we just put it down here and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.429 
and again we just put it down here and
it<00:01:23.429> spills<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.789> photos<00:01:24.329> not<00:01:24.749> a<00:01:24.780> prompt<00:01:25.200> see

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
it spills out photos not a prompt see

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.469 
it spills out photos not a prompt see
it's<00:01:25.859> like<00:01:26.070> they're<00:01:26.280> magically<00:01:26.850> drawn<00:01:27.149> out<00:01:27.329> of

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
it's like they're magically drawn out of

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.469 
it's like they're magically drawn out of
your<00:01:27.630> digital<00:01:28.049> camera<00:01:28.109> into<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> box

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
your digital camera into the box

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.910 
your digital camera into the box
wirelessly<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.689> course<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.319> now<00:01:31.499> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.770> grab

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
wirelessly of course so now you can grab

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.609 
wirelessly of course so now you can grab
photos<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.819> grab<00:01:33.060> photos<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.840> bit

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
photos and I grab photos and we can bit

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.069 
photos and I grab photos and we can bit
bigger<00:01:35.009> or<00:01:35.280> smaller<00:01:35.579> white<00:01:36.329> table<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.929> this

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
bigger or smaller white table in this

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.200 
bigger or smaller white table in this
case<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.039> case<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.030> we've

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
case in this case it is and so we've

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.819 
case in this case it is and so we've
used<00:01:39.450> those<00:01:39.780> different<00:01:40.109> attributes<00:01:40.649> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
used those different attributes of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.219 
used those different attributes of
surface<00:01:41.249> computing<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.600> application<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
surface computing in this application to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.779 
surface computing in this application to
create<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.499> totally<00:01:44.130> different<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:44.759> of

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
create a totally different kind of

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.730 
create a totally different kind of
experience<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.659> you've<00:01:45.899> got<00:01:45.929> video<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.469> want

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
experience if you've got video you want

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.719 
experience if you've got video you want
running<00:01:47.069> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.850> actually<00:01:48.499> put<00:01:49.499> a<00:01:49.530> video<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
running you can actually put a video the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.429 
running you can actually put a video the
first<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.179> these<00:01:51.329> units<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:51.899> into<00:01:52.139> bars

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
first of these units will go into bars

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.950
