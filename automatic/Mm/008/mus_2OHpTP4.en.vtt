we're<00:00:41.640> expecting<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.780> what<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.079> told<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
we're expecting and what we told the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.350 
we're expecting and what we told the
family<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.120> some

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
family is that we need to do some

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.160 
family is that we need to do some
additional<00:00:45.570> testing<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:47.149> his<00:00:48.149> brain<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.960> so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
additional testing of his brain and so

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.750 
additional testing of his brain and so
forth<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.829> need<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.899> continue<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.430> look<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.610> his

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
forth we need to continue to look at his

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.490 
forth we need to continue to look at his
lungs<00:00:54.030> we've<00:00:54.449> been<00:00:54.660> doing<00:00:54.960> daily

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
lungs we've been doing daily

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.029 
lungs we've been doing daily
bronchoscopy<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:57.690> try<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> sand<00:00:58.800> out

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
bronchoscopy to try to get the sand out

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.110 
bronchoscopy to try to get the sand out
as<00:00:59.340> well<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.300> inflammation<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.469> occurs

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
as well as the inflammation that occurs

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.640 
as well as the inflammation that occurs
from<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.390> lungs<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:04.229> they've<00:01:04.439> got<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
from the lungs because they've got a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
from the lungs because they've got a
foreign<00:01:05.010> body<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.369> them<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.630> sand<00:01:08.180> but<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.299> he

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
foreign body in them the sand but if he

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
foreign body in them the sand but if he
continues<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> recover<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> rate<00:01:10.890> he<00:01:11.100> is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
continues to recover at the rate he is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
continues to recover at the rate he is
we<00:01:11.460> expect<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.939> him<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.780> off<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
we expect to him to be off the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.280 
we expect to him to be off the
ventilator<00:01:13.439> by<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.920> end<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> week

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
ventilator by the end of the week

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.030 
ventilator by the end of the week
perhaps<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:18.390> hospital<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:19.200> 10<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.860> 14

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
perhaps out of this hospital in 10 to 14

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.580 
perhaps out of this hospital in 10 to 14
days<00:01:22.460> one<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.390> week<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.780> probably<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.259> month

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
days one to one week to probably a month

days one to one week to probably a month
in<00:01:25.830> rehab<00:01:26.280> depending<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.390> everything

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
in rehab depending on what everything

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
in rehab depending on what everything
looks<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.080> once<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.799> him<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.909> is

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
looks like once we get him it is

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
looks like once we get him it is
breathing<00:01:30.450> tube<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.079> see<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.439> he<00:01:31.500> looks

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
breathing tube out and see what he looks

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.600 
breathing tube out and see what he looks
like<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.150> then<00:01:33.150> hopefully<00:01:33.659> home<00:01:34.340> we<00:01:35.340> have

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
like and then hopefully home we have

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.370 
like and then hopefully home we have
told<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> family<00:01:36.210> we're<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.659> sure<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.170> his

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
told the family we're not sure what his

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.990 
told the family we're not sure what his
long-term<00:01:37.890> lung<00:01:38.780> injury<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:41.000> but

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
long-term lung injury is going to be but

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.429 
long-term lung injury is going to be but
has<00:01:42.150> fundamentally<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.930> least<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.350> I've

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
has fundamentally at least what I've

sand is sand and we all understand when

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.940 
sand is sand and we all understand when
we<00:02:14.430> go<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.880> beach<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.420> we<00:02:15.780> get<00:02:15.930> sand<00:02:16.740> in

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
we go to the beach and we get sand in

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.130 
we go to the beach and we get sand in
things<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.460> we<00:02:17.880> find<00:02:18.210> sand<00:02:18.540> six<00:02:18.840> months

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
things that we find sand six months

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.620 
things that we find sand six months
later<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.850> unfortunately<00:02:20.850> we<00:02:21.090> believe<00:02:21.390> he's

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
later and unfortunately we believe he's

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.880 
later and unfortunately we believe he's
probably<00:02:21.870> going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.260> sand<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.680> his<00:02:22.830> lungs

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
probably going to have sand in his lungs

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.310 
probably going to have sand in his lungs
six<00:02:23.430> months<00:02:23.700> later<00:02:23.850> as<00:02:24.090> well<00:02:24.330> but<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.170> are

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
six months later as well but we are

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.290 
six months later as well but we are
washing<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:25.920> as<00:02:26.130> much<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.760> sand<00:02:27.000> as<00:02:27.180> we

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
washing out as much of the sand as we

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.460 
washing out as much of the sand as we
can<00:02:27.540> with<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.380> daily<00:02:28.680> bronchoscopy<00:02:29.960> so<00:02:30.960> he<00:02:31.320> is

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
can with the daily bronchoscopy so he is

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.850 
can with the daily bronchoscopy so he is
at<00:02:31.740> risk<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.550> infection<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.480> actually<00:02:33.840> but<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
at risk of infection I actually but the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.670 
at risk of infection I actually but the
other<00:02:34.940> issue<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.270> foreign<00:02:36.660> bodies<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.350> that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
other issue with foreign bodies is that

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.150 
other issue with foreign bodies is that
your<00:02:38.040> your<00:02:39.000> body<00:02:39.210> tries<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.960> just<00:02:40.830> fight<00:02:41.130> it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
your your body tries to just fight it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.700 
your your body tries to just fight it
off<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.750> can<00:02:42.930> lead<00:02:42.960> to<00:02:43.200> an<00:02:43.440> allergic

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
off and that can lead to an allergic

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.420 
off and that can lead to an allergic
reaction<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.910> lead<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.180> an<00:02:45.810> autoimmune

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
reaction it can lead to an autoimmune

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.250 
reaction it can lead to an autoimmune
reaction<00:02:47.430> which<00:02:48.210> means<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:48.930> your<00:02:49.080> body

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
reaction which means that as your body

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.140 
reaction which means that as your body
starts<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.770> fight<00:02:50.040> off<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.370> foreign<00:02:50.730> body<00:02:50.910> it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
starts to fight off that foreign body it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.830 
starts to fight off that foreign body it
may<00:02:51.330> actually<00:02:51.660> also<00:02:52.050> end<00:02:53.000> up<00:02:54.000> fighting<00:02:54.330> itself

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
may actually also end up fighting itself

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.060 
may actually also end up fighting itself
some<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:56.490> cause<00:02:56.790> wheezing<00:02:57.300> cause<00:03:00.680> just<00:03:01.680> the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
some and cause wheezing cause just the

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.880 
some and cause wheezing cause just the
inability<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.790> take<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.480> deep<00:03:03.780> breath<00:03:03.990> in<00:03:04.200> and

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
inability to take a deep breath in and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.360 
inability to take a deep breath in and
and<00:03:05.490> have<00:03:05.970> normal<00:03:06.450> breathing<00:03:07.110> in<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.530> future

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
and have normal breathing in the future

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.630 
and have normal breathing in the future
and<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:09.209> really<00:03:09.360> hard<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.020> tell<00:03:10.640> what

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
and it's just really hard to tell what

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.070 
and it's just really hard to tell what
if<00:03:11.880> anything<00:03:12.150> will<00:03:12.480> happen<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:14.300> I<00:03:15.300> have<00:03:15.900> not

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
if anything will happen and I have not

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.440 
if anything will happen and I have not
seen<00:03:16.350> reports<00:03:16.770> such<00:03:17.100> as<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.489> what<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
seen reports such as to what the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.120 
seen reports such as to what the
survivors<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.020> this<00:03:19.320> looked<00:03:19.530> like<00:03:19.620> at<00:03:19.890> six

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
survivors that this looked like at six

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.640 
survivors that this looked like at six
to<00:03:20.280> 12<00:03:20.520> months<00:03:20.610> or<00:03:21.090> several<00:03:21.690> years<00:03:21.930> out<00:03:22.170> he

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
to 12 months or several years out he

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.530 
to 12 months or several years out he
actually<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:23.220> don't<00:03:23.489> believe<00:03:23.910> got<00:03:24.120> intubated

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
actually I don't believe got intubated

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.960 
actually I don't believe got intubated
until<00:03:24.959> he<00:03:25.080> got<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> outside<00:03:25.890> hospital<00:03:26.400> so

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
until he got to the outside hospital so

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.199 
until he got to the outside hospital so
he<00:03:27.000> was<00:03:27.420> he<00:03:28.260> was<00:03:28.440> breathing<00:03:28.770> at<00:03:29.250> some<00:03:29.760> level<00:03:30.060> on

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
he was he was breathing at some level on

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.690 
he was he was breathing at some level on
his<00:03:30.420> own<00:03:30.600> before<00:03:31.170> when<00:03:31.680> he<00:03:31.920> was<00:03:32.450> found<00:03:33.450> I

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
his own before when he was found I

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.860 
his own before when he was found I
believe<00:03:35.700> he<00:03:35.880> had<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.209> have<00:03:36.330> an<00:03:36.450> air<00:03:36.630> pocket

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
believe he had to have an air pocket

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.810 
believe he had to have an air pocket
down<00:03:37.200> there<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:40.459> because<00:03:41.459> that's<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.790> only

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
down there and because that's the only

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.910 
down there and because that's the only
way<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.750> could<00:03:43.020> have<00:03:43.110> been<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.739> case

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
way that that could have been the case

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.680 
way that that could have been the case
so<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:45.330> expected<00:03:46.260> him<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.650> arrive<00:03:46.950> much<00:03:47.910> sicker

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
so I expected him to arrive much sicker

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.640 
so I expected him to arrive much sicker
than<00:03:49.370> he<00:03:50.370> did<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:50.900> since<00:03:51.900> he<00:03:52.020> didn't<00:03:52.320> arrive

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
than he did and since he didn't arrive

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.979 
than he did and since he didn't arrive
sick<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.220> actually<00:03:53.520> expected<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.330> first<00:03:54.510> 24

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
sick I actually expected the first 24

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.530 
sick I actually expected the first 24
hours<00:03:55.020> to<00:03:55.470> get<00:03:55.590> works<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.160> he<00:03:56.580> really<00:03:57.180> did<00:03:57.360> not

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
hours to get works and he really did not

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.710 
hours to get works and he really did not
there<00:03:57.840> either<00:03:58.820> because<00:03:59.820> of<00:03:59.850> his<00:04:00.120> lung<00:04:00.330> injury

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
there either because of his lung injury

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.979 
there either because of his lung injury
we<00:04:00.900> are<00:04:01.050> trying<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.860> keep<00:04:02.070> him<00:04:02.630> sedated<00:04:03.630> with

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
we are trying to keep him sedated with

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.680 
we are trying to keep him sedated with
medication<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.300> intermittently<00:04:06.300> we<00:04:06.540> have

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
medication and intermittently we have

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.930 
medication and intermittently we have
also<00:04:06.989> had<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.410> give<00:04:08.190> him<00:04:08.370> medicine<00:04:08.640> to

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
also had to give him medicine to

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.520 
also had to give him medicine to
paralyze

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
paralyze

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.400 
paralyze
him<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:10.370> we<00:04:11.150> actually<00:04:11.510> don't<00:04:11.660> want<00:04:11.930> him<00:04:12.110> awake

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
him so we actually don't want him awake

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.539 
him so we actually don't want him awake
and<00:04:12.819> following<00:04:13.819> commands<00:04:14.360> and<00:04:14.510> so<00:04:14.630> forth<00:04:15.549> when

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
and following commands and so forth when

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.409 
and following commands and so forth when
he<00:04:16.760> first<00:04:17.420> came<00:04:17.690> up<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.079> ICU<00:04:18.230> we<00:04:19.419> briefly

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
he first came up to the ICU we briefly

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.240 
he first came up to the ICU we briefly
turned<00:04:20.720> off<00:04:20.900> his<00:04:21.109> sedation<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:21.650> that<00:04:21.980> we<00:04:22.100> could

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
turned off his sedation so that we could

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.820 
turned off his sedation so that we could
see<00:04:22.430> what<00:04:22.669> how<00:04:23.300> active<00:04:23.750> he<00:04:23.780> was<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.470> at<00:04:24.800> that

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
see what how active he was and at that

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.190 
see what how active he was and at that
time<00:04:25.150> he<00:04:26.150> was<00:04:26.860> completely<00:04:27.860> appropriate

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
time he was completely appropriate

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.800 
time he was completely appropriate
trying<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.470> pull<00:04:31.040> tubes<00:04:31.340> out<00:04:31.660> which<00:04:32.660> we

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
trying to pull tubes out which we

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.020 
trying to pull tubes out which we
clearly<00:04:33.050> don't<00:04:33.440> want<00:04:33.590> them<00:04:33.919> to<00:04:34.130> do<00:04:34.310> but<00:04:34.610> he<00:04:34.820> was

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
clearly don't want them to do but he was

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.570 
clearly don't want them to do but he was
really<00:04:35.840> acting<00:04:36.320> like<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.650> very<00:04:36.950> purposeful

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
really acting like a very purposeful

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.840 
really acting like a very purposeful
six-year-old<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:39.560> then<00:04:39.860> we<00:04:40.070> have<00:04:40.250> put<00:04:40.700> him

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
six-year-old and then we have put him

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.320 
six-year-old and then we have put him
under<00:04:41.030> sedation<00:04:41.570> at<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:42.650> point<00:04:43.060> but<00:04:44.060> he<00:04:44.240> is

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
under sedation at this point but he is

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.460 
under sedation at this point but he is
still<00:04:44.510> moving<00:04:44.720> everything<00:04:45.230> he<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.570> still<00:04:47.570> when

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
still moving everything he is still when

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.230 
still moving everything he is still when
he<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:48.710> lightly<00:04:48.919> sedated<00:04:49.190> still<00:04:49.700> responding

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
he is lightly sedated still responding

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.000 
he is lightly sedated still responding
to<00:04:50.540> anything<00:04:50.780> that<00:04:50.960> may<00:04:51.230> be<00:04:51.290> painful<00:04:51.860> or

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
to anything that may be painful or

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.970 
to anything that may be painful or
responding<00:04:52.669> to<00:04:52.820> touch<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.390> so<00:04:54.260> those<00:04:54.590> are<00:04:54.800> all

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
responding to touch and so those are all

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.890 
responding to touch and so those are all
things<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.640> me<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:55.790> indicate<00:04:56.390> he<00:04:56.630> is<00:04:56.750> a

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
things to me that indicate he is a

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.630 
things to me that indicate he is a
six-year-old<00:04:57.500> who<00:04:57.650> is<00:04:57.800> sedated<00:04:58.280> right<00:04:58.430> now

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
six-year-old who is sedated right now

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.420 
six-year-old who is sedated right now
and<00:04:58.940> his<00:04:59.090> brain<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.540> functioning<00:04:59.750> normally<00:05:00.430> we

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
and his brain is functioning normally we

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.610 
and his brain is functioning normally we
have<00:05:01.610> done<00:05:01.820> cat-scans<00:05:02.419> that<00:05:02.810> look<00:05:02.990> normal<00:05:03.440> at

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
have done cat-scans that look normal at

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.560 
have done cat-scans that look normal at
this<00:05:03.770> point<00:05:04.150> there<00:05:05.150> will<00:05:05.300> be<00:05:05.450> additional

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
this point there will be additional

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.500 
this point there will be additional
testing<00:05:06.320> that<00:05:06.530> will<00:05:06.710> occur<00:05:07.360> over<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.389> next

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
testing that will occur over the next

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.860 
testing that will occur over the next
couple<00:05:08.840> of<00:05:09.050> days<00:05:09.460> an<00:05:10.460> MRI<00:05:11.180> which<00:05:11.540> will<00:05:11.720> give<00:05:11.840> us

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
couple of days an MRI which will give us

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.370 
couple of days an MRI which will give us
a<00:05:12.050> little<00:05:12.200> bit<00:05:12.320> more<00:05:12.530> detail<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:14.020> then<00:05:15.020> the

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
a little bit more detail and then the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.050 
a little bit more detail and then the
biggest<00:05:15.680> thing<00:05:15.860> is<00:05:15.979> just<00:05:16.010> waking<00:05:16.370> him<00:05:16.640> up<00:05:16.760> and

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
biggest thing is just waking him up and

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.719 
biggest thing is just waking him up and
see<00:05:17.600> how<00:05:17.810> he<00:05:17.870> does<00:05:18.020> but<00:05:18.890> all<00:05:19.220> of<00:05:19.280> our

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
see how he does but all of our

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.810 
see how he does but all of our
indications<00:05:20.390> is<00:05:20.660> is<00:05:21.020> his<00:05:21.350> brain<00:05:22.310> function<00:05:22.700> is

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
indications is is his brain function is

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.960 
indications is is his brain function is
normal<00:05:23.060> anytime<00:05:23.979> there's<00:05:24.979> been<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.220> trauma<00:05:25.580> I

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
normal anytime there's been a trauma I

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.640 
normal anytime there's been a trauma I
always<00:05:26.240> tell<00:05:26.510> families<00:05:26.990> that<00:05:27.229> sometimes

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
always tell families that sometimes

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.010 
always tell families that sometimes
there<00:05:27.860> can<00:05:28.010> be<00:05:28.070> some<00:05:28.460> minor<00:05:29.180> brain<00:05:29.600> injury

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
there can be some minor brain injury

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.140 
there can be some minor brain injury
that<00:05:30.169> we<00:05:30.890> may<00:05:31.070> not<00:05:31.190> even<00:05:31.370> pick<00:05:31.640> up<00:05:31.669> in<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.030> ICU

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
that we may not even pick up in the ICU

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.029 
that we may not even pick up in the ICU
it<00:05:32.720> may<00:05:32.870> be<00:05:32.930> something<00:05:33.320> that<00:05:33.590> they<00:05:33.710> pick<00:05:33.890> up

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
it may be something that they pick up

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.440 
it may be something that they pick up
down<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.400> road<00:05:34.580> a<00:05:34.789> greatest<00:05:35.780> challenge<00:05:36.260> is

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
down the road a greatest challenge is

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.540 
down the road a greatest challenge is
getting<00:05:38.450> the<00:05:38.810> breathing<00:05:39.169> tube<00:05:39.200> is<00:05:39.560> is<00:05:39.950> how<00:05:40.310> is

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
getting the breathing tube is is how is

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.670 
getting the breathing tube is is how is
having<00:05:41.270> his<00:05:41.390> lungs<00:05:41.630> get<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.110> point<00:05:42.350> that<00:05:42.470> we

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
having his lungs get to a point that we

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.960 
having his lungs get to a point that we
can<00:05:42.890> take<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.250> breathing<00:05:43.580> tube<00:05:43.610> out<00:05:43.970> and<00:05:45.970> it

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
can take the breathing tube out and it

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.840 
can take the breathing tube out and it
and<00:05:47.390> and<00:05:48.080> I<00:05:48.500> expect<00:05:48.979> that<00:05:49.190> we<00:05:49.340> will<00:05:49.460> be<00:05:49.610> able<00:05:49.700> to

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
and and I expect that we will be able to

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.980 
and and I expect that we will be able to
do<00:05:50.090> that<00:05:50.240> over<00:05:50.539> the<00:05:50.660> next<00:05:50.690> couple<00:05:51.080> of<00:05:51.289> days<00:05:51.620> and

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
do that over the next couple of days and

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.600 
do that over the next couple of days and
then<00:05:53.990> if<00:05:55.630> his<00:05:56.630> if<00:05:57.260> he<00:05:57.320> wakes<00:05:57.680> up<00:05:57.890> and<00:05:58.130> act

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
then if his if he wakes up and act

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.820 
then if his if he wakes up and act
normally<00:05:59.240> as<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.479> believe<00:05:59.660> he's<00:06:00.020> going<00:06:00.229> to<00:06:00.500> I

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
normally as I believe he's going to I

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.219 
normally as I believe he's going to I
think<00:06:01.000> the<00:06:02.000> biggest<00:06:02.210> thing<00:06:02.390> moving<00:06:02.810> forward

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
think the biggest thing moving forward

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.779 
think the biggest thing moving forward
is<00:06:03.440> just<00:06:03.800> watching<00:06:04.250> his<00:06:04.400> lung<00:06:04.580> function<00:06:05.150> and

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
is just watching his lung function and

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.890 
is just watching his lung function and
theoretically<00:06:07.789> if<00:06:08.150> it's<00:06:08.539> an<00:06:08.720> autoimmune

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
theoretically if it's an autoimmune

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:16.170 
theoretically if it's an autoimmune
response<00:06:09.289> or<00:06:09.979> an<00:06:10.419> or<00:06:11.419> a<00:06:12.669> or<00:06:13.669> a<00:06:13.700> response<00:06:14.570> to<00:06:15.169> a

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
response or an or a or a response to a

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.850 
response or an or a or a response to a
allergic<00:06:17.180> response<00:06:17.630> it<00:06:17.930> may<00:06:18.200> take<00:06:18.229> six<00:06:18.710> months

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
allergic response it may take six months

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.250 
allergic response it may take six months
to<00:06:19.130> a<00:06:19.280> year<00:06:19.340> for<00:06:19.909> us<00:06:19.970> to<00:06:20.150> even<00:06:20.240> see<00:06:20.720> it<00:06:20.870> so<00:06:21.229> I

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
to a year for us to even see it so I

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.790 
to a year for us to even see it so I
think<00:06:21.409> it's<00:06:21.680> going<00:06:21.800> to<00:06:21.860> be<00:06:21.950> the<00:06:22.099> unknown

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
think it's going to be the unknown

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.369 
think it's going to be the unknown
family<00:06:23.310> moving<00:06:23.520> forward<00:06:24.120> about<00:06:25.020> his<00:06:25.199> lung

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:25.379 
family moving forward about his lung

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:27.260 
family moving forward about his lung
function<00:06:25.770> because<00:06:25.949> he<00:06:26.099> was<00:06:26.340> clearly<00:06:27.030> an

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
function because he was clearly an

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.189 
function because he was clearly an
active<00:06:28.190> boy<00:06:29.190> and<00:06:29.669> I'm<00:06:30.419> you<00:06:30.810> know<00:06:30.840> and<00:06:31.139> the

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
active boy and I'm you know and the

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.749 
active boy and I'm you know and the
family<00:06:31.500> wants<00:06:31.710> him<00:06:31.830> to<00:06:31.949> return<00:06:32.190> to<00:06:32.400> that<00:06:32.550> and

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 
family wants him to return to that and

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.510 
family wants him to return to that and
so<00:06:32.909> do<00:06:33.000> we<00:06:33.169> so<00:06:34.169> at<00:06:34.349> this<00:06:34.409> point<00:06:34.770> we<00:06:35.039> don't<00:06:35.190> cease

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
so do we so at this point we don't cease

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.610 
so do we so at this point we don't cease
and<00:06:35.789> when<00:06:36.030> we're<00:06:36.210> going<00:06:36.360> down<00:06:36.780> we've<00:06:37.409> been

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
and when we're going down we've been

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.399 
and when we're going down we've been
able<00:06:37.770> to<00:06:37.919> get<00:06:38.190> down<00:06:38.460> to<00:06:38.849> the<00:06:40.280> major<00:06:41.280> Airways

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409 
able to get down to the major Airways

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:47.330 
able to get down to the major Airways
after<00:06:43.409> the<00:06:43.530> MRI<00:06:43.800> today<00:06:44.250> we<00:06:44.639> hope<00:06:45.000> that<00:06:46.039> we<00:06:47.039> can

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
after the MRI today we hope that we can

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.619 
after the MRI today we hope that we can
clear<00:06:48.330> his<00:06:49.699> spinal<00:06:50.699> column<00:06:50.970> and<00:06:51.240> take<00:06:51.419> his

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:51.629 
clear his spinal column and take his

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.589 
clear his spinal column and take his
collar<00:06:52.530> off<00:06:52.710> and<00:06:52.889> then<00:06:53.430> the<00:06:54.210> pulmonologist

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 
collar off and then the pulmonologist

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.930 
collar off and then the pulmonologist
hope<00:06:55.139> to<00:06:55.289> go<00:06:55.409> deeper<00:06:55.860> down<00:06:56.039> but<00:06:56.460> we<00:06:56.550> don't<00:06:56.669> see

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
hope to go deeper down but we don't see

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.059 
hope to go deeper down but we don't see
we<00:06:57.240> don't<00:06:57.270> see<00:06:57.629> any<00:06:57.810> sand<00:06:58.169> but<00:06:58.590> against<00:06:58.800> an

00:06:59.059 --> 00:06:59.069 
we don't see any sand but against an

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:03.140 
we don't see any sand but against an
brains<00:06:59.370> were<00:06:59.550> small<00:07:00.379> we<00:07:01.490> are<00:07:02.490> still<00:07:02.969> getting

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
brains were small we are still getting

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.040 
brains were small we are still getting
sand<00:07:03.990> from<00:07:04.289> other<00:07:04.560> parts<00:07:04.949> of<00:07:05.009> his<00:07:05.190> body<00:07:05.340> off

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
sand from other parts of his body off

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.869 
sand from other parts of his body off
every<00:07:07.050> single<00:07:07.469> day<00:07:07.680> so<00:07:08.069> I'm<00:07:08.310> sure<00:07:08.550> that<00:07:08.580> he

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:08.879 
every single day so I'm sure that he

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:13.100 
every single day so I'm sure that he
still<00:07:09.120> has<00:07:09.300> sand<00:07:09.599> deep<00:07:10.580> and<00:07:11.580> i'm<00:07:12.330> just<00:07:12.870> going

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.110 
still has sand deep and i'm just going

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.619 
still has sand deep and i'm just going
to<00:07:13.139> this<00:07:13.909> another<00:07:14.909> question<00:07:15.330> that<00:07:15.479> has<00:07:15.599> been

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:15.629 
to this another question that has been

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.339 
to this another question that has been
asked<00:07:16.050> is<00:07:16.139> about<00:07:16.349> his<00:07:16.560> eyes<00:07:16.860> the

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:18.349 
asked is about his eyes the

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:21.230 
asked is about his eyes the
ophthalmologists<00:07:19.669> washed<00:07:20.669> out<00:07:20.909> his<00:07:21.060> eyes

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
ophthalmologists washed out his eyes

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.670 
ophthalmologists washed out his eyes
when<00:07:21.479> he<00:07:21.509> came<00:07:21.780> in<00:07:22.020> and<00:07:23.270> they<00:07:24.270> look<00:07:24.750> normal<00:07:25.289> and

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
when he came in and they look normal and

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.779 
when he came in and they look normal and
don't<00:07:25.949> look<00:07:26.069> like<00:07:26.219> they<00:07:26.400> have<00:07:26.580> any

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:26.789 
don't look like they have any

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:28.909 
don't look like they have any
significant<00:07:27.539> injury<00:07:27.930> again<00:07:28.500> that's<00:07:28.680> going<00:07:28.860> to

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 
significant injury again that's going to

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.159 
significant injury again that's going to
be<00:07:29.039> something<00:07:29.190> we<00:07:29.580> will<00:07:29.729> have<00:07:29.940> to<00:07:30.210> completely

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:31.169 
be something we will have to completely

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:33.260 
be something we will have to completely
determine<00:07:31.770> once<00:07:31.949> he's<00:07:32.130> awake<00:07:32.400> and<00:07:32.430> tell<00:07:33.090> us

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.270 
determine once he's awake and tell us

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.950 
determine once he's awake and tell us
how<00:07:33.419> he<00:07:33.479> sees<00:07:33.779> but<00:07:34.139> the<00:07:34.259> ophthalmologists<00:07:35.130> are

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 
how he sees but the ophthalmologists are

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.240 
how he sees but the ophthalmologists are
not<00:07:36.960> concerned<00:07:37.349> about<00:07:37.620> his<00:07:37.770> eyes<00:07:37.919> right<00:07:38.219> now

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.250 
not concerned about his eyes right now

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.779 
not concerned about his eyes right now
which<00:07:38.639> again<00:07:38.909> is<00:07:38.969> I<00:07:39.500> my<00:07:40.500> guess<00:07:40.740> is<00:07:40.919> he<00:07:41.250> probably

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:41.789 
which again is I my guess is he probably

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:49.670 
which again is I my guess is he probably
closed<00:07:42.210> his<00:07:42.389> eyes<00:07:42.509> while<00:07:42.810> he<00:07:42.840> was<00:07:43.080> underground

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.740
