00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.620
 friends and batista70 forms another friend 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.990
 tecnophone diego just reported the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.160
 news according to which it is available 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.380
 the htc internet browser on the play 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.450
 store was promptly extracted 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.410
 peek and then we flashed it on 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.750
 our sony xperia z3 let's see 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.660
 how it works here 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.820
 let's call a pocketnow site in the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.809
 in the case because I saw that to the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.070
 desktop version 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.760
 let's open it as you see it is 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.179
 very fast a second that ends 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.370
 to open up not that this moment is the 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:54.269
 cases of piave I'm doing gods 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.609
 work with wifi so I prefer not 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.100
 have slowdowns 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.350
 let's see how the fluidity we go to 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.850
 scroll I asked again loading 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.680
 however you can see that it is definitely 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.040
 double tap fluid 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.640
 ok adaptation of the column almost 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.400
 immediate as you can see double tap 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.120
 immediately return to the size you are looking at 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.910
 what speed and now the browser 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.840
 htc is available for all 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.260
 devices 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.610
 look at this column adaptation 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.920
 almost instantaneous you can see 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.840
 maximum fluidity no hitch 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 here you can see possibilities of 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.440
 share saved bookmarks 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.820
 history found on the download page 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.230
 to view in in offline and the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.660
 visit desktop let's video the view 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:51.060
 right some if we were already on the desktop 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.430
 it will be the fastest test because I have it 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.960
 I just didn't have time to install it 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.700
 try it anyway you can see that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.990
 invest well it is practical 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.170
 identical maximum fluidity double tap 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.470
 adaptation of the immediate column which 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.470
 to say 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.670
 the maximum of the two browsers a 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.750
 available to all 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.550
 thank you again diego for the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.710
 signaling with this conclusion only 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.710
 all loris alias batista70 to beat
