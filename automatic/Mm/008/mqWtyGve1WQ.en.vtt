00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
about exercise is that if you do not

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.830 
about exercise is that if you do not
enjoy<00:00:57.430> it<00:00:57.460> then<00:00:57.730> it's<00:00:57.880> just<00:00:58.090> stress<00:00:58.390> induced

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
enjoy it then it's just stress induced

and you're just looking at the clock

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.950 
and you're just looking at the clock
waiting<00:01:00.430> for<00:01:00.579> it<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.910> end<00:01:01.000> which<00:01:01.540> isn't<00:01:01.720> good

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
waiting for it to end which isn't good

muscles<00:01:05.229> bulky<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:06.009> I<00:01:06.040> always<00:01:06.340> avoided

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
muscles bulky so I always avoided

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.399 
muscles bulky so I always avoided
weightlifting<00:01:07.299> and<00:01:07.479> only<00:01:07.689> stuck<00:01:07.899> to<00:01:08.020> cardio

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
weightlifting and only stuck to cardio

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
but after a while I stopped seeing

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.819 
but after a while I stopped seeing
results<00:01:10.329> and<00:01:10.810> I<00:01:11.020> don't<00:01:11.229> want<00:01:11.350> any<00:01:11.469> of<00:01:11.590> you<00:01:11.710> to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
think that I think I'm overweight or

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.929 
think that I think I'm overweight or
that<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:14.350> need<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.920> lose<00:01:15.189> weight<00:01:15.219> that's<00:01:15.729> not

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
that I need to lose weight that's not

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.700 
that I need to lose weight that's not
necessarily<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.540> case<00:01:16.690> it's<00:01:17.140> just<00:01:17.380> that<00:01:17.680> I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
necessarily the case it's just that I

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.289 
necessarily the case it's just that I
used<00:01:17.950> to<00:01:18.040> play<00:01:18.130> softball<00:01:18.370> for<00:01:18.729> six<00:01:18.909> years<00:01:19.090> and

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
used to play softball for six years and

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.090 
used to play softball for six years and
I<00:01:19.390> had<00:01:19.570> this<00:01:19.690> really<00:01:19.960> toned<00:01:20.380> figure<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:21.040> I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
I had this really toned figure and I

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.760 
I had this really toned figure and I
really<00:01:21.400> liked<00:01:21.610> having<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:22.120> muscle<00:01:22.570> um<00:01:22.810> and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
really liked having that muscle um and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.030 
really liked having that muscle um and
after<00:01:24.400> softball<00:01:25.030> I<00:01:25.060> lost<00:01:25.360> that<00:01:25.690> and<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:26.260> for

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
after softball I lost that and I for

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.380 
after softball I lost that and I for
some<00:01:27.130> reason<00:01:27.190> thought<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:27.760> cardio<00:01:28.180> would

there<00:02:09.369> is<00:02:09.519> resistance<00:02:09.939> and<00:02:10.450> then<00:02:10.599> there<00:02:10.840> is

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
there is resistance and then there is

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.619 
there is resistance and then there is
cardio<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:12.069> stretching<00:02:12.519> on<00:02:12.849> Mondays

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
and I think that's where most of my

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.149 
and I think that's where most of my
results<00:02:16.870> are<00:02:16.959> coming<00:02:17.170> from<00:02:17.379> it's<00:02:17.650> her<00:02:17.799> circuit

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
minutes and it just blows my mind how

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.910 
minutes and it just blows my mind how

high-intensity interval training and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.320 
high-intensity interval training and

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
Here I am at 145 pounds so I lost two

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.170 
Here I am at 145 pounds so I lost two
pounds<00:04:29.890> and<00:04:30.190> I'm<00:04:30.580> not<00:04:30.730> complaining<00:04:31.120> about

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
pounds and I'm not complaining about

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.360 
pounds and I'm not complaining about
that<00:04:31.360> my<00:04:31.930> goal<00:04:32.170> with<00:04:32.350> using<00:04:32.680> this<00:04:32.830> plan<00:04:33.070> is<00:04:33.250> not

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
that my goal with using this plan is not

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.030 
that my goal with using this plan is not
to<00:04:33.430> lose<00:04:33.700> weight

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
to lose weight

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.340 
to lose weight
it's<00:04:34.160> actually<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.730> become<00:04:35.390> lean<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:35.960> strong

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
it's actually to become lean and strong

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.020

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.180 
and I know that muscle weighs more than
fat<00:04:38.180> so<00:04:38.690> two<00:04:38.750> pounds<00:04:39.320> is<00:04:39.470> perfectly<00:04:39.890> fine<00:04:40.130> with
