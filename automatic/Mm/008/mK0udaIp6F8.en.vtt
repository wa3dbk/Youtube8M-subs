00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
came up with this whole new style that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.760 
came up with this whole new style that
wound<00:00:40.860> up<00:00:41.010> being<00:00:41.340> called<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.820> India<00:00:42.180> Pale<00:00:42.450> Ale

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
wound up being called the India Pale Ale

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.049 
wound up being called the India Pale Ale
so<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.010> specifically<00:00:44.460> made<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:44.760> that

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
so it was specifically made for that

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.389 
so it was specifically made for that
purpose<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.989> gradually<00:00:46.379> became<00:00:46.770> more<00:00:46.829> and

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
purpose but it gradually became more and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.779 
purpose but it gradually became more and
more<00:00:47.460> popular<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.180> England<00:00:48.809> itself<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.789> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
more popular in England itself and I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.279 
more popular in England itself and I
guess<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.180> could<00:00:51.329> say<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.629> really<00:00:51.960> took<00:00:52.140> off

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
guess you could say it really took off

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.410 
guess you could say it really took off
in<00:00:52.350> an<00:00:52.620> America<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> American<00:00:53.789> craft

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
IPA which is a much more highly hopped

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
IPA which is a much more highly hopped

American IPA so you're going to get a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.219 
American IPA so you're going to get a
lot<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:49.920> hops<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.570> sometimes<00:01:52.020> you'll<00:01:52.140> get

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
lot more hops and sometimes you'll get

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.350 
lot more hops and sometimes you'll get
malt<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.829> come<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.549> support<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.270> as

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
malt to come and you know support it as

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.380 
malt to come and you know support it as
its<00:01:54.570> backbone<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.229> you're<00:01:55.439> not<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.100> know

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
its backbone so you're not just you know

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.280 
its backbone so you're not just you know
drinking<00:01:57.390> straight<00:01:57.689> hops

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

about<00:02:09.119> craft<00:02:09.539> beers<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.170> you'll<00:02:10.500> find<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.860> lot

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
about craft beers that you'll find a lot

about craft beers that you'll find a lot
of<00:02:11.039> people<00:02:11.430> who<00:02:11.580> can<00:02:11.760> fall<00:02:11.970> on

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
of people who can fall on

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.170 
of people who can fall on
any<00:02:12.870> different<00:02:13.230> sides<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.650> an<00:02:13.740> issue<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.280> those

any different sides of an issue so those

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.420 
any different sides of an issue so those
are<00:02:15.360> some<00:02:15.540> thoughts<00:02:15.690> about<00:02:15.990> how<00:02:16.380> IPAs<00:02:17.100> came

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
into being and also thoughts about where

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.890 
into being and also thoughts about where
they<00:02:20.550> are<00:02:20.580> now<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.210> perhaps<00:02:21.360> even<00:02:21.630> where

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
they are now and perhaps even where

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.570 
they are now and perhaps even where
they're<00:02:22.050> going<00:02:22.350> with<00:02:22.500> Brewers<00:02:23.100> all<00:02:23.250> over<00:02:23.490> the
