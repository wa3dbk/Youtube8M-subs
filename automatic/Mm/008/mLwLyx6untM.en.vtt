okay 2003 Mini Cooper S r53 these are
the<00:00:05.910> two<00:00:06.180> most<00:00:06.569> recent<00:00:06.720> mods<00:00:07.290> /<00:00:07.950> upgrades<00:00:08.580> that

the two most recent mods / upgrades that
I've<00:00:09.660> done<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> car<00:00:10.290> first<00:00:11.280> thing<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.820> the

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
I've done on the car first thing is the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.970 
I've done on the car first thing is the
m7<00:00:13.860> air<00:00:14.309> plate<00:00:14.700> diverter<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.990> noticed<00:00:16.740> when<00:00:16.920> I

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
m7 air plate diverter I noticed when I

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.359 
m7 air plate diverter I noticed when I
replaced<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.270> shroud<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.470> fan<00:00:19.800> for<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
replaced the shroud and the fan for the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.720 
replaced the shroud and the fan for the
low-speed<00:00:21.000> resistor<00:00:22.160> burnout<00:00:23.160> problem<00:00:23.580> that

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
low-speed resistor burnout problem that

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.429 
low-speed resistor burnout problem that
this<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.150> these<00:00:24.300> cars<00:00:24.570> are<00:00:24.689> notorious<00:00:25.199> for

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
this that these cars are notorious for

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.820 
this that these cars are notorious for
after<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.369> clean<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.300> radiator<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
after I clean the radiator and the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.400 
after I clean the radiator and the
condenser<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.550> highway<00:00:30.300> speed<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:31.050> running

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
condenser at highway speed I was running

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
condenser at highway speed I was running
about<00:00:31.529> two<00:00:31.859> or<00:00:32.009> three<00:00:32.040> degrees<00:00:32.610> cooler<00:00:33.360> than

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
about two or three degrees cooler than

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.430 
about two or three degrees cooler than
it<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:33.870> before

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
it was before

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440 
it was before
so<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> thought<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.730> know<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.149> get<00:00:36.300> more

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
so I thought you know if I can get more

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180 
so I thought you know if I can get more
air<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.140> would<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.290> great<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.160> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
air in there that would be great so I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.010 
air in there that would be great so I
decided<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.760> spring<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.719> put<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
decided to spring for it and I put the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.869 
decided to spring for it and I put the
air<00:00:40.140> plate<00:00:40.379> diverter<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.980> all<00:00:41.190> I'll<00:00:41.640> let<00:00:41.760> you

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
air plate diverter on all I'll let you

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.819 
air plate diverter on all I'll let you
guys<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.719> after<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> chance

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
guys know how it is after I get a chance

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.880 
guys know how it is after I get a chance
to<00:00:44.070> run<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> little<00:00:45.059> while<00:00:45.890> second

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to run with it for a little while second

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.880 
to run with it for a little while second
mod<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.250> i<00:00:47.280> did<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:48.870> sprayer<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
mod that i did is a sprayer for the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.520 
mod that i did is a sprayer for the
intercooler<00:00:50.280> now<00:00:51.149> before<00:00:51.780> i<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:52.110> into<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
intercooler now before i get into a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
intercooler now before i get into a
battle<00:00:52.800> about<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.430> effectiveness<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.210> how

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
battle about the effectiveness of how

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.560 
battle about the effectiveness of how
good<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.800> i<00:00:56.730> understand<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.480> an

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
good this is and i understand what an

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.090 
good this is and i understand what an
intercooler<00:00:57.930> does<00:00:58.289> i<00:00:58.590> know<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.890> thermal

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
intercooler does i know the thermal

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.709 
intercooler does i know the thermal
dynamics<00:00:59.760> here<00:00:59.940> i<00:01:00.000> know<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> sprayer

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
dynamics here i know what the sprayer

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.460 
dynamics here i know what the sprayer
does<00:01:01.160> not<00:01:02.160> looking<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.140> tell<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.379> this

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
does not looking to tell you that this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.320 
does not looking to tell you that this
is<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> fantastic<00:01:05.400> increase<00:01:06.119> in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
is going to be a fantastic increase in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.429 
is going to be a fantastic increase in
performance<00:01:07.790> this<00:01:08.790> basically<00:01:09.630> bought<00:01:09.990> me<00:01:10.200> two

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
performance this basically bought me two

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
performance this basically bought me two
or<00:01:10.470> three<00:01:10.619> days<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.340> uninterrupted<00:01:11.610> time<00:01:12.330> in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
or three days of uninterrupted time in

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.890 
or three days of uninterrupted time in
my<00:01:12.630> garage<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:14.400> me<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.150> kit<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.600> put

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
my garage so for me the kit that I put

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.289 
my garage so for me the kit that I put
in<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.049> was<00:01:16.680> well<00:01:17.130> worth<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.400> time<00:01:17.880> because

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
in here was well worth that time because

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.080 
in here was well worth that time because
when<00:01:18.990> I'm<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> garage<00:01:19.619> wrenching<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.850> wife

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
when I'm in the garage wrenching my wife

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.550 
when I'm in the garage wrenching my wife
and<00:01:21.330> kids<00:01:21.540> won't<00:01:21.750> come<00:01:22.020> out<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> garage

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and kids won't come out to the garage

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.719 
and kids won't come out to the garage
they<00:01:22.830> don't<00:01:22.979> dare<00:01:23.159> come<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> garage

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
they don't dare come out to the garage

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.880 
they don't dare come out to the garage
because<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.180> they<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:25.380> they<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.770> I'm

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
because if they do then they know I'm

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.260 
because if they do then they know I'm
going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> ask<00:01:26.310> them<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> help<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:26.970> they<00:01:27.090> leave

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
going to ask them to help so they leave

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.870 
going to ask them to help so they leave
me<00:01:27.450> alone<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.680> particular<00:01:28.920> mod<00:01:29.549> bought

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
me alone so this particular mod bought

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.130 
me alone so this particular mod bought
me<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> couple<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.450> days<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.780> uninterrupted

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
me a couple of days of uninterrupted

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.679 
me a couple of days of uninterrupted
alone<00:01:31.710> time<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> reasons

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
alone time and I was one of the reasons

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.140 
alone time and I was one of the reasons
why<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> did<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> actual<00:01:35.850> mod

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
why I did it so back to the actual mod

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.219 
why I did it so back to the actual mod
itself<00:01:37.189> what<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> did<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.049> first

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
itself what I did was when the first

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.670 
itself what I did was when the first
thing<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.470> did<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.860> took<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> intercooler<00:01:42.329> off

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
thing I did I took the intercooler off

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.139 
thing I did I took the intercooler off
because<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.890> wanted<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> clean<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> inside

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
because I wanted to clean out the inside

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.350 
because I wanted to clean out the inside
some<00:01:46.020> people<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:47.189> gasoline<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:48.030> clean<00:01:48.210> out

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
some people use gasoline to clean out

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539 
some people use gasoline to clean out
the<00:01:48.479> intercooler<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:49.170> people<00:01:49.439> use<00:01:49.710> some

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the intercooler some people use some

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.179 
the intercooler some people use some
simple<00:01:50.909> grain<00:01:51.299> mix<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.530> soak<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
simple grain mix it up and soak it and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.770 
simple grain mix it up and soak it and
then<00:01:53.700> dry<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.060> out<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> next<00:01:54.509> day

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
then dry it out the next day

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.499 
then dry it out the next day
I<00:01:54.990> actually<00:01:55.770> went<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> route<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.939> using<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
I actually went the route of using the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.870 
I actually went the route of using the
brake<00:01:57.810> cleaner<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> used<00:01:58.979> about<00:01:59.219> two<00:01:59.549> cans

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
brake cleaner so I used about two cans

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.639 
brake cleaner so I used about two cans
of<00:02:00.060> brake<00:02:00.270> cleaner<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.869> ran<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.439> through<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
of brake cleaner I ran it through the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.170 
of brake cleaner I ran it through the
intercooler<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.399> really<00:02:02.670> did<00:02:02.969> flush

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
intercooler and that really did flush

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.929 
intercooler and that really did flush
out<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> lot<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.719> oil<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:05.250> hopefully<00:02:05.640> that's<00:02:05.820> a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
out a lot of oil so hopefully that's a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.589 
out a lot of oil so hopefully that's a
lot<00:02:06.119> cleaner<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.710> noticed<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.569> what<00:02:09.569> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
lot cleaner and I noticed that what I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.999 
lot cleaner and I noticed that what I
should<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.899> done<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.379> should<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.830> done

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
should have done is I should have done

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.440 
should have done is I should have done
that<00:02:11.129> when<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> put<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> catch<00:02:11.910> Canyon<00:02:12.360> because

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
that when I put the catch Canyon because

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.720 
that when I put the catch Canyon because
I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
I

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.449 
I
I<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:12.940> have<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.120> catch<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.040> never<00:02:15.250> had<00:02:15.430> a

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
I do have a catch can and I never had a

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.710 
I do have a catch can and I never had a
chance<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.790> clean<00:02:15.909> out<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.180> intercooler<00:02:16.480> when

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
chance to clean out the intercooler when

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.809 
chance to clean out the intercooler when
I<00:02:16.810> installed<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.650> had<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.610> whole<00:02:18.790> thing

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
I installed that I had the whole thing

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.539 
I installed that I had the whole thing
apart<00:02:19.330> when<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.569> put<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:21.540> Detroit<00:02:22.540> tuned

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
apart when I put in the Detroit tuned

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.729 
apart when I put in the Detroit tuned
bypass<00:02:24.549> valve<00:02:24.909> by<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.810> way<00:02:26.019> if<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.349> guys<00:02:26.500> are

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
bypass valve by the way if you guys are

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.039 
bypass valve by the way if you guys are
considering<00:02:27.099> an<00:02:27.370> upgrade<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.299> Detroit<00:02:28.780> tune

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
considering an upgrade the Detroit tune

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.920 
considering an upgrade the Detroit tune
bypass<00:02:29.530> valve<00:02:29.799> was<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.010> great<00:02:30.280> upgrade<00:02:30.660> my<00:02:31.660> car

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
bypass valve was a great upgrade my car

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.979 
bypass valve was a great upgrade my car
had<00:02:32.400> 140,000<00:02:33.400> miles<00:02:33.549> on<00:02:33.849> it<00:02:33.879> and<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.780> old

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
had 140,000 miles on it and the old

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.530 
had 140,000 miles on it and the old
bypass<00:02:35.560> valve<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.040> could<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.400> tell<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.970> was

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
bypass valve you could just tell it was

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.180 
bypass valve you could just tell it was
just<00:02:37.810> getting<00:02:38.080> tired<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.620> since<00:02:38.829> I<00:02:38.920> put<00:02:39.099> the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
just getting tired and since I put the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.270 
just getting tired and since I put the
new<00:02:39.310> one<00:02:39.489> on<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:40.599> lot<00:02:41.049> stronger<00:02:42.010> performance

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
new one on a lot stronger performance

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.110 
new one on a lot stronger performance
throughout<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.140> torque<00:02:44.409> range<00:02:44.680> itself

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
throughout that the torque range itself

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.140 
throughout that the torque range itself
so<00:02:46.120> back<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.660> sprayer<00:02:46.930> upgrade<00:02:48.120> what<00:02:49.120> I

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
garden section I came across a hose that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.900 
garden section I came across a hose that
actually<00:03:20.500> had<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.709> bunch<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.099> a<00:03:21.280> demeyers<00:03:21.609> as

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
actually had a bunch of a demeyers as

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.089 
actually had a bunch of a demeyers as
atomizers<00:03:22.750> attached<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.440> where<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.650> can

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
atomizers attached to it where you can

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.580 
atomizers attached to it where you can
clip<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.329> one<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.840> umbrellas<00:03:26.319> over<00:03:26.440> a

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
clip it to one of the umbrellas over a

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.080 
clip it to one of the umbrellas over a
picnic<00:03:26.919> table<00:03:27.099> and<00:03:27.340> hook<00:03:27.609> it<00:03:27.730> up<00:03:27.819> to<00:03:27.970> an

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
picnic table and hook it up to an

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.030 
picnic table and hook it up to an
outside<00:03:28.419> faucet<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.169> it<00:03:29.319> will<00:03:29.470> spray<00:03:29.799> nice

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
outside faucet and it will spray nice

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.259 
outside faucet and it will spray nice
mist<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.489> water<00:03:30.639> and<00:03:30.880> I'm<00:03:30.940> like<00:03:31.090> that's

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
mist of water and I'm like that's

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.000 
mist of water and I'm like that's
exactly<00:03:31.780> what<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.500> want

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
exactly what I want

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.940 
exactly what I want
so<00:03:33.639> I<00:03:33.910> bought<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.480> hose<00:03:34.750> with<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.079> atomizers

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
so I bought that hose with the atomizers

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.949 
so I bought that hose with the atomizers
and<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.160> basically<00:03:36.400> cut<00:03:36.940> them<00:03:37.090> down<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.810> can

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
and I basically cut them down you can

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.270 
and I basically cut them down you can
see<00:03:38.169> here<00:03:38.470> there's<00:03:38.650> six<00:03:38.919> of<00:03:39.010> them

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
see here there's six of them

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.159 
see here there's six of them
there's<00:03:40.030> just<00:03:40.239> happened<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.690> be<00:03:40.810> six

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
there's just happened to be six

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.440 
there's just happened to be six
atomizers<00:03:42.040> on<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.519> particular<00:03:42.819> hose<00:03:43.209> the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
atomizers on that particular hose the

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.050 
atomizers on that particular hose the
size<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:43.959> got<00:03:44.169> what<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.069> had<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.459> do<00:03:45.609> because

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
size that I got what I had to do because

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.259 
size that I got what I had to do because
the<00:03:46.480> actual<00:03:47.380> atomizer<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.130> can<00:03:48.370> see<00:03:48.579> the

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
the actual atomizer you can see the

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.330 
the actual atomizer you can see the
beige<00:03:49.540> colored<00:03:49.930> hose<00:03:50.139> here<00:03:50.410> it's<00:03:50.530> molded<00:03:51.069> to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
beige colored hose here it's molded to

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.610 
beige colored hose here it's molded to
the<00:03:51.370> hose<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.790> came<00:03:51.970> with<00:03:52.150> it<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:52.780> cut<00:03:53.590> on

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
the hose that came with it so I cut on

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.039 
the hose that came with it so I cut on
both<00:03:53.950> sides<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:56.129> valve<00:03:57.129> and<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:58.090> got<00:03:58.810> myself

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
both sides of the valve and I got myself

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.710 
both sides of the valve and I got myself
some<00:03:59.500> new<00:03:59.919> hosing<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.639> I<00:04:01.090> just<00:04:01.299> shortened<00:04:01.660> it

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
some new hosing and I just shortened it

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.140 
some new hosing and I just shortened it
up<00:04:01.780> measured<00:04:02.230> it<00:04:02.349> out<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:02.829> I<00:04:03.129> have<00:04:03.639> these

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
up measured it out so I have these

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.720 
up measured it out so I have these
atomizers<00:04:04.930> really<00:04:05.200> close<00:04:05.410> together<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:06.069> have<00:04:06.700> a

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
atomizers really close together I have a

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.509 
atomizers really close together I have a
little<00:04:06.970> bracket<00:04:07.810> T<00:04:08.169> bracket<00:04:08.650> here<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.160> then

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
little bracket T bracket here and then

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.270 
little bracket T bracket here and then
the<00:04:10.260> tubing<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.379> runs<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:11.889> back<00:04:12.069> of<00:04:12.220> the

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
the tubing that runs to the back of the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.009 
the tubing that runs to the back of the
car<00:04:12.459> because<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:12.849> second<00:04:13.269> problem<00:04:13.419> I<00:04:13.629> had<00:04:13.810> was

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
car because the second problem I had was

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.009 
car because the second problem I had was
as<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:15.040> can<00:04:15.250> tell<00:04:15.489> there<00:04:15.910> is<00:04:15.940> not<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.599> lot<00:04:16.870> of

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
as you can tell there is not a lot of

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.229 
as you can tell there is not a lot of
places<00:04:17.289> in<00:04:17.590> this<00:04:17.680> vehicle<00:04:17.949> that<00:04:18.639> you<00:04:18.789> can<00:04:19.000> put

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
places in this vehicle that you can put

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.990 
places in this vehicle that you can put
a<00:04:19.959> water<00:04:20.590> bottle<00:04:20.950> or<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.250> water<00:04:21.549> alcohol

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
a water bottle or a water alcohol

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.550 
a water bottle or a water alcohol
mixture<00:04:22.360> bottle<00:04:22.719> so<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:22.840> had<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.140> run<00:04:23.320> something

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
mixture bottle so I had to run something

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.550 
mixture bottle so I had to run something
from<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.919> back<00:04:24.099> of<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.310> car<00:04:24.599> so<00:04:25.599> basically

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
from the back of the car so basically

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.340 
from the back of the car so basically
I<00:04:26.700> attached<00:04:27.700> up<00:04:27.940> these<00:04:28.090> atomizes<00:04:28.810> short<00:04:29.139> hose

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
I attached up these atomizes short hose

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.850 
I attached up these atomizes short hose
I<00:04:30.310> actually<00:04:30.639> took<00:04:30.970> this<00:04:31.590> intercooler<00:04:32.590> cover

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
I actually took this intercooler cover

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.220 
I actually took this intercooler cover
off<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.880> can<00:04:34.030> see<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.210> just<00:04:34.870> right<00:04:35.050> now

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
off and you can see I just right now

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.560 
off and you can see I just right now
have<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.650> zip<00:04:35.889> tied<00:04:36.130> in<00:04:36.370> so<00:04:36.639> we'll<00:04:37.210> see<00:04:37.419> how

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
have it zip tied in so we'll see how

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.000 
have it zip tied in so we'll see how
that<00:04:37.630> works<00:04:37.900> we'll<00:04:38.169> see<00:04:38.290> how<00:04:38.440> much<00:04:38.560> water<00:04:38.860> it

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
that works we'll see how much water it

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.409 
that works we'll see how much water it
actually<00:04:39.130> puts<00:04:39.820> down<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:41.470> now<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:43.030> bottle

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
actually puts down so now to the bottle

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.120 
actually puts down so now to the bottle
let's<00:04:43.810> go<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.230> back<00:04:44.350> of<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.560> car<00:04:47.130> so

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
let's go to the back of the car so

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.000 
let's go to the back of the car so
here's<00:04:48.880> my<00:04:49.290> bottle<00:04:50.290> give<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.740> little<00:04:50.860> bit

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
here's my bottle give you a little bit

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.060 
here's my bottle give you a little bit
of<00:04:51.100> light<00:04:51.250> there<00:04:51.460> so<00:04:51.639> you<00:04:51.730> can<00:04:51.880> see<00:04:53.070> basically

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
of light there so you can see basically

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.930 
of light there so you can see basically
what<00:04:54.700> I<00:04:54.730> plan<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.060> do<00:04:55.360> is<00:04:55.660> run<00:04:56.590> that<00:04:56.889> with<00:04:57.280> some

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
what I plan to do is run that with some

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.900 
what I plan to do is run that with some
distilled<00:04:58.450> water<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:59.490> some<00:05:00.490> alcohol

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
distilled water and some alcohol

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.050 
distilled water and some alcohol
probably<00:05:01.600> a<00:05:01.750> 50/50<00:05:02.169> mix<00:05:02.620> to<00:05:02.770> start<00:05:03.060> haven't

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
probably a 50/50 mix to start haven't

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.390 
probably a 50/50 mix to start haven't
put<00:05:04.240> anything<00:05:04.450> in<00:05:04.750> it<00:05:04.840> just<00:05:05.080> yet<00:05:05.350> because<00:05:05.919> I'm

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
put anything in it just yet because I'm

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.000 
put anything in it just yet because I'm
not<00:05:06.430> sure<00:05:06.729> how<00:05:06.940> it's<00:05:07.150> going<00:05:07.450> to<00:05:07.710> perform<00:05:08.710> it's

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
not sure how it's going to perform it's

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.500 
not sure how it's going to perform it's
just<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.250> little<00:05:09.370> too<00:05:09.610> cold<00:05:09.820> out<00:05:10.060> there<00:05:10.270> it's

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
just a little too cold out there it's

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.420 
just a little too cold out there it's
really<00:05:10.570> a<00:05:10.780> hot<00:05:11.290> weather<00:05:11.620> kind<00:05:12.100> of<00:05:12.250> thing

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
really a hot weather kind of thing

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.750 
really a hot weather kind of thing
performance<00:05:13.060> enhancement<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:14.560> when<00:05:15.280> a<00:05:15.310> summer

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
performance enhancement so when a summer

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.400 
performance enhancement so when a summer
time<00:05:16.030> comes<00:05:16.300> around<00:05:16.389> I'll<00:05:16.780> be<00:05:16.810> able<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:17.139> give

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
time comes around I'll be able to give

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.320 
time comes around I'll be able to give
you<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.530> better<00:05:17.680> idea<00:05:17.770> as<00:05:18.160> to<00:05:18.250> what<00:05:18.490> that<00:05:18.639> will

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
you a better idea as to what that will

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.480 
you a better idea as to what that will
actually<00:05:19.479> do<00:05:19.810> but<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.080> hung<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:20.979> bottle<00:05:21.280> in<00:05:21.400> the

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
actually do but I hung the bottle in the

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.580 
actually do but I hung the bottle in the
back<00:05:21.669> here<00:05:22.060> right<00:05:22.630> off<00:05:22.660> of<00:05:22.960> my<00:05:23.080> upper<00:05:23.320> stress

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
back here right off of my upper stress

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.000 
back here right off of my upper stress
bar<00:05:23.860> you<00:05:24.790> can<00:05:24.940> see<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.419> tubing<00:05:25.840> there<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.410> all

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
bar you can see the tubing there and all

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.800 
bar you can see the tubing there and all
the<00:05:27.160> electronics<00:05:27.760> actually<00:05:27.910> that<00:05:28.450> the<00:05:28.600> wire

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
the electronics actually that the wire

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.620 
the electronics actually that the wire
leads<00:05:29.139> they<00:05:30.070> run<00:05:30.280> down<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.640> tube<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.300> be

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
leads they run down the tube and be

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.890 
leads they run down the tube and be
under<00:05:31.960> the<00:05:32.080> underside<00:05:32.470> of<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.650> car<00:05:32.919> so<00:05:33.910> next

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
under the underside of the car so next

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.320 
under the underside of the car so next
thing<00:05:35.080> was<00:05:35.289> okay<00:05:35.710> how<00:05:36.340> do<00:05:36.400> I<00:05:36.520> activate<00:05:37.090> this

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
thing was okay how do I activate this

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.760 
thing was okay how do I activate this
well<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:39.610> know<00:05:39.700> with<00:05:40.479> the<00:05:40.600> kit<00:05:40.840> they<00:05:41.229> sent<00:05:41.560> me

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
well you know with the kit they sent me

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.890 
well you know with the kit they sent me
a<00:05:42.720> push-button

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
a push-button

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.219 
a push-button
momentary<00:05:44.860> push-button<00:05:45.539> I'm<00:05:46.539> thinking<00:05:46.960> okay

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
momentary push-button I'm thinking okay

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.020 
momentary push-button I'm thinking okay
that's<00:05:47.410> pretty<00:05:47.590> decent<00:05:48.130> I<00:05:48.250> can<00:05:48.430> put<00:05:48.580> a<00:05:48.610> micro

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
that's pretty decent I can put a micro

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.800 
that's pretty decent I can put a micro
switch<00:05:49.300> onto<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.169> accelerator<00:05:51.160> pedal<00:05:51.810> but

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
switch onto the accelerator pedal but

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.120 
switch onto the accelerator pedal but
then<00:05:52.990> again<00:05:53.320> if<00:05:53.560> you<00:05:53.650> know<00:05:53.740> anything<00:05:54.070> about

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
then again if you know anything about

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.980 
then again if you know anything about
sprayers<00:05:54.729> it's<00:05:54.970> kind<00:05:55.180> of<00:05:55.270> already<00:05:55.450> after<00:05:55.870> the

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
sprayers it's kind of already after the

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.990 
sprayers it's kind of already after the
fact<00:05:56.229> if<00:05:56.380> you<00:05:56.500> have<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:56.860> wait<00:05:57.520> two<00:05:57.700> you're<00:05:57.880> at

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
fact if you have to wait two you're at

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.629 
fact if you have to wait two you're at
full<00:05:58.210> pedal<00:05:58.600> before<00:05:58.930> it<00:05:58.990> starts<00:05:59.260> to<00:05:59.320> spray<00:05:59.639> so

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
full pedal before it starts to spray so

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.920 
full pedal before it starts to spray so
I'm<00:06:00.729> thinking<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:01.180> know<00:06:01.270> what<00:06:01.450> because<00:06:01.750> it's

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
I'm thinking you know what because it's

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.230 
I'm thinking you know what because it's
I<00:06:02.139> have<00:06:02.500> them<00:06:02.710> using<00:06:03.550> the<00:06:03.639> atomizer<00:06:04.090> or

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
I have them using the atomizer or

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.180 
I have them using the atomizer or
probably<00:06:04.630> a<00:06:04.720> nice<00:06:04.900> fine<00:06:05.200> mist<00:06:05.500> what<00:06:06.070> I'll

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
probably a nice fine mist what I'll

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.890 
probably a nice fine mist what I'll
probably<00:06:06.340> do<00:06:06.789> is<00:06:06.820> just<00:06:06.970> put<00:06:07.360> a<00:06:07.389> toggle<00:06:07.810> on<00:06:07.870> and

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
probably do is just put a toggle on and

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.469 
probably do is just put a toggle on and
will<00:06:08.710> gauge<00:06:08.889> it<00:06:09.070> like<00:06:09.190> that<00:06:09.370> now<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.210> thing

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
will gauge it like that now the thing

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.779 
will gauge it like that now the thing
was<00:06:10.690> I<00:06:10.870> really<00:06:11.200> didn't<00:06:11.530> want<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:11.889> start

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
was I really didn't want to start

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.040 
was I really didn't want to start

what<00:06:17.470> I<00:06:17.500> ended<00:06:17.860> up<00:06:17.950> doing<00:06:18.340> was<00:06:18.490> and<00:06:18.700> you<00:06:18.760> can

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
what I ended up doing was and you can

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.770 
what I ended up doing was and you can
see<00:06:19.120> it<00:06:19.210> here<00:06:19.479> I<00:06:19.660> took<00:06:20.620> out<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:21.880> cigarette

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.969 
see it here I took out the cigarette
lighter<00:06:22.810> because<00:06:23.200> I<00:06:23.260> don't<00:06:23.410> use<00:06:23.590> a<00:06:23.620> cigarette

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
lighter because I don't use a cigarette

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.110 
lighter because I don't use a cigarette
lighter<00:06:24.160> anyway<00:06:24.580> and<00:06:25.800> the<00:06:26.800> rocker<00:06:27.729> switch

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
lighter anyway and the rocker switch

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.460 
lighter anyway and the rocker switch
that<00:06:28.300> you<00:06:28.360> see<00:06:28.660> there<00:06:28.840> that<00:06:28.870> green<00:06:29.169> rocker

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
that you see there that green rocker

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.879 
that you see there that green rocker
switch<00:06:29.830> it<00:06:30.190> does<00:06:30.520> a<00:06:30.550> really<00:06:30.820> nice<00:06:31.060> job<00:06:31.120> with

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
switch it does a really nice job with

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.770 
switch it does a really nice job with
regards<00:06:32.889> to<00:06:32.979> fitting<00:06:33.550> into<00:06:33.820> the<00:06:34.450> same

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
regards to fitting into the same

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.450 
regards to fitting into the same
circumference<00:06:35.380> as<00:06:35.680> the<00:06:36.010> cigarette<00:06:36.430> lighter

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
circumference as the cigarette lighter

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.149 
circumference as the cigarette lighter
so<00:06:36.880> I<00:06:37.380> disconnected<00:06:38.380> all<00:06:38.470> the<00:06:38.620> backing<00:06:38.830> of<00:06:39.099> the

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 
so I disconnected all the backing of the

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:40.450 
so I disconnected all the backing of the
cigarette<00:06:39.490> lighter<00:06:39.520> actually<00:06:40.120> cut

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
cigarette lighter actually cut

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.700 
cigarette lighter actually cut
bottom<00:06:40.729> off<00:06:40.850> of<00:06:41.060> the<00:06:41.120> socket<00:06:41.539> itself<00:06:41.840> and<00:06:42.440> I

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
bottom off of the socket itself and I

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.439 
bottom off of the socket itself and I
ran<00:06:42.949> the<00:06:43.130> wires<00:06:43.340> and<00:06:43.669> it<00:06:43.759> made<00:06:43.910> a<00:06:43.940> nice<00:06:44.120> real

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449 
ran the wires and it made a nice real

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:46.420 
ran the wires and it made a nice real
simple<00:06:44.870> install<00:06:45.350> so<00:06:45.680> when<00:06:46.100> I<00:06:46.130> want<00:06:46.370> to
