a<00:05:18.430> bit<00:05:18.729> of<00:05:18.820> class<00:05:19.229> and<00:05:20.229> if<00:05:20.350> I<00:05:20.470> wanted<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.860> I

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
a bit of class and if I wanted to I

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.710 
a bit of class and if I wanted to I
could<00:05:21.250> wear<00:05:21.430> it<00:05:21.520> as<00:05:21.610> a<00:05:21.639> pinky<00:05:22.090> ring<00:05:22.120> but<00:05:22.479> it's

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
just a little bit too big so it kind of

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.439 
just a little bit too big so it kind of
just<00:05:25.750> slips<00:05:26.139> off<00:05:26.400> so<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.430> can<00:05:27.789> tend<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.120> keep<00:05:28.300> it

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
just slips off so I can tend to keep it

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.820 
just slips off so I can tend to keep it
on<00:05:28.539> this<00:05:28.720> finger<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.110> is<00:05:29.199> primarily<00:05:29.560> what<00:05:29.800> I

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
on this finger this is primarily what I

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.120 
on this finger this is primarily what I
wanted<00:05:30.130> it<00:05:30.250> for<00:05:30.900> so<00:05:31.900> there<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.169> go<00:05:32.380> so<00:05:32.919> it's<00:05:33.039> a

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
wanted it for so there you go so it's a

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.550 
wanted it for so there you go so it's a
single<00:05:33.400> diamond<00:05:34.650> this<00:05:35.650> diamond<00:05:36.190> is<00:05:36.510> vvs1

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
single diamond this diamond is vvs1

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.129 
single diamond this diamond is vvs1
so<00:05:38.889> it's<00:05:39.070> just<00:05:39.340> one<00:05:39.639> below<00:05:40.000> flawless<00:05:40.539> so

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
so it's just one below flawless so

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:47.629 
so it's just one below flawless so
you've<00:05:41.260> got<00:05:41.440> flawless<00:05:42.100> vvs1<00:05:42.970> vbs2<00:05:44.550> vs<00:05:45.550> 1<00:05:46.020> vs<00:05:47.020> 2

you've got flawless vvs1 vbs2 vs 1 vs 2

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.589 
you've got flawless vvs1 vbs2 vs 1 vs 2
then<00:05:48.639> SI<00:05:49.180> 1<00:05:49.570> SI<00:05:50.050> 2<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.590> VBS<00:05:51.520> means<00:05:52.000> bet

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
then SI 1 SI 2 and VBS means bet

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.480 
then SI 1 SI 2 and VBS means bet
flawless<00:05:53.139> obviously<00:05:53.620> there's<00:05:53.830> no<00:05:54.039> flaws<00:05:54.280> in

flawless obviously there's no flaws in
the<00:05:54.580> diamond<00:05:54.970> you've<00:05:55.599> then<00:05:55.840> got<00:05:56.169> V<00:05:56.830> vs<00:05:57.099> 1<00:05:57.550> which

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
the diamond you've then got V vs 1 which

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.110 
the diamond you've then got V vs 1 which
is<00:05:57.940> very<00:05:58.210> very<00:05:58.780> slight<00:05:59.580> inclusion<00:06:00.580> and

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
is very very slight inclusion and

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.629 
is very very slight inclusion and
inclusion<00:06:01.720> I<00:06:02.080> believe<00:06:02.740> don't<00:06:03.310> quote<00:06:03.490> me<00:06:03.610> on

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
inclusion I believe don't quote me on

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.659 
inclusion I believe don't quote me on
this<00:06:03.760> means<00:06:04.090> it's<00:06:04.450> just<00:06:04.539> a<00:06:05.039> imperfection<00:06:06.039> then

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
this means it's just a imperfection then

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.969 
this means it's just a imperfection then
you've<00:06:06.789> got<00:06:06.940> very<00:06:07.240> very<00:06:07.720> slight<00:06:08.169> inclusion

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
you've got very very slight inclusion

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.330 
you've got very very slight inclusion
the<00:06:09.700> second<00:06:10.090> grade<00:06:10.330> then<00:06:10.870> you've<00:06:11.050> got<00:06:11.229> a<00:06:11.500> very

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
the second grade then you've got a very

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.550 
the second grade then you've got a very
slight<00:06:12.760> inclusion<00:06:13.450> which<00:06:13.720> is<00:06:13.930> going<00:06:14.139> down<00:06:14.380> the

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
slight inclusion which is going down the

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.490 
slight inclusion which is going down the
scale<00:06:14.830> 1<00:06:15.310> &amp;<00:06:15.520> 2<00:06:15.729> and<00:06:16.000> then<00:06:16.630> you've<00:06:16.750> got<00:06:16.870> si<00:06:17.260> one

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
scale 1 &amp; 2 and then you've got si one

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.170 
scale 1 &amp; 2 and then you've got si one
slight<00:06:17.950> inclusion<00:06:18.580> so<00:06:18.700> it's<00:06:18.789> a<00:06:18.849> little<00:06:19.000> bit

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
slight inclusion so it's a little bit

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.589 
slight inclusion so it's a little bit
more<00:06:20.610> more<00:06:21.610> of<00:06:21.729> an<00:06:21.849> imperfection<00:06:22.240> in<00:06:22.510> the

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
more more of an imperfection in the

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.170 
more more of an imperfection in the
diamonds<00:06:22.930> is<00:06:23.050> not<00:06:23.229> as<00:06:23.380> exclusive<00:06:24.160> I'd<00:06:24.430> say<00:06:24.700> and

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
diamonds is not as exclusive I'd say and

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.680 
diamonds is not as exclusive I'd say and
the<00:06:25.690> clarity<00:06:26.410> is<00:06:26.470> e<00:06:26.680> I<00:06:27.190> think<00:06:27.220> it<00:06:27.610> was<00:06:27.789> a<00:06:28.090> or<00:06:28.419> F

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
the clarity is e I think it was a or F

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.440 
the clarity is e I think it was a or F
so<00:06:29.050> it<00:06:29.260> is<00:06:29.380> a<00:06:29.410> very<00:06:29.770> white<00:06:30.310> bright<00:06:30.970> diamond

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
so it is a very white bright diamond

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.459 
so it is a very white bright diamond
which<00:06:31.780> is<00:06:31.810> lovely<00:06:33.510> so<00:06:34.510> it<00:06:34.660> really<00:06:34.960> is<00:06:35.200> just

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:35.469 
which is lovely so it really is just

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:37.860 
which is lovely so it really is just
something<00:06:35.830> that<00:06:35.860> it's<00:06:36.099> just<00:06:36.570> beautiful<00:06:37.570> picks

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
something that it's just beautiful picks

best<00:06:48.909> clarity<00:06:49.419> only<00:06:49.689> because<00:06:50.050> it<00:06:50.740> means<00:06:51.069> that

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:51.279 
best clarity only because it means that

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:53.489 
best clarity only because it means that
you<00:06:51.699> get<00:06:51.879> the<00:06:52.059> nicest<00:06:52.449> color<00:06:52.689> looking<00:06:53.050> diamond

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:53.499 
you get the nicest color looking diamond

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:54.989 
you get the nicest color looking diamond
and<00:06:53.649> it<00:06:53.740> picks<00:06:53.949> up<00:06:54.069> the<00:06:54.129> light<00:06:54.279> in<00:06:54.669> just

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:54.999 
and it picks up the light in just

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:59.999 
and it picks up the light in just
beautifully<00:06:55.919> so<00:06:56.919> that's<00:06:57.219> the<00:06:57.759> ring<00:06:58.059> and<00:06:59.009> this

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:00.009 
beautifully so that's the ring and this

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:06.749 
beautifully so that's the ring and this
ring<00:07:00.189> is<00:07:00.669> called<00:07:02.639> the<00:07:03.639> on<00:07:03.849> hunt<00:07:04.289> ring<00:07:05.699> now<00:07:06.699> the

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 
ring is called the on hunt ring now the

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.029 
ring is called the on hunt ring now the
reason<00:07:07.210> why<00:07:08.110> it's<00:07:08.289> good<00:07:08.439> the<00:07:08.529> on<00:07:08.589> contouring

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 
reason why it's good the on contouring

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:11.969 
reason why it's good the on contouring
is<00:07:09.189> because<00:07:09.999> it<00:07:10.449> goes<00:07:10.869> back<00:07:11.259> to<00:07:11.529> the<00:07:11.619> heritage

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979 
is because it goes back to the heritage

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:13.350 
is because it goes back to the heritage
of<00:07:12.069> Louis<00:07:12.369> Vuitton<00:07:12.399> so<00:07:12.939> you've<00:07:13.089> got<00:07:13.240> the

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 
of Louis Vuitton so you've got the

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.809 
of Louis Vuitton so you've got the
diamond<00:07:13.749> here<00:07:13.930> and<00:07:14.110> these<00:07:14.369> indentations<00:07:15.369> are

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:15.819 
diamond here and these indentations are

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.699 
diamond here and these indentations are
what<00:07:16.270> is<00:07:16.419> nose<00:07:16.599> on<00:07:16.809> plants<00:07:17.349> so<00:07:18.240> imprinting<00:07:19.240> and

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:19.709 
what is nose on plants so imprinting and

00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:21.839 
what is nose on plants so imprinting and
apparently<00:07:20.709> it<00:07:20.889> goes<00:07:21.069> back<00:07:21.309> to<00:07:21.459> the<00:07:21.550> trunks

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:21.849 
apparently it goes back to the trunks

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.350 
apparently it goes back to the trunks
and<00:07:21.999> locks<00:07:22.240> heritage<00:07:22.779> of<00:07:23.459> the<00:07:24.459> company<00:07:24.969> itself

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
and locks heritage of the company itself

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.079 
and locks heritage of the company itself
so<00:07:25.959> well<00:07:26.889> that<00:07:27.039> just<00:07:27.219> makes<00:07:27.430> a<00:07:27.520> nice<00:07:27.639> law<00:07:27.909> some

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:28.089 
so well that just makes a nice law some

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:29.189 
so well that just makes a nice law some
people<00:07:28.330> look<00:07:28.509> at<00:07:28.629> it<00:07:28.689> they<00:07:28.719> all<00:07:28.899> you've<00:07:29.080> got

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 
people look at it they all you've got

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.510 
people look at it they all you've got
diamonds<00:07:29.529> missing<00:07:29.830> and<00:07:29.949> then<00:07:30.039> they<00:07:30.129> realize

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
diamonds missing and then they realize

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.399 
diamonds missing and then they realize
all<00:07:30.729> know<00:07:30.999> it's<00:07:31.270> meant<00:07:31.479> to<00:07:31.539> be<00:07:31.719> like<00:07:31.839> that<00:07:32.080> and

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:32.409 
all know it's meant to be like that and

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:35.040 
all know it's meant to be like that and
a<00:07:33.069> lot<00:07:33.520> of<00:07:33.550> people<00:07:34.059> mistake<00:07:34.509> this<00:07:34.749> for<00:07:34.809> the

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.050 
a lot of people mistake this for the

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.260 
a lot of people mistake this for the
cartier<00:07:35.469> love<00:07:35.559> ring<00:07:35.830> they<00:07:36.669> say<00:07:36.819> oh<00:07:36.849> I<00:07:36.999> love

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:41.289 
it's the Louis Vuitton ring and now the

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:43.439 
it's the Louis Vuitton ring and now the
reason<00:07:41.680> why<00:07:41.889> is<00:07:42.399> because<00:07:42.699> it<00:07:43.149> looks<00:07:43.300> very

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:43.449 
reason why is because it looks very

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:43.980 
reason why is because it looks very
similar

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:43.990 
similar

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.719 
similar

now the cartier love ring doesn't have

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:48.089 
now the cartier love ring doesn't have
these<00:07:45.879> has<00:07:46.240> the<00:07:46.389> similar<00:07:46.659> indentations<00:07:47.469> but

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.099
