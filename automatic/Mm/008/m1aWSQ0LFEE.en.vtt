00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the eyebrow nose line ends here so I

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.540 
the eyebrow nose line ends here so I
won't<00:01:02.230> start<00:01:02.800> right<00:01:03.040> there

this opening isn't going to be big
enough<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:33.720> used<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.760> chopstick<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:36.590> open

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
enough so I used the chopstick to open

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.160 
enough so I used the chopstick to open
the<00:02:37.769> hole<00:02:37.980> use<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.459> as<00:02:38.579> a<00:02:38.670> rolling<00:02:38.970> pin<00:02:39.360> or<00:02:39.599> to

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
with this method it's very important to

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.949 
with this method it's very important to
continue<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.640> check<00:02:52.879> your<00:02:53.060> work<00:02:53.269> against<00:02:53.840> the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
work against your pattern to make sure

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.150 
work against your pattern to make sure
that<00:03:24.780> they're<00:03:25.020> matching<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.710> to<00:03:25.830> make<00:03:25.980> any

now<00:03:30.960> I'm<00:03:31.110> going<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.440> retrieve<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.100> clay<00:03:32.280> from

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
now I'm going to retrieve the clay from

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.600 
now I'm going to retrieve the clay from
above<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.970> eye<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:34.500> now<00:03:34.680> locks<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
above the eye and it now locks the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.710 
above the eye and it now locks the
design<00:03:35.970> into<00:03:36.300> place<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:37.880> do<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.180> second<00:03:39.600> eye

design into place I do the second eye

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.460 
design into place I do the second eye
using<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.380> same<00:03:40.680> method<00:03:42.050> moving<00:03:43.050> down<00:03:43.230> the

using the same method moving down the

face I'm now to the nostrils and I can

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.250 
face I'm now to the nostrils and I can
lock<00:03:48.060> them<00:03:48.330> into<00:03:48.570> place<00:03:50.600> in<00:03:51.600> order<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.080> make

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
lock them into place in order to make

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.060 
lock them into place in order to make
sure<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:54.060> nostril<00:03:54.540> stay<00:03:54.960> I'll<00:03:55.380> fill<00:03:55.890> in

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
sure that the nostril stay I'll fill in

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:11.110 
sure that the nostril stay I'll fill in
those<00:03:56.540> valleys<00:03:57.540> with<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:59.000> snake<00:04:00.000> of<00:04:00.209> white

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.699 

moving<00:04:12.120> down<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.360> face<00:04:12.780> we've<00:04:13.110> gotten<00:04:13.530> all

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
moving down the face we've gotten all

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.449 
moving down the face we've gotten all
the<00:04:13.740> way<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.280> lips<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:15.510> I've<00:04:16.440> carved<00:04:17.130> out

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
the way to the lips and I've carved out

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.830 
the way to the lips and I've carved out
a<00:04:17.489> an<00:04:18.090> oval<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.530> put<00:04:19.769> them<00:04:19.980> in

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.080 

one<00:04:24.840> more<00:04:25.050> check<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.650> see<00:04:25.860> if<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.280> design<00:04:26.640> is

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
one more check to see if the design is

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.730 
one more check to see if the design is
following<00:04:28.080> our<00:04:28.820> pattern<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.440> I<00:04:31.440> think<00:04:31.650> I'll

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
following our pattern and I think I'll

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.890 
following our pattern and I think I'll
trim<00:04:32.040> some<00:04:32.310> off<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.850> side<00:04:33.090> because<00:04:33.300> actually

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
trim some off the side because actually

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.490 
trim some off the side because actually
the<00:04:33.990> face<00:04:34.170> is<00:04:34.440> oval<00:04:35.190> not<00:04:35.430> round<00:04:36.020> it's<00:04:37.020> amazing

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
the face is oval not round it's amazing

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.350 
the face is oval not round it's amazing
how<00:04:37.650> much<00:04:37.770> gain<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.370> can<00:04:38.400> get<00:04:38.760> from<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.090> two<00:04:39.270> and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
how much gain you can get from a two and

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.110 
how much gain you can get from a two and
a<00:04:39.480> half<00:04:39.660> inch<00:04:39.930> round<00:04:40.290> of<00:04:40.590> clay<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:43.880> now<00:04:44.880> for

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
a half inch round of clay and now for

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.780 
a half inch round of clay and now for
the<00:04:45.240> true<00:04:45.540> test<00:04:45.840> we'll<00:04:46.440> cut<00:04:46.860> it<00:04:46.890> and<00:04:47.250> see<00:04:47.610> what

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
the true test we'll cut it and see what

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:57.680 
the true test we'll cut it and see what
we've<00:04:47.940> got<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:50.180> very<00:04:51.180> Picasso<00:04:52.110> esque<00:04:52.350> face<00:04:56.690> with

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
we've got a very Picasso esque face with

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.200 
we've got a very Picasso esque face with
the<00:04:57.810> addition<00:04:58.290> of<00:04:58.410> some<00:04:58.770> hair<00:04:59.520> I<00:05:01.760> think<00:05:02.760> we<00:05:02.940> can

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
the addition of some hair I think we can

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.470 
the addition of some hair I think we can
have<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:05.270> passing<00:05:06.270> likeness<00:05:06.810> that<00:05:07.530> Picasso

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
have a passing likeness that Picasso

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.960 
have a passing likeness that Picasso
might<00:05:09.480> agree<00:05:09.780> with
