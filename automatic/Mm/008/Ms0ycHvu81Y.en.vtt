00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.720
 He sins or I'll leave the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.180

 You will have to pay to be able to download it 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.890
 and well when you start the application 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.840
 For the first time we need connection to 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.970
 internet to load this that 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.920
 we can see here but good once 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.760
 already done it the first time it's not going 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.780
 to be necessary and then we can play 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.809
 easily this game without connection to 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.809
 Internet 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.579
 once the game started we see that it is 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.460
 so and here we can see the characters 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.019
 and here they go here we will go adding 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.120
 to those of us who unlock 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.059
 I have unblocked these two and one more 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.620
 that now does not appear but we can see 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.350
 the characters that we can of solution 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.790
 we are here you must not avoid equipment and 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.860
 so here we are going to open all the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.659
 characters that we can go 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.700
 unlocking in this game who 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.399
 we can see that I only need one more 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.690
 to unlock the entire team but 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.690
 here we have more characters 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.520
 we can go trotting and the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.920
 unlocked 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.890
 and we also have here on that map of 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.930
 vision here we can find different 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.630
 let's say different planets 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.030
 and where we can 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.340
 will go forward clear that we have to go 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.259
 going through the different levels that are 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.360
 many as we can see there are too many 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.119
 levels and this then we're going to 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.429
 entertain a while with this so 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.590
 well let's select this 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.210
 we select one that is unlocked 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.579
 and then we see all the levels that 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.679
 we have here in a we can go 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.319
 moving forward and we have to pass all 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.390
 these to move to the next planet 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.009
 I'm going to select one I'm going to give you and not 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.009
 let's see a bit of this game 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.880
 We wait for cale 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.740
 and here we see that we see the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.680
 characters if we want we can add a 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.930
 most character must select this and what 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.650
 I'm going to add and well let's go back 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.650
 there again 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.540
 and we already have all our characters 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.270
 Now here he says he needs experience in 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.270
 the battle and we need to start 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.930
 and here we can 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.040
 to start playing we have to be 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.469
 before 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.390
 to the staff towards the enemies that we 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.609
 they are appearing and we see that the enemies 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.439
 we also see that people have 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.440
 some special powers that we can 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.480
 go using 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.730
 to be able to eliminate the enemies 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.360
 quickly 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.360
 we have this power here 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.850
 but that's not 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.739
 good to go see the rest we have 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.239
 than to advance the other duties of 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.750
 the poor and I have not explained it but 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.640
 here it is seen that it is a good game and that 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.980
 we have these options we can also 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.510
 go improving the personnel in the menu 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.510
 in others less seen 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:35.090
 and we see that it helped us 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.090
 some personal health 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.530
 to be able to eliminate the most quickly 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.900
 and well here we will be appearing 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.070
 more characters we have to go 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.250
 eliminating them until passing the level and so 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.770
 can go deactivating or unblocking 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.260
 all the others 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.140
 the next time I tutorial 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.989

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.909

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.270
 game of your liking and that if you like
