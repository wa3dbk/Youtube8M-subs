let's look at the numbers the 3s ran the

increase<00:01:26.920> in<00:01:27.310> voltage<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:28.020> question<00:01:29.020> is<00:01:29.170> how

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
increase in voltage the question is how

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.980 
increase in voltage the question is how
much<00:01:29.560> faster<00:01:29.799> is<00:01:30.130> 1.5<00:01:30.700> seconds<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.420> the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
much faster is 1.5 seconds and the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.780 
much faster is 1.5 seconds and the
answer<00:01:32.290> is<00:01:32.350> well<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.010> depends<00:01:33.400> what<00:01:33.549> you<00:01:33.640> used

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
answer is well it depends what you used

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.910 
answer is well it depends what you used
as<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.090> denominator<00:01:34.240> if<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:35.290> use<00:01:35.409> five<00:01:35.650> point

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920

eight<00:01:35.979> seconds<00:01:36.460> for<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.360> Dominator<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:38.170> get

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
eight seconds for the Dominator you get

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.060 
eight seconds for the Dominator you get
25%<00:01:38.740> however<00:01:39.610> if<00:01:39.970> you<00:01:40.270> use<00:01:40.440> 4.3<00:01:41.440> seconds<00:01:41.950> as

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
25% however if you use 4.3 seconds as

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.940 
25% however if you use 4.3 seconds as
the<00:01:42.250> denominator<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:43.090> get<00:01:43.420> 35%<00:01:44.020> which<00:01:44.770> is

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
the denominator you get 35% which is

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.520 
the denominator you get 35% which is
well<00:01:45.190> within<00:01:45.460> our<00:01:45.640> margin<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.119> error<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:46.930> there

well within our margin of error so there

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.770
