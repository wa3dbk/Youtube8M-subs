level of coolness as the bike they were
about<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.619> build<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.640> level<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.000> coolness

that I was trying to get you this is
what<00:00:19.740> I'm<00:00:19.830> building<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.400> because<00:00:20.609> none<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
what I'm building to because none of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.859 
what I'm building to because none of
those<00:00:20.939> bikes<00:00:21.300> can<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.109> ridden<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.820> water<00:00:23.869> to

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
those bikes can be ridden on water to

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.029 
those bikes can be ridden on water to
the<00:00:24.960> lab<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:26.900> can't<00:00:27.900> wait<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.769> build

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the lab I can't wait for this build

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
the lab I can't wait for this build
we're<00:00:29.369> gonna<00:00:29.490> turn<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.060> aids<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.599> recumbent

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
we're gonna turn this aids up recumbent

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
tandem into a boat bike isn't it a great

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.860 
tandem into a boat bike isn't it a great
build<00:00:34.890> idea<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.640> actually<00:00:35.730> despite<00:00:36.570> looking

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
build idea it's actually despite looking

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.540 
build idea it's actually despite looking
quite<00:00:36.930> complex<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:38.040> relatively

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
quite complex it's relatively

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.280 
quite complex it's relatively
straightforward<00:00:38.910> basically<00:00:39.390> we've<00:00:39.870> had<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
straightforward basically we've had a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290 
straightforward basically we've had a
couple<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.680> these<00:00:40.770> brackets<00:00:41.100> built<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.180> which

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
couple of these brackets built and which

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
couple of these brackets built and which
we're<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> use<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.930> attach<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.680> sail

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
we're going to use to attach to sail

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.310 
we're going to use to attach to sail
boards<00:00:45.059> which<00:00:45.270> believe<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.600> or<00:00:45.780> not<00:00:45.960> straight

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
boards which believe it or not straight

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.290 
boards which believe it or not straight
up<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.710> got<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.219> free<00:00:47.430> cuz<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> local<00:00:48.120> board

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
up we got for free cuz a local board

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.959 
up we got for free cuz a local board
high<00:00:48.510> shot<00:00:48.870> were<00:00:49.590> chucking<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.250> out<00:00:50.370> let<00:00:50.850> me

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
high shot were chucking them out let me

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.340 
high shot were chucking them out let me
connect<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> bike<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.230> then

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
connect them to the bike and then

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.979 
connect them to the bike and then
hopefully<00:00:52.559> we'll<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.100> water<00:00:53.309> bound<00:00:53.730> well<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
hopefully we'll be water bound well the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
hopefully we'll be water bound well the
brackets<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.710> been<00:00:55.890> made<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.550> tubular

we can ride on the land and we can float
in<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.880> sea<00:01:59.090> but<00:01:59.359> we're<00:01:59.600> gonna<00:01:59.719> have<00:01:59.869> to

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
in the sea but we're gonna have to

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.870 
in the sea but we're gonna have to
