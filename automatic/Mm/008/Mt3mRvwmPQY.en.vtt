we're<00:00:01.199> in<00:00:01.410> when<00:00:01.620> do<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.890> most<00:00:02.070> common

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
we're in when do the most common

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.289 
we're in when do the most common
accidents<00:00:03.149> happen<00:00:03.570> I<00:00:04.250> think<00:00:05.250> where<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.120> when

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
accidents happen I think where and when

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.370 
accidents happen I think where and when
the<00:00:06.450> most<00:00:06.629> common<00:00:07.140> accidents<00:00:07.830> happen<00:00:08.340> are

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
the most common accidents happen are

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.860 
the most common accidents happen are
number<00:00:10.380> one<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.830> Descent<00:00:11.870> historically

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
number one on the Descent historically

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.990 
number one on the Descent historically
people<00:00:13.380> use<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> lot<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.070> their<00:00:14.280> energy<00:00:14.429> an

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
people use a lot of their energy an

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.019 
people use a lot of their energy an
emotional<00:00:15.780> output<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:17.010> get<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> top<00:00:17.670> and

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
emotional output to get to the top and

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.080 
emotional output to get to the top and
and<00:00:18.390> there's<00:00:18.630> not<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> lot<00:00:19.260> left<00:00:19.310> to<00:00:20.310> get<00:00:20.550> down

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
and there's not a lot left to get down

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.120 
and there's not a lot left to get down
so<00:00:21.240> mistakes<00:00:21.720> happen<00:00:22.230> people<00:00:22.619> trip<00:00:22.920> people

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
so mistakes happen people trip people

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.710 
so mistakes happen people trip people
let<00:00:23.400> down<00:00:23.580> their<00:00:23.789> guards<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.539> all<00:00:24.689> about

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
let down their guards so it's all about

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230 
let down their guards so it's all about
preparing<00:00:25.560> yourself<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.910> round<00:00:27.119> trip

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
preparing yourself for the round trip

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.750 
preparing yourself for the round trip
you<00:00:27.869> know<00:00:27.990> having<00:00:28.380> enough<00:00:28.619> fuel<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.640> energy

major<00:00:34.739> risks<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:35.730> when<00:00:35.880> we're

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
major risks that we have here when we're

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.790 
major risks that we have here when we're
climbing<00:00:36.149> Rainier<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:37.170> primarily<00:00:37.380> what

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
climbing Rainier I think primarily what

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.010 
climbing Rainier I think primarily what
we<00:00:37.860> look<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.700> weather<00:00:39.020> bad

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
we look out for is the weather bad

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.510 
we look out for is the weather bad
weather<00:00:40.050> conditions<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:40.950> turn<00:00:41.250> us<00:00:41.399> around

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
weather conditions can turn us around

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
weather conditions can turn us around
and<00:00:42.030> historically<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:43.050> climbs<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> big

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and historically on my climbs in the big

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.069 
and historically on my climbs in the big
mountains<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.309> well<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> number<00:00:45.930> one

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
mountains as well that's the number one

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900 
mountains as well that's the number one
reason<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.770> haven't<00:00:47.129> succeeded

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
reason that I haven't succeeded

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.970 
reason that I haven't succeeded
obviously<00:00:48.539> there's<00:00:48.750> glaciers<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.379> crevasses

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
obviously there's glaciers and crevasses

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
obviously there's glaciers and crevasses
we<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> ice<00:00:50.879> wall<00:00:51.180> right<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
we have the ice wall right there on the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.990 
we have the ice wall right there on the
Ingraham<00:00:52.410> glacier<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.219> disappointment

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
Ingraham glacier we have disappointment

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.939 
Ingraham glacier we have disappointment
cleaver<00:00:54.210> there's<00:00:54.510> Rock<00:00:54.780> fall<00:00:55.079> hazard<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.739> for

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
cleaver there's Rock fall hazard but for

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.350 
cleaver there's Rock fall hazard but for
the<00:00:56.010> amount<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.340> time<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.879> spend<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.270> the

the amount of time that we spend on the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.439 
the amount of time that we spend on the
mountain<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.140> weather<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.969> kind<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> key

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
mountain the weather is kind of the key

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
mountain conditions have to be good I

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.780 
mountain conditions have to be good I
have<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.600> feel<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.380> safe<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.100> with

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
have to feel that it's safe and with

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.450 
have to feel that it's safe and with
every<00:01:12.119> step<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.630> take<00:01:12.900> higher<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> mountain

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
every step I take higher on the mountain

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.219 
every step I take higher on the mountain
I<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.850> feel<00:01:15.030> comfortable<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
I have to feel comfortable with that and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.320 
I have to feel comfortable with that and
instinctively<00:01:16.860> I've<00:01:17.189> learned<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.729> if

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
instinctively I've learned that if

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.749 
instinctively I've learned that if
something<00:01:18.840> feels<00:01:19.080> wrong<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.250> wrong<00:01:20.490> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
something feels wrong it is wrong I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.429 
something feels wrong it is wrong I
think<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.119> lot<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.420> mistakes<00:01:21.750> happen<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
think a lot of mistakes happen in the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.399 
think a lot of mistakes happen in the
mountains<00:01:22.770> because<00:01:23.100> people<00:01:24.170> inflict<00:01:25.170> their

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
mountains because people inflict their

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
mountains because people inflict their
own<00:01:25.530> problems<00:01:26.130> by<00:01:26.310> climbing<00:01:26.850> when<00:01:26.970> they

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
own problems by climbing when they

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.359 
own problems by climbing when they
shouldn't<00:01:27.439> climbing<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.560> pad<00:01:28.740> conditions

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
shouldn't climbing and pad conditions

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.460 
shouldn't climbing and pad conditions
for<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> sake<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> success<00:01:30.450> ultimately<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
for the sake of success ultimately the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.039 
for the sake of success ultimately the
mountain<00:01:31.860> decides<00:01:32.640> what<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.900> when

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
mountain decides what you do and when

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.539 
mountain decides what you do and when
you<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.040> understand

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you do it and you have to understand

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.160 
you do it and you have to understand
that<00:01:35.729> when<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.060> climb<00:01:36.360> these<00:01:36.540> mountains<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that when you climb these mountains and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.100 
that when you climb these mountains and
it<00:01:37.259> may<00:01:37.380> take<00:01:37.590> longer<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.850> successful<00:01:39.509> but

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it may take longer to be successful but

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
it may take longer to be successful but
that's<00:01:40.290> part<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> game<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> end<00:01:41.490> of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
that's part of the game at the end of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
that's part of the game at the end of
the<00:01:41.700> day<00:01:41.880> no<00:01:42.090> matter<00:01:42.299> where<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.750> am<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.259> the
