00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.010
 the match between fc groningen and starter is the duel between the number three 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.079
 and the five from the premier division 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.610
 with a win, the pieter huistra team comes closer to psv and fc twente 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.440
 it is hard work to put in the game so the team must have captured the ball 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.470
 early 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.069
 there was also the space 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.210
 and the ability to play a few good header chances in between 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.310
 one of the first to stand by the horseman 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.760
 be a guy and don't come over 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.170
 and then after a good action of tradition, the ball also comes in well 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.170
 match 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.040
 that is a sound box shooting opportunity mattresses 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.410
 between 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.530
 Director if you do this do me good and not once since the failed 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.160
 I'm just a source yes 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.950
 we knew from the previous duels children i think i was important 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.140
 for a man's weather just in the course of Thursday in the Epenaar 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 if it is a blow jesse terrible 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.640
 the revelation of injured kansas city having to prove that it really is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.390
 that promises 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.280
 it goes there, of course, is not yet known 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.430
 well i thought they sounded good in the back 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.610
 healthy good they are increasingly being pushed backwards in two years 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.430
 men can consciously 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 but we have given away very little 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.340
 it was born 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 been disappointing for a while 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.959
 they smoke red card 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.959
 this is the country 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.559
 collapse in the Netherlands 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.080
 everything to do in such a competition 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.669
 yes it is made difficult 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.009
 yes 6 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.329
 it all went well at the beginning and it is normal 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.759
 the duels win 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.489
 and that was it 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.110
 the main duties and 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.659
 keep that lead 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:31.610
 and that it is good 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.530
 yes ajax was but they have yes in the final phase 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.469
 creates the necessary opportunities 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.599
 it was a long ball in the back 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.079
 just win a header and then and then you come already a member 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.619
 niels albert 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.849
 two men from groningen against a force majeure the az players put people 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.359
 come through the eu 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.279
 more on the phone 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.279
 I don't want justice either 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:01.019
 but I think some things have met 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.660
 I find that very much 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.149
 back to earth 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:06.419
 a human 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.920
 of course we want in the netherlands and on whom they want 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.829
 it was thought that i am more a better times 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.029
 what do you have to do then 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.029
 it is not a delay 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.989
 hit 6 ms 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.079
 groningen thinks 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.639
 home games in a row 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.159
 the time has come 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.059
 surprise 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:44.760
 what should we owe ourselves to beating with the stick the idea that 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.609
 I struggle with that 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:52.459
 the he lives the two rivers 21st century the discussion the terror movement and is in 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.099
