00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:09.190
 Yes eh This time, we will describe how to use the vt 60's here of plasma cutting machine 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.130
 Want to think 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:19.200
 To 200 v dedicated a so Well 200 volts 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:21.430
 You can connect 200 volts with either a single run or a mountain cottage 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.880
 Hen 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.880
 Why air compressors make air aggressive 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.640
 Perth size is right here 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.110
 Connect 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.560
 Then insert directly into something to cut off or 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.000
 Huh 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.800
 It is a workbench of iron 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.370
 And securely connected to the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.989
 Here too 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.989
 Connect with the barrier 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.200
 Turn on 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.200
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.920
 Before cutting 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.250
 this 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.700
 It is a tip of Togawa 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.890
 Chips and 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.040
 When the electrode here is loose 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.130
 It causes contact failure so much that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.810
 Firmly it will become not disappear 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.810
 Check that it has 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.049
 Or 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.720
 Make sure and waiting 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.670
 Dee yeah every day when time cut off 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.200
 Hmm 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.980
 As far as possible from the end of the cutting 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.900
 It is in the state of putting 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.220
 With the center of this place left 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.220
 Press the button Sir 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.110
 Toshimashite bone 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:17.210
 I'm getting sparks down when cutting 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.210
 If you go ahead with the speed of the way you go here 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:28.760
 Sparks will bounce back without being able to escape downward 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:30.830
 If so, the bounce will also cause fires for expendables, so sparks on wear will 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.870
 I'm getting below 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.310
 While checking 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.690
 It is filled with torch 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.690
 Then I will do it for a while 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.120
 Well then 3.2 days 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.819
 Is not 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.650
 As much as possible 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.530
 To go straight 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.530
 I will replace this queen ruler 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.190
 Attached to 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.060
 I do not do my best in the chassis
