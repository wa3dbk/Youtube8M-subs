00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello wearing collided 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.560
 amazing fact I always believed that 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.920
 everyone has long known what is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.219
 pressure reducer for what purposes he 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.750
 intended but it turned out wrong 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.240
 pressure reducer in general that exists 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.150
 already long ago and appeared long before 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.619
 before our birth along with 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.789
 the emergence of the plumbing system 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.960
 but met me master over me 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.849
 complete amazement 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.980
 for example, he argued that the gearbox 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.690
 pressure must necessarily 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 installed after water meters in 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.190
 flat but by no means up 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.280
 counter this opinion is drawn from 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 the internet and i'm pretty sure of it 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.670
 looked in the internet and saw what was there 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.050
 really 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.460
 serious disputes are raging on this issue 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.039
 to be honest with me 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.590
 surprises this fact why do you want 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.010
 leave the most vulnerable device of yours 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.840
 plumbing system without any protection 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.559
 it is worth reminding then what a gearbox 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.140
 pressure 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.840
 pressure reducer and that is the device 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.060
 which protects your inner 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.189
 plumbing system and appliances into it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.049
 established from high blood pressure and 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.920
 jumping pressure on utility networks 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.400
 so-called hydraulic shocks 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:27.119
 which adversely affect all appliances 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.189
 your plumbing system and sometimes 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.430
 disables them even completely 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.909
 therefore, they need to be protected for this 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.790
 and called such a device as a gear 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.970
 pressure and I am surprised by the fact that 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.700
 recommends putting him sing after 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.950
 counter you want to leave this one 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.890
 small beautiful counter on 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.439
 torn apart by all the external elements 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.990
 wrong a little tour 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.759
 to the basement here is a heat point from here 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.700
 hot water is supplied to the final 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.600
 Consumer please take a look at 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.039
 pressure gauge 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.330
 we see almost 707 megapascals 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.390
 it's practically 7 atmospheres pressure 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.090
 no gauges here 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.250
 and if you look closely then 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.740
 gauge arrows constantly wave 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.160
 what speaks of pressure leaps 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:29.560
 water network seems to me 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:33.250
 what is the occurrence of such an opinion reducer 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.500
 pressure after the counter on such an opinion 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.230
 affected only by the fact that entering into 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.690
 the composition of the license scheme recommended 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.690
 meter installation does not include itself 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.810
 pressure reducer and it is possible that 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.660
 the consumer has concerns that the meters 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.660
 will not be accepted for use 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.730
 but such a scheme is only 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.270
 a recommendation by no means 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.970
 normative you do not put counters 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.720
 always there is only horizontally 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.610
 Here you met for sure 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.480
 pretty romantic device 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.040
 name to frd 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.050
 it is statutory installed only 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.680
 construction companies as it is very 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.440
 bulky not convenient to operate 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.989
 dissatisfied with capriciousness and nobody himself 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.470
 not bought but nevertheless this device 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.140
 meets all standards adopted to 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.220
 operating and has relevant 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.209
 certificates and documents 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.459
 here is the installed frg to the system 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.750
 try to squeeze the water meter 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.870
 between filter and pressure reducer 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.630
 here's another pipe layout done 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.290
 construction organization is the same 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.550
 scheme 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.269
 crane pressure reducer and meter so 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.620
 gentlemen 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:02.140
 study the construction documentation and here 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.500
 what happens when 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.530
 the counter is open to all cataclysms which 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.780
 occur on utilities and i 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.830
 I think met with sweaty 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.460
 counters 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.100
 here is one of these counter even more 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.690
 less visible sometimes does not fog up so 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.320
 no visible 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:27.250
 digital readings this is because 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.560
 that the glands and the counter can not 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.870
 resist with increased pressure in 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.680
 system and eventually start 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.660
 miss 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.240
 so think gentlemen and 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.110
 always be guided by logic and 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.730
 common sense attack with what you think 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.730
 about pressure meters
