00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
unfortunately now you need to do a one

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.590 
unfortunately now you need to do a one
at<00:01:22.120> a<00:01:22.150> time<00:01:22.450> I'm<00:01:22.600> afraid<00:01:22.750> guys<00:01:23.140> so<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.130> second

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
at a time I'm afraid guys so the second

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.270 
at a time I'm afraid guys so the second
part<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:25.720> need<00:01:25.870> is<00:01:26.020> probably<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.800> easel

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
part you need is probably the easel

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.120 
part you need is probably the easel
definitely<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.940> easiest<00:01:27.970> part<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.690> get<00:01:28.900> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
definitely the easiest part to get and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.770 
definitely the easiest part to get and
it's<00:01:30.130> near<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.430> roof<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.150> it's<00:01:31.330> in<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.510> little

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
it's near the roof and it's in a little

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.960 
it's near the roof and it's in a little
case<00:01:32.050> here<00:01:32.410> on<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.740> side<00:01:32.980> obviously<00:01:33.730> you<00:01:33.850> need

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
case here on the side obviously you need

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.520 
case here on the side obviously you need
the<00:01:34.090> wardens<00:01:34.510> key<00:01:34.780> if<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.110> don't<00:01:35.290> know<00:01:35.380> how<00:01:35.440> to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
the wardens key if you don't know how to

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.990 
the wardens key if you don't know how to
get<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:35.740> wardens<00:01:36.100> key<00:01:36.310> I've<00:01:36.430> got<00:01:36.550> a<00:01:36.580> video<00:01:36.880> on

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
get the wardens key I've got a video on

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.360 
get the wardens key I've got a video on
my<00:01:37.090> channel<00:01:37.120> showing<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.140> how<00:01:38.260> to<00:01:38.290> do<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.590> so

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.860 
that is the second part it's pretty
simple<00:01:41.409> pretty<00:01:41.770> straightforward<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.870> yeah

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
simple pretty straightforward and yeah

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.899 
simple pretty straightforward and yeah
there's<00:01:44.560> nothing<00:01:44.950> really<00:01:45.220> more<00:01:45.520> for<00:01:45.700> me<00:01:45.790> to

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
to jump through you simply jump through

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.320 
to jump through you simply jump through
that<00:04:30.010> similar<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.580> get<00:04:30.760> in<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.909> wardens

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
that similar to get in the wardens

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.059 
that similar to get in the wardens
in<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.569> second<00:04:31.930> location<00:04:32.199> but<00:04:32.590> obviously<00:04:32.919> it

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.069 
in the second location but obviously it

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.439 
in the second location but obviously it
was<00:04:33.189> in<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.370> first<00:04:33.580> one<00:04:33.789> for<00:04:33.939> this<00:04:34.030> video<00:04:34.300> and

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
was in the first one for this video and

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.210 
was in the first one for this video and
then<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.199> run<00:04:35.379> down<00:04:35.560> here<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:36.039> that

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
then you run down here is that that

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.439 
then you run down here is that that
meter<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.699> then<00:04:36.789> the<00:04:36.909> warden's<00:04:37.330> office

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
meter and then the warden's office

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.100 
meter and then the warden's office
double<00:04:38.319> become<00:04:38.830> open<00:04:39.689> so<00:04:40.689> pretty

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
double become open so pretty

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.629 
double become open so pretty
straightforward<00:04:41.710> once<00:04:41.889> you<00:04:42.009> know<00:04:42.159> how<00:04:42.189> to<00:04:42.340> do

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
straightforward once you know how to do

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.879 
straightforward once you know how to do
it<00:04:43.020> but<00:04:44.020> yeah<00:04:44.199> it<00:04:44.289> did<00:04:44.409> sent<00:04:44.590> me<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.710> while<00:04:44.860> to

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
it but yeah it did sent me a while to

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.369 
it but yeah it did sent me a while to
actually<00:04:45.129> figure<00:04:45.520> this<00:04:45.699> out<00:04:45.819> guys<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:46.930> revive

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
actually figure this out guys so revive

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:48.899 
actually figure this out guys so revive
yourself<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:48.159> then<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:48.310> can<00:04:48.550> run<00:04:48.699> in<00:04:48.819> the

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909

warden's office and normally this actual
door<00:04:51.879> will<00:04:52.060> be<00:04:52.090> electrified<00:04:52.719> but<00:04:53.020> those

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
door will be electrified but those

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.369 
door will be electrified but those
generators<00:04:53.770> we've<00:04:53.979> destroyed<00:04:55.080> allow<00:04:56.080> us<00:04:56.259> to

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379 
generators we've destroyed allow us to

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.719 
generators we've destroyed allow us to

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:46.629 
in so the plane actually takes off and

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.600 
in so the plane actually takes off and
then<00:05:47.139> I<00:05:47.319> believe<00:05:47.589> it<00:05:47.710> gets<00:05:47.860> struck<00:05:48.129> by<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.339> lot

in typical in and then you crash London

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.730 
in typical in and then you crash London
