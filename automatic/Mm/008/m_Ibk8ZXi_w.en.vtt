green<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:53.829> personally<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.309> think<00:00:54.550> all<00:00:55.329> these

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
green now personally I think all these

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.180 
green now personally I think all these
colors<00:00:55.929> really<00:00:56.230> complement<00:00:56.920> each<00:00:56.949> other

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
colors really complement each other

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.029 
colors really complement each other
really<00:00:57.399> well<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.359> especially<00:00:58.899> if<00:00:59.649> you<00:00:59.829> really

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
really well and especially if you really

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.819 
really well and especially if you really
look<00:01:00.249> at<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.579> um<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.870> pearlescent<00:01:02.260> of<00:01:02.620> the

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
look at it um the pearlescent of the

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.340 
look at it um the pearlescent of the
race<00:01:03.010> yellow<00:01:03.600> actually<00:01:04.600> kind<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:04.960> looks<00:01:05.260> like

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
race yellow actually kind of looks like

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.620 
race yellow actually kind of looks like
it<00:01:05.710> is<00:01:05.860> lime<00:01:06.130> green<00:01:06.159> because<00:01:07.000> it<00:01:07.120> is<00:01:07.240> matching

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
it is lime green because it is matching

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.720 
it is lime green because it is matching
with<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:08.050> green<00:01:08.320> itself<00:01:08.710> because<00:01:09.430> we<00:01:09.610> do

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
with that green itself because we do

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.850 
with that green itself because we do
have<00:01:09.910> the<00:01:10.090> lime<00:01:10.300> green<00:01:10.540> secondary<00:01:11.080> so<00:01:11.290> overall

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
have the lime green secondary so overall

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.800 
have the lime green secondary so overall
honestly<00:01:12.520> I<00:01:12.550> think<00:01:12.940> this<00:01:13.090> car<00:01:13.330> looks<00:01:13.750> really

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810

is the I would call it the Tron car and

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.290 
is the I would call it the Tron car and
now<00:02:00.130> definitely<00:02:00.610> if<00:02:00.670> you<00:02:00.730> guys<00:02:00.910> look<00:02:01.120> at<00:02:01.210> the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
now definitely if you guys look at the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.360 
now definitely if you guys look at the
para<00:02:01.510> lesson<00:02:01.900> you<00:02:02.020> can<00:02:02.170> kind<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.440> see<00:02:02.680> those

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
para lesson you can kind of see those

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.910
