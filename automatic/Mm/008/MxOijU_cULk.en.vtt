get people to move in that direction so
I<00:03:01.890> think<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.670> would<00:03:02.820> be<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:03.240> long<00:03:04.230> way<00:03:04.980> for<00:03:05.400> us<00:03:05.580> to

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
I think it would be a long way for us to

I think it would be a long way for us to
get<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.870> eatin<00:03:07.290> bugs<00:03:07.500> but<00:03:08.280> at<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.519> same<00:03:08.730> time<00:03:08.910> I

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
get to eatin bugs but at the same time I

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.479 
get to eatin bugs but at the same time I
think<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.570> if<00:03:09.810> enough<00:03:10.170> information<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.310> put

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
think that if enough information is put

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.630 
think that if enough information is put
out<00:03:11.550> there<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.870> course<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.410> bugs<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.550> the

out there and of course the bugs and the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.460 
out there and of course the bugs and the
insects<00:03:15.209> are<00:03:15.420> presented<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:15.959> such<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.200> way<00:03:16.440> that

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
think if we go along that route persons

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.410 
think if we go along that route persons
may<00:03:36.380> consume<00:03:37.380> but<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.920> give<00:03:38.610> me<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.820> roach<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.239> my
