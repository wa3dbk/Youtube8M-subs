 Celesio strongly changing several percent 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.210

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.490
 should start 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.069
 so I gave her extra around a rum that is 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.390

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.930
 that's quite normal the normal is that's normal with 5 12 I think 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.029
 or so 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:32.199
 is pretty okay a thousand child 20 so for five people

 Wokittel times have

 and then we talk about it 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.279
 so-called Black Sheep 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.709
 we are starting 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.239
 and see a command window

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.079
 is Worms 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:20.589
 basically 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.379
 the server contains 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.369
 but do not stop without him 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.369
 we start with Soldo 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:32.169

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.919
 some have there 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.080
 the most important 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.399
 for the beginning of this was

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.139
 the kids do everything 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.139
 Now let's do a hammer Celesio 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.889

 Maybe your game did not work out 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:02.669
 but the winners 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.669
 be forgiven until the project when it's late head 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.209
 but otherwise I really do not want to pack that

 Round a good Quattro is already feasible 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.550
 So what has to enter now very very important

 the efficient name 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.439

 Termeer Kassab Alpin Portes unrelevant and very very Nice 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:09.789
 so thats it 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.360
 speak now 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.809
 start again 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.360
