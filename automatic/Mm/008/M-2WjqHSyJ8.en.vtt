that<00:02:32.470> we're<00:02:32.620> using<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.519> know<00:02:33.640> that's<00:02:33.880> where

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
that we're using you know that's where

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.780 
that we're using you know that's where
we're<00:02:34.329> going<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.780> be<00:02:34.959> pumping<00:02:35.890> this<00:02:36.280> fluid

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
we're going to be pumping this fluid

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.410 
we're going to be pumping this fluid
down<00:02:37.060> 36<00:02:38.019> wells<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:39.070> are<00:02:39.100> 300<00:02:39.730> feet<00:02:39.970> deep<00:02:40.269> or

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
down 36 wells that are 300 feet deep or

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.860 
down 36 wells that are 300 feet deep or
so<00:02:40.630> each<00:02:41.220> down<00:02:42.220> deep<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:42.549> temperature<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.239> 57

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
so each down deep to temperature is 57

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.949 
so each down deep to temperature is 57
degrees<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.890> as<00:02:45.100> this<00:02:45.280> fluid<00:02:45.700> goes<00:02:45.910> down<00:02:46.150> 57

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
degrees and as this fluid goes down 57

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.720 
degrees and as this fluid goes down 57
degrees<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.620> first<00:02:47.860> time<00:02:48.100> in<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> second

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
degrees the first time in the second

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.880 
degrees the first time in the second
time<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.000> fluid<00:02:49.299> then<00:02:49.420> becomes<00:02:49.840> also<00:02:50.260> 57

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
time the fluid then becomes also 57

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.430 
time the fluid then becomes also 57
degrees<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.940> hot<00:02:52.239> day<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.750> 57<00:02:53.350> degrees

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.960 
built on a cold day you know in Alabama
what's<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.910> team's<00:02:57.180> at<00:02:57.870> 57<00:02:58.470> degrees<00:02:58.970> that

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
what's in the team's at 57 degrees that

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.369 
what's in the team's at 57 degrees that
will<00:03:00.180> help<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.450> warm<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.810> building<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.140> a

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
will help to warm the building just a

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.420 
will help to warm the building just a
little<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.650> we<00:03:01.680> think<00:03:01.890> it's<00:03:01.980> gonna<00:03:02.099> pay<00:03:02.280> for

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
little so we think it's gonna pay for

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.580 
little so we think it's gonna pay for
itself<00:03:02.670> 78<00:03:03.150> years<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.780> it's<00:03:04.140> going<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.410> save

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
itself 78 years and it's going to save

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.110 
itself 78 years and it's going to save
us<00:03:04.739> about<00:03:04.860> fifty<00:03:05.310> percent<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:05.730> our<00:03:05.849> heating

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
us about fifty percent on our heating
