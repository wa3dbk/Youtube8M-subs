00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.410
 hello everyone I'm alex the handsome 95 and bored I decided to make this video for 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.149
 criticize iphone 3g let's start 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:16.749
 this apple mobile was taken out in 2008 in spain in the united states it cost in 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.740
 that time 200 dollars but 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.800
 in Spain you can only get it with moviestar and also paying a fee 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.249
 of data of 15 euros a month today 25 euros 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.579
 they wonder what the hell is a data rate 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.010
 we can define this term as you have to pay a month a month 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.130
 getting in the internet with your iphone 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.490
 Of course not for wi-fi by 3g or is wasting money in addition to 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.830
 get it you also have to pay making calculations the phone comes out 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.520
 for about 300 euros 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.430
 If you want to buy it, I recommend that you go to the United States or 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.440
 buy by ebay 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.340
 good let's leave the price go to the phone what things have 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.420
 In terms of messaging, you can send SMS messages or text messages. 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.460
 email either yahoo 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.110
 or any type of mail but the bad thing is that it does not send messages or messages 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.820
 multimedia 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.870
 that's bad because you can not send photos music videos 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.230
 that's messaging 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.220
 You can call anyone by just touching a name and also the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.550
 phone is very easy to use that I like very much even if I do not have it too 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.790
 has a camera only 2 megapixels and and you can not record videos you can only 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.230
 to take pictures as far as memory is quite good you can choose eight gigs or 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.670
 16 gigas and this can be expanded in your memory you can cram everything 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.470
 music videos 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.210
 images games and applications 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.860
 you can also make notes there fone 3g is a fantastic and pop with screen 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 panning the speakers say they are not bad but could be better 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.170
 you can also do the loose cobe by turning the iphone on 90 degrees 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.610
 Internet browser is the safari and that by the way is very fast I think until 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.009
 better than a computer also the iphone e has gps by google maps the 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.100
 people say that it is very good because it is very good because it is difficult to be 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.070
 go the signal 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.639
 but when using google maps you have two bad things 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.209
 first of all you have to be connected to the internet so you 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.399
 it costs money and secondly when using google maps you lose a lot of battery in 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:21.029
 the catalog says that they are five hours of Internet but they are less hours reason why 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.219
 it is not recommended for long trips the battery is crap 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.199
 at least you have to charge once a day also has the smelly 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:33.269
 which is to download applications for your iphone through the internet some 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.449
 they are for free 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.889
 and his music store is baby and with his bike is torque is to buy music and 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.849
 up to here the analysis of the icom so in two but before we leave a joke 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.569
 a boy goes and tells his mother mom I want one and fon and the mother tells him that 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.619
 Well, you go to the United States and you buy a sheet 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:52.429
 god xd xd xd xd
