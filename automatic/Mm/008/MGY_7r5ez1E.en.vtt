more boost or volume capabilities on tap

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.100 
more boost or volume capabilities on tap
really<00:01:28.430> has<00:01:28.610> about<00:01:29.240> two<00:01:29.420> times<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.810> amount<00:01:29.960> of

really has about two times the amount of

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.520 
really has about two times the amount of
gain<00:01:30.530> as<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.980> stock<00:01:31.480> tube<00:01:32.480> screamer<00:01:32.750> it's

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
gain as the stock tube screamer it's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.670 
gain as the stock tube screamer it's
more<00:01:33.710> transparent<00:01:33.980> smoother<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:36.020> chip<00:01:36.470> has

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
more transparent smoother the chip has

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.080 
more transparent smoother the chip has
been<00:01:36.950> changed<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.460> sort<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:37.850> original

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
been changed to the sort of original

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.200 
been changed to the sort of original
tube<00:01:38.480> screamer<00:01:38.840> spec<00:01:39.320> chip<00:01:39.890> some<00:01:40.700> caps<00:01:40.940> and

tube screamer spec chip some caps and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.630 
tube screamer spec chip some caps and
resistors<00:01:41.570> have<00:01:41.720> been<00:01:41.840> changed<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:43.130> a

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
resistors have been changed and it is a

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.180 
resistors have been changed and it is a
lot<00:01:43.940> more<00:01:44.090> articulate<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.710> very<00:01:45.920> quickly

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
lot more articulate so very quickly

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.710 
lot more articulate so very quickly
because<00:01:46.900> this<00:01:48.850> strong<00:01:49.850> modded<00:01:50.210> tube<00:01:50.450> screamer

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
because this strong modded tube screamer

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.590 
because this strong modded tube screamer
is<00:01:50.810> has<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:51.830> lot<00:01:52.100> more<00:01:52.280> volume<00:01:52.700> or<00:01:53.060> gain

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
is has a lot more volume or gain

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.270 
is has a lot more volume or gain
available<00:01:54.080> on<00:01:54.200> tap<00:01:54.440> I'm<00:01:54.860> going<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.130> actually

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
the stock tube screamer they're going to

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.960 
the stock tube screamer they're going to
be<00:02:03.440> closed<00:02:03.650> in<00:02:03.890> volume<00:02:04.400> now<00:02:04.550> so<00:02:04.760> let's<00:02:04.910> just

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
be closed in volume now so let's just

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:20.580 
be closed in volume now so let's just
listen<00:02:05.360> quickly<00:02:09.040> here's<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.250> strong<00:02:10.730> bot

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.710 
modded tube screamer and the stock one
are<00:02:48.829> a<00:02:48.860> little<00:02:49.670> bit<00:02:49.849> more<00:02:50.000> even<00:02:50.329> in<00:02:50.540> their

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720

is<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.670> little<00:04:00.030> bit<00:04:00.290> quieter<00:04:01.430> than<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.940> strong

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
is a little bit quieter than the strong

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.040 
is a little bit quieter than the strong
Mada<00:04:04.080> tube<00:04:04.470> screamer<00:04:04.770> let's<00:04:05.099> turn<00:04:05.370> up<00:04:05.400> the

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
Mada tube screamer let's turn up the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.240 
Mada tube screamer let's turn up the
drive<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.080> good<00:04:07.500> bit<00:04:07.680> more<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.920> give<00:04:11.099> her<00:04:11.190> a

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
drive a good bit more and give her a

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:58.850 
drive a good bit more and give her a
goat

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.379 

so<00:04:59.860> you<00:05:00.190> can<00:05:00.370> hear<00:05:00.580> their<00:05:00.760> when<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.150> drive<00:05:01.360> is

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
so you can hear their when the drive is

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.909 
so you can hear their when the drive is
cranked<00:05:01.840> up<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:02.139> can<00:05:02.260> hear<00:05:02.350> quite<00:05:02.620> a<00:05:02.650> bit<00:05:02.710> of

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
cranked up you can hear quite a bit of

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.610 
cranked up you can hear quite a bit of
difference<00:05:03.220> in<00:05:04.000> these<00:05:04.419> two<00:05:04.810> overdrive<00:05:05.290> pedals

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
difference in these two overdrive pedals

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.760 
difference in these two overdrive pedals
they<00:05:05.800> have<00:05:05.919> really<00:05:06.250> replaced<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.770> components

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
they have really replaced the components

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.180 
they have really replaced the components
in<00:05:08.889> the<00:05:09.160> stock<00:05:09.910> one<00:05:10.660> in<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.350> strong<00:05:11.710> mod<00:05:11.919> and

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
in the stock one in the strong mod and

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.310 
in the stock one in the strong mod and
really<00:05:12.460> done<00:05:12.580> a<00:05:12.610> great<00:05:12.790> job<00:05:12.820> so<00:05:13.270> I'm<00:05:14.139> just

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
really done a great job so I'm just

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.470 
really done a great job so I'm just
going<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.590> quickly<00:05:14.800> back<00:05:15.310> off<00:05:15.550> on<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.000> drive<00:05:16.270> a

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
going to quickly back off on the drive a

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:25.110 
going to quickly back off on the drive a
little<00:05:16.750> bit<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:21.600> I'm<00:05:22.600> going<00:05:22.780> to<00:05:22.840> turn<00:05:23.440> up<00:05:24.120> the

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
little bit and I'm going to turn up the

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.469 
little bit and I'm going to turn up the
tone<00:05:25.720> knob<00:05:25.990> to<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:26.290> right<00:05:29.070> at<00:05:30.070> about<00:05:31.030> three

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
tone knob to the right at about three

00:05:31.479 --> 00:06:15.190 
tone knob to the right at about three
o'clock<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:31.810> just<00:05:32.080> let<00:05:32.200> you<00:05:32.290> listen<00:05:32.440> there

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.250 

so<00:06:16.200> I<00:06:16.230> feel<00:06:16.530> that<00:06:16.680> the<00:06:16.770> range<00:06:17.280> of<00:06:17.640> the<00:06:18.600> tone<00:06:18.930> on

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
so I feel that the range of the tone on

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.910 
so I feel that the range of the tone on
the<00:06:19.740> JH<00:06:20.250> s<00:06:20.400> strong<00:06:20.640> mod<00:06:20.910> is<00:06:21.150> a<00:06:21.180> little<00:06:21.510> bit<00:06:21.600> more

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
the JH s strong mod is a little bit more

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.010 
the JH s strong mod is a little bit more
broad<00:06:23.120> let's<00:06:24.120> go<00:06:24.240> the<00:06:24.360> opposite<00:06:24.660> way<00:06:24.720> now<00:06:24.960> we

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
broad let's go the opposite way now we

00:06:25.020 --> 00:07:02.880 
broad let's go the opposite way now we
will<00:06:25.380> go<00:06:25.560> to<00:06:25.800> 9<00:06:26.610> o'clock<00:06:26.970> on<00:06:27.120> the<00:06:27.180> tone

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.710 

so<00:07:03.890> you<00:07:04.310> can<00:07:04.460> hear<00:07:04.640> these<00:07:04.850> are<00:07:05.120> two<00:07:05.420> killer

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
so you can hear these are two killer

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.160 
so you can hear these are two killer
pedals<00:07:06.160> and<00:07:07.160> really<00:07:08.060> the<00:07:08.210> strong<00:07:08.480> mod<00:07:08.720> on<00:07:08.930> the

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170 
pedals and really the strong mod on the

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.690 
pedals and really the strong mod on the
ibanez<00:07:09.500> tube<00:07:09.530> screen<00:07:09.920> really<00:07:10.100> opens<00:07:10.490> it<00:07:10.550> up

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
ibanez tube screen really opens it up

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.120 
ibanez tube screen really opens it up
makes<00:07:10.970> it<00:07:11.060> more<00:07:11.180> articulate<00:07:11.720> more<00:07:12.620> defined

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
makes it more articulate more defined

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.010 
makes it more articulate more defined
