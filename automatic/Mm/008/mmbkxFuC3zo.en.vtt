00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 good morning to israel we continue our 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.490
 morning broadcast with us is a guest and for 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.280
 reznikova naturopath with whom we will talk 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.740
 about good nutrition good morning 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.570
 I am glad to see you again our studios as 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.990
 says fats and proteins and carbohydrates who and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.810
 for what say let's talk today 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.570
 about carbohydrates so it is extremely important 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.519
 actually carbohydrates it is well 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.720
 the best gasoline for our body 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.160
 especially with regard to the brain and muscles i 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.070
 heard that there is fast and slow 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.230
 fast 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.520
 bad good let's first understand 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.860
 what generally refers to hydrocarbons 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.899
 let's talk both of the attackers just swing 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.860
 carbohydrate principle applies all that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.989
 made from grain ie pizza buns 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.520
 any pastry all cooked 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.120
 grain post it all refers to 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.250
 carbohydrates 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.129
 in addition to these include vegetables and fruits 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.680
 that is, it contains vegetables and fruits carbohydrates 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.399
 and of course sugar is all that contains 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.109
 sugar contains carbohydrates well this is so 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.550
 say large quantities and more in 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.809
 small amounts of carbohydrates 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.590
 contained in legumes 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.049
 they are contained in dairy products and 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.880
 even in nuts in my fats to more 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.040
 contains there more fat on there is 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.619
 including some carbohydrates 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 Now we need carbohydrates but 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.909
 carbohydrates have a different say that's bad 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.460
 good carbohydrates still say empty 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.070
 carbohydrates have such a concept of what they are 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.439
 actually empty empty not from vitamins 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.659
 from minerals and fiber, that is, we 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.460
 accustomed to eat white bread first 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.930
 eat white rice and white sugar 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.170
 yes, that is, you actually carbohydrates 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.820
 which instantly absorb sap then 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.460
 There are, in principle, any carbohydrates that 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.920
 we get they end up in 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.990
 the body turns to glucose and here 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.840
 this glucose is nutrition won 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.840
 gasoline which charges us with energy and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.479
 In general, in theory, a person should from 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.940
 total ration get 60 percent 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.910
 carbohydrates nothing yourself really im 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.670
 maybe there will be many well here's a loaf 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.610
 it's undesirable to see what to do with it 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.830
 but today the average person uses 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.740
 somewhere not more than forty percent 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.540
 the rest is fats and proteins here 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.400
 this difference is just that in general 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.410
 rather negatively affects 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.530
 our health therefore do not 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.200
 worth it but carbohydrates are not all good too 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.890
 there they are you so that's what empty 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.440
 carbohydrates 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.820
 they are empty of vitamins minerals and 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.220
 fiber what when 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.320
 industrially cleaned grain 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.050
 to get white flour or white rice 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.490
 we end up getting cleared of everything 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.100
 exactly here in 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.720
 grain shells all and sat it 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.780
 energy is gasoline for our body 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.730
 gasoline which contains field 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.220
 absolutely absolutely that is it turns out 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.290
 that he is freed from all that more 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.300
 then getting stay worse after all for 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.280
 that carbohydrates are assimilated to us 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.280
 need certain substances including 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.160
 vitamins and love b vitamins very 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.200
 important vitamins are basically all in nature 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.970
 arranged very correctly and in the shell 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.739
 grains these vitamins are contained that is something 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.170
 what you need to digest carbohydrates there 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.080
 there is but if we use peeled 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.750
 grain then there it is not and therefore it is 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.239
 exhausted all the reserves of the body and 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.730
 not to learn these empty ones 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.550
 from so to speak all carbohydrates that is 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.300
 if there is a flight of whole grain with well 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.980
 of course if there is rice if there are groups 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.250
 bread and pastries try to make it 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.440
 made from whole grains and 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.420
 and another such moment I am often asked 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.170
 what is glycemic I wanted yes 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.420
 I do not doubt you take them when 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.280
 they say that's good and bad when we 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.170
 somehow, well, there are some 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.820
 characteristics are always like that 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.620
 questions arise and judges who 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.069
 yes, by what criteria we will 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.749
 evaluate good or bad correctly 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.109
 right so here's the quality 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:58.760
 such a judge advocates a concept which 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.030
 called the glycemic index 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.489
 in fact, this is the speed with which glucose 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.409
 enters the blood we said ourselves that 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.469
 all carbohydrates turn and love coffee and 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.540
 it's glucose she enters the blood on she 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:14.180
 may arrive very quickly 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.910
 if we ate with you well about sleep 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.400
 chocolate and instantly rises 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.320
 blood sugar and we feel 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.060
 the tide how would such a thing be carried on and 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.460
 energy but for a short time and we quickly 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.840
 back to the feeling of hunger and 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.419
 there is a feeling of weakness here 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.660
 these are here swings in terms of glucose level 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:39.500
 blood they are very harmful further if we 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.710
 eat with you like whole rice then 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.070
 or wholemeal bread 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.250
 then we get carbs completely 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.560
 other qualities that do not give a sharp 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:57.169
 a jump in glucose and are released 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:00.259
 very very gradually not and then we 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.110
 can we call but coach slow 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.449
 carbohydrates are slowly absorbed into the blood 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.970
 slowly released and so 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.250
 we get a feeling of fullness for a long time 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.690
 that's it actually there is a difference 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.460
 by the way this term 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.180
 rhythmic total led enough 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.159
 recently the 80s of the twentieth century is not yet 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.990
 until the end is clear here that exactly with him 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.590
 it's a deal but in any case it's some 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.050
 the evaluation criterion for 100 is considered to be 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.849
 the glucose index itself 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.949
 the speed of which glucose which we 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.860
 use goes into the blood and all 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.020
 the rest is divided everything up to 55 and 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.430
 considered very good carbohydrates 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.280
 and everything above 50 5 to 70 is considered 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.530
 average and all that more than 70 already 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.909
 refers to bad carbohydrates and eat 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.340
 such tables on which it is possible 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.610
 see which food is preferable 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.110
 for example 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.900
 whole rice has you glycemic 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.820
 index 52 white 70 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.889
 bios ie this is the difference 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.690
 which and our time is coming to the end I am 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:08.240
 it seems that with you 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.050
 carbohydrate respect the fact is that your 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.220
 appearance is always with us but 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.350
 short but on the other hand she 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.830
 useful as slow carbs therefore 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:21.009
 thank you very much for the finger come to us 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.009
 still
