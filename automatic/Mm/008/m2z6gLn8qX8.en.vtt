00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.250
 television also an honor that the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.460
 July 4th 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.160
 at this moment in which my child's 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.420
 shrimp and in 10 types that I eat and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.449
 it's very easy to do what we're going to 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.560
 put to boil is vinegar in this 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.250
 I'm going to do it with honey 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.119
 bee medel 9 bee level like 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.119
 you know in English 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:35.370
 salsa cachi cachi obvious almost everything 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.460
 American, I think it's ketchup in rice 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.790
 and all cough but notice that as always 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.620
 the whole human being always like that as 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.680
 you can if this word like burn and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.620
 I have to generalize generalized and 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.690
 good and has always demonized that usa 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 in nothing else commented hot dogs and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.710
 burgers meals of course and not 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 it's true the gm I tell you right now 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.699
 one of the countries that has most 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.220
 revolutionized cooking worldwide 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.200
 are the usa social 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.970
 the best certain ones have there too 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.680
 or like everyone 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.030
 they did not have a lot of history and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.770
 suddenly, we have better ones 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.300
 they have them and good museums 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.900
 I do not defend it I do not believe anything about them 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.560
 so it's a little bit different 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.350
 to put ginger 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.170
 then logically chopped then to 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.110
 just like garlic and after about 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.729
 how many minutes will it be like this in a 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.759
 reduction honey then take a 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.750
 consistency and it starts to reduce and 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:41.380
 now I missed the most important thing 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.679
 Tabasco sauce because if it shows more 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.270
 very much then it is already being done 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.490
 this reduction and it will stay of this 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.590
 way that is cold is already online 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.429
 because I do not want to burn, I was not 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.740
 there's that again now we have 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.380
 shrimp and I'm using shrimp and 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.090
 for more or less than they are 21 25 are the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.229
 number of units that fit within 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.869
 one pound 500 grams medium 21 25 and 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.269
 they are perfectly well cleaned 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.349
 they smell absolutely nothing they smell like mana 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.440
 maroon smell of the sea 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.170
 I removed the tract pharynx or tract 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.450
 digestive tract digestive tract and 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.930
 that is the benita that is here that 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.930
 really is 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.450
 to the fifth we remove the shell 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.530
 I do not want to mistake the shell and 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.209

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.010
