00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.880
 we follow the club's preseason 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.259
 We are with the two Mexicans of 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.930
 villarreal javier aquino giovani two 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.420
 saints are concentrated a few days 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.400
 but let's see these days how much 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.350
 time he got to know himself and we're going to 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.260
 see how many know each other as 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.940
 see a priori the challenge that we do not have 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.800
 a lot concentrating together because in the 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.930
 Selection normally we do not share 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.360
 room but but good these days 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.100
 We have been living a little longer and 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.099
 we will try to see how much he takes us is 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.750
 complicated to be a bit try to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.760
 hit what you can because good what 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.290
 I know a little bit in the selection because 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.560
 we almost concentrated together and now the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.270
 little time that we have concentrated together 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.950
 Let's see if I'm left with little things 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.290
 finally the coexistence is going well 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.640

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.270
 roommates we have to 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.550
 is that everything continues like this can also 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.950
 reflect later on the court 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.629
 the questions are football are 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.670
 personal questions is all varied or 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.290
 I hope they have talked a lot 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.920
 these days because if they are not going to 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.920

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:16.220

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.160
