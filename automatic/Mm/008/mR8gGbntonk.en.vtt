 recycling it is a project 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.680

 as part of a partnership 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.070
 public-private pro poor has only begun 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:08.060
 by identifying the beneficiaries 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:13.579
 improbable relationship with the authority 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:17.269
 communal then we organized a 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:20.269
 awareness workshop and launch 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:26.480
 official of the project of course we were at 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:30.320
 50 people and after we made a 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.160
 worker training in the cam 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.880

 2012 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.660
 four pilot projects were initiated 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.910
 through mobilization of support 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.470
 financial of 83 thousand dollars 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.820
 these initiatives are particularly 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.400
 women's empowerment 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.850

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.910
 engaged 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:56.340
 half of them are widows the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:03:09.060
 crisis and the courses would go so that the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:10.640
 camif habitat food and to achieve it ok 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.130
 sixty people at risk 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.570

 told me there is an amarillo jersey 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.520
 the benefits of the partnership 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.410
 public-private pro-poor lies in 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.360
 three aspects the transfer of 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.770
 technical knowledge creation 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.600
 economic opportunities for 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.120
 women and improving hygiene 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.870
 through waste management since the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.020
 hemois who the markets association 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.190
 have just done anyway there is a 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.170
 change the so many mess that 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.950
 was the group for months and 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.910
 months in the center have twittos market which 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.350
 all were kidnapped by the social and 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.180
 through public meetings the 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.739
 different protagonists raises awareness 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.230
 households with the interest of paying a 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.230
 monthly contribution of 0.5 dollar 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:59.870
 he asks for the economic contribution 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.190
 families and the sale of compost 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.800
 made with organic materials 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.180
 collected will eventually be the two 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.620
 main economic resources of the 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.740
 project we already saw saved cats 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.170
 volcanic fumes manager 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.920
 we paid off from postmen and 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:19.010
 then we take this household waste 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.770
 which breaks down we limit to these 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.700
 wrong and then we made the 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.650
 policy to display your characters but 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.030
 the challenges are still the size 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.530
 actors in this project of management of 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.870
 waste will have to be creative to 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.770
 solve the recycling problems of 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.210
 non-organic waste women 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.670
 marginalized by their status as 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.920
 vulnerable of ex-combatants you or 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.470
 returnees are valued by the service 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.150
 useful that it renders to society 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.400
 the first time to really appreciate 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.930
 because we have employment data 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.520
 to whom he is in your needs you 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.040
 really says you did well at 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.410
 give this woman she is how 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.080
 the few times you see these 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:06.249
 children did not eat put the veil 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.919
 close to home savin 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:17.439
 children do not go that my 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:19.619
 approach is she like that is there we are 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.619
 is 

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:38.919
 if the positive effects of this activity 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:40.719
 are confirmed it can be 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.289
 sustained and extended to other regions 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:43.289
 of the beautiful world
