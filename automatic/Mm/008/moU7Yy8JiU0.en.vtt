has a fail-safe with the signs but it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
has a fail-safe with the signs but it
still<00:01:35.250> works<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.360> want<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.689> take

the<00:01:36.990> signs<00:01:37.200> off<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:37.590> possible<00:01:38.240> but<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the signs off as possible but then you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.120 
the signs off as possible but then you
have<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.290> careful<00:01:40.500> when<00:01:40.860> you're<00:01:40.950> walking

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
through it and maybe there's a way to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.260 
through it and maybe there's a way to
fix<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.320> just<00:01:43.860> put<00:01:44.549> signs<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.090> because
