hi<00:00:00.780> guys<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.230> connect<00:00:01.650> extreme<00:00:02.100> and<00:00:02.750> this

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hi guys this is connect extreme and this

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.480 
hi guys this is connect extreme and this
in<00:00:03.899> my<00:00:03.929> connects<00:00:04.259> Hot<00:00:04.500> Wheels<00:00:04.770> machine

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
in my connects Hot Wheels machine

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.000 
in my connects Hot Wheels machine
I<00:00:05.810> sent<00:00:06.810> make<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.960> video<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.230> it<00:00:07.470> because<00:00:07.710> it

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
I sent make a video of it because it

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.459 
I sent make a video of it because it
doesn't<00:00:08.360> it<00:00:09.360> doesn't<00:00:09.570> really<00:00:09.690> work<00:00:09.990> too<00:00:10.019> well

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
doesn't it doesn't really work too well

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.970 
doesn't it doesn't really work too well
it's<00:00:10.950> just<00:00:11.190> there's<00:00:11.429> too<00:00:11.550> much<00:00:11.700> friction<00:00:11.969> and

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
it's just there's too much friction and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.320 
it's just there's too much friction and
as<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.190> see<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.490> needs<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.759> have<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.000> really

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
as you can see it needs to have a really

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.300 
as you can see it needs to have a really
long<00:00:15.900> thing<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.590> make<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.830> fluid<00:00:17.190> from

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
long thing just to make that fluid from

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.670 
long thing just to make that fluid from
the<00:00:17.430> jump<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.910> whatnot<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:19.020> pretty<00:00:19.230> cool<00:00:19.439> it

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the jump and whatnot it's pretty cool it

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.470 
the jump and whatnot it's pretty cool it
just<00:00:19.949> doesn't<00:00:20.910> work<00:00:20.970> because<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.210> way<00:00:21.270> Hot

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
just doesn't work because the way Hot

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.300 
just doesn't work because the way Hot
Wheels<00:00:21.689> track<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:22.050> designed<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.980> only<00:00:23.100> take

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
Wheels track is designed it's only take

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.830 
Wheels track is designed it's only take
the<00:00:23.430> wheels<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:24.510> edge<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the wheels just a little edge of the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.140 
the wheels just a little edge of the
wheels<00:00:25.050> are<00:00:25.140> touching<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.699> there's

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
wheels are touching and this one there's

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.880 
wheels are touching and this one there's
too<00:00:27.359> much<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.869> our<00:00:27.990> food<00:00:28.260> there's<00:00:28.650> too<00:00:28.769> much

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
too much in our food there's too much

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.049 
too much in our food there's too much
like<00:00:29.130> friction<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.900> side<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> car<00:00:32.059> or

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
like friction on the side of the car or

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.000 
like friction on the side of the car or
on<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.660> real<00:00:33.840> quick<00:00:35.149> so<00:00:36.739> yeah<00:00:37.739> I've<00:00:37.860> tried

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
on my like real quick so yeah I've tried

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.979 
on my like real quick so yeah I've tried
like<00:00:38.250> switching<00:00:38.579> track<00:00:38.850> around<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.809> whatnot

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
like switching track around and whatnot

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.590 
like switching track around and whatnot
you<00:00:40.770> know<00:00:40.800> doing<00:00:41.219> both<00:00:42.000> thick<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.570> doesn't

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you know doing both thick it doesn't

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200 
you know doing both thick it doesn't
really<00:00:42.899> matter<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.500> know<00:00:43.739> that's<00:00:44.210> constantly

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
really matter you know that's constantly

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.010 
really matter you know that's constantly
be<00:00:45.420> oiled<00:00:45.899> no<00:00:47.000> wd-40<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.420> actually<00:00:48.570> just

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
be oiled no wd-40 so I can actually just

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.040 
be oiled no wd-40 so I can actually just
make<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.289> run<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> turns<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.430> so

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
make it run in the turns what not so

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.930 
make it run in the turns what not so
here<00:00:52.050> I'll<00:00:52.140> show<00:00:52.320> ya<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:53.510> little<00:00:54.510> bit<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
here I'll show ya a little bit of it the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.830 
here I'll show ya a little bit of it the
lip<00:00:56.940> doesn't<00:00:57.239> work<00:00:57.329> too<00:00:57.449> well<00:00:57.480> there's<00:00:57.750> no

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
lip doesn't work too well there's no

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.810 
lip doesn't work too well there's no
sense<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.109> perfecting<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.730> know

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
sense of perfecting it because you know

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.110 
sense of perfecting it because you know
I'm<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.059> gonna<00:01:00.210> finish<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.640> say<00:01:02.640> even<00:01:02.940> then

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
I'm not gonna finish it so say even then

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.200 
I'm not gonna finish it so say even then
watch<00:01:03.480> yep<00:01:04.409> put<00:01:04.650> some<00:01:04.769> oil<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:08.180> it's<00:01:09.180> not

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
watch yep put some oil on it it's not

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.200 
watch yep put some oil on it it's not
very<00:01:09.330> consistent<00:01:09.840> either<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.650> see

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
very consistent either as you can see

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.980 
very consistent either as you can see
because<00:01:12.210> each<00:01:12.330> time<00:01:12.510> people<00:01:12.750> car<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
because each time people car is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
because each time people car is
different<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:17.490> doesn't<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.970> almost

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
different and so it doesn't they almost

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.800 
different and so it doesn't they almost
like<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.540> jump<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> same<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.650> try<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:19.979> one

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
like to jump the same and try this one

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.520 
like to jump the same and try this one
but<00:01:21.810> yes<00:01:22.229> he<00:01:23.180> probably<00:01:24.180> needs<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.509> oiled<00:01:24.780> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
but yes he probably needs to be oiled so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.609 
but yes he probably needs to be oiled so
we're<00:01:25.650> gonna<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.040> watch<00:01:26.130> them<00:01:27.740> now<00:01:29.299> yeah

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619

how it works now there you go
so<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.740> wasn't<00:02:16.860> too<00:02:17.040> bad<00:02:18.050> let's<00:02:19.050> try<00:02:19.320> this

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
so that wasn't too bad let's try this

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.100 
so that wasn't too bad let's try this
