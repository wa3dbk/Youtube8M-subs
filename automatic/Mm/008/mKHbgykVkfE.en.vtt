00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.900
 smartphone produced by samsung e 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.900
 belonging to the galaxy grande series 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.020
 samsung si sa loves a great tumor pro 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.800
 number of devices to be launched on 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.080
 market 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.540
 for this reason we have recently 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.620
 seen appearing samsung galaxy grande ad 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.030
 my plus or the enhanced version 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.510
 say in quotes of the samsung 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.300
 galaxy grande and in particular of the del 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 galaxy great god in this video then 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.489
 we see this the latest unboxing 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.900
 terminal just arrived on amazon in the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.030
 during the month of January 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.850
 then of course in the future we'll see 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.339
 a more in-depth review then 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.680
 packaging that slightly differs 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.140
 from what is the air pack printing 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.040
 and samsung so we have in particular 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.960
 one carton box not cardboard 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.260
 brown therefore not completely 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.670
 recyclable as can be all the various 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.979
 galaxy we have seen so far 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.400
 front with indication of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.260
 rear terminal nothing unique and data 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.630
 we find on the particular side the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.530
 screen you see 5 inch quad processor 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.969
 core and display size with the various 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.450
 camera details 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.579
 we continue in the boxing and we see that 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.640
 just remove the tab e 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.770
 automatically we access the terminal 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.200
 you see that first of all it is perfectly 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.399
 in line with all other terminals 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.799
 samsung and then rounded shapes cover 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.350
 back completely in plastic 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.590
 proscribed samsung camera flash led 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.490
 and reproducer but it is cover of course 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.030
 removable 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.020
 let us remember that the big galaxy is a 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.390
 single sim device with 5 display 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.030
 inches and quad core 1.2 processors 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.220
 gigahertz front we find the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.610
 characteristic center button as mentioned 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.460
 rounded corners with samsung writing 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.260
 frame sensors face and 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.960
 speaker for calls then 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.150
 you see that it is aesthetically an is 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.830
 clearly one of the many samsung 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.460
 that we have seen so far on 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.550
 market 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.140
 instead continuing in the boxing we have 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.900
 inside all the manuals of the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.070
 case with the charging cable 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.490
 power supply already connected to the micro 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:45.180
 usb so you won't need it strictly 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.150
 a cable like this micro usb usb for the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.480
 recharge but is also buried 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.150
 therefore useful for connecting the terminal 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.180
 computer or parallel use a 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.830
 another power supply to recharge it later 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.470
 features have been integrated 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.810
 headphones with microphone and of course 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.390
 as in all samsung we find the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.640
 battery disconnected from the rest of the del 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.230
 product and in particular we show you 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.970
 than a 2,100 milly ampere battery 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.770
 having said that we saw it quickly 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.410
 the contents of the original package 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.800
 del galaxy grande neo plus 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.850
 now we just have to try it e 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.850
