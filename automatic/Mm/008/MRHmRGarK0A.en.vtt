fabric turn it back in and voila so

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.360 
fabric turn it back in and voila so
before<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.359> leave<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.720> out<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.109> dry<00:02:41.290> there<00:02:42.100> is

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
before you leave it out to dry there is

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.819 
before you leave it out to dry there is
an<00:02:42.640> extra<00:02:42.940> step<00:02:43.000> 3<00:02:43.570> which<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.170> stuff<00:02:44.680> the

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
an extra step 3 which is to stuff the

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.280 
an extra step 3 which is to stuff the
shoe<00:02:45.070> with<00:02:45.280> newspaper<00:02:45.820> as<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.480> shoe<00:02:46.720> tends<00:02:47.170> to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
shoe with newspaper as the shoe tends to

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.819 
shoe with newspaper as the shoe tends to
shrink<00:02:47.590> when<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:48.100> dries<00:02:48.340> um<00:02:48.609> so<00:02:49.600> we<00:02:50.079> have<00:02:50.320> to

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
shrink when it dries um so we have to

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.610 
shrink when it dries um so we have to
stuff<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:51.820> as<00:02:51.970> much<00:02:52.150> as<00:02:52.299> possible<00:02:52.510> for<00:02:53.440> to

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
stuff it in as much as possible for to

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.030 
stuff it in as much as possible for to
stay<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:53.980> same<00:02:54.130> size

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.420
