two cables on the table this one is thin
this<00:00:23.970> one<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.300> well<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.410> kind<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.740> parallels

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
this one is well it's kind of parallels

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.929 
this one is well it's kind of parallels
fat<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.439> these<00:00:28.439> two<00:00:28.650> cables<00:00:29.070> are<00:00:29.189> exactly<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
fat and these two cables are exactly the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.519 
fat and these two cables are exactly the
same<00:00:29.970> all<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.080> one's<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.410> little

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
same all of this this one's a little

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.190 
same all of this this one's a little
more<00:00:31.800> expensive<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:33.180> made<00:00:33.450> for<00:00:33.660> air<00:00:33.899> flow

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
more expensive it's made for air flow

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.340 
more expensive it's made for air flow
within<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.620> case<00:00:35.000> this<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.180> fancier<00:00:36.690> cable<00:00:37.110> is

within the case this is fancier cable is

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.630 
within the case this is fancier cable is
fancier<00:00:37.800> version<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.399> one<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.570> now

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
fancier version of this one and now

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.340 
fancier version of this one and now
these<00:00:41.640> two<00:00:41.940> cables<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.079> thing<00:00:43.290> in

each one of these cables has three three

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.090 
each one of these cables has three three
different<00:00:48.899> connectors<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.500> there's<00:00:49.800> one

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
different connectors see there's one

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.840 
different connectors see there's one
there's<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.530> here<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.489> then<00:00:53.670> there's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
there's one right here and then there's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.430 
there's one right here and then there's
one<00:00:54.059> right<00:00:54.239> here<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.129> these<00:00:56.129> connectors

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
one right here and these connectors

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.670 
one right here and these connectors
determine<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.680> where<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> hard<00:00:59.910> drives<00:01:00.120> go

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
determine like where the hard drives go

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.080 
determine like where the hard drives go
first<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.800> need<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.980> identify<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:03.059> ones

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
first you need to identify which ones

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.679 
first you need to identify which ones
goes<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> hard<00:01:03.960> drives<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:06.390> notice

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
goes to the hard drives so you notice

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.179 
goes to the hard drives so you notice
that<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.990> first<00:01:07.320> two<00:01:07.530> are<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:07.830> close

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
that this first two are really close

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.969 
that this first two are really close
together<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> third<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
together and then the third one is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.670 
together and then the third one is
really<00:01:11.189> far<00:01:11.490> apart<00:01:12.049> this<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.470> far

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
really far apart this one that is far

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
really far apart this one that is far
apart<00:01:14.070> goes<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> motherboard<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
apart goes to the motherboard on the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.830 
apart goes to the motherboard on the
computer<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.610> these<00:01:17.909> ones<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
computer and these ones you know that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570 
computer and these ones you know that
are<00:01:18.960> close<00:01:19.200> together<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:20.130> one's<00:01:20.340> actually

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
are close together this one's actually

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.840 
are close together this one's actually
go<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> hard<00:01:21.600> drives<00:01:21.920> same<00:01:22.920> cases<00:01:23.400> this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
go to the hard drives same cases this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.870 
go to the hard drives same cases this
this<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.170> close<00:01:25.439> together

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
this one these two are close together

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.310 
this one these two are close together
this<00:01:26.880> one's<00:01:27.119> far<00:01:27.390> apart<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.990> goes<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
this one's far apart it goes to the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.609 
this one's far apart it goes to the
motherboard<00:01:29.720> on<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.869> very<00:01:31.140> important<00:01:31.560> thing

we'll be installing this connector which

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.789 
we'll be installing this connector which
is<00:01:38.579> call<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> master<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:40.140> will<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> first

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
is call a master which will be the first

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.010 
is call a master which will be the first
one<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:41.880> look<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> second<00:01:42.630> connector

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
one then we look at the second connector

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.620 
one then we look at the second connector
this<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.380> called<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.860> slave<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.360> for

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this is called a slave this will be for

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.569 
this is called a slave this will be for
like<00:01:45.780> let's<00:01:46.110> say<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.130> windows

like let's say you have your windows

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.730 
like let's say you have your windows
hard<00:01:47.850> drive<00:01:48.060> installed<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:49.350> want<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> have

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
hard drive installed you want to have

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.770 
hard drive installed you want to have
extra<00:01:50.159> storage<00:01:50.579> space<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.329> connect<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
extra storage space you will connect it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.830 
extra storage space you will connect it
to<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:53.390> finally<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.450> third<00:01:54.630> one

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
to this one and finally the third one

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840 
to this one and finally the third one
just<00:01:54.869> goes<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> motherboard<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.700> this

your hard drive determines where it goes
like<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.560> said<00:02:04.860> if<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.280> want<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.119> windows

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
like I said if you want if you windows

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419 
like I said if you want if you windows
hard<00:02:06.810> drive<00:02:07.020> crapped<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.129> need<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
hard drive crapped out and you need to

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.520 
hard drive crapped out and you need to
put<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> new<00:02:08.789> one<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.539> look<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.989> connector

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
put a new one you look on this connector

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.470 
put a new one you look on this connector
if<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.250> need<00:02:11.400> more<00:02:11.550> storage<00:02:11.849> ghost<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.360> this

if you need more storage ghost in this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.570 
if you need more storage ghost in this
one<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.989> if

one and if

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.400 
one and if
this<00:02:15.580> one<00:02:15.760> goes<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.150> motherboard<00:02:16.989> on<00:02:17.319> the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
this one goes to the motherboard on the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.830 
this one goes to the motherboard on the
computer
