00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.820
 Hey, people, I'll make the presentation. 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.989

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:41.300
 carli control which are six scripts like 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:44.660
 you can see six files there and he 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.770
 is used to open the doors of the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.980
 car 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.250

 only that it slowly opens a form 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.570
 Pretty slow is the best I've found 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.629
 that I used until today in my 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:09.380
 opinion is the best one that has to do the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:14.420

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.970
 number 1 to 6 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.720
 each number corresponds to a door 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:31.280
 according to the plus number 1 key and 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.800
 will open the back door on the side of the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.170
 driver 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.830
 then you can release the key plus it 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.590
 only serves to activate the keys work 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.540

 if you tighten 15 'obviously ship cap only 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.070
 that he slowly as you can see 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.110
 this is the time 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.540
