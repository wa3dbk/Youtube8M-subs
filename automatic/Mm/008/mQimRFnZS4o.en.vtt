from<00:00:03.450> junk<00:00:03.690> comm<00:00:04.200> I'm<00:00:04.920> here<00:00:05.190> today<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.490> talk

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
from junk comm I'm here today to talk

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.110 
from junk comm I'm here today to talk
about<00:00:06.200> some<00:00:07.200> various<00:00:08.189> little<00:00:08.460> things<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.820> found

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
about some various little things I found

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.320 
about some various little things I found
that<00:00:09.870> found<00:00:10.500> ways<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.950> improving<00:00:11.130> its<00:00:11.790> value

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
that found ways of improving its value

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.410 
that found ways of improving its value
by<00:00:12.480> removing<00:00:13.230> material<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.420> that's

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
by removing material and that's

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.550 
by removing material and that's
something<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.109> found<00:00:16.379> really

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
something that I found really

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.989 
something that I found really
interesting<00:00:16.859> thought<00:00:17.310> baby<00:00:17.519> probably<00:00:17.730> you'd

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:17.999 
interesting thought baby probably you'd

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.519 
interesting thought baby probably you'd
like<00:00:18.239> to<00:00:18.419> know<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.929> little<00:00:19.019> bit<00:00:19.230> more<00:00:19.380> about

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
like to know a little bit more about

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.859 
like to know a little bit more about
that<00:00:19.769> too<00:00:20.009> so<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.880> I've<00:00:20.999> done<00:00:21.149> is<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.509> have<00:00:21.839> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that too so what I've done is I have a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.439 
that too so what I've done is I have a
big<00:00:22.439> pile<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.009> these<00:00:23.189> LED<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.659> LCD<00:00:25.079> sorry<00:00:25.529> LCD

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
big pile of these LED or LCD sorry LCD

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.569 
big pile of these LED or LCD sorry LCD
displays<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:28.259> I<00:00:28.380> got<00:00:28.559> out<00:00:28.739> of<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.309> don't

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
displays that I got out of a I don't

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.299 
displays that I got out of a I don't
know<00:00:29.669> pile<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.179> junk<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.569> I<00:00:30.720> bought<00:00:30.899> and

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
know pile of junk that I bought and

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.830 
know pile of junk that I bought and
there<00:00:32.309> was<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.429> whole<00:00:32.609> bunch<00:00:32.789> of<00:00:32.879> these<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.269> said

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
there was a whole bunch of these I said

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.930 
there was a whole bunch of these I said
well<00:00:34.019> as<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.590> by<00:00:34.980> itself<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.519> looks<00:00:35.550> pretty

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
well as it's by itself it looks pretty

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.139 
well as it's by itself it looks pretty
interesting<00:00:36.559> looks<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.710> some<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.190> bit<00:00:39.030> of

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
interesting looks like some a bit of

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.579 
interesting looks like some a bit of
gold<00:00:39.359> on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> board<00:00:39.929> certainly<00:00:40.289> there's<00:00:40.530> some

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
gold on the board certainly there's some

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.939 
gold on the board certainly there's some
gold<00:00:40.859> pins<00:00:41.219> here<00:00:41.519> and<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:42.239> may<00:00:42.359> be<00:00:42.420> gold<00:00:43.230> on

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
gold pins here and it may be gold on

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.880 
gold pins here and it may be gold on
what<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.250> call<00:00:44.429> the<00:00:44.550> solder<00:00:44.820> mask<00:00:45.089> so<00:00:45.989> by

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
what they call the solder mask so by

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.340 
what they call the solder mask so by
itself<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.670> becomes<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.329> pretty<00:00:48.749> low-grade

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
itself it becomes a pretty low-grade

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.739 
itself it becomes a pretty low-grade
board<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:50.190> there's<00:00:50.879> no<00:00:50.999> real<00:00:51.210> components

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
board because there's no real components

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:53.079 
board because there's no real components
here<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.050> there's<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> lot<00:00:52.409> of<00:00:52.530> heavy<00:00:52.800> material

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
here but there's a lot of heavy material

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.790 
here but there's a lot of heavy material
that<00:00:54.089> something<00:00:54.870> doesn't<00:00:55.079> seem<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.409> with

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
that something doesn't seem right with

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.189 
that something doesn't seem right with
that<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.159> lot<00:00:56.249> of<00:00:56.280> metal<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.079> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that it's a lot of metal so what is it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.169 
that it's a lot of metal so what is it
what<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> do<00:00:58.679> to<00:00:58.800> take<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.039> off<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> let

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
what have to do to take that off and let

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.610 
what have to do to take that off and let
me<00:01:00.269> just<00:01:00.449> check<00:01:00.659> it<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:00.929> and<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.199> where<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.379> go

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
me just check it out and see where I go

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
me just check it out and see where I go
when<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.249> started<00:01:02.579> looking<00:01:02.879> at<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.269> pretty

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
when I started looking at it it's pretty

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.130 
when I started looking at it it's pretty
simple<00:01:03.569> to<00:01:04.220> take<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> off<00:01:05.570> these<00:01:06.570> little<00:01:06.869> pins

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
simple to take it off these little pins

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.230 
simple to take it off these little pins
here<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.250> particular<00:01:08.579> case<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
here in this particular case and of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.160 
here in this particular case and of
course<00:01:09.420> you'd<00:01:09.570> want<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.780> look<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.049> any

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
course you'd want to look at any

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.639 
course you'd want to look at any
material<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.640> but

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
material that you have for that but

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.649 
material that you have for that but
these<00:01:13.649> happen<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.399> just<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
these happen to have just little the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.630 
these happen to have just little the
metal<00:01:16.619> has<00:01:16.740> been<00:01:16.770> brought<00:01:17.130> through<00:01:17.159> here<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
metal has been brought through here and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.520 
metal has been brought through here and
twisted<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> had<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.500> just

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
twisted so all I had to do is just

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
twisted so all I had to do is just
straighten<00:01:20.040> them<00:01:20.159> up<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.549> I've<00:01:21.240> got<00:01:21.390> one<00:01:21.540> over

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
straighten them up and I've got one over

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.389 
straighten them up and I've got one over
here<00:01:21.719> that<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> don't<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> take<00:01:23.250> so

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
here that so I don't have to take so

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.130 
here that so I don't have to take so
much<00:01:23.490> time<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.299> well<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:24.899> this

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
much time on but well actually this

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.510 
much time on but well actually this
one's<00:01:25.350> coming<00:01:25.469> up<00:01:25.649> pretty<00:01:25.799> quick<00:01:25.950> maybe<00:01:26.340> I'll

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
one's coming up pretty quick maybe I'll

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.350 
one's coming up pretty quick maybe I'll
just<00:01:26.670> work<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:28.520> yeah<00:01:29.520> let's<00:01:29.969> just<00:01:30.149> do

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
just work with it and yeah let's just do

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910 
just work with it and yeah let's just do
that<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:31.049> work<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.799> I'm

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that I just work with the one that I'm

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.179 
that I just work with the one that I'm
I've<00:01:32.130> got<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.149> I<00:01:33.570> then<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.799> remove

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
I've got here and I then just remove

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.660 
I've got here and I then just remove
this<00:01:36.829> top<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.329> comes<00:01:39.509> off<00:01:39.659> pretty<00:01:39.960> simple

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
this top and it comes off pretty simple

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
this top and it comes off pretty simple
get<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> screwdriver<00:01:41.969> in<00:01:42.390> there<00:01:42.539> underneath<00:01:42.869> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
get a screwdriver in there underneath it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.020 
get a screwdriver in there underneath it
and<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.859> comes<00:01:44.070> off<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.640> needs<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.969> be

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
and that comes off then this needs to be

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.389 
and that comes off then this needs to be
cleaned<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.719> a<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:45.869> bit<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:47.130> little

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
cleaned up just a little bit this little

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
cleaned up just a little bit this little
bit<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.180> out<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.049> can

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
bit in here take it out and then I can

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.109 
bit in here take it out and then I can
throw<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.649> metal<00:01:49.920> pile<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
throw that in the metal pile and the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.120 
throw that in the metal pile and the
glass<00:01:51.359> can<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.350> over<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> glass<00:01:52.829> recycling

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
glass can go over in the glass recycling

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.270 
glass can go over in the glass recycling
and<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.380> there<00:01:55.380> goes<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.560> part<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.070> let's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and so there goes that part but let's

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.010 
and so there goes that part but let's
get<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.609> part<00:01:56.820> that's<00:01:57.000> got<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.600> good<00:01:57.780> money

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
get to the part that's got to good money

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.720 
get to the part that's got to good money
and<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:59.159> pop<00:01:59.609> this<00:01:59.820> little<00:01:59.880> thing

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
and we pop this little thing

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.360 
and we pop this little thing
and<00:02:03.500> I've<00:02:04.500> done<00:02:04.740> enough<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.190> them<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
and I've done enough of them that

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.999 
and I've done enough of them that
obviously<00:02:06.120> I<00:02:06.450> found<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.650> is<00:02:07.710> really

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
obviously I found that this is really

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.410 
obviously I found that this is really
good<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.430> look<00:02:08.520> at<00:02:08.670> all<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> nice<00:02:09.090> gold

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
good but look at all the nice gold

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.470 
good but look at all the nice gold
underneath<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.520> um<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.300> whole

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
underneath that and um the the whole

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.200 
underneath that and um the the whole
board<00:02:12.810> has<00:02:13.530> contacts<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.400> gold<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.030> does

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
board has contacts of gold and it does

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.630 
board has contacts of gold and it does
look<00:02:15.360> like<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.840> solder<00:02:16.080> mask<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.370> all

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
look like it's a solder mask that is all

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.360 
look like it's a solder mask that is all
gold<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.350> is<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.740> real<00:02:20.100> good

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
gold so this is going to be a real good

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.280 
gold so this is going to be a real good
one<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.640> process<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.330> probably<00:02:21.900> with<00:02:22.050> gold

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
one to process in probably with gold

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.400 
one to process in probably with gold
fingers<00:02:23.120> something<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:25.260> going

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
fingers something like that it's going

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.200 
fingers something like that it's going
to<00:02:25.500> be<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> pretty<00:02:25.920> easy<00:02:25.980> thing<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.580> process<00:02:27.090> so

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
to be a pretty easy thing to process so

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.460 
to be a pretty easy thing to process so
that's<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.600> go<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.810> my<00:02:27.930> keeper<00:02:28.260> box

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
that's going to go in my keeper box

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.130 
that's going to go in my keeper box
that's<00:02:28.770> for<00:02:29.010> sure<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.370> then<00:02:30.240> there's<00:02:31.050> a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
that's for sure and then there's a

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.110 
that's for sure and then there's a
little<00:02:31.290> piece<00:02:31.530> here<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.730> goes<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
little piece here this goes in the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.350 
little piece here this goes in the
plastic<00:02:33.600> recycle<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.880> little<00:02:36.150> piece

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
plastic recycle and in this little piece

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.630 
plastic recycle and in this little piece
also<00:02:37.080> has<00:02:37.500> quite<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.770> bit<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:37.980> gold<00:02:38.250> under<00:02:38.580> it

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
also has quite a bit of gold under it

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.420 
also has quite a bit of gold under it
it's<00:02:39.330> got<00:02:39.570> some<00:02:39.810> kind<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.290> jail<00:02:40.980> here<00:02:41.280> or

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
it's got some kind of a jail here or

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.690 
it's got some kind of a jail here or
something<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.420> all<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.170> down<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:44.070> has

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
something but all this down here has

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.110 
something but all this down here has
some<00:02:44.880> little<00:02:45.150> dots<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.690> all<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:47.580> gold<00:02:47.940> as

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
some little dots and all that is gold as

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.030 
some little dots and all that is gold as
well<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.410> going<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.590> be<00:02:49.709> some<00:02:49.890> real

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
well so this is going to be some real

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.670 
well so this is going to be some real
good<00:02:50.280> things<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.790> recover<00:02:51.540> with<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.140> look

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
good things to recover with and look

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.000 
good things to recover with and look
what<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.890> did<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.370> got<00:02:53.550> rid<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:54.590> bunch<00:02:55.590> of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
what I did is I got rid of a bunch of

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.550 
what I did is I got rid of a bunch of
metal<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.850> stuff<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.690> took<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:58.140> into<00:02:58.530> a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
metal and stuff and I took this into a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.130 
metal and stuff and I took this into a
much<00:02:58.800> higher<00:02:59.130> grade<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.630> course<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:00.990> is

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
much higher grade and of course this is

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.280 
much higher grade and of course this is
now<00:03:01.290> now<00:03:01.560> became<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.920> keeper<00:03:02.910> when<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.240> fact<00:03:03.720> not

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
now now became a keeper when in fact not

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.520 
now now became a keeper when in fact not
even<00:03:04.320> just<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.890> reseller<00:03:05.519> necessarily<00:03:06.269> but<00:03:07.170> if

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
even just a reseller necessarily but if

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.590 
even just a reseller necessarily but if
you<00:03:07.650> sold<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.070> this<00:03:08.459> would<00:03:08.670> be<00:03:08.820> certainly<00:03:09.209> go

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
you sold it this would be certainly go

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.009 
you sold it this would be certainly go
into<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.989> high-grade<00:03:10.440> board<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:12.780> piece

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
into the high-grade board and this piece

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.370 
into the high-grade board and this piece
probably<00:03:13.260> would<00:03:13.590> as<00:03:13.739> well<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.050> found

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
probably would as well so I found

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.300 
probably would as well so I found
another<00:03:16.620> one<00:03:16.800> here<00:03:17.070> that<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.959> else<00:03:19.290> LED<00:03:19.950> or

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
another one here that this else LED or

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.949 
another one here that this else LED or
LCD<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.760> keep<00:03:21.000> saying<00:03:21.180> LED<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.540> got<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> whole

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
LCD I keep saying LED I got a whole

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.900 
LCD I keep saying LED I got a whole
bunch<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.230> LEDs<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.860> another<00:03:23.130> load<00:03:23.370> over<00:03:23.610> there

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
bunch of LEDs in another load over there

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.090 
bunch of LEDs in another load over there
that<00:03:24.450> I'm<00:03:24.570> going<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.810> probably<00:03:25.500> do<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> video<00:03:25.950> on

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
that I'm going to probably do a video on

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.620 
that I'm going to probably do a video on
but<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.480> an<00:03:28.019> LCD<00:03:28.830> monitor<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:30.480> had<00:03:30.600> a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
but this is an LCD monitor and it had a

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.270 
but this is an LCD monitor and it had a
card<00:03:30.930> on<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.230> back<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.830> as<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.040> can<00:03:32.220> see

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
card on the back and as you can see

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.539 
card on the back and as you can see
again<00:03:32.549> nice<00:03:33.360> gold<00:03:33.720> traces<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.530> could<00:03:35.280> be<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
again nice gold traces and could be the

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.509

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
the heavy stuff and I took a card that

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.790 
the heavy stuff and I took a card that
was<00:04:24.130> worth<00:04:24.360> about<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.390> double<00:04:26.230> check<00:04:26.530> on<00:04:26.710> my

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
was worth about a double check on my

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.980 
was worth about a double check on my
pricing<00:04:27.310> while<00:04:27.460> ago<00:04:27.730> it's<00:04:28.300> worth<00:04:28.540> anywhere

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
pricing while ago it's worth anywhere

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.220 
pricing while ago it's worth anywhere
from<00:04:29.310> well<00:04:30.310> just<00:04:31.090> let's<00:04:31.390> say<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.720> range<00:04:31.960> was

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
from well just let's say the range was

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.030 
from well just let's say the range was
about<00:04:32.440> 15<00:04:32.919> cents<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.610> we<00:04:34.510> took<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:35.080> about<00:04:35.980> a

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
about 15 cents and we took it to about a

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.930 
about 15 cents and we took it to about a
27<00:04:36.940> cent<00:04:37.450> card<00:04:38.290> so<00:04:38.890> we<00:04:39.040> pretty<00:04:39.340> much<00:04:39.430> doubled

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
27 cent card so we pretty much doubled

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.530 
27 cent card so we pretty much doubled
its<00:04:40.270> value<00:04:40.810> by<00:04:41.410> removing<00:04:42.070> stuff<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:43.120> this

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
its value by removing stuff that this

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.409 
its value by removing stuff that this
now<00:04:43.840> can<00:04:44.050> go<00:04:44.230> over<00:04:44.500> into<00:04:44.650> my<00:04:45.060> breakage<00:04:46.060> pile

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
now can go over into my breakage pile

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.210 
now can go over into my breakage pile
and<00:04:46.750> iuck<00:04:46.960> sell<00:04:47.140> it<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.320> my<00:04:47.470> local<00:04:47.950> scrap
