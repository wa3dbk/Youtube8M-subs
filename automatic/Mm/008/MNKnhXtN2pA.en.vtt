00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.419
 I'm going to free wheel succeed myself 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.419
 I move so it's okay I'm still in it 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.289
 seven months ago he had a very bad one 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:18.359
 shoulder accident and there will be a 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.210
 particular moment not a little intense in 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.740
 which I did not know whether to continue or not 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.130
 the motivation dropped a lot , I got it 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.900
 of the time and this allowed me to 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.890
 rest to clear up my ideas and search 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.360
 to design something new 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.620
 this something new is the naga beard 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.449
 that in winter I am always a 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.570
 past passionate of mountain of 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.579
 8,000 meters to compare me with 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.739
 thin air then go more and more 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.840
 solemn and in the last three years, however, me 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.890
 I am more dedicated to technical mountaineering 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.050
 between Nepal and Pakistan and then India the year 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.730
 last in short with the patinated and the seed 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.280
 of madness this new open way 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.449
 own in alpine style 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.949
 for me this is a way of getting back on 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.560
 8 thousand to do it however with a particular way 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.750
 there is the most difficult season anymore 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.700
 impervious that hostile 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.710
 so the comparison is not so much the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 understand if 8,000 meters 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.210
 I'm fine but more than anything else if I can 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.060
 understand to accept winter and to give 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.030
 the best of me nanga parbat studio by 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.700
 three sides of amir rupal racchio 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.860
 the one chosen the amir is the first way 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.230
 that I would like to test and that of the keys 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.730
 Ofere I already climbed in 2008 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.440
 I know very well and that makes me star 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.830
 we still say on the line from 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.080
 follow 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.770
 however in the head or we say this desire 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.420
 to see if the descent of gunther rai 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.120
 not messner is that unfortunately ends in way 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.830
 tragic may be climb is 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.720
 clearly the history of mountaineering is 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.670
 the attempt of a world premiere so many 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 other styles have tried 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.470
 surely the story of moro the ruble 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.210
 he has been teaching a lot in recent years 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.980
 it happens to appreciate theirs 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.930
 tenacity at will and the ability to 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.190
 find the right glimpse of 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.290
 window for time to go up 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.320
 really unmotivated training all the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.400
 days and I bring something with me 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.350
 important is something that gives me 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.670
 really courage the desire to 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.590
 make this also moral ethics 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.780
 shipping a lot like another flag 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.120
 of human rights a flag they have 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.680
 8000 school children signed up 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.670
 I met here to meet 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.130
 together with the association of art and culture 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.630
 of rome to athens important because above 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.460
 of it the holidays the girls means 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.040
 accept and carry on the campaign 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.690
 you for human rights that arrives 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.080
 directly from America 30 rights 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.040
 recognized and that we say 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.080
 just sponsored by these guys 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.330
 their signature this pure energy that me 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.270
 I carry with me in a symbolic way and 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.510
 ethical on the summit of the nanga parbat parti 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.550
 wash the international team with me 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.250
 there will be federico santini who is a 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.320
 a cameraman a videomaker also some 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.930
 that will help me do the filming or 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.550
 however my theory in the first fields 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.530
 this international team will declare it 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.700
 officially on November 28th at 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.360
 Capitol in Rome 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.150
 11:30 because we say the agreements 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.180
 endings are being defined so there is a 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.400
 moment of knowledge of agreements of 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.350
 also choice of shared routes 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.680
 therefore everything will be produced on November 28th 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.680
