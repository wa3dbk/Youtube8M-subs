one and two quarterback are we're going
to<00:02:50.050> get<00:02:50.110> into<00:02:50.380> subjective<00:02:50.830> effects<00:02:51.220> now<00:02:52.180> as<00:02:52.480> we

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
to get into subjective effects now as we

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.360 
to get into subjective effects now as we
move<00:02:52.870> forward<00:02:53.110> because<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.740> numbers<00:02:54.070> are<00:02:54.100> so

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
move forward because the numbers are so

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.770 
move forward because the numbers are so
equal<00:02:54.760> they<00:02:54.880> do<00:02:54.940> things<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.920> well<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:58.000> now

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
equal they do things so well and now

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.720 
equal they do things so well and now
we're<00:02:58.960> have<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.260> get<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.560> subjective<00:03:00.130> what

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
we're have to get to subjective what
