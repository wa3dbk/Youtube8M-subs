and<00:01:10.310> although<00:01:11.310> most<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> subjects<00:01:12.930> were

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200

and although most of the subjects were
tough<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.670> believe<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.899> study

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
tough but I believe that if we study

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.130 
tough but I believe that if we study
hard<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.369> will<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.450> able<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:19.110> very
