00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.660
 also the red button but it is already 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.780
 all a mess of media but I program 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.850
 I recommend them with the browser and it will be 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.360
 going down normally as they always went down 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.220
 from mega 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.930
 once it's gone down we're going to 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.480
 the downloads folder and we'll have this 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.520
 winrar file and we're going to have to 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.950
 unzip it for that we need the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.810
 winrar program and here I leave a 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.800

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.550

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.170
 the white we accept 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.729
 that decompresses pretty fast good 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.650
 is that once it has been decompressed 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.119
 we are going to generate a folder to 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.100

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.960
 folder again today we have the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.210

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.140
 totally free so now we're going to 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.180
 what we are interested in is the counter 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.680

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.780

 He was left 11 program files 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.269

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.099
 green bar 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.099
 and once it's finished we give it to 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.849
 we uncheck the box that says install 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:44.920
 7 ideas and execute with a point of 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.920
 mark the market we give you to finalize

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.470
 dedicated dedicated server what 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.530
 we can eliminate that to play online 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.690
 the one that interests us is what it says with 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.700

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.010
