 hello dear guitarists me 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.830
 name is Ivan Sorokin I keep answering 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.170
 to questions of my many subscribers 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.320
 especially newbies interested in the issue of 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.289
 tom how to keep the pick so that it doesn't 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.189
 fell did not slip and clearly held 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.119
 many guitarists of different watts neurotransmitter 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:26.699
 but I will advise you how I hold him and so 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.040
 we clamp it between the index and 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.070
 thumb and put it on the bend 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.809
 index finger and top cover 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.559
 his thumb 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.640
 so you see a pick on you 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.539
 clearly fixed and he is nowhere 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.559
 slip and tip of the pick I'm 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.170
 leave see small 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.510
 as if big he will pop 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.199
 when we play when we hit about 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.080
 strings are also one of the main reasons 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.220
 the fact that the mediator is falling is small 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.619
 amount of practice 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.229
 play as many exercises as possible 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.750
 works then he you clearly 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.189
 to stick between the index and the big 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:22.259
 finger, too, when I started my dad 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.270
 gave them poison constantly but then as far as 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.400
 of how I learn but all new work 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.220
 he is already entrenched I donâ€™t pay 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.380
 attention to the right hand pick up for 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.329
 yourself such a position to you 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.369
 it was most convenient to keep the pick 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.369
 and that he was the continuation of the turret 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.159
 can also help if you will 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.030
 first play without a pick like this 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:54.040
 fold your fingers and play 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.040
 instead of a pick with the index finger 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.750
 this very well can help you for 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.080
 in order to understand the principle 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.150
 how to keep the media then it is 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.630
