forming<00:00:01.469> basic<00:00:01.890> shapes<00:00:03.200> what<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.230> want<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.500> do

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
forming basic shapes what I want to do

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.369 
forming basic shapes what I want to do
is<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.850> next<00:00:06.089> few<00:00:06.240> lectures<00:00:06.480> kind<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.259> go

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
is in the next few lectures kind of go

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.000 
is in the next few lectures kind of go
over<00:00:07.770> basic<00:00:08.130> shape<00:00:08.670> generation<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.840> why<00:00:10.800> it's

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
over basic shape generation and why it's

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.419 
over basic shape generation and why it's
so<00:00:11.070> important<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.700> because<00:00:12.259> I<00:00:13.259> noticed<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.280> have

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
so important is because I noticed I have

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.609 
so important is because I noticed I have
students<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:14.940> come<00:00:15.480> from<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.839> traditional<00:00:16.470> or

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
students that come from a traditional or

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.429 
students that come from a traditional or
background<00:00:17.190> where<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.480> learn<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.930> draw<00:00:19.199> from

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
background where you learn to draw from

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.439 
background where you learn to draw from
basic<00:00:20.010> shapes<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.670> those<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:21.029> students

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
basic shapes and those are students

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.900 
basic shapes and those are students
right<00:00:21.630> there<00:00:21.900> they<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.830> what<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.189> takes<00:00:23.550> to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
right there they have what it takes to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.570 
right there they have what it takes to
really<00:00:24.800> see<00:00:25.800> stuff<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.960> what<00:00:27.960> an<00:00:28.830> arm<00:00:29.279> is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
really see stuff like what an arm is

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.330 
really see stuff like what an arm is
made<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> okay<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.289> not<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.189> know

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
made out of okay it's not just you know

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.720 
made out of okay it's not just you know
the<00:00:32.880> complex<00:00:33.420> structure<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.440> forms<00:00:34.950> stuck

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the complex structure with forms stuck

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.209 
the complex structure with forms stuck
to<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.270> those<00:00:36.989> forms<00:00:37.350> automatically<00:00:37.980> made

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
to it and those forms automatically made

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.549 
to it and those forms automatically made
you<00:00:38.390> magically<00:00:39.390> appear<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> paper<00:00:40.200> it's

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
you magically appear on the paper it's

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.459 
you magically appear on the paper it's
its<00:00:41.250> form<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> baseball<00:00:42.510> bat<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
its form like with a baseball bat a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.529 
its form like with a baseball bat a
bowling<00:00:44.219> pin<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.899> a<00:00:45.899> baseball<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.539> those

bowling pin on a baseball and those

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.040 
bowling pin on a baseball and those
basic<00:00:49.079> shapes<00:00:49.289> go<00:00:49.530> together<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.899> person<00:00:51.899> can

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
basic shapes go together and person can

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.139 
basic shapes go together and person can
formulate<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.739> very<00:00:53.129> complex<00:00:53.699> form<00:00:54.059> down<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
formulate a very complex form down to a

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:04.189 
formulate a very complex form down to a
very<00:00:57.149> uncomplicated<00:01:02.030> e<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.170> know

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
how to take your basic shape this one

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.820 
how to take your basic shape this one
and<00:01:08.580> turn<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.299> into<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:10.439> bit<00:01:10.560> higher

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and turn it into a little bit higher

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.780 
and turn it into a little bit higher
basic<00:01:11.400> shape<00:01:11.610> forms<00:01:12.090> okay<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.460> i<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.580> an

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
basic shape forms okay so here i have an

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.539 
basic shape forms okay so here i have an
orc<00:01:14.939> helm<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.020> black<00:01:16.290> work<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.250> just

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
orc helm it's a black work i was just

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.480 
orc helm it's a black work i was just
kind<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.479> using<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.080> example<00:01:19.770> as<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> complex

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
kind of using it as example as a complex

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.359 
kind of using it as example as a complex
shape<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.869> got<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:23.009> got<00:01:23.159> our

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
shape so we got you know we got our

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.390 
shape so we got you know we got our
basic<00:01:23.850> spear<00:01:24.630> okay<00:01:25.170> made<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> helmet

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
basic spear okay made out of the helmet

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.179 
basic spear okay made out of the helmet
and<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.750> break<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.170> apart<00:01:28.380> real<00:01:28.920> quick

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and if I break this apart real quick

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.609 
and if I break this apart real quick
here<00:01:29.460> let's<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.060> i<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.390> polygons<00:01:31.259> mesh

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
here let's see if i go to polygons mesh

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.899 
here let's see if i go to polygons mesh
separate<00:01:33.290> edit<00:01:36.770> modify<00:01:37.770> center<00:01:38.400> pivot<00:01:38.670> there

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
separate edit modify center pivot there

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.420 
separate edit modify center pivot there
we<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.590> pivots<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.130> center

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
we go so now all the pivots are center

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.520 
we go so now all the pivots are center
so<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.060> i<00:01:42.150> look<00:01:42.180> at<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.630> how<00:01:43.049> its<00:01:43.290> put

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
so if i look at this how its put

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.710 
so if i look at this how its put
together<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.100> love<00:01:44.700> putting<00:01:45.030> together<00:01:45.240> things

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
together I love putting together things

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.600 
together I love putting together things
in<00:01:45.990> realistic<00:01:46.500> forms<00:01:47.159> okay<00:01:48.049> in<00:01:49.049> other<00:01:49.229> words

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
in realistic forms okay in other words

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.910 
in realistic forms okay in other words
this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:51.090> kind<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.170> would<00:01:52.200> probably<00:01:52.619> be

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
this is kind of how it would probably be

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.639 
this is kind of how it would probably be
put<00:01:53.159> together<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.360> was<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> realistic<00:01:55.290> item

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
put together if it was a realistic item

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.499 
put together if it was a realistic item
you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.250> got<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.640> thing<00:01:57.000> sitting<00:01:57.390> on

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you know you got this thing sitting on

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.590 
you know you got this thing sitting on
top<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.340> it's<00:01:59.340> got<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> pivot<00:01:59.880> point<00:01:59.909> back

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
top of this it's got a pivot point back

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.810 
top of this it's got a pivot point back
here<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.409> jaw<00:02:01.619> moves<00:02:01.950> up<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.219> down<00:02:02.340> using

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
here the jaw moves up and down using

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.870 
here the jaw moves up and down using
that<00:02:03.060> pivot<00:02:03.420> point<00:02:03.719> those<00:02:04.439> realistic<00:02:05.310> details

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
that pivot point those realistic details

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.020 
that pivot point those realistic details
really<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.689> add<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> lot<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.710> model

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
really do add a lot to the model

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.590 
really do add a lot to the model
it<00:02:09.649> allows<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.979> imagination<00:02:11.330> wander<00:02:12.330> quite<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
it allows the imagination wander quite a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.800 
it allows the imagination wander quite a
bit<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:15.020> here<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.230> basic<00:02:16.560> shape<00:02:16.800> goes<00:02:17.100> how

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
bit so here is the basic shape goes how

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.980 
bit so here is the basic shape goes how
do<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.080> get<00:02:19.740> something<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.990> into

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
do you get something like this into

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.890 
do you get something like this into
something<00:02:22.260> like<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:24.480> i'm<00:02:24.569> going<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.750> show

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
something like this so i'm going to show

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.350 
something like this so i'm going to show
you<00:02:24.930> several<00:02:25.260> methods<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.100> order<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.180> get

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360

you several methods in order to get
complex<00:02:28.050> shapes<00:02:28.350> right<00:02:28.800> now<00:02:29.010> maybe<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.430> black

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
complex shapes right now maybe a black

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.270 
complex shapes right now maybe a black
work<00:02:30.060> helm<00:02:30.360> but<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.440> know<00:02:31.560> just<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.040> tools

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
work helm but you know just the tools

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.180 
work helm but you know just the tools
necessary<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.330> able<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.720> pull<00:02:34.020> off<00:02:34.190> such

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
necessary to be able to pull off such

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.320 
necessary to be able to pull off such
things<00:02:35.489> as<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.730> screwed<00:02:36.270> on<00:02:36.390> curves<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:38.330> you

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
things as is screwed on curves and you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.840 
things as is screwed on curves and you
know<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:39.840> just<00:02:40.739> breaking<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.310> down<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.489> little

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
know just just breaking it down a little

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.140 
know just just breaking it down a little
bit<00:02:42.060> better<00:02:42.360> because<00:02:43.170> right<00:02:43.920> here<00:02:44.340> certainly

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
bit better because right here certainly

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.830 
bit better because right here certainly
that<00:02:45.360> was<00:02:45.810> an<00:02:46.019> extrude<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:46.560> curve<00:02:46.920> but<00:02:47.910> there

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that was an extrude on curve but there

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.180 
that was an extrude on curve but there
is<00:02:48.989> another<00:02:49.260> method<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.010> could<00:02:50.160> use

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
is another method that you could use

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.809 
is another method that you could use
along<00:02:50.700> with<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.920> then<00:02:52.920> how<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.190> tweak<00:02:53.640> it

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
along with it and then how to tweak it

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.650 
along with it and then how to tweak it
out<00:02:53.940> quite<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.540> bit<00:02:54.660> also<00:02:55.410> using<00:02:56.160> some

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
out quite a bit also using some

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.030 
out quite a bit also using some
manipulation<00:02:57.660> tools<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.260> are<00:02:58.290> animation

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
manipulation tools that are animation

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.250 
manipulation tools that are animation
the<00:02:59.489> animation<00:03:00.000> has<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.180> lot<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.540> deformers

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
the animation has a lot of deformers

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.009 
the animation has a lot of deformers
that<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.890> use<00:03:02.280> with<00:03:02.550> modeling<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.840> that's

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
that I use with modeling so that's

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.960 
that I use with modeling so that's
what's<00:03:04.290> coming<00:03:04.590> up<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.890> next<00:03:04.920> series<00:03:05.580> or

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
what's coming up in the next series or

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.290 
what's coming up in the next series or
section<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.540> lectures<00:03:07.110> here<00:03:07.730> starting<00:03:08.730> now<00:03:08.880> so

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
section of lectures here starting now so

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.470 
section of lectures here starting now so
go<00:03:09.569> on<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.989> next<00:03:10.170> video
