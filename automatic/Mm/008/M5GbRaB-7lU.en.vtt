the<00:00:17.490> new<00:00:17.580> Polaris<00:00:17.820> they<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.630> very<00:00:18.960> similar

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
the new Polaris they have very similar

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.620 
the new Polaris they have very similar
belt<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.859> article<00:00:20.850> had<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> similar

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
belt to this article had a similar

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.080 
belt to this article had a similar
system<00:00:21.960> like<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.439> as<00:00:22.650> well<00:00:23.000> we're<00:00:24.000> gonna

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
system like this as well we're gonna

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.120 
system like this as well we're gonna
probably<00:00:24.359> get<00:00:24.750> rid<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> about<00:00:25.109> 7<00:00:25.590> pounds<00:00:25.830> by

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
probably get rid of about 7 pounds by

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.950 
probably get rid of about 7 pounds by
putting<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.519> whole<00:00:26.670> thing<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.060> we've<00:00:27.810> got<00:00:27.930> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
putting this whole thing on we've got to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.349 
putting this whole thing on we've got to
set<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.380> chain<00:00:28.710> case<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.210> put

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
set this chain case up so we can put

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.870 
set this chain case up so we can put
this<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.720> now<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.529> also<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.949> same<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
this in now this is also the same as the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580 
this in now this is also the same as the
older<00:00:33.180> revs<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.960> use<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
older revs so you can use this in the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:51.889 
older revs so you can use this in the
some<00:00:35.160> 2003<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.090> revs<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:36.540> well<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:51.660> seal

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
some 2003 and up revs as well the seal

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.360 
some 2003 and up revs as well the seal
in<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.199> case<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.620> got<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.949> punched<00:00:53.250> out

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
in this case it's got to be punched out

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.889 
in this case it's got to be punched out
through<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> back

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899

pretty<00:02:14.260> much<00:02:14.349> use<00:02:14.650> synthetic<00:02:15.250> grease<00:02:15.430> for

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
pretty much use synthetic grease for

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.520 
pretty much use synthetic grease for
everything<00:02:15.940> now<00:02:16.090> I'm<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:16.870> gonna<00:02:16.989> Lube<00:02:17.349> up

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
everything now I'm just gonna Lube up

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.210 
everything now I'm just gonna Lube up
this<00:02:17.739> surface<00:02:18.579> here<00:02:18.849> where<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.650> seal<00:02:20.650> goes<00:02:20.920> in

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
this surface here where the seal goes in

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.620 
this surface here where the seal goes in
it'll<00:02:21.730> make<00:02:21.879> it<00:02:22.000> slip<00:02:22.209> in<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.420> little<00:02:22.450> easier

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
it'll make it slip in a little easier

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.910 
it'll make it slip in a little easier
it's<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.660> big<00:02:25.810> old<00:02:25.989> socket<00:02:26.440> give<00:02:26.650> her<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.769> couple

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
it's a big old socket give her a couple

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.009 
it's a big old socket give her a couple
tops<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.459> should<00:02:27.609> seat<00:02:27.819> right<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.120> there

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.920 

the<00:02:35.019> synthetic<00:02:35.260> grease<00:02:35.709> also<00:02:36.599> doesn't<00:02:37.599> mix

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
the synthetic grease also doesn't mix

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.679 
the synthetic grease also doesn't mix
with<00:02:38.109> water<00:02:38.379> I<00:02:39.150> guess<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.269> might<00:02:40.389> call<00:02:40.569> it

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
with water I guess you might call it

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.649 
with water I guess you might call it
immiscible<00:02:41.139> maybe<00:02:41.799> it<00:02:42.219> might<00:02:42.370> be<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.659> so

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
immiscible maybe it might be it so

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.089 
immiscible maybe it might be it so
that's<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.900> good<00:02:43.989> thing<00:02:44.049> it<00:02:44.620> won't<00:02:44.799> let<00:02:44.889> water

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
that's a good thing it won't let water

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:53.250 
that's a good thing it won't let water
in<00:02:45.249> here<00:02:45.579> it<00:02:45.639> won't<00:02:45.790> mix<00:02:45.999> with<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:52.260> that's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
in here it won't mix with it that's

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.520 
in here it won't mix with it that's
seated<00:02:53.650> all<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.799> way<00:02:53.980> around<00:02:55.469> now<00:02:56.469> the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
seated all the way around now the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.990 
seated all the way around now the
bearings<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:56.980> usually<00:02:57.340> go<00:02:57.459> in<00:02:57.609> this<00:02:57.730> case

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
bearings that usually go in this case

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.319 
bearings that usually go in this case
they<00:02:58.659> have<00:02:58.840> one<00:02:59.109> CL<00:02:59.650> out<00:02:59.769> of<00:02:59.919> them<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.849> that<00:03:01.030> is

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
they have one CL out of them and that is

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.170 
they have one CL out of them and that is
usually<00:03:01.780> pointing<00:03:02.739> outwards<00:03:03.189> so<00:03:03.340> eventually

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
usually pointing outwards so eventually

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.240 
usually pointing outwards so eventually
you<00:03:04.750> know<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.959> gear<00:03:05.169> lube<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.590> gear<00:03:05.769> oil<00:03:05.799> will

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
you know the gear lube the gear oil will

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.319 
you know the gear lube the gear oil will
work<00:03:06.489> its<00:03:06.669> way<00:03:06.730> through

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
work its way through

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.050 
work its way through
it'll<00:03:07.629> get<00:03:07.719> inside<00:03:08.109> behind<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.950> seal<00:03:09.699> here

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
it'll get inside behind the seal here

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.300 
it'll get inside behind the seal here
and<00:03:10.389> will<00:03:10.569> keep<00:03:10.689> everything<00:03:10.989> lubed<00:03:11.290> up<00:03:11.500> now

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
and will keep everything lubed up now

online I think this is off a 440 MMX
said<00:05:19.460> something<00:05:19.850> like<00:05:19.940> that<00:05:20.000> I<00:05:20.450> sent<00:05:21.200> it<00:05:21.350> in

said something like that I sent it in
had<00:05:22.220> these<00:05:22.430> little<00:05:22.880> holes<00:05:23.090> cut<00:05:23.420> in<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.600> rotor

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
had these little holes cut in the rotor

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.120 
had these little holes cut in the rotor
here<00:05:24.020> lighten<00:05:24.290> it<00:05:24.410> up<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:24.590> little<00:05:24.680> bit<00:05:24.920> more

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
here lighten it up a little bit more

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.800 
here lighten it up a little bit more
maybe<00:05:25.670> run<00:05:25.910> a<00:05:25.940> little<00:05:26.090> cooler<00:05:26.390> when<00:05:26.660> we're

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
maybe run a little cooler when we're

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.900 
maybe run a little cooler when we're
driving<00:05:27.170> this<00:05:27.800> is<00:05:27.950> what<00:05:28.100> came<00:05:28.280> off<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.700> sled

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
driving this is what came off the sled

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.580 
driving this is what came off the sled
no<00:05:29.480> there's<00:05:29.660> a<00:05:29.750> pretty<00:05:29.930> noticeable<00:05:30.230> weight

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
no there's a pretty noticeable weight

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.920 
no there's a pretty noticeable weight
difference<00:05:30.980> here<00:05:31.220> so<00:05:31.600> you<00:05:32.600> know<00:05:32.720> when<00:05:32.840> you

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
difference here so you know when you

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.230 
difference here so you know when you
have<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.140> heavy<00:05:33.770> rotating<00:05:34.550> mass<00:05:34.730> around<00:05:35.060> the

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
have a heavy rotating mass around the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.360 
have a heavy rotating mass around the
shaft<00:05:35.450> kind<00:05:36.410> of<00:05:36.500> slows<00:05:36.680> things<00:05:36.890> down<00:05:37.040> a<00:05:37.190> little

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
shaft kind of slows things down a little

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.520 
shaft kind of slows things down a little
bit<00:05:37.550> so<00:05:37.730> hopefully<00:05:37.850> this<00:05:38.300> will<00:05:38.390> make<00:05:38.540> us<00:05:38.720> a

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
bit so hopefully this will make us a

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.490 
bit so hopefully this will make us a
little<00:05:40.250> faster<00:05:41.050> make<00:05:42.050> sure<00:05:42.200> you<00:05:42.320> put<00:05:42.470> some

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
little faster make sure you put some

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.960 
little faster make sure you put some
anti-seize<00:05:43.040> compound<00:05:43.160> where<00:05:43.730> the<00:05:43.790> brake

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
anti-seize compound where the brake

00:05:43.970 --> 00:06:26.910 
anti-seize compound where the brake
rotor<00:05:44.210> seats

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.250 

the<00:06:27.920> axle<00:06:28.220> shaft<00:06:28.430> is<00:06:28.640> in<00:06:28.850> the<00:06:29.450> jack<00:06:29.690> shaft<00:06:29.960> is

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
the axle shaft is in the jack shaft is

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.990 
the axle shaft is in the jack shaft is
in<00:06:30.290> the<00:06:30.710> chain<00:06:30.920> case<00:06:31.100> is<00:06:31.310> bolted<00:06:31.670> into<00:06:31.820> place

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
in the chain case is bolted into place

in the chain case is bolted into place
the<00:06:32.390> track<00:06:32.600> is<00:06:32.780> in<00:06:32.960> obviously<00:06:33.530> I<00:06:33.740> got<00:06:34.160> the

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
the track is in obviously I got the

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.490 
the track is in obviously I got the
brake<00:06:34.430> on<00:06:34.670> the<00:06:35.030> brake<00:06:35.210> master<00:06:35.420> is<00:06:35.690> on<00:06:35.870> pretty

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
brake on the brake master is on pretty

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.050 
brake on the brake master is on pretty
much<00:06:36.680> everything<00:06:36.980> up<00:06:37.130> until<00:06:37.310> this<00:06:37.490> point<00:06:37.580> has

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
much everything up until this point has

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.750 
much everything up until this point has
been<00:06:38.090> just<00:06:38.630> the<00:06:38.960> standard<00:06:39.410> procedure<00:06:39.860> now

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
been just the standard procedure now

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.860 
been just the standard procedure now
we're<00:06:40.970> going<00:06:41.060> to<00:06:41.120> start<00:06:41.360> with<00:06:41.630> the

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
we're going to start with the

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.020 
we're going to start with the
installation<00:06:42.590> of<00:06:42.680> the<00:06:43.250> belt<00:06:43.460> and<00:06:43.670> the<00:06:43.730> gears

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
installation of the belt and the gears

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.740 
installation of the belt and the gears
and<00:06:44.300> the<00:06:44.480> idler<00:06:44.780> tension<00:06:45.170> system
