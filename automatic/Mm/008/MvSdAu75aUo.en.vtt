00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.600
 Many of you are going to be interested 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.340
 first of all to announce each other in the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.680
 new narnia movie that will be titled 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.300

 this new movie is said to 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.630
 will debut in 2015 or 2016 not yet 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.880
 we have nothing confirmed but the movie 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.950
 it is already a fact we do not know what it will be 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.780
 who are going to be the actors but it is already 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.520
 a fact that this film will be made 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.260
 and after the blockbuster of the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.180
 dragon ball movie that by the way to 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.980
 I did not like this good but 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.330
 well judge you 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.800
 let's go dragonball aside and what 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.690
 important is that a 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.880
 movie of the knights of the zodiac 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.230
 just as you are listening to it 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.150
 movie of the knights of the zodiac 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.620
 this series that is a little older 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.420
 that dragon ball but it was more or less 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.340
 as contemporary saw the same type 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.840
 of public is a super successful animal 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.580
 that marked the childhood of many 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.290
 people like dragon ball did not 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.910
 is completely confirmed but it is 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.770
 practically a fact that such a 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.090
 this movie in 2014 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.960
 so if you are fans of 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.850
 no one 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.160
 I'm here because you can be happy 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.690
 now let's move on to video games and 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.550
 I pretend that from the first day of 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.140
 October is to say yesterday is already 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.360

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.130

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.870
 online this game mode that 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.060
 everyone also been waiting for 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.980
 be able to kill people with 15 more people 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.690
 on your same television as you 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.850
 mentioned could connect 16 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.320
 players is 15 and you will not be able 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.090
 perform missions but you can do 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.880
 practically everything else you can steal 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.860
 banks dance steal cars what 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.030
 you want to do and you can even make 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.470
 small transactions 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.450
 if you want to download this update 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.160
 the only thing you have to have connect 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.270
 your device to the internet and put the 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.620
 game and it will be updated 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.480
 practically only you just have to 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.460
 confirm the download despite 59 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.080
 megabytes and it's completely worth it 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.700
 the players are complaining some 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.800
 small mistakes but it is to be understood 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.510
 in the network they must be super saturated 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.130
 I am very sure that in a very future 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.140
 near you observe it can improve this 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.490

 Interesting youtube together they were more or 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.209
 less equality the concept that the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.040
 television of an awards ceremony what 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.900
 You think just like every year 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.489

 which are the most valuable brands of 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.019
 2013 last year the most valuable brand 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.970
 it was google but already the most this year 2013 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.669
 first of all we find blue with a 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.900
 value of 98 trillion dollars 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.180
 second place is under a position 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.580
 we found the google with a total of 93 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.270

 beat google the internet giant 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.810
 surely in the next few years that 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 google is doing a lot of things 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.620
 in order to have the domain that I had 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.240
