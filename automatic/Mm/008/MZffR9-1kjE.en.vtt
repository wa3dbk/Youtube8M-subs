different compiles for stockfish and the
question<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.359> i<00:00:24.600> get<00:00:24.660> asked<00:00:25.019> most<00:00:25.410> often<00:00:25.740> on

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
question that i get asked most often on

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.150 
question that i get asked most often on
my<00:00:26.160> forum<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.060> which<00:00:27.840> version<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.590> need<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
my forum is which version do I need to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.849 
my forum is which version do I need to
install<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.910> my<00:00:29.939> computer<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.230> quick<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
install on my computer the quick and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.770 
install on my computer the quick and
simple<00:00:31.920> answer<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.759> question<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.540> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
simple answer to that question is is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.930 
simple answer to that question is is
that<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> depends<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> instruction<00:00:35.610> sets

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
that it depends on the instruction sets

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.720 
that it depends on the instruction sets
