over South Carolina makes out a game at
the<00:02:13.820> end<00:02:13.970> UCF<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.110> 270<00:02:15.770> plus<00:02:15.950> yard<00:02:16.220> passes<00:02:16.700> so

the end UCF it's 270 plus yard passes so

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.030 
the end UCF it's 270 plus yard passes so
the<00:02:17.630> linebackers<00:02:18.200> youth<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.620> still<00:02:18.830> showing

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the linebackers youth is still showing

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.670 
the linebackers youth is still showing
through<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.790> secondary<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:21.200> guys<00:02:21.350> aren't

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
through the secondary the guys aren't

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.140 
through the secondary the guys aren't
playing<00:02:21.770> very<00:02:22.100> well<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.430> run<00:02:22.580> support<00:02:22.970> and

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
playing very well and run support and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.340 
playing very well and run support and
certainly<00:02:23.510> they're<00:02:23.690> giving<00:02:23.900> up<00:02:24.020> some<00:02:24.200> big

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
certainly they're giving up some big

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.010 
certainly they're giving up some big
plays<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.890> think<00:02:25.190> safety<00:02:25.520> in<00:02:25.970> particular<00:02:26.660> has

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
plays I think safety in particular has

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.360 
plays I think safety in particular has
been<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.260> bigger<00:02:27.440> issue<00:02:27.650> than<00:02:27.920> cornerback

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
been the bigger issue than cornerback

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.190 
been the bigger issue than cornerback
because<00:02:28.670> Victor<00:02:28.940> Hampton<00:02:29.090> Jimmy<00:02:29.600> Legree<00:02:29.810> I

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
because Victor Hampton Jimmy Legree I

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.350 
because Victor Hampton Jimmy Legree I
think<00:02:30.590> they<00:02:30.680> both<00:02:30.710> played<00:02:31.100> really<00:02:31.880> well<00:02:32.000> this

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
think they both played really well this

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.150 
think they both played really well this
past<00:02:32.540> games<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.110> let's<00:02:33.500> see<00:02:33.770> if<00:02:33.860> there's<00:02:34.010> going

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
past games so let's see if there's going

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.760 
past games so let's see if there's going
to<00:02:34.220> be<00:02:34.250> any<00:02:34.340> sort<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.820> changes<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:36.320> in<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
to be any sort of changes and in the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.770 
to be any sort of changes and in the
secondary<00:02:37.220> I'm<00:02:37.430> really<00:02:37.640> not<00:02:37.760> sure<00:02:37.820> yet<00:02:38.180> now

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
secondary I'm really not sure yet now

upperclassman moved to free safety

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.450 
upperclassman moved to free safety
before<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.930> season<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.530> he's<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.190> guy<00:03:07.430> that's

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
before the season and he's a guy that's

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.710 
before the season and he's a guy that's
counted<00:03:07.970> on<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.090> be<00:03:08.300> one<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.600> more

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.120 
counted on to be one of the more
productive<00:03:09.170> players<00:03:09.440> but<00:03:09.770> I<00:03:09.830> don't<00:03:09.980> think

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
productive players but I don't think

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.160 
productive players but I don't think
he's<00:03:10.370> really<00:03:10.550> lived<00:03:10.910> up<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.330> so<00:03:11.750> far<00:03:11.990> this

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
he's really lived up to that so far this

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.200 
he's really lived up to that so far this
season<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.830> think<00:03:13.250> anybody<00:03:13.610> on<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.880> team<00:03:13.910> would

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
season I think anybody on the team would

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.240 
season I think anybody on the team would
admit<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:14.930> he's<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> guy<00:03:15.830> that<00:03:15.860> they<00:03:16.070> need

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
admit that so he's a guy that they need

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.370 
admit that so he's a guy that they need
to<00:03:16.340> step<00:03:16.610> up<00:03:16.820> will<00:03:17.210> it<00:03:17.330> be<00:03:17.450> personnel<00:03:17.990> changes

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
against UCF what do the Gamecocks need

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.280 
against UCF what do the Gamecocks need
to<00:03:57.860> do<00:03:58.010> in<00:03:58.280> practice<00:03:58.490> this<00:03:58.850> week<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.690> come<00:04:00.080> out

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
to do in practice this week to come out

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.350 
to do in practice this week to come out
with<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.650> little<00:04:00.950> more<00:04:01.610> spring<00:04:02.030> in<00:04:02.060> their<00:04:02.300> step

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
with a little more spring in their step

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.170 
with a little more spring in their step
than<00:04:02.870> they<00:04:03.020> did<00:04:03.080> against<00:04:03.590> UCF<00:04:04.100> I<00:04:04.430> think<00:04:04.910> the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
than they did against UCF I think the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.140 
than they did against UCF I think the
offensive<00:04:05.570> game<00:04:05.960> planning<00:04:06.310> will<00:04:07.310> just<00:04:07.550> be<00:04:07.730> you

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
offensive game planning will just be you

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.700 
offensive game planning will just be you
know<00:04:08.270> really<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:09.110> look<00:04:09.290> at<00:04:09.410> how<00:04:09.530> they

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
know really that you look at how they

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.080 
know really that you look at how they
did<00:04:09.860> against<00:04:10.100> Vanderbilt<00:04:10.610> they<00:04:10.820> use<00:04:11.060> a

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
did against Vanderbilt they use a

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.660 
did against Vanderbilt they use a
different<00:04:11.660> style<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:12.080> offense<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:13.280> that's

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
different style of offense and that's

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.100 
different style of offense and that's
how<00:04:13.790> they<00:04:13.940> tried<00:04:14.180> to<00:04:14.330> open<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.630> game<00:04:14.840> against

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
how they tried to open the game against

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.080 
how they tried to open the game against
UCF<00:04:15.620> didn't<00:04:15.980> have<00:04:16.070> as<00:04:16.190> much<00:04:16.220> success<00:04:16.520> so<00:04:16.970> they

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
UCF didn't have as much success so they

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.250 
UCF didn't have as much success so they
switch<00:04:17.330> things<00:04:17.540> up<00:04:17.720> they<00:04:17.900> had<00:04:18.020> a<00:04:18.049> lot<00:04:18.230> more

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
switch things up they had a lot more

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.530 
switch things up they had a lot more
success<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.760> I'm<00:04:19.940> not<00:04:20.060> sure<00:04:20.120> what<00:04:20.299> the

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
success so I'm not sure what the

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.060 
success so I'm not sure what the
offensive<00:04:20.840> game<00:04:21.140> plan<00:04:21.169> will<00:04:21.470> look<00:04:21.620> like<00:04:21.799> but<00:04:21.980> I

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
offensive game plan will look like but I

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.380 
offensive game plan will look like but I
do<00:04:22.130> think<00:04:22.370> they<00:04:22.520> can<00:04:22.669> score<00:04:22.850> points<00:04:22.910> on

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
do think they can score points on

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.680 
do think they can score points on
Kentucky<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.440> biggest<00:04:24.620> concern<00:04:25.070> is<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:25.280> on

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
Kentucky the biggest concern is just on

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.810 
Kentucky the biggest concern is just on
defense<00:04:26.010> Kentucky<00:04:27.010> doesn't<00:04:27.370> have<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> great

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
defense Kentucky doesn't have a great

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.550 
defense Kentucky doesn't have a great
offense<00:04:28.240> but<00:04:28.480> they've<00:04:28.600> got<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.750> couple<00:04:29.020> capable

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
offense but they've got a couple capable

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.290 
offense but they've got a couple capable
quarterbacks<00:04:30.010> that<00:04:30.130> they'll<00:04:30.340> use<00:04:30.550> they<00:04:31.180> have

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
quarterbacks that they'll use they have

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.030 
quarterbacks that they'll use they have
some<00:04:31.480> capable<00:04:31.900> receivers<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.650> running<00:04:32.680> back

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
some capable receivers and running back

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.880 
some capable receivers and running back
so<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:34.450> biggest<00:04:34.750> concern<00:04:35.080> will<00:04:35.260> be<00:04:35.290> getting

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
so the biggest concern will be getting

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.680 
so the biggest concern will be getting
off<00:04:35.980> field<00:04:36.310> on<00:04:36.430> third<00:04:36.610> down<00:04:36.880> trying<00:04:37.420> to<00:04:37.510> fix
