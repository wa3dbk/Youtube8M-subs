from like breaking the news that's the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.780 
from like breaking the news that's the
only<00:00:34.780> way<00:00:34.900> you<00:00:34.960> can<00:00:35.080> get<00:00:35.230> a<00:00:35.290> nurse<00:00:35.890> sorry<00:00:36.700> i'll

continue there's brown things that are
and<00:00:40.870> I<00:00:40.900> guess<00:00:41.379> holders<00:00:41.830> for<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.070> bananas<00:00:42.550> or

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
and I guess holders for the bananas or

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.460 
and I guess holders for the bananas or
something<00:00:42.970> as<00:00:43.090> you<00:00:43.180> can<00:00:43.330> see<00:00:43.480> over<00:00:43.900> there<00:00:44.080> and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
something as you can see over there and

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.869 
something as you can see over there and
then<00:00:45.160> when<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:45.430> break<00:00:45.760> it<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.860> banana<00:00:48.309> comes<00:00:48.730> it

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
then when you break it a banana comes it

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.440 
then when you break it a banana comes it
it<00:00:49.329> can<00:00:49.510> either<00:00:49.600> be<00:00:49.720> a<00:00:49.840> raw<00:00:50.140> or<00:00:50.500> a<00:00:50.560> ripe<00:00:51.070> banana

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
it can either be a raw or a ripe banana

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.760 
it can either be a raw or a ripe banana
Oh<00:00:52.500> two<00:00:53.500> bananas<00:00:53.860> I<00:00:54.010> think<00:00:54.220> oh<00:00:54.370> no<00:00:55.380> but<00:00:56.380> yeah

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
Oh two bananas I think oh no but yeah

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.280 
Oh two bananas I think oh no but yeah
I've<00:00:57.700> never<00:00:58.030> gone<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.300> Robin<00:00:58.720> any<00:00:58.840> yet<00:00:59.020> so<00:00:59.200> I'm

I've never gone to Robin any yet so I'm

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.450 
I've never gone to Robin any yet so I'm
guessing<00:00:59.530> it's<00:00:59.800> fairly<00:01:00.190> uncommon<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:02.590> yeah

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
guessing it's fairly uncommon but yeah

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.520 
guessing it's fairly uncommon but yeah
there's<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.880> cherry<00:01:04.180> blossom<00:01:04.660> tree<00:01:04.899> just<00:01:05.380> as

to<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.890> other<00:02:21.890> way<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.190> make<00:02:22.400> cake<00:02:22.640> unless

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
to the other way you make cake unless

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.550 
to the other way you make cake unless
and<00:02:23.330> they<00:02:23.570> might<00:02:23.750> have<00:02:23.870> changed<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.410> give

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
and they might have changed it to give

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.960 
and they might have changed it to give
you<00:02:24.680> your<00:02:24.800> buckets<00:02:25.160> back<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.460> don't<00:02:25.640> think<00:02:25.820> so

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
you your buckets back I don't think so

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:35.290 
you your buckets back I don't think so
though<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.870> here<00:02:33.230> we<00:02:33.380> have<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.950> equal<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.640> tree

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
though so here we have the equal a tree

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.730 
though so here we have the equal a tree
or<00:02:35.450> something<00:02:35.510> i'm<00:02:35.840> sorry<00:02:36.110> i<00:02:36.170> really<00:02:36.470> don't

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
or something i'm sorry i really don't

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.980 
or something i'm sorry i really don't
know<00:02:36.770> how<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:36.980> pronounce<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.750> yeah<00:02:38.750> basically

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
know how to pronounce it yeah basically

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.680 
know how to pronounce it yeah basically
it's<00:02:39.260> just<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.470> big<00:02:39.709> hollow<00:02:40.040> tree<00:02:40.690> nothing

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
it's just a big hollow tree nothing

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.330 
it's just a big hollow tree nothing
really<00:02:41.930> else<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:43.010> one<00:02:43.190> actually

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
really else to it this one actually

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.420 
really else to it this one actually
isn't<00:02:43.670> as<00:02:43.880> big<00:02:44.180> as<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.540> other<00:02:44.570> one<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.840> found

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
isn't as big as the other one I found

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.430 
isn't as big as the other one I found
yeah<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.940> was<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.570> was<00:02:47.690> pretty<00:02:47.870> hard<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.170> find

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
yeah it was it was pretty hard to find

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.640 
yeah it was it was pretty hard to find
the<00:02:48.590> other<00:02:48.620> one<00:02:49.720> like<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.260> one<00:02:51.440> wasn't

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
the other one like and this one wasn't

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.220 
the other one like and this one wasn't
too<00:02:51.890> far<00:02:52.160> from<00:02:52.190> this<00:02:52.520> fall<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:52.820> I<00:02:52.910> guess<00:02:53.230> just

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
too far from this fall and I guess just

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.170 
too far from this fall and I guess just
random<00:02:54.890> because<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.430> doesn't<00:02:55.700> even<00:02:55.760> seem<00:02:56.000> to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
random because it doesn't even seem to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.090 
random because it doesn't even seem to
be<00:02:56.300> in<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.540> same<00:02:56.810> volume<00:02:57.110> as<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.650> other<00:02:57.920> one

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
be in the same volume as the other one

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.970 
be in the same volume as the other one
was<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:58.880> don't<00:02:59.780> know<00:02:59.959> how<00:03:00.680> where<00:03:00.860> they

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
was so I don't know how where they

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.210 
was so I don't know how where they
spawned<00:03:01.400> or<00:03:01.550> anything<00:03:01.820> like<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:02.440> yeah<00:03:03.440> don't

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
spawned or anything like that yeah don't

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.730 
spawned or anything like that yeah don't
think<00:03:04.880> I'm<00:03:05.000> going<00:03:05.240> to<00:03:05.330> go<00:03:05.480> up<00:03:05.840> there<00:03:06.140> it's<00:03:06.530> just

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
think I'm going to go up there it's just

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.550 
think I'm going to go up there it's just
basically<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.220> normal<00:03:07.610> tree<00:03:08.350> yeah<00:03:09.350> that's

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
basically a normal tree yeah that's

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.670 
basically a normal tree yeah that's
dollars<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.730> show<00:03:10.910> for<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.300> one<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.750> still

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
dollars to show for this one I still

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.740 
dollars to show for this one I still
have<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.190> find<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.640> apple<00:03:14.060> tree<00:03:14.360> which<00:03:14.600> I

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
have to find the apple tree which I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.940 
have to find the apple tree which I
can't<00:03:15.170> seem<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.530> find

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.890 

all<00:03:19.520> right<00:03:19.670> well<00:03:19.879> I'm<00:03:20.000> about<00:03:20.270> ready<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.660> give

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
all right well I'm about ready to give

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.199 
all right well I'm about ready to give
up<00:03:20.959> looking<00:03:21.290> for<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.709> apple<00:03:22.099> tree<00:03:22.250> here<00:03:22.459> I've

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
up looking for this apple tree here I've

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.080 
up looking for this apple tree here I've
been<00:03:23.300> looking<00:03:23.360> for<00:03:23.810> about<00:03:24.310> six<00:03:25.310> minutes<00:03:25.489> five

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
been looking for about six minutes five

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.460 
been looking for about six minutes five
minutes<00:03:26.410> can't<00:03:27.410> seem<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.160> find<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.900> clearly

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
minutes can't seem to find it so clearly

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.970 
minutes can't seem to find it so clearly
they<00:03:30.800> need<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.099> make<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.519> more<00:03:31.879> frequent<00:03:32.980> the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
they need to make this more frequent the

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.970 
they need to make this more frequent the
apple<00:03:34.280> tree<00:03:34.430> spawning<00:03:34.819> more<00:03:35.090> frequently<00:03:35.980> it's

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
apple tree spawning more frequently it's

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.300 
apple tree spawning more frequently it's
turning<00:03:37.370> night<00:03:37.670> now<00:03:38.530> what<00:03:39.530> I'm<00:03:39.650> going<00:03:39.860> to<00:03:39.980> do

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
turning night now what I'm going to do

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.759 
turning night now what I'm going to do
is<00:03:42.670> generate<00:03:43.670> one<00:03:44.150> more<00:03:44.330> world<00:03:44.569> and<00:03:44.810> see<00:03:45.319> what

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
is generate one more world and see what

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.280 
is generate one more world and see what
happens<00:03:46.569> so<00:03:47.569> I'll<00:03:47.930> be<00:03:48.019> right<00:03:48.170> back<00:03:50.110> alright<00:03:51.110> so

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
happens so I'll be right back alright so

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.610 
happens so I'll be right back alright so
I<00:03:51.319> just<00:03:51.560> generated<00:03:52.099> a<00:03:52.250> new<00:03:52.280> world<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.620> it

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
I just generated a new world and it

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.530 
I just generated a new world and it
doesn't<00:03:55.190> seem<00:03:55.640> like<00:03:55.910> there's<00:03:56.090> an<00:03:56.180> apple<00:03:56.420> tree

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
doesn't seem like there's an apple tree

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.559 
doesn't seem like there's an apple tree
around<00:03:56.810> here<00:03:57.079> either<00:03:57.349> i<00:03:57.560> have<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.069> enabled

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
around here either i have it enabled

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.890 
around here either i have it enabled
I've<00:03:59.569> seen<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.200> or<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.410> saw<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:00.739> earlier<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:01.900> I

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
I've seen it or I saw it earlier and I

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.259 
I've seen it or I saw it earlier and I
can't<00:04:03.440> find<00:04:03.799> it<00:04:04.010> again<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.370> have<00:04:04.640> no<00:04:05.060> clue

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
can't find it again I have no clue

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.250 
can't find it again I have no clue
what's<00:04:05.480> up<00:04:05.599> with<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:07.959> really<00:04:08.959> don't<00:04:09.079> know

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
what's up with that I really don't know

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.559 
what's up with that I really don't know
actually<00:04:09.739> oh<00:04:10.040> there's<00:04:10.700> an<00:04:10.880> apple<00:04:11.150> tree<00:04:11.239> what

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
actually oh there's an apple tree what

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.810 
actually oh there's an apple tree what
do<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.690> know

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.180 

yeah<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:18.570> think<00:04:18.930> everything<00:04:19.290> else<00:04:19.590> has<00:04:19.770> a<00:04:19.830> good

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
yeah I think everything else has a good

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.810 
yeah I think everything else has a good
spawning<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.810> gum<00:04:22.400> generating<00:04:23.400> rate<00:04:23.640> or

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
spawning the gum generating rate or

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.090 
spawning the gum generating rate or
whatever<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.210> call<00:04:24.420> it<00:04:24.450> but<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.590> apple<00:04:25.890> trees

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
whatever you call it but the apple trees

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.650 
whatever you call it but the apple trees
definitely<00:04:26.670> need<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.910> be<00:04:27.030> more<00:04:27.180> frequent

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
definitely need to be more frequent

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.760 
definitely need to be more frequent
because<00:04:28.320> I<00:04:28.560> walked<00:04:29.550> quite<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.570> far<00:04:31.110> ways<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.710> I

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
because I walked quite a far ways and I

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.230 
because I walked quite a far ways and I
was<00:04:31.920> in<00:04:31.950> a<00:04:32.070> boat<00:04:32.280> for<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.580> while<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.940> just

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
was in a boat for a while to just
