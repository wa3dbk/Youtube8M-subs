00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.030

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.530
 school is done I hope you go 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.300
 well 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.820
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.310
 autumn tutorial it's the sun that 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.220
 was inspired by the beautiful 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.410
 tinkerbell isa actually there are some 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.350
 days of that she put online 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.410
 tutorial that features the fullness 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.720
 and the strong queen of branded streets that 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.400
 is absolutely beautiful it's very 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.559
 very bright it is very well in the eyes 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.630
 browns actually they use 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.350
 mostly just effort of 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.719
 film 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:48.350
 gold for example toaster with five years 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.140
 of a favorite club origins and so on and 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.700
 add-on touches there to more autumnal with the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.020
 lighthouse cranberry of evil so that's 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.730
 absolutely beautiful it's worth the trip 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.250
 go see her if you do not know 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.629
 start during my part 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.420
 so my name my tutorial I have enough of 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.980
 France that I had already then I admitted 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.380
 even that's a little different actually 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.689
 I had seen that are simpler less 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.330
 strong but something still 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.670
 very metallic that also reminds 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.490
 colors of difool that was falling all 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.820
 field I also want in the days to 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.270
 come 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.330
 those who live elsewhere than in quebec 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.340
 you take a video including the 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.320
 changes a little colors of 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.020
 trees because it's very very pretty 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.540
 I hope I have the chance to do it 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.650
 otherwise I will resume next but I 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.640
 think it might be nice for 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.070
 you to have it if you want to see at 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.770
 this place there if you want to know 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.619
 how 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.619
 the story is there when you look 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.650
 I already have my base I took the haye 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.630
 show at colruyt and I will 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.570
 actually apply a delay that produces 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.640
 the trio I acted at a very long time I 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.140
 wanted to come out because of 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.259
 precisely you speaking of introduction 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.479
 of tutorials of tencube elisa so the 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.190
 lighthouse cranberry I did not see in 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.080
 person but I'm with you that 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.400
 may have looked a bit like 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.860
 using it I realize that 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.150
 much more to store in the organs 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.910
 store the cranberry 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.630
 but it would be training here that is a 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.890
 kind of red metallic orange and is 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.540
 what am I going to do what I want 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.269
 use this lemay color for the raw 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.860
 and I will take the brush definition 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.290
 from the birds and I'm going all 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.110
 simply apply the color in 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:44.180
 semicircle movement of a thought like 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:47.350
 this one already covers the reflections 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.350
 metallized in color 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.420
 I take America their call on two 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.430
 hosts and you're applying it to all the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.430
 along my line and is extremely rare 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.480
 here it is in this of that I will 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.250
 take the rounded brush this this 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.049
 period and hillsides and I'm coming 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.030
 look for the color or drink that makes 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.280
 long as poets refused in the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.209
 bag their game which is very pretty his 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.069
 Flat brand 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.030
 they want to apply this regulation on 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.459
 the paper to me quickly like this 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.049
 leaves a metallic color 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.540
 so we do not really see in a lot 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.730
 shine together I do not resume 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.010
 his restaurant bar just to come force 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.540
 hallway together I speak any time 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:49.209
 your fingers for just looking for them 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.639
 that in addition to this side or glee and a little 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.379
 more at the outer corner precisely for good 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.989
 do the mixing between the two I'm going 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.239
 then as a brush is the film 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.840
 is quite dense like this here and I 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.510
 am going to use the color handsome bombshell and 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.040
 old-fashioned games so has the beach as I 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:12.159
 know that your white badge slightly 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.680
 aniseed and I 'm just not going 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.599
 pretty eyebrow and doing this I come 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.349
 do my instant pages at the same time 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.609
 to the top 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:23.080
 here again we just decrease their 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.000
 number of countries are rather than just 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.330
 to refuse and I do a little my corner 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.330
 internal 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.570
 and then that's about it for whatever the 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.470
 red gives us the sick I like 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.380
 cut it in glass the eye and I use 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.510
 actually very black is getting ready written in 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.860
 also wanks and I'm going to put on the 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.860
 top and bottom speed 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.090
 I get to the inside corner so that 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.189
 gives us are here is automatically 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.779
 not want to see that it's going on the 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:13.460
 line b slightly lower ones 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:17.639
 but it creates a kind of fondue with 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.129
 our our red and then of that I 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.719
 take my mascara and there we can 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:25.560
 to go generously enough for this delay 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:27.719
 the bumps he provided enough so here's the 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.789
 munster was applied what that we 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.789
