the Leslie cable when you can see that
this<00:00:39.980> pin<00:00:40.280> is<00:00:40.430> really<00:00:40.820> burned<00:00:41.949> so<00:00:42.949> we're<00:00:43.129> going

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
this pin is really burned so we're going

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.869 
this pin is really burned so we're going

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
Leslie socket and I'm going to add

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.279 
Leslie socket and I'm going to add
additional<00:00:49.160> fuses<00:00:50.120> to<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.420> circuit<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:50.899> try

additional fuses to the circuit to try

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.610 
additional fuses to the circuit to try
to<00:00:51.350> help<00:00:52.329> prevent<00:00:53.329> this<00:00:53.660> from<00:00:53.929> happening<00:00:54.230> in

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
to help prevent this from happening in

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.970 
to help prevent this from happening in
the<00:00:54.769> in<00:00:55.039> the<00:00:55.129> future<00:00:55.989> this<00:00:56.989> this<00:00:57.589> had<00:00:57.769> had<00:00:57.949> a

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
the in the future this this had had a

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.520 
the in the future this this had had a
trek<00:00:58.339> three<00:00:58.730> as<00:00:59.059> a<00:00:59.210> trek<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.629> or<00:00:59.960> a<00:00:59.989> trek<00:01:00.260> three

whatever the the solid state preamp is

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.320 
whatever the the solid state preamp is
called<00:01:03.499> and<00:01:05.290> they<00:01:06.290> replaced<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.190> original

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
called and they replaced the original

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.480 
called and they replaced the original
tube-type<00:01:08.330> electronics<00:01:08.960> chassis<00:01:09.490> and

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
tube-type electronics chassis and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.760 
tube-type electronics chassis and
whoever<00:01:11.030> wired<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:11.690> up<00:01:11.930> they<00:01:12.110> did<00:01:12.290> run<00:01:12.560> new

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
whoever wired this up they did run new

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.360 
whoever wired this up they did run new
wire<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.190> cabinet<00:01:17.180> connector<00:01:18.370> but

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
wire to the to the cabinet connector but

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.550 
wire to the to the cabinet connector but
somehow<00:01:20.060> this<00:01:20.480> wiring<00:01:20.780> ended<00:01:21.230> up<00:01:21.350> burning

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
somehow this wiring ended up burning

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.340 
somehow this wiring ended up burning
along<00:01:22.010> with<00:01:22.300> whatever<00:01:23.300> else<00:01:23.570> happened<00:01:24.200> there

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
along with whatever else happened there

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.120 
along with whatever else happened there
so<00:01:24.880> new<00:01:25.880> powerline<00:01:26.510> wiring<00:01:27.020> plus<00:01:27.290> fuses<00:01:27.830> plus

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
so new powerline wiring plus fuses plus

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.830 
so new powerline wiring plus fuses plus
new<00:01:28.370> connectors<00:01:28.910> ought<00:01:29.120> to<00:01:29.240> solve<00:01:29.540> the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
new connectors ought to solve the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.700 
new connectors ought to solve the
problem<00:01:31.270> here's<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.480> inside<00:01:32.900> of<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.230> cable

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
problem here's the inside of the cable

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.980 
problem here's the inside of the cable
on<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:33.980> end<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.310> Leslie<00:01:34.700> connector<00:01:35.210> the

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
on the end of the Leslie connector the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.470 
on the end of the Leslie connector the
wiring<00:01:36.470> looks<00:01:36.620> like<00:01:36.890> good<00:01:37.160> modern<00:01:37.790> plastic

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
wiring looks like good modern plastic

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.800 
wiring looks like good modern plastic
wire<00:01:39.440> but<00:01:40.430> there<00:01:40.610> was<00:01:40.730> enough<00:01:41.030> heat<00:01:41.360> here<00:01:41.690> to

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
wire but there was enough heat here to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.810 
wire but there was enough heat here to
completely<00:01:42.260> melt<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.770> solder<00:01:43.010> on<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.430> pins

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
completely melt the solder on the pins

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.110 
completely melt the solder on the pins
to<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.120> AC<00:01:44.390> power<00:01:44.870> leads<00:01:45.580> so<00:01:46.580> what<00:01:46.820> I'm<00:01:46.940> gonna

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
to the AC power leads so what I'm gonna

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.600 
to the AC power leads so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:47.450> I'm<00:01:47.660> going<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.900> put<00:01:48.110> on<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.260> new<00:01:48.530> plug<00:01:49.010> and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
do I'm going to put on a new plug and

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.690 
do I'm going to put on a new plug and
I'm<00:01:50.090> gonna<00:01:50.210> put<00:01:50.540> on<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.720> new<00:01:51.050> shell<00:01:51.890> on<00:01:52.340> there

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
I'm gonna put on a new shell on there

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.580 
I'm gonna put on a new shell on there
just<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.090> make<00:01:53.810> sure<00:01:53.840> there<00:01:54.290> wouldn't<00:01:54.560> be

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
just to make sure there wouldn't be

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.590 
just to make sure there wouldn't be
carbon<00:01:55.280> or<00:01:55.430> anything<00:01:55.640> inside<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.480> this

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
carbon or anything inside of this

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.570 
carbon or anything inside of this
because<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:57.500> looks<00:01:57.680> like<00:01:57.800> there<00:01:58.100> was<00:01:58.250> some

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
because it looks like there was some

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.120 
because it looks like there was some
some<00:01:59.540> burn<00:01:59.810> stuff<00:02:00.260> in<00:02:00.470> here<00:02:01.270> so

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
some burn stuff in here so

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.219 
some burn stuff in here so
I've<00:02:03.460> got<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.730> brand<00:02:04.120> new<00:02:04.240> one<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.720> these<00:02:04.840> shells

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
I've got a brand new one of these shells

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.980 
I've got a brand new one of these shells
so<00:02:05.770> we'll<00:02:06.400> just<00:02:06.550> redo<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.150> whole<00:02:07.330> deal

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
so we'll just redo the whole deal

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.050 
so we'll just redo the whole deal
I'll<00:02:08.350> need<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.740> cut<00:02:08.950> off<00:02:09.130> cut<00:02:09.640> off<00:02:09.789> these<00:02:10.000> old

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
I'll need to cut off cut off these old

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.650 
I'll need to cut off cut off these old
ends<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:12.070> strip<00:02:12.610> back<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.820> insulation

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
ends and then strip back the insulation

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.390 
ends and then strip back the insulation
to<00:02:13.690> get<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> little<00:02:14.170> bit<00:02:14.320> more<00:02:14.500> wire<00:02:14.770> length<00:02:15.100> on

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
to get a little bit more wire length on

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.190 
to get a little bit more wire length on
there<00:02:17.490> we're<00:02:18.490> now<00:02:18.610> wiring<00:02:19.209> up<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.390> new<00:02:19.780> plug

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
there we're now wiring up the new plug

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.480 
there we're now wiring up the new plug
on<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.590> Leslie<00:02:21.010> cable<00:02:21.520> here's<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.360> old<00:02:22.510> one

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
on the Leslie cable here's the old one

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.800 
on the Leslie cable here's the old one
made<00:02:24.490> a<00:02:24.520> chart<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.510> wire<00:02:26.260> colors<00:02:26.890> here<00:02:27.459> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
made a chart of the wire colors here and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.330 
made a chart of the wire colors here and
this<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:28.959> about<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.410> amount<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.830> has<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.190> be

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
this is about the amount that has to be

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.550 
this is about the amount that has to be
stripped<00:02:30.700> off<00:02:30.910> for<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.420> wire<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.660> feed<00:02:32.170> into
