oxidizing lotion oxidizing lotion is
basically<00:00:35.370> something<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.690> mix<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.230> with

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
basically something that you mix in with

solution<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.450> basically<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.469> formula<00:00:44.160> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
solution is basically this formula that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.580 
solution is basically this formula that
contains<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.059> lot<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> hydrogen<00:00:45.809> peroxide<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
contains a lot of hydrogen peroxide and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.740 
contains a lot of hydrogen peroxide and
when<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.520> hair<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.000> lifts

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
makes it lighter and in the process it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.150
