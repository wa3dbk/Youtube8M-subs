00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.740
 we believe that we must succeed to be 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.889
 happy but the formula could be to 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.480
 reverse is to be happy to have 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.480
 success are lakers 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.740
 Hello, friends, how are you? I am Miguel 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.980
 figueroa and today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.740
 very interesting researcher called sam 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.900
 chord since it decorates the university of 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.910
 harvard plus a teacher is extremely 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.059
 popular everyone wants to enter their 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.250
 classes and their lectures they say 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.110
 something very very thought 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.180
 is divided into two parts I grew up 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.970
 seeing parts and to see we are going to see 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.030
 What do you think about the first part 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.670
 I feel sorry we do not condition the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.070
 obtaining our logos with the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.539
 happiness what is referred 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.449
 surely something like 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.680
 When they have my car, it gets gray when 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.160
 have my own house the title that 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.160
 job 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.800
 when we get that, that great happiness 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.020
 we thought it would take to be of 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.890
 banes in a short time something maybe the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.340
 change from 100 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.460
 the small object to 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.549
 is registered in many places that by 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.320
 example the people who win the lottery 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.320
 he becomes happy he is excited 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.539
 returns to its traditional state of 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.039
 sad negative thinking or if it were 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.569
 a happy person stays a 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.569
 happy person is still won 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.050
 it says the following we do not condition the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.400
 obtaining our achievements with the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.030
 happiness if we do not do exactly what 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.580
 contrary 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.670
 that is, let's have our thoughts 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.920
 positive we have in your brain happy and 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.500
 that happiness is going to be that we get 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.090
 more quickly the achievements I repeat if 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.190
 our mind is happy 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.310
 it's going to be easier for us to get 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.370
 our achievements and not the other way around if I am 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.530
 so I get something I'll be happy not if I 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.530
 I'm happy I'll get something look at it 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.000
 It is interesting and giving me the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.150
 absolutely revealing he did by 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.940
 example that we can be 31 by 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.800
 hundred percent more efficient if we have the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.290
 positive thinking if we have a 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.750
 Intelligent positive thinking 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.390
 37% sellers are more sellers if 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.940
 is that they have a positive thinking 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.190
 compared to negative thinking or a 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.510
 thinking of others who write 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:53.520
 the data really several doctors 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:57.840
 may be 19% 19 more 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.870
 more accurate in obtaining and 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.020
 find the disease if they are like a 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.210
 thinking and a positive brain the 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.380
 Core talks a bit about dopamine and 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.770
 of this there are many researched 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.960
 decisions that eco portals says that 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.300
 the dopamine generates us happiness this is 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.270
 absolutely true also that 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.250
 awakens related brain areas 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.770
 to learning and therefore to the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.800
 connection of new possibilities and 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.330
 also to creativity and now I think 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.520
 it 's a good time to ask 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.040
 you work in organizations 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.550
 you maybe lead a group of 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.830
 people 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.060
 how are our organizations how 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.530
 is the brain of our 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.590
 organizations 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.250
 they are connected with a thought 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.090
 positive intelligent rational 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.610
 happy we are not depressed 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.860
 oppressed or simply neo 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.820
 how is the climate of doors 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.650
 I remember good weather has a lot to do 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.480
 with the possibilities of growth 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.490
 comes from the organization with the 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.620
 growth possibilities that have 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.370
 the individuals inside and outside the 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.670
 organization 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.220
 that gives us a kind of kind of 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.470
 fairly quick tool for 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.109
 manage to change the brain a little 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.150
 negative an anguished brain a 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.930
 brain a neutral to a positive 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.440
 ellis for 21 days listen and point 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.020
 and try to do it for 21 days 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.770
 let's thank for two minutes 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:40.810
 the 21 days about something to someone to the 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:43.150
 life to nature to our friends to 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.630
 greece for 21 days for two 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.370
 minutes or three daily thanks 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.490
 After those 21 days , our brain goes 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.430
 to find a pattern of thoughts 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.949
 positive to our brain is going to 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.500
 get used to thinking positively about 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.060
 once in neutral negatively we in 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.000
 our organization orders we have 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.150
 generated this and other variants that 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.729
 effectively show that if the 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.400
 brain can change our brain is 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.070
 able is so elastic and flexible that 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.680
 you can change your ability to think and 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.270
 to adapt to connect to the middle of a 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.509
 better way as a thought 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.910
 positive I hope you enjoyed this 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.070
 delivery that I mentioned that they share 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.690
 and make it a growth tool 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.690
 staff and organization
