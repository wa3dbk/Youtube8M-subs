00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.770
 hello youtube friends we are in canary 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.060
 tech and today we come to talk about the new 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.140
 iphone 5 s 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.140
 let's go with the video 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.660
 The new iPhone 5s was introduced on the 10th 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 September maintains the design of the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.189
 iphone 5 adding to the range of colors 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.980
 the champagne has a screen of 4 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.059
 inches with a resolution of 1.136 x 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.150
 640 pixels and a density of 326 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.720
 pixels per inch weighs only 112 grams 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.760
 and it's 76 millimeters thick one of 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.159
 the novelties of this smartphone is the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.839
 touch hide and a sensor placed in the 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.300
 home button able to read our 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.039
 fingerprints this will serve us for 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.260
 iphone unlock our way more 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.750
 secure and even to validate the purchase 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.129
 of apps apple has highlighted the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.960
 use of sapphire crystal in its 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.019
 making what was a greater 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.880
 resistance to the button inside this 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.800
 new iphone brings many changes apple 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.060
 has decided to take a risk using his 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.729
 i7 new 64 - bit processor being 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.250
 5 s the first smartphone with such a chip 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.350
 powerful has created some controversy with 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.420
 this decision because many of the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.900
 experts consider unnecessary 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.210
 power in a smash 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.430
 we also find another surprise that has 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.840
 gone unnoticed but that can 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.030
 open up great opportunities for 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.580
 developers the coprocessed 'network the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.680
 movement l be a little chip 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.510
 responsible for constantly measuring the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.540
 data recorded by the average brain 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.640
 the gyroscope and the compass the b7 is 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.760
 designed to perform this task a 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.750
 much more efficient mode that equips 7 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.220
 freeing him from a job with which 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.650
 traditionally they have had to deal 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.480
 all your previous generations and 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.910
 significantly reducing consumption 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.950
 of energy this basically means 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.900
 that anyone who makes use of this 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.240
 factor can get it at all times 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.670
 without ending our battery and here is 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.260
 where the good starts in 2007 knows 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.110
 when you're walking and running 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.660
 even driving thanks to them the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.820
 Maps app automatically gives you a type 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.220
 indications and low skin and other -that 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.360
 If you go by car as the l7 detects 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.300
 when you're in a vehicle 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.370
 move the iphone5 s where will ask 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.660
 if you want to connect to the wifi network 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.820
 two that happens 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.130
 The new processor also puts you 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.590
 it has not been moving for a while 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.290
 when he sleeps and thus minimizes the battery 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.239
 that was to connect to the network 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.519
 the camera is something fundamental in a 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.739
 smartphone this iphone 5 game is that 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.480
 that give 8 megapixels but has 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.670
 introduced great improvements in the rest 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.370
 of factors that define the isight camera 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.489
 to begin with in terms of quality the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.829
 Sensor cases 5 s 15% more 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.720
 large what allow you to capture more light 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.209
 to improve the photos at night or in 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.180
 interiors also includes a new 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.829
 flash formed by two leds stand out 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.920
 several modes within the interface of the 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.900
 camera the anti blur that takes out four 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.689
 photos and then complements them to 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.340
 eliminate the blur bursts of 10 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.709
 photos per second that will allow us 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.040
 making creations is pretty curious and 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.780
 720p video recording with 120 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.810
 frames per second that we 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.379
 will allow you to create videos like this one in 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.379
 slow motion 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.600
 This has been our review of the 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.430
 highlights of iphone5 s 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.780
 now I will give my opinion about the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.580
 smartphone and some small 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.910
 Comparisons with other terminals of the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.910
 market 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.410
 the htc one for me the best smartphone 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.890
 of the market better audio on a mobile 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.550

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.250

 from double core to 1.5 fun day 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.760
 tension an incredible 48 camera 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.950
 megapixels what makes this batch 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.570
 aluminum the best option in the market 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.570
 for those who love photography 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.270
 sony xperia z 1 a blue screen hd 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.259
 looking for a camera of 20 as 7 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:08.430
 megapixels the ram memory of 2 gb and a 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:11.099
 2.30 processor and also this 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.849
 terminal is resistant to water dust 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.849
 and something against 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.590
 first of all I have to make it clear that 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.360
 I am not any hater of affection rather 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.730
 on the contrary because I have always been 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.530
 delighted your products I will try 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.110
 be as objective as possible with this 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.930
 let's go with my opinion of this iphone 5 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.700
 that is not a terminal evil, much less 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.890
 but we have already seen that in the market 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.800
 there are more powerful smartphones with better 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.930
 cameras and even prettier apple has 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.120
 made your bet but I think it has been 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.780
 wrong this is proven by looking at the 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.640
 price of the new iphone 699 euros and 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.500
 comparing it for example with that of the 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.070
 I 'll let you know that I have seen it 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.680
 about the 480 euros anyway 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.140
 this is a matter of taste those who 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.850
 you choose you are up to here the video 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.400
