00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.620

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.770
 tusk 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.770
 then fought for game 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.949
 is the same today 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.130

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.159
 Dr 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.930
 4 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.620
 nice down day love to see the very warm welcome 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.690
 So Allah becomes TV today with one of my favorite places and that makes me happy 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.470
 especially with there are not so many radio plays from and therefore 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.480
 Pro today I can present and introduce you to one of them 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.730
 And it is much less than mourning Philipp Lerf Kreft 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.569
 or 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:03.499
 also a Robert von Lenz, as they liked to call him 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.570
 Stories are at least as cranky as 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.690
 Dia he was probably himself 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.930
 amongst other things 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.280
 Year particularly well-known by the so-called Chatrooms the TuS the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.909
 is about we have how could one say a percent 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.750
 a universe transferred from 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.070
 and 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.909
 Coco customers year gatherings gatherings 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.440
 a really scary one is India 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.680
 Endspiel captivates on Kraft's descriptions mostly by the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.930
 beautiful r detailed descriptions of the stark horror stress 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.900
 Protagonists of the way through the bank always away from the I-perspective 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.390
 told and partly the whole is also kept in letter form 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.190
 Now at the pot inside stories there are many many she collects 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.530
 Volumes which I would very much like to recommend to you by Suhrkamp Verlag 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.240
 now it is unclear at first a very nice example example 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.710
 and werlte 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.170
 that's it 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.119
 inter alia to hear Reimer beautiful 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.490
 Alexander Torecke Annina Braunmiller and many more so one who round 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.920
 Seeker would be the whole rounded Kas 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.570
 I want to talk about the story itself 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.250
 So much betrayed is the band Bowmore Ahlen Jonathan Dreier and one 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.519
 Expedition as the good has accompanied goes 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.579
 an expedition into eternal ice 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.230
 and what you found there I do not want to betray too much 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.779
 Above all, these stories love each other 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:46.309
 Of everything you do not know us too much in advance to reveal 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.410
 that breaks the surprise a little bit I know that some then 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.560
 again, those who are not plagued enough will not be enough on the plot 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.720
 but I trust it's worth it just to get involved with it 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.400
 whole is a two-part to the game so really right thick park discovered 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.890
 and episode 44 and 55 from the horror cabinet I have her body 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.680
 to 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.680
 Year 44 and the k-word listener 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.379
 45 a Mayer I'm of course also a great after the small picture 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.219
 you probably do not recognize that anyway 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:24.349
 and 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.279
 a very nice and atmospheric radio play but you have to 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:29.689
 saying 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:30.639
 the 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.289
 the um 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:38.459
 Colleagues of Titan year namely percent Markus% market could and Stefan where they 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.669
 - 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.529
 Above all, it is well-known that they are loyal to the fabric filler Seher Werks 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:48.220
 translate that is Award the Dark a glossy Moon at it 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.729
 actual ripper 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:54.299
 but a very atmospheric and very exciting story that she sees very much 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.399
 is worthwhile if you are a burden I often yard games and straight 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:00.789
 all around the Loomit East 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:04.159
 that is really very exciting 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.839
 Books from the Suhrkamp Verlag has briefly addressed the I would you very much 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:11.379
 recommend and what I would like to miss you in 2010 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.659
 HAZ the 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:13.999
 hamburger 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:18.479
 Formations Earth Star that has just become known by giving it 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.989
 Play music to roles 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.919
 to have done 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.970
 just to the point of madness an album releases at least something 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:32.080
 I have heard so far about it was really very worthwhile and gives 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.440
 It is also a very successful trailer 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.379
 that does not bend 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.059
 would like to link here once 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:42.430
 YouTubes makes it possible in this sense, I really recommend you 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.259
 listen to the mountains of madness rows maybe even with the colleagues 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.630
 from heirs star 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.630
 and at the same time 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.430
 and we will be back at this point again when it is called again 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.889
 is described 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.759
 store like that 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.120
 solve the web -ing
