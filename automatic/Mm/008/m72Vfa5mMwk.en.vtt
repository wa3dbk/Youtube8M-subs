00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.759
 mayor 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.390
 who said that 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.149
 in the first quarter of an hour the first minutes 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.149
 I warned the players but the problem is that 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.019
 we can tell you what you want and 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.460
 the players you own about the role 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.159
 they do not take lightly it's true that 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.749
 we came back 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.179
 we got back into this game normally 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.700
 two games less a normal match that I am too 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.390
 it is etienne they showed it 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.390
 in the presence in the first twenty minutes before they ate 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.710
 mediatized a lot of goal chances 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.960
 and the first on his return 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.860
 realism 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.210
 clean 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.550
 know it's like that too 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.539
 this post 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.120
 higher level that 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 it's going fast 5 this report on the other hand so 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.580
 attention concentration 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.440
 speaking of this match 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.870
 you see that it was not started well the match 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.720
 it was the great early potato 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.560
 it's hard to come back 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.530
 scott was yesterday is about to stop you know that voices 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.240
 will eventually rise to decades so the country 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.110
 mam started the match after 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 boulogne and even the world was safer and the more 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.080
 sodexo employs or even if the actions were more efficient innocuous 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.160
 I think we're back from the game 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.360
 especially in the last fifteen minutes of the first half 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.230
 the green fans the first 30 minutes of the second period it's 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.230
 true that we must or must score a goal to equalize 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.399
 because we did not want to give 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.820
 if I do not say it's a little by little 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.190
 who you who plants you the effect has been the case since 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.230
 if the match france 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.630
 we do not know too much 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.730
 in the end the market between 3 euros 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.270
 the top 5 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.080
 its own brand this folder 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.240
 we are all disappointed 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.340
 we must quickly reconcentrate for the bank of France Wednesday in bordeaux 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.940
 in fact it is a fact that turns 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.170
 only lightning 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.229
 it is a priority axis 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.199
 we made good matches 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.159
 we had German confidence 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.529
 a week after the defeat of the fund 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.819
 they do it you have to assume 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.219
 a bit too much 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.629
 for this time's pane 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.580
 or to kill the beast that made me a little scared I have young players they have 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.749
 need to learn 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.189
 a lot in terms of concentration of termonde 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.959
 I always said 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.220
 our country of the g10 that there is still 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.840
 we see it for double hit 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.840
 waste in this area 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.279
 confuse many things according to judgment 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.149
 a party 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:48.599
 I started in the back anyway 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.840
 she knew that the small advance at the same time one must drill the well does not 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.489
 will be that the fed tonight pau 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.989
 actually a good match against the om 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.610
 so today and we redo a good series 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.820
 I take this site offers is that to rebound 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.039
 good it's true 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.039
 we have two tough matches and the personality of pierre bourgault and 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.829
 it's sometimes easier 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.109
 to apprehend countries 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.739
 the bape the market 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.539
 at the same time the content 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.029
 good things were written to weaken in the end because 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.959
 in this second Japanese goal that bring a few more scoring chances 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.159
 it's because at one point we do not even talk about purpose 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.729
 not to question everything about whether we take the time to 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.069
 progress Welsh people do not want to become aware of the 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:41.459
 This is the reality as well as the equality of the teams that can 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.959
 to be misclassified having the squad is very complicated
