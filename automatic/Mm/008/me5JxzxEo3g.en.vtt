00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.120
 hello youtube friends today I bring you my 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:13.190
 second video tutorial of how and what 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:16.939
 brings and how the minions speaker works 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:21.079
 the first video tutorial told them that 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:25.490
 this is the official channel horn that 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:27.980
 we will use to 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.650
 listen to the background music today is already 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.989
 I do not have background music because they are 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.690
 I'm presenting previously was 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.160
 connected to my cell phone but as no longer 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.610
 has a stack or it was left at zero no longer 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.110
 can you learn the need to load and then 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.780
 it was a long time to charge it good 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.100
 it has a duration of about 3 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.250
 days 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.820
 or the maximum 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.220
 because depending on how much which 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.920
 how many hours do they let me carry 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.940
 I let load a full night so that 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.740

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.579

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.370
 to ask how to listen 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.290

 any lot of guys on the internet I've 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.070
 I have seen many videos and they are true 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.640

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:56.310
 volume is recessed inward and 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.310
 then show this in like this 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:06.270
 they leave them like this for about two seconds and pau 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:10.200
