00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.190
 what I have here is for you 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:21.970
 learn to create your own games 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:21.970
 because we are the ones who are 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:35.140
 in this edition we will know how you 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.180
 can learn to make their own 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.180
 videogames do not need to go to another country 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.750
 to learn because he wants the savior 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.540
 we have it all there is an academy and not 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.920
 they teach you how to create your own 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.370
 games to join us and I love let's go 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.370
 forever 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.110
 Thank you 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.930
 what he was telling me that he wanted 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:35.270
 learn to create good and cheap 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.740
 monarch love to tell you that we are 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.610
 the first development chain of 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.800
 video game 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.750
 and we do courses to be able 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.490
 teach people how to develop 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.320
 videogames all our courses are 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.000
 completely basic ontario if not 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.490
 you need 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.440
 a very big knowledge requirement 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:59.000
 but only knows how to occupy well 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:01.160
 computer with that idea we go clear and 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.530
 it's a profound question because let me 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:11.120
 Deep tell staff 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.790
 when we meet with a partner of 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.530
 I work to be able to think who we 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.870
 we wanted to do a study of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.450
 video games then we try to think 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.910
 how could we do to get more 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.620
 people who help us and all that 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.319
 it happened to me at that moment 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.840
 he liked to give classic and can also 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.750
 put an academy of this and we think 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.030
 that in this way to teach us 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.620
 other people then we could start 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.049
 to have more people for our 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.049
 projects 2d games 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.480
 the most important thing is that they are 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.569
 earrings from our facebook page 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.579
 we find ourselves as part of 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.560
 studies with that one that showing up in 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.590
 screen and west 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.590
 because we put there when 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.970
 start all the courses if we have all 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.530
 the information that we can also 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.170
 order by means of a nimbus 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.480
 or can not write to contact mail 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.220
 at the point of read and we 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.740
 we send the catalog of all the courses 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.910
 that we have and there decides which 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.910
 and what exactly do you want 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.450
 or it gets a little closer but neither does it 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.040
 save were six please with 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.760
 respect here to the wings look at this 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.720
 complete 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.959
 these are creations of the students is 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.000
 a shame because it is used so that the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.950
 teacher helps them how to go creating 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.989
 let's say the character they want 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.269
 do first they do it with a 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.880
 illustration and when they have the idea of 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.670
 how to know they start trying to 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.590
 shaping the body already was like 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.040
 let's say so because they happen from the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.040
 paper to try to make it a sculpture 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:11.090
 and I never look like they happen to a 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.280
 digital sculpture already on the computer 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.840
 with wants and afterwards they start to make 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.970
 like the skeleton that is known as 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.590
 wing and the animation already so that it 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.180
 were models characters look at what 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.130
 interesting our hair yes yes here 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.240
 There is a place where you can 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.979
 learn what is the most important truth 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.320
 that today we met something wonderful something 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.240
 that not many unknown people that 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.770
 existed in the savior that really 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.520
 that today we are going to see that there is a 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.520
 where can 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:47.919
 thank you very much for sitting and 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.919
 opening the doors 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:57.520
 the chepe don three hairs 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:08.190
 all 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:11.870
 and the average media cameraman 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.870
 they are the profit dollars
