00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.680
 we previously could shop at the BMW 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.570
 dealer for a 3-series coupé 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.070
 you can now no longer that car that is 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.850
 replaced that is to a higher level 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.300
 lifted 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.430
 I present you the new 4 series 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.280
 the first thing that stands out with that car is 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.390
 of course the beautiful lines 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.610
 sloping roofline 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.040
 in this color with these wheels that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.960
 combination with a known is the one 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 lots of mesh lock 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.350
 today I will take you with the new one 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 450 ppi okay 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.510
 No 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.060
 as i just told you is the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.190
 competitive of the 3 series 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.100
 past tense actually for all 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.860
 variants of bmw is a complete version 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.140
 today an even number 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.690
 just as the convertible comes from the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.240
 1-series coupé and a series car led 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.270
 soon a 2 series so comes from the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.870
 3-series convertible and the coupé 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.770
 now the 4 series he already had the 5 series 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.659
 combination with the 6 series and 7 series 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.780
 there we would never coupé innovation 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.780
 and 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:15.440
 the 4 series can be ordered from bmw from 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:17.920
 40,000 euros our test model the 435 extra 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.130
 with vending machine can be ordered from one 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.600
 64,000 euros but then you are not there yet 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.310
 as of 1 May the Netherlands has something here 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.880
 options pasted 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.370
 we have a four series here that costs 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.570
 89 thousand euros but must I say then 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.060
 do you have a car 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.000
 you meet all your wishes as I do 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.830
 just told this BMW 435 is provided 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.640
 of a language of options so has it 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.459
 car 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.470
 a head-up display a sliding-tilt roof 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.019
 a navigation system the professional 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.250
 sports seats a surround camera system 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.250
 and so on 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.220
 and fun is what stood out when i was for it 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.750
 first get into this car wash belt 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.459
 to indicate 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.050
 very practical who would actually 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.630
 expect in a bentley 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.970
 the next thing I noticed in this car 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.370
 as the interior of the 4 series I have 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.200
 many media hear it speculate 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.690
 interior of this 4 series is a car 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.400
 that is shared to a higher level 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.010
 a bit disappointing because it was rather 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.780
 resembles that of a 3 series 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.700
 and then I think guys why are we sowing 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.480
 about the interior of a 4 series what 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.519
 resembles that of the three 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.099
 if it is just really ergonomic 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:31.129
 if it is focused on driving there is 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.129
 the material use is good I see there 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.459
 for example, that m steering wheel 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.319
 light so nice in the hand in my 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.060
 place in that car and you don't get it 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.920
 sit like a diaper case 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.349
 take will hold you drive your 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.040
 seat well you can do everything nicely 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:53.370
 and you will devour turns 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.180
 that 435 in of course not really it 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.489
 news 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.639
 the 4 series is the news but that engine 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:03.420
 that six-in-line engine that already knows him 306 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.579
 pk in combination with them zf automatic that 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.659
 8-speed automatic transmission that switches the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.000
 open air 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.709
 nothing has changed but also there 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.829
 I think again why we have things 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.410
 if the right thing is the only thing 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.389
 my little bit disappointing is it 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.759
 sound of that six-in-line engine it is 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.389
 present but it may be a bit 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.389
 worse 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.610
 a 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.699
 the four very in that sends reasonable 

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:45.289
 light does communicate with the boards 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.169
 it with not numb 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.889
 i am a real bnp me step 1 daily 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.979
 series 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.180
 one and went out today with these 4 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.080
 series 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.789
 435 with nick fight 4 diarrhea 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.410
 that will not be completely nice in such a 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.509
 car you just hear the drive 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.910
 on the rear wheels 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.039
 so I cut four-wheel drive system 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.860
 a distribution of 60% on the rear wheels 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.870
 and you dig up percent on the front wheels 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.240
 it intervenes where he needs more 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.820
 traction on the for million needed than pack 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.220
 I like that 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.780
 then I must say that this car is not 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.070
 drives like a car with 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.720
 four wheel drive 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.600
 I mean by saying that that car 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.910
 just drives like a real bmw 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.680
 that character the sporty character with 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.600
 drive on the rear wheels 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.670
 day he still has and that has me 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.730
 rejoice 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.760
 for who is this 4 series then you can do it 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.110
 compare with audi a5 coupé 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.270
 I just think this is a bit more and more 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.490
 rijdersauto everything is focused on the 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.550
 he is somewhat ergonomic 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.080
 dynamic and perhaps sportier 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.390
 it also offers enough space and 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.490
 in the back that sloping roof line 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.980
 don't make sure you are in the back either 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.960
 can sit and your bags in the back 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.340
 no problem love who has one 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.770
 nice h5 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.170
 interior looks good but still would 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.210
 I opt for this 4 series 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.070
 purely because he is more playful and something 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.300
 has less the appearance of a true one 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.980
 lease car 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.390
 again a very successful new model 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.270
 series of bmw 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.330
 the 4 series a fool primium and he drives 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.310
 good but looks very sexy 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.660
 this was a nice appetizer but I watch 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.040
 looking forward to main course 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.040
 the m4 is coming 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.919
 Well
