00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.280 
in this video we're going to be
exploring<00:00:02.490> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.730> create<00:00:03.120> instances<00:00:03.659> of<00:00:04.080> our

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
exploring how to create instances of our

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.410 
exploring how to create instances of our
objects<00:00:04.799> inside<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.160> modem<00:00:05.430> as<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:06.120> can<00:00:06.240> see

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
objects inside of modem as you can see

is<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:19.680> high<00:00:19.859> resolution<00:00:20.430> model<00:00:20.670> there

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
is a pretty high resolution model there

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.420 
is a pretty high resolution model there
are<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> lot<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.180> polygons<00:00:21.689> if<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.439> had<00:00:22.680> just<00:00:23.279> done

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
are a lot of polygons if I had just done

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.609 
are a lot of polygons if I had just done
you<00:00:23.970> know<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> traditional<00:00:24.689> clone<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.500> had

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
you know a traditional clone or if I had

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.040 
you know a traditional clone or if I had
copied<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.220> pasted<00:00:26.640> all<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.330> these<00:00:27.480> polygons

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
copied and pasted all of these polygons

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.620 
copied and pasted all of these polygons
I<00:00:28.349> would<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:28.980> millions<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.820> polygons<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.480> my

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
I would have millions of polygons in my

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.819 
I would have millions of polygons in my
scene<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.590> center<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.189> instance<00:00:32.809> instances

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
scene the center the instance instances

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.660 
scene the center the instance instances
are<00:00:34.829> not<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:35.430> processor<00:00:36.739> demanding<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:37.920> true

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
are not as processor demanding as true

are not as processor demanding as true
3d<00:00:39.570> clones<00:00:39.930> let's<00:00:40.559> start<00:00:40.770> off<00:00:40.890> by<00:00:41.040> making<00:00:41.160> an

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
3d clones let's start off by making an

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.650 
3d clones let's start off by making an
instance<00:00:41.760> let's<00:00:42.149> go<00:00:42.300> over<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> our

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
instance let's go over to our

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.229 
instance let's go over to our
duplication<00:00:43.469> tab<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> surface<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
duplication tab and on the surface it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.549 
duplication tab and on the surface it
looks<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.570> there<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:45.870> isn't<00:00:46.350> any

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
looks like there really isn't any

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.860 
looks like there really isn't any
instances<00:00:47.219> oh<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.879> right<00:00:47.910> there<00:00:48.149> but

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
instances oh there it is right there but

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.930 
instances oh there it is right there but
all<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> instance<00:00:49.890> commands<00:00:50.370> inside<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
all of the instance commands inside the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
all of the instance commands inside the
duplication<00:00:51.570> menu<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.680> buried

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
duplication menu are going to be buried

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.069 
duplication menu are going to be buried
in<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> submenu<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.329> don't<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.600> yours

those<00:01:03.090> are<00:01:03.270> differents<00:01:03.600> later<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.619> we're

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
those are differents later but we're

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.929

the tool properties for an instant
instance<00:01:11.040> clone<00:01:11.340> are<00:01:11.610> identical<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:12.780> at

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
instance clone are identical up here at

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.719 
instance clone are identical up here at
the<00:01:12.869> top<00:01:12.930> these<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> same<00:01:14.070> tool

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the top these are the same tool

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
the top these are the same tool
properties<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.509> were<00:01:15.630> used<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> seeing<00:01:16.140> with

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
properties that were used to seeing with

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.499 
properties that were used to seeing with
the<00:01:16.560> traditional<00:01:17.070> clone<00:01:17.369> its<00:01:17.640> exact<00:01:18.299> same

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the traditional clone its exact same

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.350 
the traditional clone its exact same
thing<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.930> let's<00:01:19.140> let's<00:01:20.130> go<00:01:20.340> ahead<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.549> add<00:01:21.030> a

rhinoceros is now pink well it's not

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.350 
rhinoceros is now pink well it's not
really<00:01:30.810> pink<00:01:31.159> until<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.520> move<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.060> there

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
really pink until we move it out there

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
really pink until we move it out there
it<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:34.920> once<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.490> give<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> little

it is there we go once we give a little
translation<00:01:36.540> along<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> x-axis<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.770> can

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
translation along the x-axis you can

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.490 
translation along the x-axis you can
start<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.759> clones<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.659> here's<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
start to see the clones so here's the

original and the two pink wire frames

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.280 
original and the two pink wire frames
represent<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.280> instance<00:01:44.790> clones<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.689> we

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
represent the instance clones if we

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.440 
represent the instance clones if we
examine<00:01:46.680> our<00:01:47.009> item<00:01:47.490> list<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.420> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
examine our item list you can see that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.389 
examine our item list you can see that
we<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.659> two<00:01:49.079> new<00:01:49.320> items<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.009> shown<00:01:50.220> up

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
we have two new items that have shown up

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.940 
we have two new items that have shown up
original<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.210> an<00:01:51.479> original<00:01:52.020> three<00:01:52.290> they<00:01:52.799> have

this<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.479> how<00:02:00.600> moto<00:02:00.899> tells<00:02:01.229> us<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.799> these<00:02:01.979> are

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
this is how moto tells us that these are

this is how moto tells us that these are
copies<00:02:02.610> now<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.420> great<00:02:03.689> thing<00:02:03.719> about<00:02:03.930> an

copies now the great thing about an
instance<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.969> that<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.329> very<00:02:06.719> quick<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
same clone effector that we're used to

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.140 
same clone effector that we're used to
seeing<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.830> portion<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.670> tool

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
seeing but this portion of the tool

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.199 
seeing but this portion of the tool
properties<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:34.160> specific<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.730> instance

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
properties is specific to the instance

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.900 
properties is specific to the instance
okay<00:02:36.629> right<00:02:37.349> now<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.830> parent<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.310> set<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.700> root

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
okay right now the parent is set to root

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.140 
okay right now the parent is set to root
if<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.900> change<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.519> hierarchy<00:02:41.519> look<00:02:42.030> what

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
if we change it to hierarchy look what

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.210 
if we change it to hierarchy look what
happens<00:02:42.540> over<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:43.019> our<00:02:43.170> item<00:02:43.470> list<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:44.190> have

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
happens over in our item list we have

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.880 
happens over in our item list we have
the<00:02:44.519> original<00:02:44.970> mesh<00:02:45.180> item<00:02:45.510> up<00:02:45.870> at<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.049> top<00:02:46.230> but

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
the original mesh item up at the top but

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.150 
the original mesh item up at the top but
it<00:02:47.010> has<00:02:47.700> placed<00:02:48.090> original<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.560> original

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
it has placed original to and original

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.849 
it has placed original to and original
three<00:02:50.459> in<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:51.150> parent-child<00:02:51.959> relationship<00:02:52.620> so

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
three in a parent-child relationship so

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.220 
three in a parent-child relationship so
original<00:02:53.430> three<00:02:53.700> has<00:02:54.120> been<00:02:54.329> parented<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.810> to

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
original three has been parented to to

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.610 
original three has been parented to to
an<00:02:55.560> original<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.640> has<00:02:57.239> been<00:02:57.450> parented<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:57.989> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
an original to has been parented to the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.830 
an original to has been parented to the
original<00:02:59.040> mesh<00:02:59.220> item<00:02:59.549> so<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.510> type

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
original mesh item so this is the type

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.449 
original mesh item so this is the type
of<00:03:00.870> visual<00:03:01.500> hierarchy<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:02.040> you're<00:03:02.310> going<00:03:02.400> to

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.170 
looks like it's not liking it doesn't
like<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.349> when<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.530> try<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.519> change<00:03:29.849> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
like it when I try to change the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.960 
like it when I try to change the
hierarchy<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.810> my<00:03:31.230> clones<00:03:31.620> when<00:03:32.579> I'm<00:03:32.700> trying

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
hierarchy of my clones when I'm trying

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.289 
hierarchy of my clones when I'm trying
to<00:03:33.030> record<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.480> ok<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:35.549> parent<00:03:35.970> mode<00:03:36.120> is

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
to record it ok so the parent mode is

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.120 
to record it ok so the parent mode is
now<00:03:36.510> set<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.870> root<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.410> look<00:03:37.650> what<00:03:37.799> happens

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
now set to root and look what happens

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.979 
now set to root and look what happens
instead<00:03:38.519> of<00:03:38.669> parenting<00:03:39.329> two<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:39.750> three

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
instead of parenting two and three

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.990 
instead of parenting two and three
together<00:03:40.139> they've<00:03:40.889> just<00:03:41.130> taken<00:03:41.310> both<00:03:41.700> two<00:03:41.970> and

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
together they've just taken both two and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.789 
together they've just taken both two and
three<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.510> they<00:03:42.750> parented<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.440> original

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
three and they parented to the original

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.620 
three and they parented to the original
so<00:03:44.250> it's<00:03:44.370> going<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.549> place<00:03:44.730> all<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
so it's going to place all of the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.020 
so it's going to place all of the
instance<00:03:46.049> clones<00:03:46.440> underneath<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.639> original

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
instance clones underneath the original

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.120 
instance clones underneath the original
and<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.930> how<00:03:49.079> I<00:03:49.109> usually<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.950> work

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
and this is how I usually like to work

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.710 
and this is how I usually like to work
personally<00:03:50.669> just<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.910> little<00:03:51.090> bit<00:03:51.180> easier<00:03:51.540> for

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
personally just a little bit easier for

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.449 
personally just a little bit easier for
me<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.840> see<00:03:52.109> I<00:03:52.290> don't<00:03:52.650> have<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:52.889> dig<00:03:53.099> through

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
me to see I don't have to dig through

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.759 
me to see I don't have to dig through
you<00:03:53.849> know<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.150> whole<00:03:54.450> series<00:03:55.079> of<00:03:55.260> parent-child

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
you know a whole series of parent-child

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.089 
you know a whole series of parent-child
relationships<00:03:56.579> a<00:03:56.790> whole<00:03:57.329> visual<00:03:57.660> hierarchy

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
relationships a whole visual hierarchy

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.740 
relationships a whole visual hierarchy
this<00:03:59.099> is<00:03:59.280> really<00:03:59.549> helpful<00:03:59.760> if<00:04:00.209> we<00:04:00.389> had<00:04:00.569> like

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750

and i'm going to show you the magic of
an<00:04:29.759> instance<00:04:30.150> so<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.810> instancing<00:04:31.410> tools<00:04:31.740> make

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
an instance so the instancing tools make

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.300 
an instance so the instancing tools make
it<00:04:32.819> an<00:04:32.940> instance<00:04:33.330> use<00:04:34.289> the<00:04:34.500> exact<00:04:34.800> same<00:04:34.830> tools

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
it an instance use the exact same tools

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.770 
it an instance use the exact same tools
in<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.669> process<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.330> workflow<00:04:36.690> that

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
in the process in the workflow that

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.089 
in the process in the workflow that
we're<00:04:37.050> used<00:04:37.259> to<00:04:37.349> using<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.919> traditional

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
we're used to using the traditional

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.339 
we're used to using the traditional
clone<00:04:38.610> tools<00:04:38.880> or<00:04:39.270> radial<00:04:39.630> raised<00:04:39.900> it's<00:04:40.229> the

clone tools or radial raised it's the

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.230 
clone tools or radial raised it's the
exact<00:04:40.620> same<00:04:40.650> thing<00:04:41.099> but<00:04:41.639> here's<00:04:41.880> where<00:04:42.090> it's

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
exact same thing but here's where it's

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.659 
exact same thing but here's where it's
different<00:04:42.630> since<00:04:43.259> these<00:04:43.530> instances<00:04:44.099> are<00:04:44.460> not

different since these instances are not

any of these polygons on my instance

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.290 
any of these polygons on my instance
okay<00:04:55.470> they're<00:04:56.069> just<00:04:56.099> so<00:04:56.430> i<00:04:56.460> just<00:04:56.819> it's<00:04:57.060> just<00:04:57.120> a

okay they're just so i just it's just a

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.629 
okay they're just so i just it's just a
wireframe<00:04:57.599> outline<00:04:58.349> okay<00:05:00.139> but<00:05:01.139> all<00:05:01.860> of<00:05:02.460> these

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
wireframe outline okay but all of these

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.999 
wireframe outline okay but all of these
instances<00:05:03.180> are<00:05:03.539> referencing<00:05:04.349> back<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.889> the

the instances as well okay so let me

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.430 
the instances as well okay so let me
show<00:05:14.820> what<00:05:14.910> I'm<00:05:14.970> talking<00:05:15.270> about<00:05:15.300> maybe<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.169> want

so<00:05:21.780> I'm<00:05:22.020> just<00:05:22.199> gonna<00:05:22.289> select<00:05:22.740> some<00:05:22.979> polygons

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
so I'm just gonna select some polygons

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.969 
so I'm just gonna select some polygons
here<00:05:23.639> and<00:05:23.820> since<00:05:24.659> I'm<00:05:24.900> so<00:05:25.139> changing<00:05:25.949> the

here and since I'm so changing the

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.430 
here and since I'm so changing the
polygons<00:05:26.550> on<00:05:26.819> the<00:05:26.909> original<00:05:27.569> rhinoceros<00:05:28.229> all

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
polygons on the original rhinoceros all

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.680 
polygons on the original rhinoceros all
the<00:05:29.099> instances<00:05:29.580> are<00:05:30.060> going<00:05:30.449> to<00:05:30.509> get

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
the instances are going to get

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.140 
the instances are going to get
immediately<00:05:31.380> updated<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.190> let's<00:05:32.820> see<00:05:32.940> here

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
immediately updated and let's see here

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.710 
immediately updated and let's see here
I'm<00:05:33.360> going<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.840> go<00:05:33.930> to<00:05:34.050> my<00:05:34.139> deform<00:05:34.889> tools<00:05:35.190> and

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
I'm going to go to my deform tools and

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.670 
I'm going to go to my deform tools and
we're<00:05:36.720> just<00:05:36.900> going<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.050> bend<00:05:37.289> it<00:05:37.409> we're<00:05:37.590> going

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
we're just going to bend it we're going

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.610 
we're just going to bend it we're going
to<00:05:37.770> bend<00:05:38.009> this<00:05:38.690> this<00:05:39.690> rhinoceros<00:05:40.320> back

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
to bend this this rhinoceros back

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.080 
to bend this this rhinoceros back
whether<00:05:40.889> it's<00:05:41.009> not<00:05:41.130> this<00:05:41.250> horn<00:05:41.520> back<00:05:41.820> a<00:05:41.849> little

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
whether it's not this horn back a little

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.420 
whether it's not this horn back a little
bit<00:05:42.270> now<00:05:42.750> watch<00:05:43.020> what<00:05:43.199> happens<00:05:43.349> you<00:05:44.159> can<00:05:44.310> just

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
bit now watch what happens you can just

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.129 
bit now watch what happens you can just
barely<00:05:44.699> see<00:05:44.909> the<00:05:45.270> other<00:05:45.419> horns<00:05:45.930> in<00:05:46.050> the

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
barely see the other horns in the

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.560 
barely see the other horns in the
background<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:46.979> instances<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.729> make<00:05:48.330> any

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
background of the instances and make any

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.020 
background of the instances and make any
sort<00:05:48.900> of<00:05:49.050> change<00:05:49.349> to<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:49.770> original<00:05:50.159> all<00:05:50.400> of

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
sort of change to the original all of

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.480 
sort of change to the original all of
the<00:05:51.180> instances<00:05:51.659> are<00:05:52.080> immediately<00:05:53.009> updated

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
the instances are immediately updated

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.399 
the instances are immediately updated
now<00:05:54.060> this<00:05:54.180> is<00:05:54.330> a<00:05:54.360> great<00:05:54.870> way<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.139> work

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
now this is a great way to work

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.040 
now this is a great way to work
especially<00:05:55.740> when<00:05:56.190> you're<00:05:56.310> when<00:05:56.729> you<00:05:56.849> have<00:05:57.050> you

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
especially when you're when you have you

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.350 
especially when you're when you have you
know<00:05:58.139> a<00:05:58.289> lot<00:05:58.740> of<00:05:58.770> objects<00:05:59.490> in<00:05:59.669> your<00:05:59.699> scene<00:05:59.849> that

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
know a lot of objects in your scene that

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.360 
know a lot of objects in your scene that
are<00:06:00.479> exactly<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:01.110> same<00:06:01.139> making<00:06:02.130> them<00:06:02.250> all

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
are exactly the same making them all

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.490 
are exactly the same making them all
instances<00:06:02.909> you<00:06:03.300> know<00:06:03.570> just<00:06:03.750> reduces<00:06:04.380> the

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
instances you know just reduces the

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.990 
instances you know just reduces the
amount<00:06:04.620> of<00:06:04.800> editing<00:06:05.219> that<00:06:05.340> you<00:06:05.460> have<00:06:05.669> to<00:06:05.849> do

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
amount of editing that you have to do

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.040 
amount of editing that you have to do
when<00:06:06.599> you<00:06:06.719> need<00:06:06.870> to<00:06:06.900> make<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.139> change<00:06:08.900> so<00:06:09.900> that's

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
when you need to make a change so that's

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.899 
when you need to make a change so that's
pretty<00:06:10.229> cool<00:06:10.320> we<00:06:10.560> can<00:06:10.620> also<00:06:10.770> go<00:06:10.949> back<00:06:11.130> in<00:06:11.340> let's

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 
pretty cool we can also go back in let's

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:13.580 
pretty cool we can also go back in let's
make<00:06:12.030> some<00:06:12.240> pretty<00:06:12.449> sweeping<00:06:12.810> changes<00:06:13.380> now

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
make some pretty sweeping changes now

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.770 
make some pretty sweeping changes now
let's<00:06:13.919> say<00:06:14.070> I<00:06:14.099> don't<00:06:14.370> know<00:06:14.580> we'll<00:06:15.150> take<00:06:15.330> the

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
let's say I don't know we'll take the

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.420 
let's say I don't know we'll take the
side<00:06:15.990> here<00:06:16.500> and<00:06:16.710> we'll<00:06:16.800> just<00:06:16.889> like<00:06:17.070> move<00:06:17.280> it

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
side here and we'll just like move it

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.120 
side here and we'll just like move it
out<00:06:17.580> some<00:06:18.349> there<00:06:19.349> you<00:06:19.500> go<00:06:19.590> and<00:06:19.740> you<00:06:19.830> can<00:06:19.889> see

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
out some there you go and you can see

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.120 
out some there you go and you can see
those<00:06:20.430> changes<00:06:20.460> are<00:06:21.090> you<00:06:21.599> immediately

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
those changes are you immediately

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.089 
those changes are you immediately
reflected<00:06:23.130> in<00:06:23.669> the<00:06:23.849> instances<00:06:24.479> as<00:06:24.719> well<00:06:25.440> so<00:06:26.009> if

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
reflected in the instances as well so if

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.520 
reflected in the instances as well so if
we<00:06:26.219> drop<00:06:26.430> the<00:06:26.580> tool<00:06:26.699> we<00:06:27.599> can<00:06:27.630> you<00:06:27.810> click<00:06:28.259> on<00:06:28.409> the

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
we drop the tool we can you click on the

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.450 
we drop the tool we can you click on the
instances<00:06:29.009> to<00:06:29.250> see<00:06:29.490> their<00:06:29.759> their<00:06:30.259> wireframe

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460

using instances the reference back to
the<00:06:48.460> original<00:06:48.760> shape<00:06:49.000> and<00:06:49.210> there<00:06:49.300> are<00:06:49.390> a<00:06:49.420> whole

the original shape and there are a whole
lot<00:06:49.690> faster<00:06:50.110> to<00:06:50.440> render<00:06:50.740> so<00:06:50.980> look<00:06:51.220> forward<00:06:51.490> to

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
lot faster to render so look forward to

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.650 
lot faster to render so look forward to
using<00:06:51.820> instances<00:06:52.510> in<00:06:52.690> your<00:06:53.110> own<00:06:53.230> workflow
