00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Well, I need to say that we are in 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.810
 minecraft 1.7 point 10 and we will see a 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.780
 mode a mod that deals with bags or 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.940
 backpacks or whatever the issue is that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.380
 there is a village here and this one has 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.870
 reindeer that I do not know lately but I 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.950
 they all left in herrera and this peta 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.930
 because it's 1.7 point 10 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.300
 and always lend this pressure I do not know 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.760
 but I'm always in order 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.110
 let's see what's there that I'm very 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.520
 busybody 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.500
 I want to know if there are good things 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.040
 although usually there usually are not 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.370
 good things good hey 7 obsidian 4 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.860
 3 apples of bread iron boots 4 of 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.290
 gold and affections of good people hear it 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.720
 the question is not entirely wrong 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.570
 this assembly of backpacks as you are 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.309
 watching here add backpacks of tier 1 and 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.790
 tier 2 of all colors and we want 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.130
 let's see some examples of tier 1 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.930
 different colors 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.930
 here are 32 papers 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.270
 for organ fat the question that I 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.290
 I always distract male the bag of tier 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.380
 1 of the black is made with four wool 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.630
 black four four-wire of these and 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.150
 a chest and to make the red ones 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.550
 it's just changing the colored wool 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.060
 the green the brown the blue so with all 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.890
 you are the tier 1 that as you can see 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.240
 all these spaces that is not good for me 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.910
 we can put the bag inside the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.460
 bag we tried to see if I would 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.650
 I know if game minecraft was destroyed but 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.560
 you can not not let me drag a 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.020
 pile but good is the one of tier 1 that does not 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.270
 it's wrong in its pretty enough space 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.119
 extra space on everything and then the one of 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.070
 certain that is made with six leather 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.640
 two iron and the bag has one 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.610
 this for all the bag of red of tier 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.550
 1 the green bag of tier 1 the case is the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.080
 same always and this one is full then 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.150
 there's the tier 2 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.210
 is that here they increase engines like 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.430
 another inventory more really and why 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.170
 we put this for example and we are left 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.450
 the backpack and inside is quite low and 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.460
 as I say or it is not all bad and 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.319
 then we have another bag we burn the 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.359
 very long white 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.340
 I think white is the one that all the 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.609
 world as is the white wool 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.739
 directly but we have this void back 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.659
 that this is done with four wool 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.519
 any color four threads and one 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.849
 interpellate and stress we are going to this this and 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.159
 this 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:39.189
 this this is not a door for 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.709
 example the versions that this bag is 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.749
 a garbage then we can put here 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.459
 things if we did not have the mail 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:47.260
 for example with him using the and already 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.659
 but if we do not have it 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.700
 we directly put it here and go 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.540
 eliminating things with shift too 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.890
 works 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.620
 I can not catch something else to see if 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.180
 we keep the shift and left click what 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.010
 get directly is pretty cool 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.810
 but with this you have to be careful of 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.879
 that more than one is going to go to some 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.200
 diamond over there by the way I think 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.299
 I do not put it 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.970
 this is the seed that I am that foolish 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.450
 with the ones of the dream it is and I do not put it 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.450
 these are the coordinates 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.330
 I do not know why but I forgot 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.750
 but hey this is the motor of your motorcycle 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.620
 he died seven areas that lately I 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.580
 just convinced you'll be there for 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.580
 all the eternity 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.350
 14 chicken too this is not bad 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.610
 He is a good con man 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.450
 I hope you liked it when you have 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.850
 the registration at 1.7 points 10 if 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.650
 is the comfort you have as always 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.690
 thank elephants may a lot 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.690
 yes all chao
