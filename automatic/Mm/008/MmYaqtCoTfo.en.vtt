I<00:02:35.860> have<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.010> win<00:02:37.190> or<00:02:37.900> miserable<00:02:40.240> it's<00:02:41.240> pure

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.900 

it's<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.620> only<00:02:45.739> thing<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:46.160> satisfies<00:02:46.760> you

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
it's the only thing that satisfies you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.839 
it's the only thing that satisfies you
that's<00:02:47.180> good

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
that's good

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.370 
that's good
there's<00:02:49.450> no<00:02:49.599> reason<00:02:49.989> for<00:02:50.319> second<00:02:50.980> place

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.140 

so<00:02:53.680> will<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:53.980> go<00:02:54.130> home

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
so will you go home

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.510 
so will you go home
it's<00:02:57.150> simple
