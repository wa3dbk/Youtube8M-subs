00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.630
 so then I can welcome them to 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.849
 press conference after today's game 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.520
 the lti pour in front of the sixers against the 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.840
 EisbÃ¤ren Bremerhaven endstand 80 to 114 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.970
 the first word belongs to the 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.670
 Guest coach dax bradley giant 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.879
 Compliments to the boys after three hours 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.559
 defeat in succession 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.530
 I know how hard that is in myself 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:51.989
 pour the music that is to him 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.160
 to bring the spectator out of the game 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 We did that from the beginning 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:08.080
 a very good performance 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.470
 I was waiting for that at some point like that 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.610
 playing a game we have my opinion 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 good players we do not have that unfortunately 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.160
 always shown the first player though 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.630
 think we just have one 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.369
 had these days and the boys have 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.549
 the deserved won so belfry and 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.200
 my players 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.430
 thank you mister spreng matthias yours 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.229
 word to the game short to victory that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.810
 definitely a deserved victory there is 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:43.900
 yes not much to say we have on 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.340
 at the beginning a bit kept but one 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.439
 must say very clearly today we were 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.780
 not since we were not awake and were 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.189
 not ready to start the fight 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.360
 from the beginning I think we are one 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.890
 were shocked by the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.189
 injury of prof had to with 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.200
 seven stitches are sewn to the hand 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.619
 and that was very important to us 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.200
 hurt on the position four 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.479
 but overall, of course, I am very 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.590
 very dissatisfied because we are just in the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.519
 Defense did not work at all and 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.739
 respect to bremerhaven 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.810
 they came from three very heavy ones 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:25.680
 play against very high-class teams 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.860
 and they have every throw today 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.860
 met 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.650
 yes there really is not to say that 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.030
 was not a nice game for us i feel 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.390
 I'm not feeling well after this game either 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.640
 that was yes that showed us and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.160
 shown us where we are so almost 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.349
 Thankfully, there are also questions 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.790
 on the other hand, that does not seem to be so 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.190
 then I would say thank you 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.590
 for us it is the next saturday after 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.890
 continue to do everything for the polar bear 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.540
 quality 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.540
 Thank you very much for coming home
