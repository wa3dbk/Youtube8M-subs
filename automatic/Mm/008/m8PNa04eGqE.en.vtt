when I get into the pattern I do my gum

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.860 
when I get into the pattern I do my gum
so<00:02:57.920> RC<00:02:58.310> comes<00:02:58.580> whichever<00:02:59.120> airplane<00:02:59.690> you're

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
so RC comes whichever airplane you're

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
so RC comes whichever airplane you're
flying<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.770> I<00:03:00.890> just<00:03:01.160> don't<00:03:01.430> do<00:03:01.700> see<00:03:02.090> Gump's<00:03:02.480> on

flying and I just don't do see Gump's on

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.580 
flying and I just don't do see Gump's on
downwind<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:04.370> do<00:03:04.460> see<00:03:04.850> gumps<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.330> base<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.990> do<00:03:06.200> see

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
downwind I do see gumps on base I do see

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.340 
downwind I do see gumps on base I do see
comes<00:03:06.860> on<00:03:07.100> final<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.850> do<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.210> a<00:03:08.360> half<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.840> mile<00:03:09.050> out

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
comes on final I do it a half a mile out

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.040 
comes on final I do it a half a mile out
and<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:10.550> I<00:03:10.610> got<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.090> make<00:03:11.180> sure<00:03:11.240> everything<00:03:11.930> is
