every<00:02:31.550> once<00:02:31.790> in<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.000> while<00:02:33.190> something<00:02:34.190> like

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
every once in a while something like

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.300 
every once in a while something like
this<00:02:34.640> appears<00:02:35.000> in<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.209> bag<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:37.780> just<00:02:39.310> can't

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
this appears in the bag and I just can't

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.830 
this appears in the bag and I just can't
find<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.970> project<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:42.410> it's<00:02:42.590> worthy<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.100> and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
find a project that it's worthy of and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.010 
find a project that it's worthy of and
so<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:45.230> put<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.709> up<00:02:45.800> on<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.070> shelf<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:47.750> one

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
so I put it up on the shelf and this one

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.259 
so I put it up on the shelf and this one
has<00:02:48.230> been<00:02:48.470> here<00:02:48.739> for<00:02:49.010> almost<00:02:49.250> three<00:02:49.730> years<00:02:49.760> now

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
has been here for almost three years now

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.509 
has been here for almost three years now
and<00:02:50.570> I<00:02:51.489> just<00:02:52.489> don't<00:02:52.670> know<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.800> think<00:02:54.800> I'd<00:02:54.920> be<00:02:55.100> sad

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
and I just don't know I think I'd be sad

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.830 
and I just don't know I think I'd be sad
if<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:57.110> didn't<00:02:57.500> have<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.310> shop<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.300> I

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
if I didn't have it in the shop and I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.570 
if I didn't have it in the shop and I
think<00:03:00.080> that's<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.500> sickness<00:03:00.920> right<00:03:01.130> there<00:03:01.370> is

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
think that's the sickness right there is

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.090 
think that's the sickness right there is
that<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.480> should<00:03:02.780> be<00:03:02.959> using<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.890> make<00:03:04.040> a

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
that I should be using it to make a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.060 
that I should be using it to make a
project<00:03:04.660> but<00:03:05.660> instead<00:03:05.930> they<00:03:06.080> go<00:03:06.230> this<00:03:06.890> would

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
project but instead they go this would

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.520 
project but instead they go this would
make<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.220> beautiful<00:03:07.489> tool<00:03:08.030> handle<00:03:08.480> when<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.350> take

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
make a beautiful tool handle when I take

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.240 
make a beautiful tool handle when I take
it<00:03:09.620> out<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.850> look<00:03:11.030> at<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.239> go<00:03:12.140> or<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.739> could

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
it out and I look at it go or I could

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.280 
it out and I look at it go or I could
use<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.519> piece<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.940> maple<00:03:14.150> maybe<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.989> piece<00:03:15.260> of

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.539 
I actually made two bowls out of this
blank<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:54.170> had<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:55.100> instead<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.400> just

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549
