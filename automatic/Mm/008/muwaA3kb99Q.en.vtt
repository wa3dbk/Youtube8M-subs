00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 and hello everyone as you probably already understood 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.259
 in my instagram and we are now 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.790
 on holiday 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.500
 but since you still watch it 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.389
 video that means internet is our hotel 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.370
 so much so that I just can't 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.080
 load nothing new so here you 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.090
 I'm a week old with wet hair 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.140
 and behind me by the way are hiding 2 not 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.789
 packed suitcases 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.500
 here is here we have Interstellar and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.449
 today so as not to skip 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.340
 monday and thursday this week so 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.320
 how maximum places were let out of him 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.210
 gallery and we will multiply at last but together 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.250
 go on vacation and shoot a video for you 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.290
 the most favorite is essential for me 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.670
 the question is the answer is moisture recently in 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.710
 they just gave me a huge amount 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.510
 which answer questions 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.579
 pleasure to articulate the way yes 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.230
 the next video will be about shopping in june 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.789
 she will be very messy in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.710
 fragmentary because there are many of them 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.270
 seriously talk about shopping and yes 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.789
 I now for the plane remains somewhere 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.340
 about 4 hours so what are we waiting for 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.320
 drove polina how do you manage so 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.109
 a lot and so quickly read involved 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.910
 and if I have super powers 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.739
 honestly a little surprised that the reader does not 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.809
 so many people are now calling 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.549
 such a surprise resonance I will say right away that 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.170
 I absolutely always preferred a couple 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.270
 watch honors rather than see 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 TV yes I read about 2 hours in 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.500
 the day it turns out 14 hours a week 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.119
 if I can, I don’t think it is beyond 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.630
 of course I would like to read a lot 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.920
 more 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.200
 and in general I sometimes get created 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.460
 the impression that now I do not know Russia 18 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.259
 century when can only read 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.000
 limited minority and this is me 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.920
 frankly grieves me for example and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.560
 reading entered into the good old habit and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 these two hours of reading 24-hour days 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.950
 fly for me the truth is just like 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.720
 second and for those who asks 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.729
 you can start to develop your speech above 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.259
 read my read as much as possible 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.670
 try so pick literature 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.530
 to most of what you 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.020
 read you liked and over time i 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.670
 I think 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.990
 it is inevitable you will not notice how 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.829
 go to quality literature 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.090
 even if you started I do not know from the Don and 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.369
 the following questions how do you feel about 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.350
 advertising in social networks is very, very 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.090
 positive now oddly in 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.799
 world as I understand it there is no but 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.659
 Russia has a shameful situation 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.880
 earn what you like on 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.649
 your hobby is on your hobbies and on that 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.209
 something honest I don’t know why but 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.130
 for creative work for some reason 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.869
 shame and no matter you open 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.530
 advertising do or hidden you care 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.090
 sold out 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.799
 but for some reason nobody takes it to rotate 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.630
 that people who are engaged in creativity 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.760
 24 hours a day dedicates this 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.620
 absolutely all the free time they have no time 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.360
 I need to work, that is also with me 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.250
 now my channel eats about two 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.900
 my weekend days a week but if you 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.459
 the video came out more often it would have turned out 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.200
 which is potentially my work day 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.760
 ate soup so basically no 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.079
 costs other than just the greatest 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.030
 man-hours per 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.099
 video production I have not done to me yet 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.170
 honestly mail about 20-30 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.489
 youtube ads but me 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.500
 this is not interesting because 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.239
 shower video blogging is certainly a hobby 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.250
 but when suddenly I realize that I want to improve 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.690
 video quality video quality 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.700
 effects do not know or buy for example 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.690
 camera with a side screen that look 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.760
 there they are on you 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.260
 then of course I will spend money on it but also 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.120
 especially I do not understand aggressive 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.920
 comments whose essence can be reduced to 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.870
 Fu sold to the people for whom 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.609
 youtube is for example a profession that is 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.440
 they produce so much content 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.090
 which is simply impossible to cram into these 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.040
 two days a week and then another 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.840
 week worked at all if a blogger 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.940
 suitable choice advertising deliberately not 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.739
 exchanging for anybody and if gi and banks 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.940
 filter papers and this is all I choose 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.889
 just what he really likes 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.569
 then it seems the opposite to me 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.340
 some kind of professionalism person 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.989
 because like me a man who 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.579
 some big big company 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.349
 chose as my medium conduct 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.370
 your ideas on the contrary inspire great 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.659
 trust and if it is all these nested 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.640
 funds are used for some 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.110
 self-development of your content then 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.549
 what could be more beautiful on and in 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.739
 principle, the Internet is exactly the same 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.360
 advertising how much and on your unarmed 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.680
 the look is visible on the street and it seems to me 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.090
 it is quite adequate if you 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.860
 you earn money 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.599
 making some money and not even worth 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.159
 on this occasion to make excuses because 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.690
 damn it seems to me absolutely everything 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.360
 dreamed of making money including 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.549
 like such things are helpful you plan 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.500
 Do you continue to lead lidiyu channel l. 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.060
 and moreover I even plan to him somehow 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.829
 improve further as for 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.810
 technical pribluda I already for example 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.030
 I got a microphone buttonhole yes yes I 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.680
 spent and I hope that soon the time 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.510
 I can use it and as for 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.040
 some kind of internal components frame this 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.840
 most likely in the near future we 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.519
 let's move when you probably finally 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.620
 You can say goodbye to this rack 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.329
 so you know and actually here before 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.069
 you on the mole on ksyushu so I hope 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.900
 that this too will change soon 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.220
 but I also do not exclude 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.170
 opportunities that videos will be coming out 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.329
 more often 2 times a week but it is provided 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.979
 the fact that I will work less and so far 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.530
 that the only barrier between me and 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.510
 three videos a week of fields to tell 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.490
 my best friends really for 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.380
 me my very best friend is 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.000
 my mom I'm just a little representatives 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.979
 probably not a single thing that I would not 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.780
 could anyone tell her here my 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.639
 mom watches all my videos gives me 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.440
 Of course, cool tips hello little 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.150
 In general, mom is the person who we are I 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.740
 just peremptorily trusts 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.479
 for example, only yo-yo ma would trust 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.310
 its little white valve time 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.169
 vacation and yes harley for several hours 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.090
 like my mom in them and so I understand 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.760
 now there is an idyll west highland white 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.160
 download a terrier polinochka 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.849
 audio rutracker yes mom ama 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.070
 crime 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.810
 maybe I missed a mate somewhere 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.190
 what makeup do you use every 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.020
 I don't use every day 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.789
 I paint with cosmetics so much either 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.590
 video or paint me makeup artist for 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.270
 some filming but now on her two 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.250
 proofreaders I mix them to find 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.750
 your mascara color lip gloss and bottom 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.639
 I only care cosmetics 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.650
 night cream if not forget and yes 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.690
 for example changing 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.160
 14-16 year old girls with cosmetics 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.020
 probably more in weight than them 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.550
 own weight and yes it seems to me that no 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.800
 nothing more beautiful than freshness and 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.960
 youthful ecstasy most frequently asked 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.640
 the question lately is more correct it is not 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.440
 question and please tell me about it 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.670
 admission to journalism and guys I think 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.710
 that this information will be extremely 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.000
 actual for you because it was 8 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.500
 years ago as far as I remember for 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.570
 Receipt handed over in Russian 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.790
 stories in Russian I was like 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.350
 97 points but I won't be honest in history 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.420
 I don’t remember how much I remember then 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.570
 our fakie 97 shaft was calculated as 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.850
 score three as 98 points 99 points this 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.680
 4 and 100 points this five on history 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.690
 sort of like we and his scores were rated 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.280
 as a four, well, a creative contest and 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.440
 I handed over literature directly 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.970
 you parrot got fives for that 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.740
 I basically do not go to the budget 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.510
 It was difficult but the second time I 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.550
 God blessed you with art criticism 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.590
 it was hot because with their creative 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.000
 competition simply nothing beats not 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.590
 I know how now because it was that 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.750
 which is quite a few years ago but then 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.940
 creative competition could have a stupor at 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.040
 he had two parts 1 part this test 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.810
 because there were questions in the spirit of and what 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.520
 will be if you are with a teacher apart 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.140
 play the Russian roulette exam 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.120
 who was the author of the cover of any of 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.890
