00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.889 
studied the intricacies of the light and
found<00:01:47.130> out<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> way<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:48.060> create<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> completely

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
found out a way to create a completely

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
found out a way to create a completely
invisible<00:01:49.290> light<00:01:49.649> by<00:01:49.890> infusing<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.399> file<00:01:50.700> with

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
invisible light by infusing a file with

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.749 
invisible light by infusing a file with
the<00:01:51.060> raw<00:01:51.210> light<00:01:52.189> while<00:01:53.189> there's<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.520> lot<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the raw light while there's a lot of

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.940 
the raw light while there's a lot of
lights<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.960> file<00:01:55.229> contains<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
lights in that this file contains a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.429 
lights in that this file contains a
created<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.810> concentrated<00:01:57.810> extract<00:01:58.290> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
created and a concentrated extract of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.230 
created and a concentrated extract of
gaseous<00:01:58.799> alumina<00:01:59.369> they<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.000> released

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
gaseous alumina they can be released

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.959 
gaseous alumina they can be released
through<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.290> right<00:02:01.530> click<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.100> will<00:02:02.729> spread

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
through a right click and will spread

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.550 
through a right click and will spread
relatively<00:02:03.540> fast<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> nearby<00:02:04.439> area

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
relatively fast in the nearby area

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.880 
relatively fast in the nearby area
lighting<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.899> requires<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.649> glass

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
lighting it up so it requires a glass

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.839 
lighting it up so it requires a glass
file<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> catalyst<00:02:08.819> also<00:02:09.330> requires<00:02:09.899> tener

sixteen looks and eight motifs and that

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.170 
sixteen looks and eight motifs and that
will<00:02:14.060> give<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.329> the<00:02:14.510> gaseous<00:02:15.049> alumina<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.730> let

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
will give you the gaseous alumina so let

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.140 
will give you the gaseous alumina so let
me<00:02:17.269> actually<00:02:17.390> go<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:18.879> peaceful<00:02:19.879> because<00:02:20.090> I
