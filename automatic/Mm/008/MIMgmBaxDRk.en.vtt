00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
put half-inch grid marks on that now you

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.950 
put half-inch grid marks on that now you
notice<00:00:24.280> around<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.670> mouth<00:00:24.910> and<00:00:24.940> the<00:00:25.360> eyes<00:00:25.390> I

those<00:00:31.510> areas<00:00:31.960> on<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.289> 16<00:00:32.770> by<00:00:32.920> 20<00:00:33.430> because<00:00:34.030> I

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
those areas on the 16 by 20 because I

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.080 
those areas on the 16 by 20 because I
want<00:00:34.630> to<00:00:34.750> make<00:00:35.050> those<00:00:35.290> more<00:00:35.620> detailed<00:00:36.190> so<00:00:36.910> I'm

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
want to make those more detailed so I'm

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.760 
want to make those more detailed so I'm
just<00:00:37.270> going<00:00:37.450> to<00:00:37.510> transfer<00:00:37.780> what<00:00:38.260> I<00:00:38.290> see<00:00:38.620> in

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
just going to transfer what I see in

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.090 
just going to transfer what I see in
these<00:00:38.920> boxes<00:00:39.520> over<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.630> drawing<00:00:40.930> so<00:00:41.800> once

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
these boxes over to the drawing so once

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.010 
these boxes over to the drawing so once
you<00:00:42.250> get<00:00:42.399> the<00:00:42.520> grid<00:00:42.760> in<00:00:42.940> place<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.630> begin

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
you get the grid in place you begin

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.370 
you get the grid in place you begin
going<00:00:44.380> line<00:00:45.100> by<00:00:45.130> line<00:00:45.399> box<00:00:46.149> by<00:00:46.540> box<00:00:46.570> just

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
going line by line box by box just

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.500 
going line by line box by box just
flowing<00:00:47.800> from<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:48.460> grid<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:49.210> make<00:00:49.360> sure

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
flowing from the grid to make sure

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.740 
flowing from the grid to make sure
everything<00:00:49.870> is<00:00:49.899> perfectly<00:00:50.440> proportional<00:00:51.750> now

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
everything is perfectly proportional now

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.780 
everything is perfectly proportional now
why<00:00:52.930> do<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.110> do<00:00:53.290> it<00:00:53.320> upside<00:00:53.710> down<00:00:53.770> you<00:00:54.160> do<00:00:54.760> it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
why do you do it upside down you do it

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.580 
why do you do it upside down you do it
upside<00:00:55.030> down<00:00:55.239> because<00:00:55.630> this<00:00:55.930> forces<00:00:56.410> you<00:00:56.559> to

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
upside down because this forces you to

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.130 
upside down because this forces you to
draw<00:00:56.890> what<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:57.309> see<00:00:58.030> instead<00:00:58.660> of<00:00:58.899> drawing

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
draw what you see instead of drawing

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.170 
draw what you see instead of drawing
what<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.559> think<00:01:00.040> something<00:01:00.760> should<00:01:00.969> look

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
what you think something should look

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.990 
what you think something should look
like<00:01:01.210> so<00:01:02.140> in<00:01:02.350> working<00:01:02.590> on<00:01:03.040> an<00:01:03.370> area<00:01:03.550> like<00:01:03.969> a

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
like so in working on an area like a

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.090 
like so in working on an area like a
nose<00:01:04.390> you're<00:01:04.869> drawing<00:01:05.139> shades<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.889> shadows

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
nose you're drawing shades and shadows

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.489 
nose you're drawing shades and shadows
and<00:01:06.490> lines<00:01:06.789> instead<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.509> drawing<00:01:08.229> what<00:01:08.409> you

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:08.499 
and lines instead of drawing what you

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:10.620 
and lines instead of drawing what you
think<00:01:08.889> a<00:01:09.039> nose<00:01:09.249> should<00:01:09.429> look<00:01:09.670> like<00:01:09.700> or<00:01:10.209> as<00:01:10.420> I'm

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
think a nose should look like or as I'm

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.440 
think a nose should look like or as I'm
working<00:01:10.990> on<00:01:11.079> here<00:01:11.380> an<00:01:11.530> ear<00:01:11.979> if<00:01:12.579> you'll<00:01:13.090> notice

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
area here I had to really speed up this

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.399 
area here I had to really speed up this
part<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.880> video<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:05.569> took<00:02:05.840> me<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.050> long

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
part of the video this took me a long

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.279 
part of the video this took me a long
time<00:02:06.819> whenever<00:02:07.819> I<00:02:07.909> work<00:02:08.149> on<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.630> mouth<00:02:08.869> or<00:02:09.259> the

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
time whenever I work on the mouth or the

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.800 
time whenever I work on the mouth or the
eyes<00:02:09.530> which<00:02:10.039> are<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.220> most<00:02:10.489> detailed<00:02:11.030> areas<00:02:11.330> I

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
eyes which are the most detailed areas I

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.650 
eyes which are the most detailed areas I
spend<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.560> lot<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.860> time<00:02:13.250> notice<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.299> lighting

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
spend a lot of time notice the lighting

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.630 
spend a lot of time notice the lighting
just<00:02:14.900> changed<00:02:15.319> in<00:02:15.440> my<00:02:15.560> sweatshirt<00:02:15.860> because<00:02:16.610> I

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
just changed in my sweatshirt because I

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.420 
just changed in my sweatshirt because I
actually<00:02:16.970> worked<00:02:17.480> on<00:02:17.630> this<00:02:17.840> over<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.500> three<00:02:19.250> day

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
actually worked on this over a three day

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.479 
actually worked on this over a three day
period<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.660> took<00:02:20.870> me<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.410> total<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:22.130> ten

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
period and so it took me a total of ten

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.570 
period and so it took me a total of ten
hours<00:02:23.030> over<00:02:23.870> three<00:02:24.170> days<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.799> I'm<00:02:25.190> doing<00:02:25.459> the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.360 
notice I use my finger on the picture so
I<00:03:29.150> stay<00:03:29.750> within<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.170> boxes<00:03:30.650> as<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:31.069> get<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.340> my

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
I stay within the boxes as I get to my

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.360 
I stay within the boxes as I get to my
eye<00:03:31.489> over<00:03:32.030> here<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.239> actually<00:03:32.569> use<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.370> blown-up

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
eye over here I actually use a blown-up

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.120 
eye over here I actually use a blown-up
picture<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:35.180> our<00:03:35.329> eyes<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.109> they're<00:03:36.290> huge<00:03:36.889> and

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
picture of our eyes so they're huge and

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.759 
picture of our eyes so they're huge and
I<00:03:37.250> can<00:03:37.400> see<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.609> lot<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.090> detail<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.139> really

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
I can see a lot of detail to really

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.039 
I can see a lot of detail to really
create<00:03:40.580> a<00:03:40.640> tremendous<00:03:41.150> amount<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.480> detail<00:03:41.659> in

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
create a tremendous amount of detail in

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.920 
create a tremendous amount of detail in
the<00:03:42.170> eyes<00:03:42.349> I<00:03:42.769> think<00:03:43.459> those<00:03:43.849> capture<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.750> most

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
the eyes I think those capture the most

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.119 
the eyes I think those capture the most
of<00:03:45.140> your<00:03:45.290> personality

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
of your personality

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.369 
of your personality
and<00:03:46.340> need<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:46.909> be<00:03:47.030> detailed<00:03:47.719> now<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.079> notice

the<00:03:48.469> other<00:03:48.620> eye<00:03:48.709> just<00:03:49.069> magically<00:03:49.579> appeared

the other eye just magically appeared

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.789 
the other eye just magically appeared
that's<00:03:50.420> because<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.019> camera<00:03:51.560> got

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
that's because the camera got

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.679 
that's because the camera got
accidentally<00:03:52.340> turned<00:03:52.640> off<00:03:52.939> during<00:03:53.420> that
