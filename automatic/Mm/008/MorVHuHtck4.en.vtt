00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.929
 here 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.929
 m 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.730
 yes hello to all my enemies welcome 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.380
 on be tv still as part of the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.529
 prayer we will see what is the report 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.779
 that exists between regeneration it's up to 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.310
 say the transformation is to pray 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 remember that last time we 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.080
 had seen that because of the character to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.269
 because of what some people do not 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.489
 are not united yet they are not 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:36.449
 able to pray in accordance with the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.519
 God's will 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.290
 but effective prayer is first of all a 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.879
 prayer that is consistent with the will of 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.489
 god because we can not really 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.180
 know how to pray as long as you do not know 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.950
 not first what is our identity 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.570
 in Christ and more secondly what is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.210
 our heritage because what you have 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.000
 to know how well liked is that accepted 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.629
 christ whose opinion implies a change 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.420
 identity 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.850
 the Bible tells us that accepting 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.739
 Christ implies that we become a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.869
 new well- liked creation located at 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.520
 accept christ according to the Bible that is 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.259
 become a new creation and makes 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.119
 same bible of says that things 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.440
 old ones are gone and all things 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.259
 have become a new because 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.810
 before receiving jesus you were a 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.610
 in accepting crisis allows you 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.799
 to move from the race of Adam to that of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.420
 christ has in his long fishermen to 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.060
 dance is so who is bound by the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.590
 sin danced wind that is deprived of the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.509
 glory of the private team the presence 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.390
 of god who is deprived of the life of god 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.310
 and that's what you were before 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.189
 know Christ and now that you are 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.479
 in christ I have a new name the word 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.890
 of god tells us that your old man has 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.750
 been destroyed 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.700
 the word of God also tells us that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.439
 you already received the holy spirit the spirit of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.649
 god who gives the ability to be able 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.020
 live the life I want you to live the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.479
 ability to discern who you 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.250
 gives the ability to think 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.009
 as god to be able to communicate with 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.219
 him to be transformed by him and to 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.909
 final to be in his image then know 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.160
 who are you 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.700
 ie this transformation this 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.829
 difference of fact that you have gone da 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.239
 donate to christ, that is to say from the old 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.920
 man you were to who you are 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.540
 today know who you are 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.150
 is what drives you so in the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.340
 regeneration process that is to say 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.199
 of transformation of your thought so the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.810
 regeneration process so who will you 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.480
 allows 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.940
 to think like god and you go 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.590
 able to pray according to his 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.390
 will 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.880
 so so that's the first aspect it's 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.500
 very important to know who you are from 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.660
 know what it means for you 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.150
 having home knowing such 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.340
 that this new man now belongs 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.250
 to god's government which is the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.349
 kingdom of god which is a kingdom where one 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.170
 do everything to love his neighbor where we 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.610
 do everything to live in peace with the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.080
 others we do not lie we do not steal 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.530
 no longer lives in advertising 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.060
 I came out of the kingdom of darkness because 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.310
 that before he was subject to this kingdom to 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.140
 this satan government a government 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.340
 where we can fly as we want when we 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.730
 hurts his neighbor we can 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.690
 hate hate and that's so it's very 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.099
 important that you understand this 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.900
 difference there I went from race 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.880
 from Adam to the race of Christ so 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.739
 now what is meant to enter the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.739
 process that will allow you to 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.630
 conform to your new identity of te 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.209
 comply but to the government 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.410
 I belong henceforth as and 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.860
 as you conform to this 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.650
 government 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.480
 thought transformed and then gradually 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.070
 you end up doing prayers 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.540
 as I have as I say conforms to 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.910
 the will of God and therefore prayers 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.109
 effective the second aspect concerns your 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.450
 well- loved inheritance you must know 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.470
 also what happened at the cross 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.720
 because it happened something to 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.239
 the cross that makes you have an inheritance 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.590
 jesus you have all he endured to 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.580
 the cross is not in vain it was not 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.190
 not fair 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.680
 for the story because jesus lived 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.860
 it was actually to give you a gift 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.870
 that's justification in healing 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.130
 whose peace and the experienced 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.320
 For example, do you worry that you 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.270
 can have peace he was he was 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.280
 rejected so that you are no longer 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.800
 never rejected why not a live that 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.690
 never a situation of rejection and skin 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.760
 nude humiliation for you to be 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.350
 spared from the shame of what is 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.200
 honors and all that so that you can 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.620
 on the contrary live the honor and the 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.570
 glory 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.850
 it was actually all that jesus has 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.230
 experienced on the cross it was for 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.320
 that you are spared 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.700
 so so all these things there peace 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.940
 healing the honor the acceptance that 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.960
 oppose the rejection the justification 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.000
 I was sentenced for you 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.710
 to justify all these things there are 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.070
 buttocks and things you already have 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.480
 it's very important that you know that 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.100
 these things you have them they are 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.960
 maybe not manifest maybe 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.730
 satan the thief went through there they 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.320
 try to kill rhdp what you jesus 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.960
 have already given because he knows you 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.430
 ignore you have these things embellished 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.490
 but it's important that you know 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.450
 of all these things are part of 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.040
 your heritage and knowing that 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.020
 are part of your TD heritage in 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.190
 the prayer of that fact that when you go 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.820
 prayed for example you're not going to pray for 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.740
 claim the justification is not going 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.720
 pray to claim to be here to be 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.760
 justified because the justification you 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.100
 already have if you accept Jesus in your 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.860
 you're already justified, you're not going 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.460
 pray for having I do not know about life 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.320
 eternal 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.480
 because you already have him he died for 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.890
 that you are life what I would like 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.900
 to tell you win but it is that there are 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.669
 things you do not have to 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.160
 claim things you have to 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.870
 simply called to the demonstration 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.820
 and if you observe the constraint of these 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.470
 things that from what I do not have him 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.080
 to give to the cross 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.550
 you must remind the invader 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.169
 the sick entities I have to remind to 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.680
 the invader quillan that he is in 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.120
 offense in your life because the 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.800
 Bible tells us that she was bruised 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.500
 because you are cured 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.419
 so healing that tempt her 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.710
 something that you automatically have as 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.310
 it 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.870
 because the cure was paid to the 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.250
 golgotha prod compared to these 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.530
 things that Jesus gave us at the cross 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.300
 we must pray for the event 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.980
 when he took for the manifestation of 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.900
 what I said has already given to lacroix 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.660
 rice you're doing a prayer just do you make a 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.610
 appropriate prayer because we must not 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.860
 claimed we did not ask jo what 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.720
 CCC has already given somewhere 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.880
 disbelief and I know from experience 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.770
 that I do not appreciate this kind of praying 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.480
 it means you do not know you do not 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.950
 do not recognize where you ignore what Jesus 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.570
 to do the cross and it's serious because 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.190
 that it's a sacrifice he missed and I 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.350
 know that it's very important for our 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.350
 god that each of his children realize 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.220
 the depth of sacrificing yourself from 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.510
 sacrifice of Jesus 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.270
 so it's very important to start 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.620
 blessed by understanding what it is him to 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.550
 to do the cross what does it imply 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.250
 the cross of Jesus 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.870
 but what does it mean for you 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.730
 to accept this jesus in your life by the 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.840
 grace of God I will come back on this 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.590
 point because I you at this mini but 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.240
 it's things you have to understand 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.550
 things to understand for 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.110
 to be in harmony with two friends on the 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.940
 same wavelength as him for 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.040
 move forward with him 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.670
 so here I wanted to talk about these 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.740
 two points concerning our particular 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.620
 identity in jesus what is changing 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.120
 the importance to understand everything that you 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.370
 no longer the one you were and that you 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.660
 now represent a new 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:23.420
 creation with some requirements here 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.310
 and especially in the main one is to be 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.530
 regenerate to change mentality of 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.360
 conform to the culture of the kingdom where
