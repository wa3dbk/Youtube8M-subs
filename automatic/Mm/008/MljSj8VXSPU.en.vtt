00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
this fine all the oldest dinosaurs were

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.080 
this fine all the oldest dinosaurs were
all<00:01:49.380> equally<00:01:49.890> old<00:01:50.130> from<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> same<00:01:50.700> place<00:01:50.850> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
all equally old from the same place in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.670 
all equally old from the same place in
Argentina<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.720> those<00:01:51.899> sediments<00:01:52.259> are<00:01:52.530> about

Argentina and those sediments are about
230<00:01:53.490> million<00:01:53.790> years<00:01:54.240> old<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.930> pushes<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
230 million years old so this pushes the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.200 
230 million years old so this pushes the
dinosaur<00:01:55.740> lineage<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> closest<00:01:56.820> relative
