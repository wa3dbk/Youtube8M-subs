00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.240
 speak now because i'm strong at the beginning 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.180
 explain about the fact that I turned 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:22.080
 Season 2 In Season 1 The fact is that I decided 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.320
 well I thought that in two seasons it would be 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.230
 somehow wrong and as a matter of fact a 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.699
 no different because now I 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.759
 I do not want to destroy the server 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.860
 not only because with the help 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.149
 fu ca n't write your letter 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.750
 server there plus here it was looking for nero 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.329
 admin but I only know from krx collection 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.960

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:54.500
 narex crafting i will do the destruction a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.120
 so i decided to review this server 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.180
 just as well, as a kiva propiarili 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.340
 in my VKontakte group they wrote that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.700
 server is very cool in general but now 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.430
 we'll see how cool he is 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.740
 which I honestly got sick a lot so not 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.280
 pay attention because the channel 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:20.880
 emptying now something dogs become a 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.390
 down and you need to stick activity 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.729
 in the evening there is nobody here so on 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.610
 server beautiful shop can not write 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.729
 beautiful stores these Russians eat not 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.009

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.579
 Welcome who gave our good 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.579
 to work for parker server 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:58.679
 steam in the army 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 well in general let's go to warp apartments they 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.659
 I write everything in English, as I understand it, but 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.719
 they get a parker something like this 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.619
 This type of distribution tables are made. 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.549
 enchantment is natural to me without 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.269
 treatment 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:20.370
 you liked more I do not know who but 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:22.110
 personal posture seems to me so much up 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.360
 more precisely, everything here is a cake which we 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.190
 we can poem portal to hell which we 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.260
 come back later and the portal to the edge 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.610
 here and never understood people who 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.269
 do spawn portal to hell 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.250
 and even more so in the edge okay there in from but 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.510

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:44.549
 immediately move and we what are you doing 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.700
 prove there is no dragon here 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.220
 understand don't write comments like that 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.139

 do here i'm here i'm not one here 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:01.040
 I say that the admin of these servers is very 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.470
 bad people if they themselves are something from 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.090

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.470
 smells if you paid for hosting 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:35.400

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.049
 Little 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.560
