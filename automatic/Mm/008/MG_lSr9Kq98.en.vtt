00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.660
 effective 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.240
 hello to all the highlights of the week and well it's a new 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.120
 challenge of the lievremont brand authority after lens bitter 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.610
 defeat against tonga as well saturday and to talk about which morning 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.810
 near the editorial office of sport24 jean-baptiste maunier and we receive the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.860
 Karabagh has ten French stadiums and Arnaud Coudry is a specialist 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.710
 regular it of the sports service of the figaro bourgeois trudel I do not care 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.790
 retired stone a phrase five themes this weekend she pronounced 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.840
 by marc lièvremont that the players do in me I ask only that 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.319
 yesterday sunday marc lièvremont 

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:41.910
 surrendered 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.620
 I do not know if we can say that what is certain is that they wait 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.730
 in addition to independence from his group 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.930
 it's something that was normally 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.480
 we have often seen in the past that because the group is a little bit 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.520
 vain to come off a little bit of 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.820
 of the coach it worked better but it was before a context 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.570
 different there it's true that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.890
 we see him doing the lot, that is to say 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.900
 sometimes in e to go away and be very severe towards his players facing 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.940
 to the press what is still quite often had already spoken about it and 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.730
 then the day before and resigned himself not sworn of arsenal and there it looks like 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.030
 confess a little bit stuck yesterday that his captors now ask me 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.920
 do not believe I believe he is 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.830
 in % 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.490
 a little confused by what was happening 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.710
 it is I think it is expected before scenario taxes 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.859
 percent and that and that today they change their thinking 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.069
 and small even changes answers in press conference from where this kind of 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.670
 sentence 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 nevertheless that which disappointed me the most customers in this situation the 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.659
 behavior the world 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.210
 no player behavior 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.159
 in the canton of isle-daydain will have enough 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.359
 the cult series on the ground at the time of the blatant commitment 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.019
 to bounce back what you were saying right now he asks players to 

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:49.280
 take power he totally 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.110
 cut off all heads two groups as soon as a player a little character 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.540
 it is thought that julien dupuy at bastareaud fritz jauzion copé has not retained them 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.810
 so in a moment if I want the players to take 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.119
 the things in hand to find the point of yielding leaders and then of 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.329
 places guys who asserts itself even if we have one in the fifteenth of France but we 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.300
 can 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.909
 it would have been that 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.869
 the guy is not beautiful 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.250
 shoulders to take things in hand actually incidentally by a lot of 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.680
 of responsibility to each other 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.959
 so listen to human imanol harinordoquy thierry tilly apparently 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.390
 areva to take his responsibilities from the players as how to help one has 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.560
 thought also the contribution at the last moment 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.399
 we do not have enough 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.669
 took things in hand we were too spectators of what happened from the 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.819
 way in his tour 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.019
 but I believe there have been some incidents of this dairy group that 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.039
 have to take their responsibilities and I belong to them elsewhere and 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.419
 that's what's missing today really it's over 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.179
 you can not talk about that you have to wear at least 1000 rome for example 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:48.890
 someone chasing 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.320
 rarely to coal that but the head 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.330
 but the problem is that he does not talk much that is not very expansive 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.269
 also worry is that we have other ideas we have almost all 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.789
 lines we share we can think of angoulême servat late aurélien 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:02.889
 blush behind 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.969
 I do not understand why sega lane 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.229
 of course it's not revolt when you do not have 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.699
 no reaction against anyone 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.899
 it's a little reducer of the leading capelle houses that are not relentless 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.879
 a guaranteed place 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.769
 that's for sure it's a recurring problem 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.639
 because there is a counter-performance when all is well we never ask ourselves 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.809
 kind of questions 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.969
 because we are in a dynamic of victory and things are being done 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.359
 of themselves but when things go wrong sometimes you have to know stop and say 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.259
 sometimes even against the coherent authority that meant by that 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.600
 by marc lièvremont and sporting is what naulleau me who follow 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.349
 maybe the players have 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.329
 to swallow some snakes at times we would do without things 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.409
 who 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.100
 the itki disappointed the group 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.150
 and he would have been aware moment but they did not want to blame 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
 against and the coach and those of his staff 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.570
 but then it goes bad 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.570
 % and I think that's what 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.179
 do not be ashamed 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.999
 pressed where it hurt but mr years will be recruited on the situation 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.129
 in an outfit today only - what I denounce this group is able 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.459
 to revolt to mobilize on the challenge tour yes I think so 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.879
 after as arnaud said 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.229
 it is true that 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.049
 rumors 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.720
 in time of the selection choices for the world cup 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.260
 world I think there is a link to someone like sylvain marconnet and 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.430
 as I like curious like yannick jauzion as sébastien chabal 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.450
 without meaning 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.809
 number of people who in these conditions 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:27.249
 percent had the legitimacy to 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:31.080
 she just pressed these points demers monde asked me that 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.280
 a straight talk 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.830
 despite that today there are still players like the old camp 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.550
 so are cars that have a lot of experience at nianing boys like 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.710
 we like it like 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.120
 lionel nallet in front 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.300
 like that of the jumper once this club and players who are recognized recognized and 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.020
 respected 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.770
 it's helping their teammates 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.639
 I I think I do not think it comes from a first 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.520
 you have to change something that's clear 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.400
 and it's not too late we're lucky 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.089
 with 7 me on these color pictures 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:04.289
 really bad that we made to be in quarterfinal cup of the 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.729
 world it is not necessary to gurgle what one can be in the final of the world cup with 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.439
 Thierry Dautoir very interesting choice is what you said 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.660
 if it's what these players in front 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.270
 before the best of the protesters 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.020
 let's not leave a little too much today people who arrive at 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.430
 been a seamless support 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.659
 the sequelae 9 tasteless it takes 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.689
 not just say for support any cost% is ok 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.819
 fall into the catastrophism arnaud it's a French evil a little balm 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.710
 practice at all goes 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.729
 note also the stick to be beaten black as much harm to 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.470
 find them positive defects of things 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.620
 interesting so the world 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.270
 it can also be a force for 2 011 is alone against all we are 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.180
 now we do not go there we all have an aperitif see them show that they have 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.670
 wrong 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.310
 I think we have to tell them 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.509
 also that 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:49.470
 obviously 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.230
 even if they know that we can not be satisfied and they can not 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.729
 to satisfy benefits 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.439
 especially the match against tonga 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.860
 that's normal but after that they actually know that 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.139
 people there for his demanding not what they want to see another image of 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.119
 The french team 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:06.259
 and I join 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:07.949
 in clear on it obviously 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:12.070
 we are we are sad today we go to England we want to see a 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.789
 other team of France but that's still the ground which is more 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:16.889
 problematic is everything that happens outside 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.510
 for all these controversies this comparison 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.400
 quina that has no place to be with what happened in south africa for 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.639
 the football world cup 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.260
 not too big that it does not make sense when we are not in the 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:28.950
 world in the same context 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.150
 with players who are still looking for the same behavior 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.369
 not to make parallel 

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:36.039
 kiki that have no place to be today the team is not 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.330
 om performer since all this time and that's what is very surprising 

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:40.540
 it's their body 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.590
 the 10% for China constitutes with the journalists 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.180
 tomorrow it looks like it's identified with 1 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.660
 the order of things that is there who do not order who does not even ask him 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.660
 so that's it in five years we want it to stop 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:55.469
 that the team of France 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:58.599
 this name respectively and some years 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.180
 and how are we going to know where he is 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.340
 and that with it delivers the best possible match between England and of course 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.630
 we can beat them 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.780
 it's clear and the water will be your TV to support them and 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.020
 and then after we never know what can happen if we beat England this 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.689
 that we are able to do even if in world cup it was difficult by 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:19.479
 the past behind there is a semi-final against the team of denials 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.430
 shoots again and after on a match in less 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.400
 so we know what date it represents in this current doldrums 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.419
 can still if the song 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:29.740
 and axel weber 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.889
 for the explanations and we meet again tomorrow for the look of 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:33.440
 the editor's guest
