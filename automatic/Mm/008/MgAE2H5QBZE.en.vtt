00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
that I couldn't for copyright reasons so

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.160 
that I couldn't for copyright reasons so
sorry<00:00:09.059> about<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.269> but<00:00:09.599> I'll<00:00:09.780> link<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.080> that

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
sorry about that but I'll link to that

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.930 
sorry about that but I'll link to that
in<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> description<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:11.370> go<00:00:11.400> check<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.790> out

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
in the description so go check that out

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.970 
in the description so go check that out
but<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.269> doesn't<00:00:12.389> reveal<00:00:12.750> much<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.769> guess

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
but it doesn't reveal much and I guess

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.350 
but it doesn't reveal much and I guess
that's<00:00:14.190> probably<00:00:14.460> good<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.880> can't<00:00:15.120> load

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.429 
website and on there was the wall that
you<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.810> been<00:01:15.930> broken<00:01:16.170> down

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you can see that it's been broken down

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.410 
you can see that it's been broken down
in<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> trailer<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.060> looks<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.330> be

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
in in the trailer and it looks to be

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.850 
in in the trailer and it looks to be
like<00:01:18.450> some<00:01:18.780> kind<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.080> prison<00:01:19.530> Warren<00:01:19.710> I'm

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
like some kind of prison Warren I'm

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.170 
like some kind of prison Warren I'm
thinking<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.430> maybe<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.790> story<00:01:21.060> line

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
thinking that maybe the story line

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
thinking that maybe the story line
starts<00:01:21.630> off<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.170> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.409> prison

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
starts off with some kind of prison

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
starts off with some kind of prison
break<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.280> prison<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:24.030> I'm<00:01:24.630> trying<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
break out of prison or I'm trying to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
break out of prison or I'm trying to
rescue<00:01:25.170> people<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.740> prison<00:01:26.009> that's<00:01:26.369> maybe

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
rescue people out of prison that's maybe

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.359 
rescue people out of prison that's maybe
how<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> story<00:01:27.180> line<00:01:27.299> starts<00:01:27.780> off<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.140> and

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
how the story line starts off with and

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.770 
how the story line starts off with and
maybe<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.640> expands<00:01:30.119> from<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.659> other

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
maybe just expands from there but other

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.480 
maybe just expands from there but other
than<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.320> trailer<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.799> pretty<00:01:32.040> useless

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
than that the trailer was pretty useless

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550 
than that the trailer was pretty useless

the game obviously gonna get the same
feel<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:36.030> love<00:02:36.240> from<00:02:36.450> call<00:02:36.600> duty<00:02:36.810> but

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
feel that we love from call duty but

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.300 
feel that we love from call duty but
they're<00:02:37.080> gonna<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.320> able<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.500> add<00:02:37.590> loads<00:02:38.010> more

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
they're gonna be able to add loads more

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.790 
they're gonna be able to add loads more
new<00:02:38.490> features<00:02:38.520> loads<00:02:39.120> more<00:02:39.420> greater<00:02:40.170> graphics

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
new features loads more greater graphics

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.470 
new features loads more greater graphics
physics<00:02:41.370> things<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.209> it's<00:02:42.330> just

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
physics things like that and it's just

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.210 
physics things like that and it's just
going<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.750> amazing<00:02:43.260> they<00:02:43.770> also<00:02:43.920> said<00:02:44.160> that

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
going to be amazing they also said that

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.770 
going to be amazing they also said that
the<00:02:44.430> building<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.820> new<00:02:44.940> saw<00:02:45.209> Brandon<00:02:45.660> we've

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the building a new saw Brandon we've

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.240 
the building a new saw Brandon we've
already<00:02:45.930> talked<00:02:46.290> about<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.680> possibility<00:02:46.709> of

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
already talked about the possibility of

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.530 
already talked about the possibility of
them<00:02:47.459> branching<00:02:47.940> off<00:02:48.030> from<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.300> modern

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
them branching off from the modern

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.930 
them branching off from the modern
warfare<00:02:48.660> series<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.410> making<00:02:49.739> their<00:02:49.890> own

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
warfare series and making their own

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.490 
warfare series and making their own
brand<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.300> call<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.660> duty<00:02:51.690> ghosts<00:02:52.110> brand

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
brand in the call of duty ghosts brand

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.080 
brand in the call of duty ghosts brand
so<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.340> looks<00:02:53.550> like<00:02:53.610> that's<00:02:53.760> what<00:02:53.940> they're

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
so it looks like that's what they're

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.160 
so it looks like that's what they're
going<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.330> be<00:02:54.420> doing<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.870> think<00:02:55.080> it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
going to be doing and I think it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.330 
going to be doing and I think it
probably<00:02:55.200> does<00:02:55.590> link<00:02:55.830> into<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.190> modern

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
probably does link into the modern

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.370 
probably does link into the modern
warfare<00:02:56.580> story<00:02:57.030> somewhat<00:02:57.540> because<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.989> think

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
warfare story somewhat because I think

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.110 
warfare story somewhat because I think
the<00:02:58.500> ghost<00:02:58.709> mask<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.430> all<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.670> ghosts

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the ghost mask and all the ghosts

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.840 
the ghost mask and all the ghosts
memorabilia<00:03:00.959> kind<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.410> stuff<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.830> think<00:03:02.610> it's<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
memorabilia kind of stuff I think it's a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.460 
memorabilia kind of stuff I think it's a
little<00:03:03.030> bit<00:03:03.180> too<00:03:03.360> similar<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:04.110> kind<00:03:04.320> of

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
little bit too similar to not kind of

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.990 
little bit too similar to not kind of
link<00:03:04.709> them<00:03:04.830> together<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> basic

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
link them together so that is a basic

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.610 
link them together so that is a basic
roundup<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.630> what's<00:03:06.840> happened<00:03:07.170> today<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.380> lot
