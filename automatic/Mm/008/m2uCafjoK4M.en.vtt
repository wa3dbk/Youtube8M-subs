00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.080
 that is a great amount to take with you 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.020
 half a million coins is still in the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.520
 I don't like this series for me too 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.549
 to see if you have a good envelope 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.000
 guess what the ending number will be 24 and 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.380
 here is an amount of 1000 coins 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.189
 it is not to write home about 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 so we have a total of 78 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.680
 1500 coins that we go on our own 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.299

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.250
 why do I had there I had another 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.160
 cold just when i was the one coach talking about 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.810
 was to buy packs so then had 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.000
 I am a fucking good player who I think 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.260

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.750

 we are going to look into the vision 5 which 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.110
 and we encounter an opponent 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.120
 someone with black city fc as that name 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.920
 swansea city kids zanzi city logo badge 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.739
 but does not have the black city because he 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.049
 has a spanish team 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.269
 casillas in the window when back is right 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.730

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.109
 chances should have kept me type 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.120
 I think so 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.280
 i think that by im just that 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.410
 just stop taking that free kick yes 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.569
 we'll just take that from that side 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.250
 your video 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.380
 you have the city but you do n't 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.609
 then I post to that app that 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.980
 because he puts the games on the line and one 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.000
 2nd name is Huppekee Peace Corps 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.280
 mangala anyway 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.840
 is that mandala yes it seems rehearsed 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.639
 it seems perfectly coordinated 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.669
 thereby i d just what makes up 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.590
 school there and also do that when yes 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.819

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.410

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.810

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.800

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.100
 You tubers feel ridiculous 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.200
