00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.760
 organizational effort but with it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.710
 it is now not synonymous to the lc's 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.949

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.130
 long such a league of legends game 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.930
 can go 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.000
 yes and for all these days we have to 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.799
 of course, on the one hand could prepare 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.689
 on the other hand we have to invite guests 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.409
 kuka invite and of course we look 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.030
 maybe we even 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.780
 have contests for you and 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.310
 accordingly, you can imagine 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.530
 that's just a whole lot 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.700
 Latte is at work especially for the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.379
 most guests 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.720
 hotel must be booked the ride 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.760
 must be booked and and and so 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.150
 Do you think with giant rat tail 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.099
 tuned 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.290
 yes, what's next, then I come 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.000
 you know you like to cook and at 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.530
 I still have the last lcs production 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.690
 I am now cooking hard 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.190
 involved ourselves that means we have to 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.019
 We also take care of the catering 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.040
 Something we have to eat well, come on 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.230
 But now we are going to do something different 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.880
 topic who followed the wcs 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.459
 found that the German starcraft 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.810
 2-player puncto banda been locked 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.220
 yes and they are not 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.530
 have heard of course ask yourself 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.110
 What happened? How did that happen? 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.599
 well the answer is relatively simple 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.269
 the man played quali in the wcs 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.549
 lost his match against Jason and 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.260
 then he tried to bribe jason 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.239
 So he really wrote and wrote 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.769
 asked hey, you can not assume 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.140
 I also do what you want 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.519
 promote you and and and yes and Jason 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.989
 Of course, I did not want to do that 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.790
 for a bit of facebook promo and 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.250
 then said hey young give me 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.560
 1000 euro with many smileys aloud 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.480
 own statement so in joke and 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.280
 although jason himself screenshots 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.069
 quasi released on reddit 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.079
 had blizzard in tubs from the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.819
 simple logical reason if you have it 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.950
 would not have had such a jetlag 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.540
 no proof because he is in the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.970
 Principle of each of the match are gone 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.920
 would want to say that could operate 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.569
 whole was just kidding so 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.609
 a pretty stupid action of the 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.350
 both and at the end you have the whole thing 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.359
 also quite regretful on twitter 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.650
 still while chatting and match are gone 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.510
 there is simply a zero tolerance 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.639
 Politics but let's continue with 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.200
 our curiosity cabinet next to the 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.239
 both were also able to wants in 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.609
 locked which was only known now 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.280
 through his four hours I play 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.590
 my four hours with turtle that is 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.660
 already violent and just as incredible as 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.670
 the four-hour match was a tough one 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.349
 match who of you in the hartz 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.900
 The scene certainly knows that 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.239
 name amas what did the em win ? 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.280
 niger known mega successful already 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.260
 won several tournaments and also 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.880
 just always a lot of spectators 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.340
 his stream sums it happened to be 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.450
 and that were the server down so has 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.430
 he decided we play on 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.019
 the asian server and then had to 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.329
 Of course, it was time to start again 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.700
 not as hard as he does on the 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.570
 mailserver has then but with 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.580
 his fri 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.020
 stack played with his pries control 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.410
 away with which already won tournaments 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.780
 Has 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.560
 and that against the absolute no name 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.900
 Beginner 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.450
 that means really lowest level with 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.890
 off the chicken level 25 but off you go 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.480
 thought rise only very quickly the 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.870
 countries open but then that happens 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.300
 unbelievable and yes, as I said 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.120
 against the absolute player without him 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.950
 would have played with the standard deck 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.910
 just once defeated and but 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.200
 not at all counted 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.880
 yes, you just have to 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.800
 but only with humor taken 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.850
 and at the end of the whole itself 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.860
 youtube uploaded 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.720
 That means everyone can feel his shame 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.580
 look like a top-ranked player 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.380
 against the absolute no take standard 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.120
 the guys and girls lose that fat 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.620
 it was with mori I cook again 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.790
 Hope you liked it as always 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.170
 you can find the recipe in the 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.820
 description and of course you can 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.640
 you in the comments the next time 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.850
 to wish 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.850
 no problem
