perfect<00:00:36.640> like<00:00:36.820> a<00:00:36.850> face<00:00:37.210> I<00:00:37.510> went<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.470> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
perfect like a face I went to the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.420 
perfect like a face I went to the

after<00:00:42.430> doing<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:43.180> search<00:00:43.840> I<00:00:44.500> found<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:46.330> picture

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
after doing a search I found the picture

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.990 
after doing a search I found the picture
right<00:00:47.620> there<00:00:47.650> in<00:00:47.890> front<00:00:48.070> of<00:00:48.190> me<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.520> labeled

right there in front of me and labeled

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.090 
right there in front of me and labeled
head<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:49.870> it<00:00:50.320> was<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.440> picture<00:00:50.770> of<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.920> face

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
the face not just one and I remember

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.830 
the face not just one and I remember
particularly<00:02:43.070> being<00:02:43.520> impressed<00:02:44.210> by<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.540> fact

particularly being impressed by the fact
that<00:02:44.960> they<00:02:45.140> appeared<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.590> have<00:02:45.680> found<00:02:45.800> what

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
that they appeared to have found what

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.970 
that they appeared to have found what
looked<00:02:46.610> like<00:02:46.670> an<00:02:46.880> eyeball<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:48.350> can<00:02:48.530> see<00:02:48.740> a

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
looked like an eyeball you can see a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.890 

and<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.590> remember<00:02:58.100> thinking<00:02:58.480> well<00:02:59.480> if<00:02:59.660> one

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
and I remember thinking well if one

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.940 
and I remember thinking well if one
finds<00:03:00.700> something<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.880> looks<00:03:02.060> like<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.300> carved

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
finds something that looks like a carved

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.520 
finds something that looks like a carved
face<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.430> one<00:03:05.360> finds<00:03:05.690> what<00:03:06.200> looks<00:03:06.470> like

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
face and one finds what looks like

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.960 
face and one finds what looks like
pyramids<00:03:07.480> then<00:03:09.340> someone<00:03:10.340> should<00:03:10.610> look<00:03:10.760> into

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
pyramids then someone should look into
