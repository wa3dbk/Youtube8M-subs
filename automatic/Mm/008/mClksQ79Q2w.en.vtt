00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.339
 Y 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.690
 the day that I left jose was born in truth 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.300
 I did not feel great joy because I wanted 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.929
 a male 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:34.690
 two days later I went back to look for my 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.520
 two women one looked pale and the other 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.710
 radiant and sleepy 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.040
 in a few months I was captivated by the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.200
 smile of maria jose 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.440
 that's when I started to love her with 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.150
 madness his face and his look does not 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.130
 I took a moment away from my 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.430
 thought 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.580
 One day Daddy told me when he turns 15 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.670
 years what will be my gift but my love if 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.150
 you're barely 10 years old, good daddy 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.950
 you always say that time flies by 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.939
 and it was true 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.770
 Maria Jose was already 14 years old and excellent 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.340
 school notes 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.409
 took up all the space at home in the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.409
 mind and in the heart of the family 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.320
 especially his father's 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.150
 it was a very early Sunday when we 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.900
 we headed to mass 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.550
 Maria Jose stumbled upon something 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:40.070
 that we all believed and stumbled the 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.010
 I stopped immediately so it would not fall 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.510
 Maria Jose was slowly falling over 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.980
 the bank 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.980
 and almost lost consciousness 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.020
 We took her to the hospital there she stayed 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.330
 for 10 days I was informed that my daughter 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.560
 I suffered from a serious illness that 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.770
 seriously affected his heart 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.540
 but it was not something definitive there was 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.470
 practice other tests to get to 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.650
 a firm diagnosis for foot 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.490
 I'm going to die, it's not true that they told you 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.650
 the doctors truth not my love you're not going to 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.390
 die god that is so big no 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.780
 would allow you to lose what has been most 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.580
 loved in the world 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.100
 for here 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.680
 who die somewhere 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.040
 can see from above people 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.040
 dear ones 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.110
 you know if they can go back 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.659
 good daughter 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.270
 it's true no one has returned from there to 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:50.450
 tell something about that but 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.459
 if I died I would not leave you alone 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.129
 being in the hereafter I would seek the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.959
 way to communicate with you in the last 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.450
 instance would use the wind to 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.330
 come to see you 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.910
 wind 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.850
 and how would you do that daddy 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.500
 I have no idea daughter, I only know that 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.900
 If I die one day, you'll feel like I'm 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.180
 with you when a gentle wind touches your 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.310
 face 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.310
 and a cool breeze once from your cheeks 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.530
 that same day in the afternoon they called the 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.170
 father 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.160
 the matter was serious 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.590
 his daughter was dying 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.930
 they needed a heart because hers 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.320
 I would not resist but fifteen or twenty 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.320
 more days 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.840
 and where do I get a heart 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.930
 that same month mariajo would fulfill its 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.180
 15 years 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.700
 It was Friday afternoon when 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.220
 they got a donor 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.220
 things were going to change 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.280
 and then 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.569
 Sunday afternoon 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.700
 Maria Jose was operated 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.650
 total success 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.079
 but nevertheless 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.259
 dad had not come back through the hospital and 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.840
 Maria Jose missed him very much her 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:30.520
 Mommy told her that everything would be fine 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.520
 and he embraced her with tenderness 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.500
 later on when everyone arrived home 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.460
 they sat on a huge sofa and their mom with 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.460
 the eyes full of tears 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.020
 delivered to María José 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.020
 a letter from his father 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.170
 Maria Jose 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.170
 my great love 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:02.379
 at the time of reading my letter you must have 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.129
 15 years old and a strong heart beating in 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.529
 your chest 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.830
 that was the promise of the doctors that you 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.830
 they operated 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.699
 you can not even remotely imagine 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.240
 how sorry I am not to be by your side in 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.240
 this instant 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:27.849
 when I knew you were going to die 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.679
 I felt that I too would die with you 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.679
 and I was wondering what I could do 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.599
 after so much thinking and feeling a thousand 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:42.629
 things inside of me I finally decided that 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:44.520
 the best way to do something for you was 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:46.919
 answering a question that I 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.460
 did you do when you were ten years old 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.500
 remember 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.430
 and on the web 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.430
 does not answer 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.569
 I decided to make you the most beautiful gift that 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.569
 nobody has ever done 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.330
 my heart 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.100
 I give you my whole life without condition 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.919
 some for you to do with it what 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.169
 you think it's better to feel many 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.460
 beautiful things and knowing that in the world 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:25.900
 the most important 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:29.360
 is you want to live lives 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.110
 I will always be by your side 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.110
 I love you 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:35.539
 and I will always love you 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.230
 because you are the greatest and most beautiful thing 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.230
 God has given me 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.229
 Maria Jose 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:55.020
 Maria I cry all day and all the 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.020
 night 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.449
 the next day 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.230
 went to the cemetery and sat on the 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:06.250
 grave of his dad 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.250
 and whisper 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.430
 Daddy 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.410
 Now I can understand how much you loved me 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.340
 I love you too and will honor you for 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.419
 forever 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.419
 and in that instant 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.560
 the tops of the trees moved 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.780
 slightly 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.889
 and some flowers fell 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:38.070
 I felt Maria José that a gentle wind 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:40.540
 put sugar 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.800
 and a cool breeze 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.800
 kissed his cheeks 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.780
 He looked up at the sky feeling a 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:52.880
 immense peace 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:54.969
 and he thanked God for that 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.610
 got up 

00:07:54.969 --> 00:08:00.629
 and I walk home with the joy of knowing 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.629
 that he carries in his heart 

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.080
 and the greatest love in the world
