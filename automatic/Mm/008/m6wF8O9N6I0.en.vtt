foundation when I first saw it I must

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.339 
foundation when I first saw it I must
have<00:00:20.329> missed<00:00:20.539> I<00:00:20.689> thought<00:00:20.930> it<00:00:21.080> looked<00:00:21.230> exactly

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
have missed I thought it looked exactly

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.970 
have missed I thought it looked exactly
like<00:00:21.920> a<00:00:22.250> regular<00:00:22.820> compact<00:00:23.150> foundation

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
like a regular compact foundation

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.839 
like a regular compact foundation
however<00:00:25.720> when<00:00:26.720> you<00:00:26.900> open<00:00:27.230> it<00:00:27.320> up<00:00:27.500> it<00:00:28.490> actually

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.960 
however when you open it up it actually
contains<00:00:29.330> a<00:00:29.570> fluid<00:00:29.810> foundation<00:00:30.500> inside<00:00:31.099> which

is delivered through this unique cushion

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.040 
is delivered through this unique cushion
which<00:00:34.850> is<00:00:34.970> how<00:00:35.089> it<00:00:35.210> gets<00:00:35.330> its<00:00:35.540> name

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050

applicator pad which is specially

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.850 
applicator pad which is specially
designed<00:00:42.559> to<00:00:43.100> use<00:00:43.460> with<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:44.030> formula<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:45.680> just

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
designed to use with the formula so just

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.649 
designed to use with the formula so just
push<00:00:46.100> it<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.400> couple<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:46.760> times<00:00:47.030> into<00:00:47.540> the

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.079 
cushion and then apply directly onto
your<00:00:49.879> skin<00:00:50.180> I<00:00:51.280> like<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.400> start<00:00:52.640> around<00:00:53.000> the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
your skin I like to start around the

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:59.590 
your skin I like to start around the
centre<00:00:53.449> of<00:00:53.510> my<00:00:53.659> face<00:00:53.900> and<00:00:54.229> work<00:00:55.159> out<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:59.420> has<00:00:59.570> a

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
centre of my face and work out it has a

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.990 
centre of my face and work out it has a
nice<00:00:59.900> natural<00:01:00.439> looking<00:01:01.040> application<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:01.970> I

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
nice natural looking application and I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.490 
nice natural looking application and I
think<00:01:02.180> one<00:01:02.449> of<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.629> first<00:01:02.869> things<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.320> will

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
think one of the first things you will

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.190 
think one of the first things you will
notice<00:01:03.949> is<00:01:04.159> how<00:01:04.670> fresh<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.089> cooling<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:05.960> feels

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
notice is how fresh and cooling it feels

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.450 
notice is how fresh and cooling it feels
on<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.439> skin<00:01:08.439> because<00:01:09.439> it's<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:09.740> buildable<00:01:10.250> if

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
on the skin because it's so buildable if

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.340 
on the skin because it's so buildable if
you<00:01:10.549> have<00:01:10.729> any<00:01:10.850> areas<00:01:11.149> that<00:01:11.539> you're<00:01:11.750> concerned

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
you have any areas that you're concerned

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.880 
you have any areas that you're concerned
about<00:01:12.560> just<00:01:13.159> dip<00:01:13.340> back<00:01:13.549> into<00:01:13.789> the<00:01:13.939> cushion<00:01:14.299> and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
about just dip back into the cushion and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.609 
about just dip back into the cushion and
apply<00:01:15.890> extra<00:01:16.609> so<00:01:16.909> for<00:01:17.119> me<00:01:17.270> for<00:01:18.049> example<00:01:18.140> it's

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
apply extra so for me for example it's

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.950 
apply extra so for me for example it's
definitely<00:01:19.039> around<00:01:19.250> my<00:01:19.490> chin<00:01:19.850> around<00:01:20.780> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
definitely around my chin around the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.859 
definitely around my chin around the
sides<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.439> my<00:01:21.560> nose<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.159> my<00:01:22.369> mouth<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.840> I

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
sides of my nose and my mouth that I

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.010 
sides of my nose and my mouth that I
like<00:01:24.109> extra<00:01:24.530> coverage<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:28.749> then<00:01:29.749> I<00:01:29.840> like<00:01:29.990> a

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
like extra coverage and then I like a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.709 
like extra coverage and then I like a
thin<00:01:30.350> layer<00:01:30.560> everywhere<00:01:31.100> else<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:31.700> I'm<00:01:32.420> just

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
thin layer everywhere else so I'm just

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.230 
thin layer everywhere else so I'm just
working<00:01:32.929> and<00:01:33.429> smoothing<00:01:34.429> out<00:01:34.609> and<00:01:34.969> it<00:01:35.060> does

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
working and smoothing out and it does

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.779 
working and smoothing out and it does
have<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.479> very<00:01:36.100> smoothing<00:01:37.100> effect<00:01:37.219> on<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.210> skin

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
have a very smoothing effect on the skin

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.239 
have a very smoothing effect on the skin
and<00:01:40.789> it's<00:01:40.939> quite<00:01:41.329> poor<00:01:42.079> refining<00:01:42.649> to<00:01:42.859> which<00:01:43.069> we

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
and it's quite poor refining to which we

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.559 
and it's quite poor refining to which we
love<00:01:45.369> one<00:01:46.369> of<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:46.549> things<00:01:46.789> I<00:01:46.939> do<00:01:46.999> really<00:01:47.389> like

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
love one of the things I do really like

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.959 
love one of the things I do really like
about<00:01:47.749> it<00:01:47.929> is<00:01:48.139> how<00:01:48.200> portable<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:49.009> is<00:01:49.130> if<00:01:49.429> you

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
about it is how portable it is if you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.480 
about it is how portable it is if you
want<00:01:50.149> to<00:01:50.329> touch<00:01:50.869> up<00:01:50.899> at<00:01:51.170> lunchtime<00:01:51.710> or<00:01:52.039> before

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
want to touch up at lunchtime or before

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.429 
want to touch up at lunchtime or before
you<00:01:52.579> go<00:01:52.609> out<00:01:52.909> in<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.179> evening<00:01:53.689> it's<00:01:53.960> really

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
you go out in the evening it's really

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.950 
you go out in the evening it's really
really<00:01:54.740> easy<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:55.249> carry<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.179> compact<00:01:56.630> around

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
really easy to carry the compact around

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.959 
really easy to carry the compact around
and<00:01:57.229> just<00:01:57.380> make<00:01:57.619> any<00:01:58.130> touch-ups<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.880> are

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
and just make any touch-ups that are

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.120 
and just make any touch-ups that are
necessary<00:01:59.479> and<00:02:00.049> I<00:02:00.409> think<00:02:00.649> usually<00:02:00.829> that's

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
necessary and I think usually that's

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.620 
necessary and I think usually that's
quite<00:02:01.369> difficult<00:02:01.609> with<00:02:01.999> a<00:02:02.030> bottle<00:02:02.359> of<00:02:02.389> liquid

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
quite difficult with a bottle of liquid

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.989 
quite difficult with a bottle of liquid
foundation<00:02:03.350> in<00:02:03.409> your<00:02:03.560> handbag<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:04.639> this<00:02:04.789> kind

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
foundation in your handbag so this kind

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:09.100 
foundation in your handbag so this kind
of<00:02:05.030> makes<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.389> much<00:02:05.749> much<00:02:06.229> easier<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:08.300> if<00:02:08.990> you

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
of makes it much much easier and if you

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.260 
of makes it much much easier and if you
want<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.380> more<00:02:09.530> precise<00:02:10.069> application<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:11.120> think

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
want a more precise application I think
