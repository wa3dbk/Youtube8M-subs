sea<00:00:42.809> salt<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.200> something<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
sea salt is something that like that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.979 
sea salt is something that like that
into<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.370> diet<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.420> course<00:00:45.660> i<00:00:45.840> agree

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
into your diet now of course i agree

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.720 
into your diet now of course i agree
with<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.860> extent<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.579> always

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
with that to some extent but we always

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.729 
with that to some extent but we always
have<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> peel<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> layers<00:00:48.600> back<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.559> i

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
have to peel the layers back and i

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.260 
have to peel the layers back and i
believe<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.670> we're<00:00:50.789> not<00:00:50.910> peeling<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
believe that we're not peeling the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
believe that we're not peeling the
layers<00:00:51.390> back<00:00:51.719> enough<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.250> everything

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
layers back enough and with everything

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.510 
layers back enough and with everything
that<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.570> always<00:00:54.870> comes<00:00:55.350> back<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.949> blood

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that we do it always comes back to blood

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.180 
that we do it always comes back to blood
sugar<00:00:56.550> regulation<00:00:57.469> energy<00:00:58.469> production<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
sugar regulation energy production and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.369 
sugar regulation energy production and
thyroid<00:00:59.940> hormone<00:01:00.420> production<00:01:00.870> which

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
thyroid hormone production which

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.680 
thyroid hormone production which
stimulates<00:01:02.129> energy<00:01:02.609> production<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
stimulates energy production now of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.170 
stimulates energy production now of
course<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.110> believe<00:01:04.470> yes<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.309> does<00:01:05.580> come<00:01:06.150> down

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
course we believe yes it does come down

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810 
course we believe yes it does come down
to<00:01:06.450> minerals<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.439> course<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.549> people

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
to minerals of course and people

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.789 
to minerals of course and people
recommend<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.630> know<00:01:09.720> drink<00:01:10.170> more<00:01:10.350> coconut

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
recommend you know drink more coconut

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.170 
recommend you know drink more coconut
water<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.100> did<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.280> youtube<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.000> that's

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
water we did a youtube on that that's

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.000 
water we did a youtube on that that's
very<00:01:12.390> beneficial<00:01:12.600> because<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.560> course

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
very beneficial because of course

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.499 
very beneficial because of course
there's<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> lot<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.460> potassium<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.240> potassium

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
there's a lot of potassium and potassium

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.499 
there's a lot of potassium and potassium
is<00:01:16.110> very<00:01:16.290> important<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:18.000> actually

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
is very important because it actually

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.840 
is very important because it actually
helps<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.930> keep<00:01:19.140> sodium<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.830> circulation<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
helps to keep sodium in circulation and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.450 
helps to keep sodium in circulation and
it<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.600> important<00:01:22.140> because<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:23.040> actually

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it is important because it actually

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670 
it is important because it actually
helps<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:24.000> um<00:01:24.240> sugar<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.140> cell<00:01:25.350> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
helps to get um sugar in the cell it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.609 
helps to get um sugar in the cell it
kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.009> piggyback<00:01:26.520> sugar<00:01:26.909> into<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.630> cell<00:01:28.020> so

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
kind of piggyback sugar into the cell so

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.020 
kind of piggyback sugar into the cell so
it's<00:01:28.740> very<00:01:28.860> important<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.430> those<00:01:29.490> reasons<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it's very important for those reasons of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.910 
it's very important for those reasons of
course<00:01:30.240> salt<00:01:30.600> salt<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.409> putting<00:01:31.650> salt

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
course salt salt you know putting salt

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.260 
course salt salt you know putting salt
on<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.100> food<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.790> bit<00:01:32.909> your<00:01:33.030> water

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
on your food or a little bit your water

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.850 
on your food or a little bit your water
throw<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.869> very<00:01:34.020> important<00:01:34.470> because

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
throw that is very important because

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.530 
throw that is very important because
saul<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.970> suppress<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
saul actually can suppress the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.030 
saul actually can suppress the
hippocampus<00:01:37.200> from<00:01:37.380> releasing<00:01:37.710> stress

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
hippocampus from releasing stress

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.039 
hippocampus from releasing stress
hormones<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.150> actually<00:01:39.540> important<00:01:39.990> for

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
hormones and it's actually important for

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.899 
hormones and it's actually important for
cellular<00:01:40.500> respiration<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:41.490> energy

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
cellular respiration or energy

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.330 
cellular respiration or energy
production<00:01:42.240> which<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.630> ATP<00:01:42.990> water<00:01:43.439> oh<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.950> what

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
production which is ATP water oh we what

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.760 
production which is ATP water oh we what
we<00:01:44.430> call<00:01:44.579> energy<00:01:44.990> now<00:01:45.990> if<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.229> actually<00:01:46.380> peel

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
we call energy now if we actually peel

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.069 
we call energy now if we actually peel
the<00:01:46.860> layers<00:01:47.009> back<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.149> look<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.960> we

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the layers back and we look at what we

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.620 
the layers back and we look at what we
call<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.680> hypo<00:01:50.130> metabolic<00:01:50.670> person<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.270> don't

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
call a hypo metabolic person I don't

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.719 
call a hypo metabolic person I don't
really<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:51.990> use<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> word<00:01:52.500> hypothyroid<00:01:53.250> you

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
really like use the word hypothyroid you

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.490 
really like use the word hypothyroid you
can<00:01:53.939> use<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.509> we're<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:54.840> doctors<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.409> we

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
can use it but we're not doctors so we

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.929 
can use it but we're not doctors so we
like<00:01:55.649> these<00:01:55.799> we're<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.100> hypo<00:01:56.430> metabolic

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
like these we're at hypo metabolic

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.850 
like these we're at hypo metabolic
someone<00:01:57.180> with<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> slow<00:01:57.600> metabolism<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.649> that's

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
someone with a slow metabolism so that's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.499 
someone with a slow metabolism so that's
not<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.130> producing<00:01:59.549> energy<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> cell

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
not actually producing energy the cell

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.780 
not actually producing energy the cell
level<00:02:00.659> which<00:02:01.229> we've<00:02:01.409> taught<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.040> can

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
level which we've taught you can

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.249 
level which we've taught you can
actually<00:02:02.969> see<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.600> body<00:02:03.810> temperature

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
actually see this with body temperature

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.560 
actually see this with body temperature
and<00:02:04.380> pulse<00:02:04.640> if<00:02:05.640> you're<00:02:05.939> not<00:02:06.119> producing<00:02:06.299> enough

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
and pulse if you're not producing enough

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.690 
and pulse if you're not producing enough
energy<00:02:07.020> your<00:02:07.439> body<00:02:07.469> temperature<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.310> actually

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
energy your body temperature is actually

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.219 
energy your body temperature is actually
below<00:02:09.090> ninety<00:02:09.450> seven<00:02:09.720> point<00:02:09.929> eight<00:02:09.989> your

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
below ninety seven point eight your

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.070 
below ninety seven point eight your
pulse<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.530> gonna<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.830> low

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
pulse is gonna be low

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.500 
pulse is gonna be low
it's<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:12.890> simple<00:02:13.460> well<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.180> little<00:02:14.420> bit

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
it's that simple well it's a little bit

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.970 
it's that simple well it's a little bit
more<00:02:14.630> complex<00:02:14.990> but<00:02:15.230> for<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.470> purpose<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.890> this

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
more complex but for the purpose of this

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.370 
more complex but for the purpose of this
video<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.910> know<00:02:17.030> that's<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.780> simplicity<00:02:18.200> of

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
video you know that's the simplicity of

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.840 
video you know that's the simplicity of
it<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.650> course<00:02:18.890> we<00:02:19.040> talk<00:02:19.220> about<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.580> more

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
it of course we talk about this more

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.430 
it of course we talk about this more
when<00:02:19.880> we<00:02:20.000> work<00:02:20.240> with<00:02:20.390> people<00:02:20.660> one<00:02:20.780> on<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:20.930> as

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
when we work with people one on one as

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.140 
when we work with people one on one as
well<00:02:21.800> as<00:02:21.890> in<00:02:21.980> our<00:02:22.070> online<00:02:22.220> programs<00:02:22.880> that<00:02:23.060> you

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
well as in our online programs that you

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.260 
well as in our online programs that you
can<00:02:23.330> actually<00:02:23.510> see<00:02:23.900> below<00:02:24.170> but<00:02:24.770> that's<00:02:25.520> not

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
can actually see below but that's not

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.060 
can actually see below but that's not
the<00:02:26.420> point<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:26.810> video<00:02:26.960> if<00:02:27.470> we<00:02:27.890> actually

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
the point of this video if we actually

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.060 
the point of this video if we actually
peel<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.670> layers<00:02:28.850> back<00:02:29.290> hypo<00:02:30.290> metabolic

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
peel the layers back hypo metabolic

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.760 
peel the layers back hypo metabolic
people<00:02:31.810> compensate<00:02:32.810> number<00:02:33.440> one<00:02:33.590> with

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
people compensate number one with

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.080 
people compensate number one with
adrenaline<00:02:34.310> because<00:02:34.490> they<00:02:34.910> don't<00:02:35.060> have

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
adrenaline because they don't have

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.790 
adrenaline because they don't have
enough<00:02:35.390> energy<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.900> body<00:02:36.080> says<00:02:36.260> well<00:02:36.530> I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
enough energy and the body says well I

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.920 
enough energy and the body says well I
need<00:02:37.550> more<00:02:37.940> energy<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.420> that's<00:02:38.540> one<00:02:38.750> way<00:02:38.900> of

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
need more energy and that's one way of

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.900 
need more energy and that's one way of
getting<00:02:39.140> more<00:02:39.410> energy<00:02:39.530> which<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.040> course<00:02:40.070> can

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
getting more energy which of course can

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.850 
getting more energy which of course can
lead<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.480> slow<00:02:41.810> heart<00:02:41.990> rate<00:02:42.230> over<00:02:42.440> time<00:02:42.710> in

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
lead to a slow heart rate over time in

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.250 
lead to a slow heart rate over time in
an<00:02:42.950> increased<00:02:43.310> heart<00:02:43.460> rate<00:02:43.760> over<00:02:43.910> time<00:02:44.260> more

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
an increased heart rate over time more

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.320 
an increased heart rate over time more
chronic<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:46.190> at<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.370> same<00:02:46.520> time<00:02:46.820> they

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
chronic but at the same time they

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.140 
chronic but at the same time they
actually<00:02:47.780> lose<00:02:47.960> sodium<00:02:48.500> in<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.650> fast<00:02:48.920> rate<00:02:49.190> in

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
actually lose sodium in a fast rate in

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.030 
actually lose sodium in a fast rate in
the<00:02:50.330> compensate<00:02:50.930> for<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.290> these<00:02:51.740> people

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
the compensate for this these people

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.640 
the compensate for this these people
actually<00:02:52.400> release<00:02:52.880> more<00:02:53.180> aldosterone<00:02:53.650> the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
actually release more aldosterone the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.710 
actually release more aldosterone the
problem<00:02:55.130> with<00:02:55.280> aldosterone<00:02:55.640> Weld<00:02:56.210> also<00:02:56.630> it

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
problem with aldosterone Weld also it

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.210 
problem with aldosterone Weld also it
actually<00:02:56.840> regulates<00:02:57.500> water<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.040> sodium

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
actually regulates water and sodium

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.050 
actually regulates water and sodium
metabolism

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
metabolism

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.360 
metabolism
the<00:02:59.630> problem<00:03:00.140> with<00:03:00.290> aldosterone<00:03:00.710> this<00:03:01.250> is

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
the problem with aldosterone this is

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.980 
the problem with aldosterone this is
where<00:03:01.520> everyone<00:03:01.790> says<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.420> know<00:03:02.540> minerals

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
where everyone says you know minerals

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.840 
where everyone says you know minerals
minerals<00:03:03.350> minerals<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.460> aldosterone

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
minerals minerals is that aldosterone

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.390 
minerals minerals is that aldosterone
tries<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.690> keep<00:03:05.930> water<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.500> sodium<00:03:07.010> in<00:03:07.220> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
tries to keep water and sodium in the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.640 
tries to keep water and sodium in the
body<00:03:07.580> tries<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:07.970> keep<00:03:08.240> it<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.510> circulation<00:03:09.170> but

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
body tries to keep it in circulation but

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.830 
body tries to keep it in circulation but
at<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.860> expense<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.490> losing<00:03:10.720> magnesium<00:03:11.720> and

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
at the expense of losing magnesium and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.880 
at the expense of losing magnesium and
potassium<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:14.450> problem<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:16.900> sodium<00:03:17.900> can

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
potassium the problem is this sodium can

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.340 
potassium the problem is this sodium can
actually<00:03:19.420> down<00:03:20.420> regulate<00:03:20.930> adrenaline<00:03:21.320> you

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
actually down regulate adrenaline you

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.470 
actually down regulate adrenaline you
don't<00:03:21.530> have<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.709> connect<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.100> dots<00:03:22.130> here<00:03:22.490> so

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
don't have to connect the dots here so

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.970 
don't have to connect the dots here so
hypo<00:03:23.870> metabolic<00:03:24.290> people<00:03:24.560> are<00:03:24.650> actually

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
hypo metabolic people are actually

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.900 
hypo metabolic people are actually
losing<00:03:25.480> sodium<00:03:26.480> at<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.600> fast<00:03:26.840> rate<00:03:27.910> they

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
losing sodium at a fast rate they

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.850 
losing sodium at a fast rate they
release<00:03:29.270> aldosterone<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:30.170> compensate<00:03:30.680> for

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
release aldosterone to compensate for

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.590 
release aldosterone to compensate for
this<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.160> problem<00:03:31.490> is<00:03:31.610> they<00:03:31.790> lose<00:03:31.940> magnesium

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
this the problem is they lose magnesium

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.760 
this the problem is they lose magnesium
and<00:03:32.660> potassium<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.230> as<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.410> mentioned

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.220 
like that but eating every two to three
hours<00:06:48.880> is<00:06:48.970> the<00:06:49.060> best<00:06:49.330> way<00:06:49.510> to<00:06:49.540> regulate<00:06:50.050> blood

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
cramps and what's the most interesting

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.850 
cramps and what's the most interesting
thing<00:06:58.630> about<00:06:58.780> this<00:06:59.170> when<00:06:59.410> do<00:06:59.500> people<00:06:59.530> get

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
thing about this when do people get

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.250 
thing about this when do people get
muscle<00:07:00.130> cramps<00:07:00.430> most<00:07:01.000> of<00:07:01.150> the<00:07:01.210> time<00:07:01.450> after

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
muscle cramps most of the time after

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.250 
muscle cramps most of the time after
expending<00:07:02.800> energy<00:07:03.130> and<00:07:03.850> they<00:07:04.540> get<00:07:04.750> the<00:07:04.900> cramps

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
expending energy and they get the cramps

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.360 
expending energy and they get the cramps
because<00:07:05.380> they're<00:07:05.650> not<00:07:05.830> taking<00:07:06.190> in<00:07:06.280> enough

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
because they're not taking in enough
