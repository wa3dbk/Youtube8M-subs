fire and man it works wonders man you

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.020 
fire and man it works wonders man you
don't<00:02:34.710> even<00:02:34.800> realize<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.250> it's<00:02:35.550> only<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.760> 20

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
don't even realize that it's only a 20

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.670 
don't even realize that it's only a 20
bullet<00:02:36.270> clip<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.110> i<00:02:37.140> think<00:02:37.230> i'm<00:02:37.470> going<00:02:37.590> to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
bullet clip so i think i'm going to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.500 
bullet clip so i think i'm going to
start<00:02:37.860> actually<00:02:38.040> using<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.210> scars

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
start actually using the like the scars

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.870 
start actually using the like the scars
only<00:02:39.840> 20<00:02:40.110> bullets<00:02:40.260> too<00:02:40.560> i<00:02:40.770> think<00:02:41.220> for<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.610> scar

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
only 20 bullets too i think for the scar

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.150 
only 20 bullets too i think for the scar
will<00:02:42.090> go<00:02:42.150> single<00:02:42.360> fire<00:02:42.600> as<00:02:42.750> well<00:02:42.980> because<00:02:43.980> it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
will go single fire as well because it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.590 
will go single fire as well because it
really<00:02:44.370> does<00:02:44.459> come<00:02:44.850> through<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.390> helps

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
really does come through and it helps

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.170 
really does come through and it helps
you<00:02:45.660> out<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.810> lot<00:02:46.050> like<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.560> wouldn't<00:02:46.740> i<00:02:47.180> didn't

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
you out a lot like you wouldn't i didn't

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.400 
you out a lot like you wouldn't i didn't
think<00:02:48.390> it'd<00:02:48.510> make<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.870> big<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.230> difference

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
think it'd make that big of a difference

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.000 
think it'd make that big of a difference
going<00:02:50.310> single<00:02:50.670> shot<00:02:50.940> but<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.240> does<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.010> if

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
going single shot but it does so if

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.110 
going single shot but it does so if
you're<00:02:53.190> using<00:02:53.340> one<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.730> guns<00:02:53.940> with<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
you're using one of the guns with the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.480 
you're using one of the guns with the
small<00:02:54.420> clips<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.870> scar<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.320> pp-2000<00:02:56.280> or<00:02:56.459> i

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490
