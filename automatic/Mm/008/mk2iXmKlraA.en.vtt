00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350 
could be too moist but still break apart
in<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.259> test<00:01:52.640> sandy<00:01:53.640> soils<00:01:54.000> require

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
in this test sandy soils require

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.749 
in this test sandy soils require
moisture<00:01:54.659> during<00:01:55.200> compaction<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:56.280> usually

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
moisture during compaction but usually

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.940 
moisture during compaction but usually
less<00:01:57.030> than<00:01:57.060> required<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.960> clay<00:01:58.170> or<00:01:58.409> silty

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
less than required for clay or silty

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.639 
less than required for clay or silty
soils<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.540> see<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:00.960> important<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.469> know

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
soils so you see it's important to know

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.850 
soils so you see it's important to know
the<00:02:01.920> soil<00:02:02.159> type<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.240> moisture<00:02:03.600> content

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
the soil type and the moisture content

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.170 
the soil type and the moisture content
now<00:02:04.860> these<00:02:05.070> field<00:02:05.369> tests<00:02:05.759> are<00:02:05.820> okay<00:02:06.149> for

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
now these field tests are okay for

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.290 
now these field tests are okay for
patios<00:02:06.869> driveways<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.979> walkways<00:02:08.209> where<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
patios driveways and walkways where the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.390 
patios driveways and walkways where the
native<00:02:09.629> soil<00:02:09.810> was<00:02:10.140> not<00:02:10.170> disturbed<00:02:10.770> by

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
native soil was not disturbed by

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400 
native soil was not disturbed by
excavation<00:02:12.209> but<00:02:13.200> we

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
driveways and streets are being built

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.840 
driveways and streets are being built
