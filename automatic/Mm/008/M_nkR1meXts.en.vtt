00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.400

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
here a bit tricky part

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.480 
here a bit tricky part
it's<00:04:08.780> equivalent<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.620> slide<00:04:09.950> I'm<00:04:10.160> bending

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
it's equivalent to a slide I'm bending

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.330 
it's equivalent to a slide I'm bending
it<00:04:10.610> up<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:10.940> then<00:04:11.210> bringing<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.720> back<00:04:12.220> if<00:04:13.220> you

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340

want<00:04:13.520> to<00:04:13.610> play<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.850> original<00:04:14.000> part<00:04:14.600> it's

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
want to play the original part it's

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.560 
want to play the original part it's
actually<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.170> prebend<00:04:15.650> prevent<00:04:16.400> is<00:04:16.640> you<00:04:17.239> bend

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
actually a prebend prevent is you bend

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.220 
actually a prebend prevent is you bend
it<00:04:17.810> up<00:04:17.989> thinking<00:04:18.739> as<00:04:18.980> if<00:04:19.730> it's<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.690> has<00:04:20.750> reached

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
it up thinking as if it's it has reached

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.570 
it up thinking as if it's it has reached
the<00:04:21.470> required<00:04:23.380> pitch<00:04:24.380> but<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.010> don't<00:04:25.220> pick<00:04:25.430> it

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
the required pitch but you don't pick it

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.760 
the required pitch but you don't pick it
you<00:04:25.820> just<00:04:26.030> bring<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.420> down<00:04:26.630> from<00:04:26.900> there<00:04:27.170> so

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
you just bring it down from there so

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.680 
you just bring it down from there so
instead<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.550> going<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:29.680> are<00:04:30.680> doing<00:04:33.400> all<00:04:34.400> right

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
instead of going you are doing all right

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:48.939 
instead of going you are doing all right
you<00:04:35.690> are<00:04:35.780> not<00:04:35.900> getting<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.320> reference

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.649 

so<00:04:49.490> preventing<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:52.310> bend<00:04:52.849> it<00:04:52.999> up<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.389> then

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
so preventing you bend it up and then

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.050 
so preventing you bend it up and then
bring<00:04:53.689> it<00:04:54.009> if<00:04:55.009> you<00:04:55.159> don't<00:04:55.370> practice<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.849> bends

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
bring it if you don't practice the bends

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.439 
bring it if you don't practice the bends
properly<00:04:56.599> this<00:04:56.749> won't<00:04:57.020> happen<00:04:58.240> actual<00:04:59.240> thing

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
properly this won't happen actual thing

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.989
