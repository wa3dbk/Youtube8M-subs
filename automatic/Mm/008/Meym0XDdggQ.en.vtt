our hitch to space it out so it doesn't
hit<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.820> bolts<00:02:03.240> they're<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> factory<00:02:03.960> bolts

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.859 

you<00:02:07.890> put<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.399> bolts<00:02:08.759> right<00:02:09.300> through<00:02:09.630> with<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you put your bolts right through with a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:33.770 
you put your bolts right through with a
nap

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.119 

so<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:34.840> decided<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.260> go<00:02:35.319> over<00:02:35.349> an<00:02:35.560> Avenger<00:02:35.920> King

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
so we decided to go over an Avenger King

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.360 
so we decided to go over an Avenger King
one<00:02:36.340> which<00:02:36.569> it's<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.599> 12,000<00:02:38.230> pound<00:02:38.260> winch<00:02:38.620> not

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
one which it's a 12,000 pound winch not

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.390 
one which it's a 12,000 pound winch not
powerful<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:40.090> 150<00:02:40.780> series<00:02:41.170> proto<00:02:41.439> out<00:02:42.220> of

powerful this 150 series proto out of

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.160 
powerful this 150 series proto out of
anything<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.909> we<00:02:43.030> drove<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.390> into<00:02:43.540> pretty

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
anything that we drove it into pretty

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.130 
anything that we drove it into pretty
much<00:02:44.849> on<00:02:45.849> this<00:02:45.970> windshield<00:02:46.299> particular<00:02:46.750> it

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
much on this windshield particular it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.500 
much on this windshield particular it
uses<00:02:47.439> an<00:02:47.530> external<00:02:47.739> break<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:49.060> external

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
uses an external break the external

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.830 
uses an external break the external
break<00:02:49.720> allows<00:02:50.079> you<00:02:50.379> to<00:02:50.590> put<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:51.220> rope<00:02:51.430> on<00:02:51.609> there

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
break allows you to put a rope on there

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.789 
break allows you to put a rope on there
compared<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.989> some<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.319> other<00:02:53.409> winches

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
compared to some of the other winches

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.280 
compared to some of the other winches
out<00:02:53.980> there<00:02:54.159> that<00:02:54.340> use<00:02:54.489> of<00:02:54.609> internal<00:02:54.970> break

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
out there that use of internal break

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.500 
out there that use of internal break
which<00:02:56.290> means<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:57.370> heat<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:57.970> going<00:02:58.120> onto<00:02:58.359> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
which means the heat is going onto the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.990 
which means the heat is going onto the
drum<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.349> having<00:02:59.530> rope<00:02:59.890> on<00:03:00.159> that<00:03:00.370> on<00:03:00.939> that

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
drum so having rope on that on that

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.240 
drum so having rope on that on that
internal<00:03:01.629> break<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:02.109> gonna<00:03:02.319> allow<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:03.010> heat

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
internal break is gonna allow the heat

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.309 
internal break is gonna allow the heat
which<00:03:03.909> is<00:03:04.000> probably<00:03:04.209> not<00:03:04.269> good<00:03:04.480> for<00:03:04.599> rope<00:03:04.780> so

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
which is probably not good for rope so

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.800 
which is probably not good for rope so
if<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.709> don't<00:03:05.859> be<00:03:05.920> going<00:03:06.069> for<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.810> synthetic

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
if you don't be going for a synthetic

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.559 
if you don't be going for a synthetic

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
rope on your week maybe try and go for

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.030 
rope on your week maybe try and go for
an<00:03:10.659> external<00:03:10.959> break<00:03:11.260> one<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.650> decide<00:03:11.920> the
