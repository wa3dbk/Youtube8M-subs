goal here is to interact with the
missiles<00:06:10.800> which<00:06:11.040> will<00:06:11.190> cause<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.400> weird<00:06:11.820> 10

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
missiles which will cause the weird 10

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.580 
missiles which will cause the weird 10
looking<00:06:12.540> things<00:06:12.720> to<00:06:13.020> come<00:06:13.170> and<00:06:13.290> load<00:06:13.470> the

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
looking things to come and load the

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.890 
looking things to come and load the
cannons<00:06:13.950> once<00:06:14.850> the<00:06:15.000> cannons<00:06:15.330> are<00:06:15.450> loaded<00:06:15.780> they

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
cannons once the cannons are loaded they

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.200 
cannons once the cannons are loaded they
become<00:06:16.200> usable<00:06:16.440> the<00:06:17.370> simplest<00:06:17.790> way<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:18.000> handle

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
become usable the simplest way to handle

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.060 
become usable the simplest way to handle
this<00:06:18.450> is<00:06:18.510> to<00:06:18.660> wait<00:06:18.900> until<00:06:19.230> all<00:06:19.260> four<00:06:19.740> cannons

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
this is to wait until all four cannons

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.530 
this is to wait until all four cannons
are<00:06:20.190> loaded<00:06:20.340> and<00:06:20.640> then<00:06:20.790> smash<00:06:21.120> her<00:06:21.360> all

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
are loaded and then smash her all

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.660 
are loaded and then smash her all
together<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:22.650> last<00:06:22.890> person<00:06:23.250> that<00:06:23.370> hits<00:06:23.520> her

together the last person that hits her

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.070 
together the last person that hits her
will<00:06:23.850> end<00:06:24.030> up<00:06:24.150> with<00:06:24.270> hate<00:06:24.480> and<00:06:24.630> should<00:06:24.930> keep

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
will end up with hate and should keep

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.770 
will end up with hate and should keep
her<00:06:25.200> in<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:25.410> middle<00:06:25.620> as<00:06:25.800> still<00:06:26.070> as<00:06:26.190> possible
