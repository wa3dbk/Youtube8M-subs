thing<00:00:14.620> you're<00:00:14.830> gonna<00:00:14.980> need<00:00:15.219> to<00:00:15.280> load<00:00:15.610> mapping

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
thing you're gonna need to load mapping

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.710 
thing you're gonna need to load mapping
I<00:00:16.420> loaded<00:00:17.230> topo<00:00:17.770> Canada<00:00:18.340> into<00:00:18.670> this<00:00:18.850> unit<00:00:19.450> so<00:00:19.690> I

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
I loaded topo Canada into this unit so I

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.110 
I loaded topo Canada into this unit so I
could<00:00:20.020> do<00:00:20.140> this<00:00:20.290> demonstration<00:00:20.890> for<00:00:21.280> you<00:00:21.400> you

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
could do this demonstration for you you

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.210 
could do this demonstration for you you
can<00:00:22.270> build<00:00:22.450> city<00:00:22.750> Navigator<00:00:23.350> North<00:00:23.620> America

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
can build city Navigator North America

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.010

then start typing what you want to find
I'm<00:01:42.070> just<00:01:42.250> gonna<00:01:42.399> put<00:01:42.850> in<00:01:43.060> let's<00:01:43.270> say<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.509> D<00:01:44.439> and

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
I'm just gonna put in let's say a D and

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.679 
I'm just gonna put in let's say a D and
I'm<00:01:45.130> gonna<00:01:45.280> go<00:01:45.429> done<00:01:45.729> so<00:01:45.939> everything<00:01:46.359> that<00:01:46.509> has

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
I'm gonna go done so everything that has

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.779 
I'm gonna go done so everything that has
D<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:47.289> gonna<00:01:47.469> show<00:01:47.770> up<00:01:47.979> which<00:01:48.609> is

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
D and it's gonna show up which is

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.410 
D and it's gonna show up which is
probably<00:01:49.090> most<00:01:49.299> of<00:01:49.600> them<00:01:50.850> once<00:01:51.850> you<00:01:52.030> find<00:01:52.270> the

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
probably most of them once you find the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.810 
probably most of them once you find the
point<00:01:52.689> in<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.500> list<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.130> will<00:01:54.159> see<00:01:54.340> that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
point in the list you will see that

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.789 
point in the list you will see that
there's<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.090> distance<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:57.310> compass<00:01:58.000> heading

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
there's a distance and a compass heading

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.529 
there's a distance and a compass heading
that's<00:01:59.799> how<00:02:00.009> far<00:02:00.310> away<00:02:00.609> it<00:02:00.789> is<00:02:00.820> from<00:02:00.969> you<00:02:01.329> and

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
that's how far away it is from you and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.590 
that's how far away it is from you and
in<00:02:01.689> what<00:02:01.899> direction<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.299> one<00:02:04.479> you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
in what direction I like the one you
