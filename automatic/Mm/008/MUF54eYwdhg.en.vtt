00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.519
 hi all guys are iphone 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.360
 value and welcome to this brand new 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.300
 video on the iPhone I went back to the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.060
 the iPhone and therefore there will be many 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.670
 video then as you see from the title 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.810
 this program that I'm going to do today 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.859
 to see 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.660
 it's called hound and light on the left 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.469
 of the time how you want to say it sms that is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.230
 a program that allows us to review 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:43.530
 the sms we erroneously have 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.510
 deleted mistakenly alive because of 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.320
 some people usually erroneously 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.320
 they can also do it on purpose 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.899
 unfortunately today they are friends who cancel 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.260
 the messages of others what it is 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.640
 it happened to me and so I was 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.110
 forced to find this beautiful 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.400
 little program that I'll explain to you now 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.340
 you can have it too 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.070
 logically you guys have to have a 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.970
 device modified ie with the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.030
 jailbreak 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.530
 already the bric child rock then with all 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.490
 the vowels you already want the bric tie 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.100
 break 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.710
 what you want is enough with it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.020
 change then why with this 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.890
 program is downloadable only and I say 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.979
 only from cydia from the network x and leeds e 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.540
 which you can find in description for 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.310
 copy the rep 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.920
 when you have to go and add it 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.020
 however we will go to it on cydia and vi 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.250
 let me show you how first 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.250
 add this oar 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.479
 we wait for the loading that unfortunately 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.310
 alas, it lasts years and soon 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.770
 quiet game 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.840
 then first thing once that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.329
 we arrived in cydia 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.630
 we will have to go on runs once on 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.690
 manage we'll go to sources once 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.040
 on sources we will go on to modify one 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.140
 once on modification we will go up 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.900
 update data no kidding guys 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.329
 data will be updated only and does not depend 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.519
 nor from me and from you when the program 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:25.180
 that is, if he did, they will update themselves 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.560
 the data so we'll just have to wait for one 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.819
 once the data is updated and everything 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.939
 we could go to add one 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.870
 new rap that the one I want to give you 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:43.450
 add today is the one you see here 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.400
 I logically do not however add vi 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.170
 I show grades once and clicked 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.489
 edit that was right up here 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.349
 on the right you have to go looking 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.760
 add that you are here in the upper left 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.430
 here you will insert the link on the 16th we call 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.669
 a link to the rap below 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.500

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:04.030
 once found put it add can 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.620
 even if it tells you that there are dangers 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.150
 for this reprobate and add it 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.959
 equally because there isn't so much 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.549

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.530

 He did what he did go on the button 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:36.819

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.629
 a penny 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.919
 go to this one here that this 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.349

 screen go here 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:19.209
 I in the place of modification in theory I should 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.669
 have add and you'll have to add 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.830

 program will tell you about 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.050
 restarting the springboard would be the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.760
 device already would restart the 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.760
 screen of the device for 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.400

 your deleted sms is not enough for you 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.600

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.560
 loading of all deleted text messages 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:10.110
 now I'll show you not running 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.560
 you should understand nothing of my messages 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.970
 how do you go looking for messages 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.330
 then those at the top are i 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.039
 older messages instead those in 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.840
 low which more below are more messages 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.720
 recent, that is, those more recent declines in 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.789
 unfortunately unfortunately therefore canceled 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.280
