00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.639 
the wig with conditioner just swap
conditioner<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.120> then<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> flat<00:00:37.110> iron<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
conditioner and then I flat iron the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.180 
conditioner and then I flat iron the
ends<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.969> when<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.300> flat<00:00:39.570> iron<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:40.110> wig<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
ends but when you flat iron this wig the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.840 
ends but when you flat iron this wig the
texture<00:00:41.730> gets<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.149> little<00:00:42.300> bit<00:00:42.480> silkier<00:00:43.850> then

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
texture gets a little bit silkier then

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.630 
texture gets a little bit silkier then
yaki<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.660> once<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.829> gonna<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
yaki so once you do that it's gonna be a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.380 
yaki so once you do that it's gonna be a
little<00:00:47.820> bit<00:00:48.170> stickier<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.059> when<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> flat

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390

and flat iron sections of the hair and
then<00:01:57.450> while<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.780> hot<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.040> pin

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
then while it's hot I'm going to pin

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.550 
then while it's hot I'm going to pin
curl<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.060> hair<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:00.810> stick<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> bobby<00:02:01.409> pin

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
curl the hair and then stick a bobby pin

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.450 
curl the hair and then stick a bobby pin
in<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:04.469> get<00:02:04.619> some<00:02:04.829> kind<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.100> curl<00:02:05.280> in

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
in it so I can get some kind of curl in

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.950 
in it so I can get some kind of curl in
it<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.759> hope<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.090> works<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.750> I'm<00:02:06.840> going

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
it and I hope it works out so I'm going

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.900 
it and I hope it works out so I'm going
to<00:02:07.049> show<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.200> guys<00:02:07.469> what<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.069> looks<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.520> oh

hold<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.660> second

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:36.560

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
I finished pink Relling this week and

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.480 
I finished pink Relling this week and
taking<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:36.990> down<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.380> everything<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> mean

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
taking it down and everything so I mean

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.090 
taking it down and everything so I mean
it's<00:03:38.670> not<00:03:38.850> just<00:03:39.240> like<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.290> was<00:03:40.470> when<00:03:40.800> I<00:03:40.830> first

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
it's not just like it was when I first

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.070 
it's not just like it was when I first
bought<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.490> but<00:03:41.820> it<00:03:41.910> still<00:03:42.030> looks<00:03:42.360> pretty<00:03:42.900> good

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
bought it but it still looks pretty good

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.870 
bought it but it still looks pretty good
you<00:03:43.410> don't<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.950> do<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.310> pink<00:03:44.550> Arle

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
you don't have to do the pink Arle

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.330 
you don't have to do the pink Arle
method<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:45.450> can<00:03:45.630> use<00:03:45.810> your<00:03:46.140> flexi<00:03:46.650> rods<00:03:46.890> or

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
method you can use your flexi rods or

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.970 
method you can use your flexi rods or
whatever<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.090> choose<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.540> use<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:49.140> just<00:03:49.440> wanted

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
whatever you choose to use I just wanted

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.180 
whatever you choose to use I just wanted
to<00:03:50.160> do<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.360> method<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.050> time<00:03:52.320> because<00:03:53.160> I

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
to do this method this time because I

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.400 
to do this method this time because I
didn't<00:03:53.520> want<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.820> be<00:03:54.060> like<00:03:54.270> super<00:03:54.780> curly<00:03:55.080> I

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
didn't want it to be like super curly I

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.200 
didn't want it to be like super curly I
just<00:03:55.800> wanted<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.220> ends<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.640> be<00:03:56.760> bumped<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
just wanted the ends to be bumped a

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.570 
just wanted the ends to be bumped a
little<00:03:57.240> bit<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:58.980> think<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.250> looks<00:03:59.370> pretty

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
little bit and I think it looks pretty

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.130 
little bit and I think it looks pretty
good<00:03:59.820> it's<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.210> final<00:04:00.540> review<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.870> what<00:04:01.110> I

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
good it's the final review of what I

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.200 
good it's the final review of what I
think<00:04:01.260> about<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.740> week<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.460> Parden<00:04:02.880> space

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
think about this week the Parden space

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.060 
think about this week the Parden space
when<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.630> originally<00:04:04.020> get<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.380> it's<00:04:04.530> not<00:04:04.620> good

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
when you originally get it it's not good

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.960 
when you originally get it it's not good
so<00:04:05.580> that's<00:04:06.420> definitely<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:07.170> crime<00:04:07.410> but

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
so that's definitely a crime but

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.729 
so that's definitely a crime but
everything<00:04:08.970> else<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.690> density<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.500> wigs

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
everything else the density of the wigs

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.910 
everything else the density of the wigs
the<00:04:11.640> length<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.209> color<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.930> texture<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:13.860> the

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
the length the color the texture and the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.580 
the length the color the texture and the
ends<00:04:14.850> being<00:04:15.090> bumped<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:15.540> everything<00:04:15.959> that

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
ends being bumped and everything that

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.849 
ends being bumped and everything that
was<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.520> plus<00:04:17.760> for<00:04:17.820> me<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.450> my<00:04:19.049> overall<00:04:19.500> rating

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
was a plus for me so my overall rating

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.340 
was a plus for me so my overall rating
for<00:04:19.890> this<00:04:20.220> week<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.730> a<00:04:20.760> nod<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.720> is<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.959> month

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
for this week is a nod this is a month

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.590 
for this week is a nod this is a month
later<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.160> wore<00:04:23.370> this<00:04:23.520> week<00:04:23.790> heavily<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.540> I

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
later and I wore this week heavily and I

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.080 
later and I wore this week heavily and I
think<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.960> still<00:04:25.230> looks<00:04:25.440> pretty<00:04:26.130> good<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:26.910> is

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
think it still looks pretty good this is

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.070 
think it still looks pretty good this is
definitely<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:28.050> wig<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:29.070> I'm<00:04:29.700> gonna
