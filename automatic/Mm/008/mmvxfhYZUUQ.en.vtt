00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520 
so here we are at adrenalin truck

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.549 
so here we are at adrenalin truck
performance<00:00:13.150> and<00:00:13.570> mike<00:00:13.809> is<00:00:13.990> getting<00:00:14.139> ready<00:00:14.380> to

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
performance and mike is getting ready to

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.810 
performance and mike is getting ready to
show<00:00:15.299> flashing<00:00:16.299> of<00:00:16.570> the<00:00:16.960> CSP<00:00:17.500> five<00:00:17.800> format<00:00:18.550> in

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
show flashing of the CSP five format in

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.920 
show flashing of the CSP five format in
a<00:00:18.970> 2007<00:00:19.600> 5.9<00:00:20.530> liter<00:00:20.560> Cummins<00:00:21.660> first<00:00:22.660> you<00:00:22.810> can

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
a 2007 5.9 liter Cummins first you can

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.080 
a 2007 5.9 liter Cummins first you can
hear<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.350> highway<00:00:23.830> background<00:00:24.550> noise<00:00:24.760> here

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
hear the highway background noise here

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.690 
hear the highway background noise here
at<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.300> tower<00:00:25.510> parking<00:00:25.900> lot<00:00:26.110> and<00:00:27.040> let's<00:00:27.400> go<00:00:27.550> and

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
at a tower parking lot and let's go and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.940 
at a tower parking lot and let's go and
walk<00:00:27.820> through<00:00:28.030> the<00:00:28.090> process<00:00:28.300> Mike<00:00:28.750> alright<00:00:29.740> so

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
walk through the process Mike alright so

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.100 
walk through the process Mike alright so
this<00:00:30.070> is<00:00:30.250> for<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:30.610> new<00:00:30.790> CSP<00:00:31.300> five<00:00:31.540> operating

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
this is for the new CSP five operating

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.350 
this is for the new CSP five operating
system<00:00:32.529> so<00:00:33.250> what<00:00:33.370> we're<00:00:33.489> gonna<00:00:33.550> do<00:00:33.760> is<00:00:33.910> plug<00:00:34.180> in

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
system so what we're gonna do is plug in

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:42.090 
system so what we're gonna do is plug in
beat<00:00:35.079> you<00:00:35.290> to<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.620> truck

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.049 

and<00:00:43.100> now<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.250> switch<00:00:43.520> is<00:00:43.699> in<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.879> run

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
and now the switch is in the run

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.209 
and now the switch is in the run
position<00:00:44.090> -<00:00:44.989> clicks<00:00:45.320> -<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.559> run<00:00:45.680> position

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
position - clicks - the run position

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.860 
position - clicks - the run position
so<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:48.870> step<00:00:49.109> is<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.449> scroll<00:00:51.449> down<00:00:51.510> to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
so the first step is to scroll down to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.100 
so the first step is to scroll down to
the<00:00:52.079> team<00:00:52.379> tool<00:00:53.629> select<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:55.219> select<00:00:56.420> tuning

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.509 

program<00:01:01.110> full<00:01:01.440> that's<00:01:01.800> important<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.339> full

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
program full that's important you full

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.899 
program full that's important you full
flash<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.949> then<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.100> will<00:01:05.220> select<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.610> tune

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
flash and then we will select the tune

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.870 
flash and then we will select the tune
that<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:07.110> want<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> flash<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.860> here's<00:01:08.460> our<00:01:08.670> new

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that we want to flash in here's our new

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.010 
that we want to flash in here's our new
CSP<00:01:09.450> 5<00:01:09.690> -<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.000> take<00:01:12.210> around<00:01:12.390> 8<00:01:12.780> minutes

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
CSP 5 - it will take around 8 minutes

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350 
CSP 5 - it will take around 8 minutes
for<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.409> tune<00:01:13.619> flash<00:01:13.920> into<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.280> truck<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
for that tune flash into the truck and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.870 
for that tune flash into the truck and
when<00:01:15.539> it's<00:01:15.750> done

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
when it's done

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.190 
when it's done
go<00:01:17.299> ahead<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:17.600> shut<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.840> key<00:01:18.020> on

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
go ahead and shut the key on

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.899 
go ahead and shut the key on
so<00:01:19.770> we're<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.070> actually<00:01:20.250> gonna<00:01:20.460> watch<00:01:20.729> this

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
so we're not actually gonna watch this

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.330 
so we're not actually gonna watch this
right<00:01:21.150> now<00:01:21.299> because<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.720> order<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> enjoy

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
right now because it's order you enjoy

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.770 
right now because it's order you enjoy
so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.990 

between<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.230> key<00:01:26.410> off

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.910 

now<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.270> next<00:01:32.570> step<00:01:32.750> will<00:01:33.080> be<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.230> install<00:01:33.560> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
now the next step will be to install the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.820 
now the next step will be to install the
new<00:01:33.950> CSP<00:01:34.550> 5<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.260> these<00:01:36.260> are<00:01:36.440> pretty<00:01:36.590> simple

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
new CSP 5 so these are pretty simple

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.710 
new CSP 5 so these are pretty simple
there's<00:01:37.190> just<00:01:37.370> some<00:01:37.490> obd2<00:01:37.970> connection<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:38.690> one

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
there's just some obd2 connection on one

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.310 
there's just some obd2 connection on one
end<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.230> then<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.130> swish<00:01:40.400> on<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.880> other<00:01:41.000> end

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
end and then the swish on the other end

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.590 
end and then the swish on the other end
so<00:01:42.730> probably<00:01:43.730> what<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:43.970> do<00:01:44.150> is<00:01:44.240> want<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.450> mount

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
so probably what you do is want to mount

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.120 
so probably what you do is want to mount
it<00:01:44.720> somewhere<00:01:45.110> that's<00:01:45.350> easy<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.710> get<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:45.980> while

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
it somewhere that's easy to get to while

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.630 
it somewhere that's easy to get to while
you're<00:01:46.250> driving<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.930> then<00:01:47.950> go<00:01:48.950> ahead<00:01:49.100> and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
you're driving and then go ahead and

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:58.250 
you're driving and then go ahead and
plug<00:01:49.880> in<00:01:49.910> switch

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.860 

and<00:01:58.800> included<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.730> switch<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.480> a<00:02:00.540> small

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
and included with the switch is a small

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.500 
and included with the switch is a small
allen<00:02:01.170> wrench<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.590> remove<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.830> knob<00:02:02.130> as<00:02:02.510> well

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
allen wrench to remove the knob as well

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.810 
allen wrench to remove the knob as well
as<00:02:03.690> switch<00:02:04.260> plates<00:02:04.620> you<00:02:04.800> can<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.130> which<00:02:05.520> tuner

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
as switch plates you can see which tuner

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.529 
as switch plates you can see which tuner
on

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.480 

so<00:02:09.140> once<00:02:09.379> this<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.739> installed

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.260 

she's<00:02:13.790> back<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.330> run<00:02:14.450> position

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
she's back to the run position

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.950 
she's back to the run position
the<00:02:16.390> teams<00:02:16.630> can<00:02:16.870> be<00:02:16.930> selected

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
the teams can be selected

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.960 
the teams can be selected
two<00:02:19.620> three<00:02:20.490> four<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.570> five<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> back

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
two three four and five and on the back

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.360 
two three four and five and on the back
of<00:02:24.210> this<00:02:24.330> which<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.900> actually<00:02:25.560> an<00:02:25.650> LED<00:02:26.100> I'm<00:02:26.220> not

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
of this which is actually an LED I'm not

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.060 
of this which is actually an LED I'm not
sure<00:02:26.520> if<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.820> see<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.260> but<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.410> will<00:02:28.500> which

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
sure if you can see it but it will which

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.600 
sure if you can see it but it will which
T<00:02:29.340> neuron<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:31.050> when<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.260> switch<00:02:31.650> from<00:02:31.950> two<00:02:32.400> one

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
T neuron so when I switch from two one

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.930 
T neuron so when I switch from two one
two<00:02:32.820> two<00:02:32.970> two<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.900> will<00:02:34.020> flash<00:02:34.230> twice<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.760> tune

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
two two two it will flash twice to tune

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.850 
two two two it will flash twice to tune
three<00:02:36.300> little<00:02:36.840> flash<00:02:37.020> three<00:02:37.290> times

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
three little flash three times

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.640 
three little flash three times
this<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.460> just<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.120> Diagnostics<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.050> will

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
this is just for Diagnostics and will
