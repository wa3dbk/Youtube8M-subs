00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
buckle damaged it unfortunately I'm

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.600 
buckle damaged it unfortunately I'm
usually<00:00:24.300> extremely<00:00:24.779> careful<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:26.279> my

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
usually extremely careful with my

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.999 
usually extremely careful with my
instruments<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.419> somehow<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.110> one<00:00:28.290> one

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
instruments but somehow on this one one

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.229 
instruments but somehow on this one one
night<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:30.050> was<00:00:31.050> wearing<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> belt<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.860> it<00:00:32.239> tore

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
night I was wearing a belt and it tore

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.500 
night I was wearing a belt and it tore
up<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> back<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:35.520> difference<00:00:36.060> between<00:00:36.390> this

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
up the back the difference between this

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
up the back the difference between this
and<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.810> new<00:00:36.960> Ripper<00:00:37.230> bass<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.010> believe<00:00:38.220> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and a new Ripper bass is I believe the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.370 
and a new Ripper bass is I believe the
new<00:00:38.640> ones<00:00:38.820> don't<00:00:38.970> come<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.540> chrome

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
new ones don't come with this chrome

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.930 
new ones don't come with this chrome
piece<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.860> goes<00:00:40.980> over<00:00:41.310> the<00:00:41.430> bridge<00:00:41.670> back

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
piece that goes over the bridge back

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
piece that goes over the bridge back
here<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:44.420> I<00:00:45.420> think<00:00:46.260> everything<00:00:46.620> else<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
here and I think everything else is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.230 
here and I think everything else is
identical<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.670> new<00:00:47.790> ones<00:00:47.970> that<00:00:48.030> they

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
identical to the new ones that they

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.600 
identical to the new ones that they
reissued<00:00:48.840> these<00:00:49.560> are<00:00:49.710> an<00:00:49.800> extremely<00:00:50.190> heavy

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
reissued these are an extremely heavy

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.850 
reissued these are an extremely heavy
bass<00:00:50.970> guitar<00:00:51.590> it's<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.680> long<00:00:52.890> scale<00:00:53.250> neck<00:00:53.580> and

bass guitar it's a long scale neck and
it's<00:00:56.540> actually<00:00:57.540> very<00:00:58.050> hard<00:00:58.290> to<00:00:58.440> hold<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.770 
I strongly prefer the her finger Beatle
bass<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.830> much<00:01:32.010> lighter<00:01:32.780> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
