00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
basically like the same hero there's a

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.650 
basically like the same hero there's a
little<00:00:17.400> bit<00:00:17.520> more<00:00:17.670> utility<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.420> spells

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
little bit more utility in the spells

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.450 
little bit more utility in the spells
basically<00:00:19.140> those<00:00:19.410> are<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.740> showing<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
basically those are just showing up the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.640 
basically those are just showing up the
cool<00:00:20.880> graphics<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.960> mechanics<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.560> add

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
cool graphics and mechanics that can add

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.320 
cool graphics and mechanics that can add
in<00:00:22.769> diablo<00:00:23.070> 3<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.820> see<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
in diablo 3 and you can see that and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.820 
in diablo 3 and you can see that and
stuff<00:00:24.510> like<00:00:24.660> wave<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.019> force<00:00:25.260> or<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> time

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
stuff like wave of force or the time

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.560 
stuff like wave of force or the time
slowing<00:00:26.160> ability<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.970> anyways<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> pier

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
slowing ability but anyways a pier

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.150 
slowing ability but anyways a pier
spellcaster<00:00:28.140> he<00:00:28.230> does<00:00:28.380> all<00:00:28.619> his<00:00:28.650> damage

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
spellcaster he does all his damage

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.020 
spellcaster he does all his damage
through<00:00:29.460> magic<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.090> at<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> range<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.160> it's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
through magic and at a range and so it's

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.920 
through magic and at a range and so it's
just<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.420> very<00:00:33.630> bursty<00:00:35.180> glass<00:00:36.180> cannon<00:00:36.660> type<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
just a very bursty glass cannon type of

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.150 
just a very bursty glass cannon type of
carrier<00:00:37.110> similar<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.590> Dementor<00:00:38.040> where

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
carrier similar to the Dementor where

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.709 
carrier similar to the Dementor where
the<00:00:38.250> dee<00:00:38.370> milliner<00:00:38.520> kind<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.210> goes<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the dee milliner kind of goes for a

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.040 
the dee milliner kind of goes for a
ranged<00:00:40.530> high<00:00:40.920> damage<00:00:41.190> low<00:00:41.579> health<00:00:41.899> this<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
ranged high damage low health this is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.690 
ranged high damage low health this is
the<00:00:43.170> basically<00:00:43.559> exact<00:00:43.890> same<00:00:44.040> concept<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
the basically exact same concept to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
the basically exact same concept to
accept<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> wizard<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.050> more

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
accept the wizard is going for more

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
accept the wizard is going for more
magic<00:00:46.559> damage<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:47.940> take<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.300> look<00:00:48.539> at

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
magic damage and so if we take a look at

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.810 
magic damage and so if we take a look at
just<00:00:49.379> how<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> wizard<00:00:50.039> works<00:00:50.219> he's<00:00:50.430> got<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
just how the wizard works he's got a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.389 
just how the wizard works he's got a
source<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.930> energy<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.710> called<00:00:52.860> arcane

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
source of energy it's called arcane

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.670 
source of energy it's called arcane
power<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.090> basically<00:00:54.300> mana<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
power and it's basically mana it but the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.580 
power and it's basically mana it but the
difference<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.699> mana<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.379> not<00:00:58.379> mana

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
difference is is that mana or not mana

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410 
difference is is that mana or not mana
arcane<00:00:58.980> power<00:00:59.010> generators<00:00:59.609> very<00:00:59.850> quickly<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
arcane power generators very quickly and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.950 
arcane power generators very quickly and
so<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.770> other<00:01:02.600> classes<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
so it's not like the other classes that

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
so it's not like the other classes that
require<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> charge<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.400> your<00:01:05.430> abilities

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
require you to charge up your abilities

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.090 
require you to charge up your abilities
or<00:01:06.000> whatever<00:01:06.240> arcane<00:01:07.080> power<00:01:07.110> regenerate<00:01:07.830> very

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
or whatever arcane power regenerate very

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.910 
or whatever arcane power regenerate very
quickly<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.880> don't<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.479> any

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
quickly and you don't really have any

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.730 
quickly and you don't really have any
abilities<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> regenerated<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.740> that's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
abilities that regenerated and so that's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.840 
abilities that regenerated and so that's
going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.130> source<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.490> mana<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
going to be your source of mana and you

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.039 
going to be your source of mana and you
really<00:01:15.060> don't<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> worry<00:01:15.600> about<00:01:15.720> mana

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
really don't have to worry about mana

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
really don't have to worry about mana
the<00:01:16.710> only<00:01:16.860> thing<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> worry<00:01:17.549> about

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the only thing you have to worry about

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.700 
the only thing you have to worry about
is<00:01:18.000> basically<00:01:18.450> timing<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.170> abilities<00:01:19.560> so

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
is basically timing your abilities so

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.440 
is basically timing your abilities so
that<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.979> don't<00:01:20.189> spam<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> same<00:01:21.180> thing<00:01:21.330> over

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
that you don't spam the same thing over

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.660 
that you don't spam the same thing over
and<00:01:21.630> over<00:01:21.720> again<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.229> bring<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> down<00:01:23.250> where

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and over again and bring it down where

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.060 
and over again and bring it down where
you<00:01:23.790> can't<00:01:24.060> use<00:01:24.450> your<00:01:24.720> arcane<00:01:25.590> power<00:01:25.619> there

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you can't use your arcane power there

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
you can't use your arcane power there
alright<00:01:26.580> abilities<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.210> require<00:01:27.570> our<00:01:27.750> game

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
alright abilities that require our game

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.020 
alright abilities that require our game
power<00:01:28.110> later<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.369> breakdown<00:01:29.759> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
power later on and so the breakdown of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.870 
power later on and so the breakdown of
the<00:01:30.990> Wizards<00:01:31.560> abilities<00:01:31.979> he's<00:01:32.250> got<00:01:32.460> three

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the Wizards abilities he's got three

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.399 
the Wizards abilities he's got three
basic<00:01:33.270> sets<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.900> signature

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
basic sets it's gonna be signature

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.740 
basic sets it's gonna be signature
offensive<00:01:34.890> end<00:01:35.009> utility<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> wizard

wizard in case you know you run out of
arcane<00:01:48.720> power<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.740> like

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
arcane power so this is going to be like

arcane power so this is going to be like
the<00:01:50.220> same<00:01:50.399> ability<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> barbarian<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.170> he

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290

generates fury he has a basically extra
ability<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.710> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
earlier parts of the game just to

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.330 
earlier parts of the game just to
maximize<00:02:54.780> my<00:02:55.019> damage<00:02:55.409> now<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.650> wizard<00:02:56.040> also

basically like the shields of the wizard
and<00:03:01.829> so<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.549> I<00:03:02.579> assume<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.329> later<00:03:03.569> on<00:03:03.659> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and so that I assume that later on the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.360 
and so that I assume that later on the
game<00:03:04.079> those<00:03:04.319> are<00:03:04.500> just<00:03:04.650> going<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:04.859> replace<00:03:05.190> my

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
game those are just going to replace my

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.520 
game those are just going to replace my
tuna<00:03:05.670> weapon<00:03:05.940> but<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.359> just<00:03:07.019> found<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.409> very
