00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.539
 him that when turned on 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.170

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.189
 happens 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:30.840
 let's see it including a problem 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:32.960
 personally this is a regular ordinary promo 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.710
 loading 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.710
 i.e. there is a launch 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:47.670
 Windows logo appears and here 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 In this state, it hangs I waited 15 minutes 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.000
 nothing changes we take reboot 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.100
 its control does not work 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.989
 turn off the button hold it for 5 seconds it 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:06.090
 goes off again turn on trying to do 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:11.790
 recovery run means 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:18.509

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:20.520
 more accurate recovery attempt 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.090

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.090
 unsuccessful 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.150
 all here it says that the launcher 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.670
 can't automatically stop this 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.300
 the computer tells us about the error that we 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:43.270
 it does not help I come here 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.260

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.860
 system recovery tried further from 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.980

 system restore none of them 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:08.979
 working now for further 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:11.990

 removing here usb storage device is mine 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.510
 flash drive here choose boot antison with 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.140

 Where will be built Victoria for pro 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.860
 fidelity over surface checking 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.880
 hard disk for bedov here comes 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.880

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:03.430
 windows pe we started moving 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:10.930
 program start from the bottom of Victoria go 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:13.230

 go to the tests and click start and 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:28.090
 watch the testing process then 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:36.810
 have it checks every every cell 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:36.810
 hard drive to read each sect 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.270
 if we do not have start windows and then 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:52.270
 most likely if the cause of trouble is these 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.270
 troubles will be at the beginning of the hard disk 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.739
 so far so good there is no orange 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.709
 from bad orange appeared red 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.709
 blue then do nothing the red 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.300
 bad who might be able to hide in 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.970
 reserve area orange top with 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.830
 high speed 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:36.100
 reading everything now appeared we have blue 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:44.440
 troubles and now look at the further 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:49.169
 I will interrupt the picture now because 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:52.090
 that here he ran into trouble and when he 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.150
 just test so much trouble spends 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.360
 a lot of time to re-check it and a little 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:04.720
 I'll show you the final picture later 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:07.240
 Well , how many photosensors have passed anywhere 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.349
 I do not see well 5-7 minutes probably passed and 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.300
 Here is a picture that we have troubles 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.340
 most likely it will be physical when 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.979
 the work of the laptop either dropped it either 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:23.650
 hit and mechanically damaged in 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.270
 one place on the path was what it says 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.220
 us this picture this picture speaks of 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.800
 the fact that the hard disk replacement 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.389
 nothing can do with them is not necessary to change 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.580
 need new hard to put Windows 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.280
 we all made you a diagnosis or 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.960
 problem further i will solve it all 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.970
