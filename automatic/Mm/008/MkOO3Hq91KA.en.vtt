macerator<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.310> Industrial<00:01:35.310> Craft<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:36.420> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
macerator in Industrial Craft what it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.679 
macerator in Industrial Craft what it
does<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.229> put<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:38.189> oars<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.270> will

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
does is if you put your oars in it will

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.710 
does is if you put your oars in it will
crush<00:01:40.409> them<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.909> double<00:01:41.909> them<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.420> get

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
crush them and double them so you get

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.469 
crush them and double them so you get
twice<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> yield<00:01:43.850> also<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.090> needed<00:01:45.450> for

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
twice the yield also it's needed for

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.100 
twice the yield also it's needed for
some<00:01:45.689> recipes<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.380> make<00:01:46.520> some<00:01:48.290> special<00:01:49.290> things

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
here i'm using a Stirling engine which

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.310 
here i'm using a Stirling engine which
will<00:02:05.040> make<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.640> very<00:02:05.790> slow<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.079> will<00:02:07.200> do

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
will make it very slow but it will do

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.060 
will make it very slow but it will do
the<00:02:07.350> job<00:02:07.469> now

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
so I put the stunning engine down and I

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.770 
so I put the stunning engine down and I
leave<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.530> next<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:13.330> fill<00:02:14.330> out<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.570> and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
leave the next to it fill out this and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:23.770 
leave the next to it fill out this and
come<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:21.290> then<00:02:21.440> just<00:02:21.710> put<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.910> or<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.600> as

come and then just put in the or and as
you<00:02:23.930> see<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.440> get<00:02:24.620> pulverized<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.550> ones<00:02:25.910> being

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
you see it get pulverized so ones being

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:37.550 
you see it get pulverized so ones being
pulverized<00:02:26.750> now

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.980 

it<00:02:38.560> comes<00:02:38.770> out<00:02:38.950> as<00:02:39.190> two<00:02:39.790> pulverized<00:02:40.510> iron<00:02:40.750> dust

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
it comes out as two pulverized iron dust

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.260 
it comes out as two pulverized iron dust
which<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.040> can<00:02:42.190> then<00:02:42.220> smell<00:02:42.580> into<00:02:42.850> iron<00:02:43.030> bars

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
which you can then smell into iron bars

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.780 
which you can then smell into iron bars
so<00:02:43.540> basically<00:02:43.960> each<00:02:44.050> or<00:02:44.290> get<00:02:45.160> two<00:02:45.370> bars<00:02:45.580> for

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
so basically each or get two bars for

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.970 
so basically each or get two bars for
instead<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.120> one<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:46.870> quite<00:02:46.960> useful<00:02:47.140> it's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
instead of one so it's quite useful it's

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.000 
instead of one so it's quite useful it's
very<00:02:48.160> very<00:02:48.430> simple<00:02:48.490> to<00:02:48.850> make<00:02:49.530> now<00:02:50.530> I'm<00:02:50.800> going

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
very very simple to make now I'm going

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.150 
very very simple to make now I'm going
to<00:02:51.070> be<00:02:51.160> focusing<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:52.650> thermal<00:02:53.650> expansion

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
to be focusing on thermal expansion

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.510 
to be focusing on thermal expansion
machines<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:55.030> next<00:02:55.300> few<00:02:55.480> tutorials<00:02:56.520> and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
machines the next few tutorials and

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.920 
machines the next few tutorials and
trying<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.000> get<00:02:58.060> them<00:02:58.120> out<00:02:58.240> fairly<00:02:58.510> regularly

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
trying to get them out fairly regularly

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.230 
trying to get them out fairly regularly
so<00:02:59.410> they're<00:02:59.500> quite<00:02:59.680> sure<00:02:59.890> easy<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.640> make<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:00.970> I

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
so they're quite sure easy to make and I

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.810 
so they're quite sure easy to make and I
think<00:03:01.450> they've<00:03:01.570> quite<00:03:01.750> useful<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:03.070> thanks<00:03:03.760> for

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
think they've quite useful so thanks for

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.199 
think they've quite useful so thanks for
