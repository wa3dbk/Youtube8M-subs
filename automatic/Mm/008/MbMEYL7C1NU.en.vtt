important land like score mark is that

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.670 
important land like score mark is that
over<00:00:22.170> here

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
over here

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.570 
over here
you<00:00:23.070> always<00:00:23.369> know<00:00:23.820> despite<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
you always know despite all of the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.089 
you always know despite all of the
technology<00:00:26.580> which<00:00:27.180> are<00:00:27.330> speed<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.099> elevation

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
technology which are speed and elevation

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.999 
technology which are speed and elevation
are<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.550> separate<00:00:29.939> dedicated<00:00:30.150> display<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
are in a separate dedicated display so a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.979 
are in a separate dedicated display so a
land<00:00:32.309> ice<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> very<00:00:32.969> simple<00:00:33.450> treadmill<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
land ice is a very simple treadmill to

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.190 
land ice is a very simple treadmill to
operate<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.250> press<00:00:35.520> stop<00:00:36.200> or

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
operate in that if you press stop or

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.700 
operate in that if you press stop or
start<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.920> starts<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.230> change<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
start it starts and if you change the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.540 
start it starts and if you change the
speed<00:00:41.600> or<00:00:42.600> change<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> elevation<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:44.129> changed

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
speed or change the elevation it changed

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.100 
speed or change the elevation it changed
the<00:00:44.640> elevation<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.390> very<00:00:45.539> important<00:00:46.020> at

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the elevation so it's very important at

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.920 
the elevation so it's very important at
land<00:00:46.320> ice<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.489> terminal<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.270> simple<00:00:48.780> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
land ice that a terminal is simple to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.670 
land ice that a terminal is simple to
use<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.879> despite<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> immense<00:00:51.680> capabilities

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
use and despite the immense capabilities

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.860 
use and despite the immense capabilities
of<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> treadmill<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> basic<00:00:54.149> operation<00:00:54.719> is

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
of the treadmill the basic operation is

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900 
of the treadmill the basic operation is
very<00:00:54.989> simple<00:00:55.230> I'd<00:00:56.219> now<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.610> show<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
very simple I'd now like to show you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
some of the computer graphics that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.950 
some of the computer graphics that
really<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.219> an<00:00:59.399> exciting<00:00:59.670> product<00:01:00.059> so

okay we can see that you're climbing at
a<00:02:13.140> rate<00:02:13.409> of<00:02:13.489> 2.4<00:02:14.489> feet<00:02:14.700> per<00:02:14.909> minute<00:02:15.590> you're

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
a rate of 2.4 feet per minute you're

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.039 
a rate of 2.4 feet per minute you're
currently<00:02:17.310> at<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.459> height<00:02:17.609> of<00:02:17.639> 3<00:02:17.879> feet<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.329> your

currently at a height of 3 feet and your
person<00:02:19.709> here<00:02:19.920> will<00:02:20.099> become<00:02:20.400> higher<00:02:20.780> against

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
person here will become higher against

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.050 
person here will become higher against
these<00:02:21.900> different<00:02:22.260> landmarks<00:02:22.859> which<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.879> can

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
these different landmarks which you can

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.239
