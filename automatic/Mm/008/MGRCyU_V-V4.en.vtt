00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:04.870
 the time difference after that of greece in this meeting here they are 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.910
 it was taking place on this stage near selestat missiles 10 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.750
 current 6th in the pool are launched in a capital year for their maintenance 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.649
 in d1 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.359
 currently 24 clubs composed the elite at the end of the season it will remain 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.849
 that 18 to continue the adventure at the top of the hierarchy so it will take 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.609
 finish in the first four of the hen one challenge the most licked 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.589
 first reading approach here and achievable achievable but that's okay 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.699
 to be relatively difficult since he had two shock teams that his 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.230
 chili jailer 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.780
 dijon who is in a very favorable tie for third place for 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.390
 that the rest of the chicken who is very happy we will fight for this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 fourth place after five games the record of the signage with three 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.730
 defeats for two wins 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.190
 but the group is asking for time 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 the rugby usc and relies on a big conquering pack in melee and was still putting 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160
 their lack of tactics 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.080
 it does not matter how cool it is in the face of adversity seems to be able to erase 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.040
 mistakes 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.590
 it shows really interesting 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.610
 a group very very young very very young very little of two girls who 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.830
 have with mystical science 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.470
 the very young so in terms of experience but also to money 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.110
 we have a lot of two girls are born in 90 91 years old who are seniors 1st 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.310
 2nd year 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.450
 so a big band is the quality that has a potential to really 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 interesting but toudic who remains naÃ¯li 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.590
 it was needed a lot a lot worked and to learn the the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.759
 basic lyon nice despite the imperfections that enamel young 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.940
 Haitian starts to get expensive the group remains confident 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.300
 worn by a few executives like Captain the Prime Minister him the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.120
 continuity their parents probed inc it's partly to their state of mind 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.860
 solidarity commitment and desire to win his leitmotif of this team 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.700
 but I still think we can see the state of mind said 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.100
 that's what we do here 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.159
 now we are really 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.700
 in the learning phase 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.579
 and percent and I think we'll be able to really show up in the 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.280
 second part of the season on the return leg 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.220
 Appointment is made to return to the real performances 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.680
 Alsatian it would perhaps allow to make exist a discipline which has 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.929
 struggling to find a place 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.799
 drowned between football basketball handball female rugby additionally struggling to 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.570
 seduce beyond the sports challenge miss rugby a dream one to break the 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.489
 a priori of an exclusively masculine sport at first we do not play 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.609
 not know in search of recognition 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.769
 our players because we are passionate we love this sport and we have 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.759
 want to give clear ideas with the team but it is certain that we 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:20.900
 would like 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.620
 to make oneself known more than elsewhere and then bring down some serotypes 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.829
 on women's rugby 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.189
 but it's still developing a new team that 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.029
 can create this year between the mark 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:35.089
 so true so it develops little by little we've created a team 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.849
 since last year so to be honest we're still in the 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.699
 good direction and% and it takes a lot of effort a lot of time 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.859
 but when we love we do not count 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.189
 with their smile their desire and their conviction in rugby combine 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.879
 easily hopeful that these assets will also allow them to 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.059
 maintain in d1 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.359
 next home appointment for miss it will be December 6 against 8
