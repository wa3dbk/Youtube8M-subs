00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.190
 I said I'm Rodrigo and in today's video 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.060
 I will give my impressions on the embi 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.949
 2k 14 out there ose android 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.420
 it's not because it's costing 8 dollars 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.699
 currently 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.680
 just to make the whole experience clear 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.539
 that I had with him so far has been 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.329
 playing the version and west on a 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.460
 fifth generation shocking but I suppose 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.860
 what medium android android devices 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.350
 will present results 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.629
 look alike 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.840
 of course it 's a basketball game 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.090
 made by 2k sports who also left 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.690
 for table consoles and the main 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.539
 ask me a lay fire over it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.969
 It is a complete basketball game either 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.109
 say in convincing commands that gave 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.890
 to the player the feeling of being 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.690
 controlling the whole thing is the answer 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.830
 to the satisfaction of those who have 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.650
 interested a sound yes there are two 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.740
 here more casual gameplay methods 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.170
 based on gestures with one finger and another 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.810
 more classic than the virtual buttons on the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.850
 I chose this method because 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.250
 although it is more laborious to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.369
 adapt is more convincing when you 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.130
 learn the commands and commands are the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.979
 without the ball you can switch from 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.210
 tries to steal the ball and tries to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.350
 Turkish with the ball you can play 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.060
 Fling would depend on the situation 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.110
 also has a button to do that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.909
 tip basket is the race it takes when 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.399
 you drag the directional forward 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.170
 by a certain interval and other details 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.270
 have been adapted to suit 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.320
 this scheme of buttons and the way well 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.210
 interesting 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.180
 for example when you are running in 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.310
 toward the bullet deviation basket logo 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.259
 then tap to throw your player 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.880
 can juggle lightly before 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.009
 buried in the tray the pitches themselves 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.440
 are made in a similar way to the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.710
 of physical controls, ie you 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.560
 press the button 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.230
 this senator is able to kick and 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.870
 jump and just release the ball when you let go 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.690
 the button is more or less as soon as 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.210
 the free throws do not exist 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.890
 no meter on the screen for them 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.870
 you just have to touch the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.450
 throw and release at the moment the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.610
 player will only return the ball in this 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:46.620
 situation if you 're just long before or 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:46.620
 long after you do not do friday 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.460
 talking about the dynamics of the game itself 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.490
 a certain time for you to get used to it 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.680
 with virtual controls at least 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.900
 you want to use them automatically 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.270
 without looking at each one of them 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.670
 This is because for example when you want 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.040
 defend aggressively in that 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.380
 learn to play 2k plays using the button 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.070
 to take the ball in addition to touching the button 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.720
 at the top when the opponent 's shipment has already 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.580
 When you're with the ball, you have to 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.830
 stay connected in the movement of others 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.570
 players of your team since when a 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.820
 of them goes under the 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.800
 you can pass the ball 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.710
 quickly and make a tray or 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.030
 such a thing 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.400
 so in summary what I mean is that 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.260
 you can get used to it but this requires 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.160
 some matches until you get more 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.040
 Natural 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.620
 there is no doubt easier to play the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.510
 playing cards intab let because of the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.220
 higher level screen and the graphics are very 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.950
 good at least when you see the 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.290
 play away in this way the overall look 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.650
 is very satisfactory the animations are 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.960
 convincing and everything but when 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.910
 camera focuses on players 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.190
 You do not realize it's not a game of 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.890
 level of the consoles since neither 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.900
 there are facial expressions and also 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.360
 there are some polygonal faults that 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.520
 me do not come to bother but 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.380
 always good to do this internship in them 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.210
 it's the game modes they are 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.020
 enough to reach pt for a good 

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.450
 time 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.190
 besides the friendly fast you can 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.130
 play 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.830
 Look what I did not test can also 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.110
 start seasons to sysomos that will have 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.390
 a number of matches you choose 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.180
 in addition it has mode focused on the leblon 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.530
 twins the champion miami champion and in 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.150
 that you need to achieve some 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.490
 things like park in goals 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.160
 the overall presentation of the game is very good 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.830
 has all nbb teams and graduates 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.380
 with many players very similar to 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.050
 real athletes and about one more absence 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.130
 What I really miss was the 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.830
 comments 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.590
 that is, there is no narration in time 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.370
 that is something that already exists in the 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.430
 ing and 24 13 and in this version knows if there 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.830
 because this has been removed what remains 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.620
 are the comments made by speakers 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.350
 from within the gyms themselves 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.630
 talking about important missed plays and 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.580
 does not save the general atmosphere of 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.010
 they stay a long time only with ambient sound 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:25.050
 of the fans and this yes I found 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:27.930
 Sorry folks in general I think 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.050
 It cost me 18 dollars even though I paid 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.080
 almost crying and if I had already 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.320
 version 2 4 13 for the I do not know if I 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.870
 buy and 2014 not the gameplay of 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.720
 previous version is very close and 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.480
 this year and had the loss of narration that 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.730
 It's very strange for me, it's not something 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.500
 changes the fact that this is a great game 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.350
 basketball sim 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.520
