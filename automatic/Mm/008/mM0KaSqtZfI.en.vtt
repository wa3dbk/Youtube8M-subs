00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
points it's been a disastrous campaign

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.610 
points it's been a disastrous campaign
on<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> face<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.140> thought<00:00:34.350> both

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
on the face of it I thought both

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.680 
on the face of it I thought both
performances<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.640> first<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.030> against<00:00:36.270> Italy

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
performances the first one against Italy

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.780 
performances the first one against Italy
and<00:00:36.899> obviously<00:00:37.170> again<00:00:38.040> she<00:00:38.219> required<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.610> lost

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and obviously again she required we lost

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.299 
and obviously again she required we lost
both<00:00:38.969> games<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.600> one<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:41.010> thought<00:00:41.219> we

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
both games to one but I thought we

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.920 
both games to one but I thought we
deserved<00:00:41.460> something<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:42.030> above<00:00:42.300> games<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.809> be

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
deserved something out above games to be

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.610 
deserved something out above games to be
fair<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.950> defense<00:00:44.340> let<00:00:44.579> us<00:00:44.670> down<00:00:44.910> badly

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
midfield as well where we didn't have

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.700 
midfield as well where we didn't have

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
know Henderson would have been the weak

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.260 
know Henderson would have been the weak
link<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> was<00:00:59.190> actually<00:00:59.340> Gerard<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.090> was

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
link but it was actually Gerard that was

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.830 
link but it was actually Gerard that was
the<00:01:00.420> likud<00:01:00.780> weakest<00:01:01.289> link<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:01.829> too<00:01:02.840> he

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the likud weakest link out there too he

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.789 
the likud weakest link out there too he
gave<00:01:04.049> away<00:01:04.080> both<00:01:04.559> goals<00:01:04.890> against<00:01:05.220> Uruguay<00:01:05.750> um

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
gave away both goals against Uruguay um

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.289 
gave away both goals against Uruguay um
it's<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:07.890> frustrating<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:08.700> Balotelli's
