00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.799
 hello how about how are you in the video 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.600
 Today we will continue decorating Christmas 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.030
 doing work with our own 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.469
 hands but is that if in addition to it the 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.640
 materials that we are going to use are 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.169
 recycled and we create you are beautiful 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.930
 then we can not ask for more 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.439
 You like them because I put you on 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.439
 step by step 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.280
 aluminum foil or silver paper this what 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.960
 we can go saving breakfast light 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.690
 of the small of the sandwiches that we 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.059
 let's go to work in the end let's try 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.329
 recycle a little porexpÃ¡n spheres 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.040
 or cones of the size that you like we are going to 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.140
 need some type of cord if 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.600
 we think about hanging the work of our 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.870
 scissor tree acrylic paint for 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.300
 crafts effect metallic brush 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.719
 and silicone gun or glue 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.719
 hot 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.079
 from now on when we eat the 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.989
 sandwich in the park at work in 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.020
 the school instead of folding the paper and 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.470
 make a little ball we are going to double it with 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.470
 cautious 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.220
 and we're going to keep them and when 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.080
 let's get home we're going to go 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.440
 unfolding and cutting strips with 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.630
 our scissors all along the paper 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.110
 then with these strips we will make some 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.110
 churritos 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.590
 to join some strips with others we leave 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.340
 a bit on the tip chairs and here what 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.340
 we twist well 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.820
 although you can also work with the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.159
 short pieces and that's what you 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.840
 be easier with the pieces of 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.280
 aluminum foil that are too 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.500
 spoiled if they do not serve us for 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.220
 We can use it to cut it 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.220
 make the balls 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.270
 what we have to try is that the 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.789
 that as spherical as possible 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.729
 I will use a poor ball to make 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.409
 ye see better process steps will 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.640
 put a drop of hot silicone on 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.340
 the ball and then stick the cord 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.680
 and then we will stick all the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.420
 churritos of aluminum foil around 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.420
 of the ball with a little silicone 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.650
 every time we get to the end of 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.270
 trickle and we do not have to continue what 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.670
 only thing we have to do is put a 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.370
 glue drop crush a little bit 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.090
 and then we put the following and 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.090
 we can continue 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.670
 when we have covered it completely 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.530
 we simply cut what we have left and 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.239
 so we can create different designs 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.100
 we can make for example a snail 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.560
 milestone to one side 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.260
 and another side facing towards the other and what 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.450
 we can go hitting the ball we hit 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.450
 several and it will look very pretty 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.370
 and if we make a small pine also 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.370
 for our tree 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.340
 another option is to go making snails 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.130
 and we would stick them to a sphere 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.990
 lined with aluminum foil 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.700
 this job also has the option of 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.040
 that we can paint for it, we're going to 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.090
 pour some paint on a plate and 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.890
 with a brush 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.110
 we are going to remove a little excess 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.300
 and we are going to give it a few taps of 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.300
 painting with the dry brush technique 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.239
 that is appearing 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.970
 and you already decide if you like them more 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.370
 painted or unpainted you can also 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.099
 varnish, add a little 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.330
 glitter paste them some accounts of 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:06.190
 colors and that to taste of each one you are 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.430
 have been my ideas and I hope that I have 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.430

 recycled materials 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.479

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.280
