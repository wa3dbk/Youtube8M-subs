like ruined cities under huge oceans and
stuff<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.280> something<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.239> would<00:00:39.360> see

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
stuff like that something you would see

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.440 
stuff like that something you would see
in<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.410> movie<00:00:40.770> called<00:00:41.010> water<00:00:41.280> world<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.969> it's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
in the movie called water world and it's

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.970 
in the movie called water world and it's
very<00:00:42.660> interesting<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.410> gods

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
very interesting that the gods

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.310 
very interesting that the gods
similarities<00:00:44.940> from<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> movie<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:46.050> might

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
similarities from that movie they might

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.110 
similarities from that movie they might
have<00:00:46.469> had<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.770> as<00:00:47.010> our<00:00:47.160> inspiration<00:00:47.910> for

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
have had that as our inspiration for

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600 
have had that as our inspiration for
some<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.930> world<00:00:49.170> building<00:00:49.649> however<00:00:50.039> in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
some of the world building however in

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.209 
some of the world building however in
the<00:00:51.239> movie<00:00:51.570> water<00:00:51.840> world<00:00:52.140> literally<00:00:52.890> almost

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the movie water world literally almost

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.180 
the movie water world literally almost
everything<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.449> underwater<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.829> cities

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
everything is underwater all the cities

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.770 
everything is underwater all the cities
and<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> land<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.000> used<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:57.629> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and on the land that used to be there it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
and on the land that used to be there it
was<00:00:57.930> completely<00:00:58.440> covered<00:00:58.890> by<00:00:59.010> ocean<00:00:59.399> except

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
was completely covered by ocean except

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.630 
was completely covered by ocean except
for<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.329> small<00:01:01.199> island<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.160> they<00:01:02.309> found<00:01:02.520> at

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
for one small island that they found at

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
for one small island that they found at
the<00:01:02.730> very<00:01:02.879> end<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.300> movie<00:01:03.480> which<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.110> very

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the very end of the movie which is very

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.109 
the very end of the movie which is very
interesting<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> might<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.280> look<00:01:05.670> exactly

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
interesting it might be look exactly

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
interesting it might be look exactly
like<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.200> world<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.650> 0<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.250> like

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
like what the world of 0 is like like

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
like what the world of 0 is like like
it's<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.390> world<00:01:09.570> levu<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> very<00:01:10.290> giant

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
it's a the world levu is a very giant

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.590 
it's a the world levu is a very giant
island<00:01:11.130> surrounded<00:01:11.760> by<00:01:12.090> nothing<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
island surrounded by nothing but a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.580 
island surrounded by nothing but a
gigantic<00:01:13.590> ocean<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.640> possibility<00:01:14.970> um<00:01:15.590> but

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
gigantic ocean it's a possibility um but

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.530 
gigantic ocean it's a possibility um but
that's<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.460> best<00:01:17.700> theory<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.210> i<00:01:18.270> have

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that's just my best theory that i have

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.800 
that's just my best theory that i have
about<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.110> another<00:01:19.560> theory<00:01:19.920> i<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
about that another theory i have is that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.840 
about that another theory i have is that
the<00:01:22.470> world<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.040> covered<00:01:23.310> by<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.460> gigantic

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the world is not covered by a gigantic

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.330 
the world is not covered by a gigantic
ocean<00:01:24.210> granted<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.259> may<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.680> some<00:01:25.979> motions

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
ocean granted it may have some motions

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.580 
ocean granted it may have some motions
but<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.270> giant<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.350> could

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
but it's not just one giant one it could

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.560 
but it's not just one giant one it could
be<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> possibility<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.700> something<00:01:30.060> along<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
be a possibility of something along the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.170 
be a possibility of something along the
lines<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.990> post-apocalyptic<00:01:31.829> world<00:01:32.520> where

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
lines of post-apocalyptic world where

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.740 
lines of post-apocalyptic world where
there<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.380> giant<00:01:34.890> cities<00:01:35.490> upon<00:01:36.299> cities

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
there are just giant cities upon cities

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.580 
there are just giant cities upon cities
upon<00:01:37.229> nations<00:01:38.220> covered<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.240> ruin<00:01:39.659> from<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
upon nations covered in ruin from the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.149 
upon nations covered in ruin from the
nuclear<00:01:41.070> bomb<00:01:41.540> this<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.780> probably<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.710> thing

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
nuclear bomb this is probably the thing

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.010 
nuclear bomb this is probably the thing
that<00:01:44.189> happened<00:01:44.670> because<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.360> doubt<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.960> an

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that happened because I doubt that an

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
that happened because I doubt that an
entire<00:01:46.380> world<00:01:46.619> would<00:01:47.009> succumb<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.270> ocean

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
entire world would succumb to the ocean

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.319 
entire world would succumb to the ocean
and<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.049> collapse<00:01:49.500> underneath<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.329> it's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
and just collapse underneath it it's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.899 
and just collapse underneath it it's
most<00:01:51.750> likely<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.829> world<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.189> incomplete

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
most likely that the world is incomplete

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.959 
most likely that the world is incomplete
ruins<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.350> never<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.100> mean<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.820> could

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
ruins but you never know I mean it could

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.760 
ruins but you never know I mean it could
be<00:01:57.149> completely<00:01:57.390> different<00:01:57.600> earth<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.350> what

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
be completely different earth and what

the<00:02:12.989> word

the word
and<00:02:13.900> adventure<00:02:14.739> time<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.519> there's<00:02:16.090> a

and adventure time so there's a
