product<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:02.809> is<00:01:03.050> transformerless<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.759> it

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
product that is transformerless so it

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.140 
product that is transformerless so it
has<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.390> huge<00:01:05.780> benefit<00:01:06.320> with<00:01:06.560> respect<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.340> the

has a huge benefit with respect to the

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.940 
has a huge benefit with respect to the
application<00:01:08.720> or<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.350> customer's

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
application or the customer's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.070 
application or the customer's
requirements<00:01:10.550> so<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:11.509> was<00:01:11.600> very<00:01:11.810> novel

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
requirements so it was very novel

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.440

started our our work with Ryerson was

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.580 
started our our work with Ryerson was
quite<00:01:44.250> small<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.390> work<00:01:45.810> we've<00:01:46.110> done<00:01:46.140> over

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
quite small and the work we've done over

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.490 
quite small and the work we've done over
the<00:01:46.860> last<00:01:47.040> 15<00:01:47.820> years<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.330> has<00:01:49.080> really
