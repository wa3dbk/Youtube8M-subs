00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
drivability did that work out oh yeah

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.509 
drivability did that work out oh yeah
everything's<00:03:16.079> improved<00:03:16.680> throttle<00:03:17.370> response

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
everything's improved throttle response

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.330 
everything's improved throttle response

very<00:03:20.609> much<00:03:22.669> and<00:03:23.669> drivability<00:03:24.060> out<00:03:24.450> see<00:03:24.750> where

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
very much and drivability out see where

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.479 
very much and drivability out see where
anything<00:03:25.290> where<00:03:25.799> you're<00:03:25.859> giving<00:03:26.130> up<00:03:26.250> anything

anything where you're giving up anything

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.930 
anything where you're giving up anything
it<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:26.790> seems<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.239> everything's<00:03:27.599> a<00:03:27.720> game

we<00:03:38.820> did<00:03:39.330> block<00:03:39.630> your<00:03:39.990> your<00:03:40.350> pair<00:03:40.590> about<00:03:40.830> block

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
we did block your your pair about block

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.260 
we did block your your pair about block
off<00:03:41.930> any<00:03:42.930> time<00:03:43.200> year<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.800> add<00:03:44.010> more<00:03:44.220> fuel<00:03:44.550> you

off any time year you add more fuel you

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.180 
off any time year you add more fuel you
do<00:03:46.080> run<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:46.770> risk<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:48.170> burning<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.380> little

do run the risk of burning a little

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.580 
do run the risk of burning a little
additional<00:03:50.610> gas<00:03:50.790> but<00:03:51.120> just<00:03:51.300> so<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.510> know<00:03:51.630> we

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
additional gas but just so you know we

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.100 
additional gas but just so you know we
do<00:03:52.800> shoot<00:03:53.070> for<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.430> thirteen<00:03:53.850> point<00:03:54.120> two<00:03:54.210> air

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
do shoot for a thirteen point two air

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.580 
do shoot for a thirteen point two air
fuel<00:03:55.410> ratio<00:03:55.610> so<00:03:56.610> at<00:03:57.450> cruising<00:03:58.050> speeds<00:03:58.380> were

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
fuel ratio so at cruising speeds were

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.550 
fuel ratio so at cruising speeds were
also<00:03:58.950> conscious<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.610> not<00:04:00.450> over<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> few<00:04:01.140> look<00:04:01.350> so

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
also conscious to not over a few look so

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.440 
also conscious to not over a few look so
your<00:04:02.040> gas<00:04:02.220> mileage<00:04:02.460> should<00:04:02.850> be<00:04:03.030> right<00:04:03.240> about

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
your gas mileage should be right about

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.900 
your gas mileage should be right about
the<00:04:03.630> same<00:04:03.950> that's<00:04:04.950> assuming<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.580> course<00:04:05.610> that

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
the same that's assuming of course that

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.240 
the same that's assuming of course that
you<00:04:06.800> aren't<00:04:07.800> on<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.040> gas<00:04:09.170> all<00:04:10.170> right<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:10.620> as

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
you aren't on the gas all right and as

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.310 
you aren't on the gas all right and as
far<00:04:11.520> as<00:04:12.500> as<00:04:13.500> far<00:04:13.800> as<00:04:14.660> keeping<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.870> front<00:04:16.079> wheel

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
far as as far as keeping the front wheel

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.819 
far as as far as keeping the front wheel
on<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.650> ground<00:04:16.859> under<00:04:17.130> under<00:04:17.760> acceleration

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
on the ground under under acceleration

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.159 
on the ground under under acceleration
easier<00:04:19.829> harder<00:04:20.130> yeah<00:04:20.730> it's<00:04:21.180> definitely<00:04:21.540> much

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
easier harder yeah it's definitely much

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.050 
easier harder yeah it's definitely much
harder<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.860> think<00:04:23.370> I'm<00:04:23.460> gonna<00:04:23.550> save<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.790> lot<00:04:23.910> of

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
harder I think I'm gonna save a lot of

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.900 
harder I think I'm gonna save a lot of
money<00:04:24.180> up<00:04:24.450> front<00:04:24.600> wheels<00:04:24.900> this<00:04:25.169> year

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
money up front wheels this year

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.580 
money up front wheels this year
everywhere<00:04:26.910> we<00:04:27.120> do<00:04:27.300> yeah<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:27.900> don't<00:04:28.260> think

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
everywhere we do yeah I don't think

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.480 
everywhere we do yeah I don't think
we'll<00:04:28.710> put<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:29.040> in<00:04:29.190> our<00:04:29.280> bulletin<00:04:30.030> board

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
we'll put that in our bulletin board

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.130 
we'll put that in our bulletin board
well<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.520> think<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:34.400> was<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:36.090> was<00:04:36.600> comparing

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
well I think I was I was comparing

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.380 
well I think I was I was comparing
myself<00:04:37.790> first<00:04:38.790> day<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.650> was<00:04:40.650> very<00:04:41.390> pleasantly
