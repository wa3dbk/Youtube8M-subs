00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.280
 the turbot is a fish that 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.040
 we found in the hottest months 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.650
 of the year especially highlights that it has very 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.990
 little fat content and also a high 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.180
 content of vitamin b9 or folic acid 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.460
 in the spring we also find 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.040
 Vegetables and vegetables, for example 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.860
 the red pepper the pumpkin or 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.990
 asparagus characteristics in common 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.820
 of these vegetables is that 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.890
 they have a lot of water and also 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.899
 they also contribute a significant amount 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.910
 of potassium to our diet to 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.649
 Next, ana explains how 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.649
 develop recipes with these ingredients 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.010
 we propose a turbot in papillote 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.440
 with vegetables the turbot we ask 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.830
 our condi fisherman that we 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.480
 fillet as the loins of the turbot 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.060
 first of all we cut the vegetables to 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.230
 Juliana 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.230
 first leek 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.420
 after zucchini 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.790
 the green part we cut it to juliana and 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.759
 we keep it inside to make a 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.970
 cream the asparagus cut them into 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.960
 longitudinal way in half or to 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.700
 rooms as we see the size 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.350
 if we like the vegetable al dente we can 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.659
 make the porridge directly with the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.490
 vegetables if we like the vegetable a 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.860
 little bit more cooked we can give it a 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.619
 hit microwave or make a sauteed 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.020
 in the pan for the cream we put the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.200
 zucchini interior the white part 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.700
 with a splash of oil and a little 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.810
 water oregano and curry we let him make a 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.409
 boil for about 35 minutes and then 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.409
 crush 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.540
 the porridge you assembled it first with 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.520
 a sheet of silver foil after 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.259
 we put on a sheet of paper of 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.470
 oven the fish in our turbot and 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.690
 juliana vegetable leeks asparagus 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:19.200
 and zucchini the green part oil and salt 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.200
 we close the porridge 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.440
 we put it in the oven that previously 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.830
 we will have reheated it to 200 degrees 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.720
 approximately 20 minutes if they are 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.020
 smaller pieces we can calculate 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.020
 about 15 minutes 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.330
 for the assembly of the plate we open the 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.250
 pap and we serve directly the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.220
 fish on the plate or we could also 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:49.100
 serve the cream with silver paper 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.100
 serves as an accompanying sauce 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.300
 another proposal is a turbot to the 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.720
 iron equally we ask the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.090
 fishmonger who fillets us the turbot and 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.030
 we will accompany it with a pumpkin puree 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.790
 and some cherry sautéed the puree of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.610
 pumpkin we can do it both in a 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.350
 casserole as to the microwave and os 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.770
 we suggest that you throw a little bit of 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.770
 cinnamon 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.780
 the cherry and sauté with herbs 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.690
 fine herbs oregano parsley are good 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.930
 options and a splash of vinegar 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.930
 modena 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.470
 the turbot we mark it back and forth 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.450
 and we serve on the plate with the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.450
 accompaniments 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.769
 to reduce the salt content in 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.840
 our diet we recommend that you 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.760
 use spices as they enhance 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.760
 very much the taste of our dishes
