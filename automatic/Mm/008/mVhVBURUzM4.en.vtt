00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.390 
do that to make sure if you have that
happening<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.439> keep<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.710> shoulders<00:01:55.040> relaxed

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
happening you keep the shoulders relaxed

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.130 
happening you keep the shoulders relaxed
make<00:01:56.119> sure<00:01:56.270> it's<00:01:56.420> nice<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:56.600> smooth<00:01:56.960> straight

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
make sure it's nice and smooth straight

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.539 
make sure it's nice and smooth straight
out<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.350> center<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.740> head<00:01:57.920> talking

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
out to the center of the head talking

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.210 
out to the center of the head talking
about<00:01:58.820> grip<00:01:59.119> from<00:01:59.900> my<00:02:00.080> perspective<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:00.770> like<00:02:01.040> to

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
about grip from my perspective I like to

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.090 
about grip from my perspective I like to
use<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.670> front<00:02:01.909> fulcrum<00:02:02.710> with<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.799> mixture

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
use the front fulcrum with the mixture

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.100 
use the front fulcrum with the mixture
of<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.340> middle<00:02:04.580> finger<00:02:04.670> fulcrum<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.390> reason

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
of the middle finger fulcrum a reason

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.690 
of the middle finger fulcrum a reason
being<00:02:06.290> I<00:02:06.560> feel<00:02:06.710> like<00:02:06.770> it's<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.040> most<00:02:07.070> control

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
being I feel like it's the most control

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.669 
being I feel like it's the most control
and<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.450> best<00:02:08.660> sound<00:02:08.959> out<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.259> drum<00:02:09.290> that

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
and the best sound out of the drum that

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.910 
and the best sound out of the drum that
way<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.970> then<00:02:11.180> moving<00:02:11.360> on<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.810> wrist<00:02:12.290> angles<00:02:12.680> I

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
way and then moving on to wrist angles I

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.680 
way and then moving on to wrist angles I
like<00:02:13.549> my<00:02:13.730> wrist<00:02:13.970> angle<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.180> little<00:02:14.209> bit<00:02:14.390> flatter

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
like my wrist angle a little bit flatter

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.199 
like my wrist angle a little bit flatter
the<00:02:15.200> most<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:16.340> way<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.459> try<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.850> descend<00:02:17.180> to

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
the most the way I try to descend to

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.720 
the most the way I try to descend to
find<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.959> ask<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.500> player<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:19.010> put

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
find that is I ask the player to put

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.910 
find that is I ask the player to put
their<00:02:19.880> hands<00:02:20.090> down<00:02:20.299> by<00:02:20.450> their<00:02:20.660> side<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.320> relax

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
their hands down by their side and relax

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.680 
their hands down by their side and relax
the<00:02:22.160> shoulders<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.640> their<00:02:22.760> wrists<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.269> then

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
the shoulders and their wrists and then

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.240 
the shoulders and their wrists and then
purely<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.320> bring<00:02:24.560> their<00:02:24.709> wrist<00:02:24.950> right<00:02:25.160> up

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
purely just bring their wrist right up

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.069 
purely just bring their wrist right up
to<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.459> center<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.820> drum<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.810> when<00:02:26.959> you

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
to the center of the drum and when you

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.240 
to the center of the drum and when you
do<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.590> want<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.769> make<00:02:27.890> sure<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.100> your

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
do that you want to make sure that your

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.729 
do that you want to make sure that your
forearm<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:28.880> also<00:02:29.269> flat<00:02:29.480> as<00:02:29.660> well<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.140> then

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
forearm is also flat as well and then

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.110 
forearm is also flat as well and then
from<00:02:30.920> there<00:02:31.070> talking<00:02:31.489> about<00:02:31.579> where<00:02:31.970> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
from there talking about where the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.840 
from there talking about where the
mallet<00:02:32.540> lies<00:02:32.750> within<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.350> palm<00:02:33.640> if<00:02:34.640> we<00:02:34.700> want

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
mallet lies within the palm if we want

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.449 
mallet lies within the palm if we want
to<00:02:34.880> make<00:02:35.030> sure<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.840> our<00:02:35.900> thumb<00:02:36.350> our<00:02:37.160> thumb

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
to make sure that our thumb our thumb

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.680 
to make sure that our thumb our thumb
dictates<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.209> we<00:02:38.329> want<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.570> make<00:02:38.660> sure

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
dictates that in we want to make sure

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.420 
dictates that in we want to make sure
it's<00:02:38.930> not<00:02:39.049> pulled<00:02:39.350> in<00:02:39.470> too<00:02:39.620> far<00:02:39.919> because

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
it's not pulled in too far because

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.160 
it's not pulled in too far because
if<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.609> is<00:02:40.760> you'll<00:02:41.420> see<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.659> mountain<00:02:41.930> angle

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
if it is you'll see the mountain angle

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.679 
if it is you'll see the mountain angle
is<00:02:42.260> too<00:02:42.469> steep<00:02:42.739> right<00:02:43.189> here<00:02:43.459> yeah<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.540> if<00:02:44.629> we

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
is too steep right here yeah and if we

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.679 
is too steep right here yeah and if we
have<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.109> too<00:02:45.290> far<00:02:45.590> out<00:02:46.150> my<00:02:47.150> lingual<00:02:47.510> gets

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:47.689 
have it too far out my lingual gets

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.449 
have it too far out my lingual gets
really<00:02:48.019> flat<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:48.950> want<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.159> make<00:02:49.280> sure<00:02:49.310> you

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
really flat so you want to make sure you

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.649 
really flat so you want to make sure you
find<00:02:49.609> a<00:02:49.730> nice<00:02:49.909> middle<00:02:50.209> ground

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
find a nice middle ground

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:51.819 
find a nice middle ground
typically<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.379> right<00:02:51.560> underneath<00:02:51.709> the

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
typically it's right underneath the

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.550 
typically it's right underneath the
meaty<00:02:52.099> portion<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.849> your<00:02:53.299> thumb<00:02:53.569> palm<00:02:53.810> or<00:02:54.439> your

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
meaty portion of your thumb palm or your

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.740 
meaty portion of your thumb palm or your
thumb<00:02:54.709> pad<00:02:54.920> sorry<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.489> that<00:02:56.180> gives<00:02:56.390> us<00:02:56.510> the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
thumb pad sorry and that gives us the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.149 
thumb pad sorry and that gives us the
right<00:02:56.930> angle<00:02:57.409> to<00:02:57.680> give<00:02:57.799> us<00:02:57.889> the<00:02:57.980> correct

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
right angle to give us the correct

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.099 
right angle to give us the correct
pathway<00:02:58.700> coming<00:02:59.090> out<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.389> drum<00:02:59.599> now<00:02:59.959> we're

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
pathway coming out of the drum now we're

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.089 
pathway coming out of the drum now we're
going<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.260> talk<00:03:00.439> about<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.859> two<00:03:01.069> different

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
going to talk about the two different

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.789 
going to talk about the two different
types<00:03:01.489> of<00:03:01.849> strokes<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.420> use<00:03:02.689> in<00:03:02.959> bass<00:03:03.500> drumming

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
types of strokes we use in bass drumming

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.530 
types of strokes we use in bass drumming
for<00:03:04.790> us<00:03:05.019> our<00:03:06.019> gravity<00:03:06.889> comes<00:03:07.819> on<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.090> upstroke

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
for us our gravity comes on the upstroke

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.149 
for us our gravity comes on the upstroke
as<00:03:08.810> comparison<00:03:09.290> with<00:03:09.439> the<00:03:09.500> snare<00:03:09.739> drums<00:03:09.980> and

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
as comparison with the snare drums and

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.039 
as comparison with the snare drums and
tenor<00:03:10.340> drums<00:03:10.700> where<00:03:11.299> it<00:03:11.359> tends<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.599> come<00:03:11.810> down

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
tenor drums where it tends to come down

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.379 
tenor drums where it tends to come down
on<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.349> down<00:03:12.530> stroke<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:13.519> for<00:03:13.730> us<00:03:13.879> the<00:03:14.180> prep

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
on the down stroke so for us the prep

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.149 
on the down stroke so for us the prep
motion<00:03:14.720> has<00:03:14.900> always<00:03:15.109> let<00:03:15.409> out<00:03:15.560> from<00:03:16.040> the

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
motion has always let out from the

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.069 
motion has always let out from the
fulcrum<00:03:16.549> yeah<00:03:17.299> we<00:03:17.480> don't<00:03:17.569> want<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:17.870> lead<00:03:17.989> it

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
fulcrum yeah we don't want to lead it

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.690 
fulcrum yeah we don't want to lead it
from<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.319> mallet<00:03:18.650> tip<00:03:18.889> because<00:03:19.370> if<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:19.579> do

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
from the mallet tip because if you do

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.339 
from the mallet tip because if you do
you're<00:03:19.879> gonna<00:03:19.970> use<00:03:20.150> too<00:03:20.299> much<00:03:20.389> arm<00:03:20.720> in<00:03:20.959> that

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
you're gonna use too much arm in that

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.470 
you're gonna use too much arm in that
prep<00:03:21.650> motion<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.609> give<00:03:22.790> us<00:03:22.879> a<00:03:22.939> really<00:03:23.239> weak

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
prep motion that give us a really weak

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.569 
prep motion that give us a really weak
and<00:03:23.629> hollow<00:03:23.900> sound<00:03:24.290> we<00:03:24.859> also<00:03:25.040> want<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.340> do<00:03:25.430> too

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
and hollow sound we also want to do too

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:26.949 
and hollow sound we also want to do too
much<00:03:25.700> risk<00:03:26.000> because<00:03:26.180> we<00:03:26.269> do<00:03:26.359> too<00:03:26.510> much<00:03:26.629> wrist

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
much risk because we do too much wrist

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.020 
much risk because we do too much wrist
that'll<00:03:27.560> cause<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.859> also<00:03:28.280> another<00:03:28.579> really

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
that'll cause it also another really

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.119 
that'll cause it also another really
weak<00:03:29.209> sound<00:03:29.510> for<00:03:29.780> us<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:30.500> combination<00:03:31.069> of

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
weak sound for us so the combination of

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.280 
weak sound for us so the combination of
the<00:03:31.250> two<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:31.609> what<00:03:31.790> works<00:03:32.120> best<00:03:32.419> so<00:03:33.169> we're

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
the two is what works best so we're

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.809 
the two is what works best so we're
gonna<00:03:33.409> lead<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.739> prep<00:03:33.950> motion<00:03:34.280> out<00:03:34.459> from<00:03:34.700> the

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
gonna lead the prep motion out from the

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.970 
gonna lead the prep motion out from the
fulcrum<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.629> get<00:03:35.750> maximum<00:03:36.169> wrist<00:03:36.500> break<00:03:36.739> and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
fulcrum to get maximum wrist break and

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.800 
fulcrum to get maximum wrist break and
then<00:03:37.519> from<00:03:37.730> there<00:03:37.969> we'll<00:03:38.180> incorporate<00:03:38.450> a

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
then from there we'll incorporate a

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.089 
then from there we'll incorporate a
slight<00:03:39.169> bit<00:03:39.409> of<00:03:39.439> forearm

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
slight bit of forearm

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.800 
slight bit of forearm
motion<00:03:40.489> into<00:03:40.939> that<00:03:41.060> stroke<00:03:41.419> to<00:03:41.510> give<00:03:41.629> us<00:03:41.689> a

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
motion into that stroke to give us a

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.929 
motion into that stroke to give us a
pullout<00:03:42.019> vertical<00:03:42.560> yeah<00:03:43.219> and<00:03:43.459> then<00:03:43.730> from

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
pullout vertical yeah and then from

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.449 
pullout vertical yeah and then from
there<00:03:44.180> going<00:03:44.720> into<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.019> down<00:03:45.229> stroke<00:03:45.620> we<00:03:46.159> use

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
there going into the down stroke we use

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.000 
there going into the down stroke we use
the<00:03:46.790> forearm<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.479> the<00:03:47.540> back<00:03:48.229> of<00:03:48.379> the<00:03:48.470> palm<00:03:48.680> and

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
the forearm and the back of the palm and

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.250 
the forearm and the back of the palm and
the<00:03:49.430> deltoid<00:03:49.879> muscles<00:03:50.359> to<00:03:50.870> give<00:03:51.019> us<00:03:51.139> the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
the deltoid muscles to give us the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.589 
the deltoid muscles to give us the
velocity<00:03:51.379> into<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.129> head<00:03:52.400> like<00:03:52.970> produces<00:03:53.479> the

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
velocity into the head like produces the

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.869 
velocity into the head like produces the
best<00:03:53.750> sound<00:03:54.109> to<00:03:54.620> add<00:03:54.769> on<00:03:54.979> a<00:03:55.280> little<00:03:55.639> bit<00:03:55.790> more

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
best sound to add on a little bit more

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.259 
best sound to add on a little bit more
to<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.900> down<00:03:57.079> stroke<00:03:57.439> I<00:03:58.010> like<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.699> from<00:03:59.180> my

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
to the down stroke I like to from my

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.909 
to the down stroke I like to from my
perspective<00:03:59.479> I<00:03:59.780> like<00:03:59.810> to<00:04:00.109> use<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.290> stroke

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
perspective I like to use a stroke

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.890 
perspective I like to use a stroke
called<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.250> Marcato<00:04:01.639> stroke<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:02.659> what<00:04:02.750> that

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
called the Marcato stroke and what that

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.140 
called the Marcato stroke and what that
purely<00:04:03.290> means<00:04:03.530> is<00:04:03.859> after<00:04:04.040> we<00:04:04.310> strike<00:04:04.639> the<00:04:04.879> head

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
purely means is after we strike the head

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.020 
purely means is after we strike the head
we<00:04:05.810> lift<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.079> mallet<00:04:06.470> rebound<00:04:06.829> back<00:04:07.189> out<00:04:07.459> to

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
we lift the mallet rebound back out to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.149 
we lift the mallet rebound back out to
make<00:04:08.180> sure<00:04:08.209> we<00:04:08.569> get<00:04:08.689> optimal<00:04:09.290> sound<00:04:09.620> out<00:04:09.949> of

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
make sure we get optimal sound out of

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.249 
make sure we get optimal sound out of
the<00:04:10.310> out<00:04:10.549> of<00:04:10.699> the<00:04:10.759> drum<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.720> if<00:04:11.870> I'll<00:04:11.959> show<00:04:12.199> you

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:12.259 
the out of the drum so if I'll show you

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:15.670 
the out of the drum so if I'll show you
turn<00:04:13.069> to<00:04:13.129> the<00:04:13.220> side<00:04:13.430> here<00:04:13.699> a<00:04:14.470> regular<00:04:15.470> down

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
turn to the side here a regular down

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.810 
turn to the side here a regular down
stroke<00:04:16.070> may<00:04:16.609> look<00:04:16.849> like<00:04:17.030> this<00:04:21.310> yeah<00:04:22.310> so<00:04:22.759> you

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
stroke may look like this yeah so you

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.370 
stroke may look like this yeah so you
see<00:04:23.030> there's<00:04:23.210> not<00:04:23.330> much<00:04:23.509> movement<00:04:23.720> after<00:04:24.139> the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
see there's not much movement after the

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.230 
see there's not much movement after the
mouth<00:04:24.620> strikes<00:04:25.009> the<00:04:25.159> head<00:04:25.340> but<00:04:25.909> from<00:04:26.120> my

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
mouth strikes the head but from my

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.730 
mouth strikes the head but from my
perspective<00:04:26.509> I<00:04:26.900> like<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.169> use<00:04:27.259> the<00:04:27.380> Marcato

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
perspective I like to use the Marcato

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.890 
perspective I like to use the Marcato
stroke<00:04:28.159> which<00:04:28.610> allows<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:28.909> mouth<00:04:29.330> rebound

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
stroke which allows that mouth rebound

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.659 
stroke which allows that mouth rebound
back<00:04:30.169> out<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.740> make<00:04:30.860> sure<00:04:31.039> we<00:04:31.159> get<00:04:31.250> maximum

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
back out to make sure we get maximum

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.800 
back out to make sure we get maximum
velocity<00:04:32.270> into<00:04:32.479> the<00:04:32.570> head

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.420 

and<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:38.080> reason<00:04:38.380> why<00:04:38.530> that<00:04:38.560> mallet<00:04:39.070> rebounds

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
and the reason why that mallet rebounds

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.090 
and the reason why that mallet rebounds
back<00:04:39.640> out<00:04:39.880> it's<00:04:40.360> because<00:04:40.510> my<00:04:40.840> hand<00:04:41.110> is<00:04:41.440> nice

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
back out it's because my hand is nice

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.760 
back out it's because my hand is nice
and<00:04:42.340> relaxed<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.120> it<00:04:43.990> doesn't<00:04:44.290> limit<00:04:44.380> any<00:04:44.620> of

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
and relaxed and it doesn't limit any of

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.250 
and relaxed and it doesn't limit any of
that<00:04:44.890> motion<00:04:45.250> from<00:04:46.240> my<00:04:46.420> perspective<00:04:46.960> there's

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
that motion from my perspective there's

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.340 
that motion from my perspective there's
many<00:04:47.440> different<00:04:47.650> ways<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:48.130> define<00:04:48.250> Heights

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350

everyone<00:04:50.350> tends<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.680> use<00:04:50.800> inches<00:04:51.220> but<00:04:51.520> the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
everyone tends to use inches but the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.400 
everyone tends to use inches but the
variation<00:04:52.120> of<00:04:52.240> how<00:04:52.360> they<00:04:52.540> use<00:04:52.720> that<00:04:52.750> is<00:04:53.200> what

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
variation of how they use that is what

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
variation of how they use that is what
differs<00:04:53.790> I<00:04:54.790> like<00:04:55.180> to<00:04:55.300> use<00:04:55.570> 3<00:04:56.530> inches<00:04:56.800> 4<00:04:57.400> inches

in<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:12.970> forearm<00:05:13.420> to<00:05:13.990> achieve<00:05:14.920> those<00:05:15.190> Heights

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
in the forearm to achieve those Heights

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.670 
in the forearm to achieve those Heights
so<00:05:16.030> for<00:05:16.180> three<00:05:16.390> inches<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:16.930> use<00:05:17.110> mainly<00:05:17.350> all

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
so for three inches I use mainly all

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.100 
so for three inches I use mainly all
wrists<00:05:18.070> four<00:05:18.880> inches<00:05:19.270> is<00:05:19.540> a<00:05:19.570> little<00:05:19.840> bit<00:05:19.930> more

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
wrists four inches is a little bit more

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.530 
wrists four inches is a little bit more
six<00:05:20.830> inches<00:05:21.130> a<00:05:21.190> little<00:05:21.430> bit<00:05:21.520> higher<00:05:21.700> nine

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
six inches a little bit higher nine

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.810 
six inches a little bit higher nine
inches<00:05:22.960> 12<00:05:23.800> inches<00:05:23.980> when<00:05:24.340> we<00:05:24.400> finally<00:05:24.610> get<00:05:24.760> to

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
inches 12 inches when we finally get to

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.400 
inches 12 inches when we finally get to
12<00:05:25.090> inches<00:05:25.300> we're<00:05:25.510> incorporating<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.110> full

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
12 inches we're incorporating the full

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.170 
12 inches we're incorporating the full
forearm<00:05:27.040> muscles<00:05:27.400> in<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.610> back<00:05:27.730> of<00:05:27.790> the<00:05:27.970> hand

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
forearm muscles in the back of the hand

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.390 
forearm muscles in the back of the hand
that's<00:05:28.630> when<00:05:28.840> we<00:05:28.930> use<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:29.230> deltoid<00:05:29.680> on<00:05:29.920> the

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
that's when we use the deltoid on the

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.460 
that's when we use the deltoid on the
downstroke<00:05:30.970> so<00:05:31.390> for<00:05:31.720> an<00:05:31.780> example<00:05:31.870> three

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
downstroke so for an example three

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.960 
downstroke so for an example three
inches<00:05:32.710> is<00:05:32.830> mainly<00:05:33.130> all<00:05:33.250> wrist<00:05:35.700> position<00:05:36.700> 4
