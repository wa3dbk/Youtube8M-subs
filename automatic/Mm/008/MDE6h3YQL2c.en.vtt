00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.639
 and all welcome everything is new and 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.140
 boring program to analyze the 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.689
 delicate current situation that leads to 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.029
 nothing after a lot of people have 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.099
 I tried to explain how it is done 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.840
 correctly this movement 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.809
 let's try to uncover the secrets 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.920
 to get a crazy led as god 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:36.920
 send 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.920
 Y 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.120
 several things that we're going to need some 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:49.320
 skates a cone at least one floor a 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.670
 skater or a skater and a lot 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.670
 perseverance and patience 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.050
 The first thing we will do is put the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.449
 skates somiÃ³ then we will begin 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.900
 practicing a simple movement like 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.800
 shows our skater 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.270
 but call me marc now marc or 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.520
 will perform the second step that consists 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.770
 in lifting the heel when the foot is 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.950
 backward and tilt it a bit towards 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.950
 outside 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.660
 The third step is the most delicate because 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.640
 you have to stay in tea with your foot 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.050
 advance every time you pick up the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.050
 back foot heel 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.030
 Now you can try a cone but 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.590
 remember that as everything requires 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.590
 patience and a lot of training 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.590
 and good up to here the crazy tutorial 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:57.260
 led can be explained faster or more 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.560
 slow or in another language but not with this 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.560
 smile
