00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
well made this game unique was was the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.480 
well made this game unique was was the
amount<00:01:16.240> of<00:01:16.329> speed<00:01:16.600> obviously<00:01:16.810> that<00:01:17.619> sonic

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
amount of speed obviously that sonic

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.300 
amount of speed obviously that sonic
could<00:01:18.640> achieve<00:01:18.939> I<00:01:19.710> mean<00:01:20.710> on<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.829> 16-bit

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
could achieve I mean on the 16-bit

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.230 
could achieve I mean on the 16-bit
system<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.869> frame<00:01:23.140> rate<00:01:23.350> was<00:01:23.560> damn<00:01:24.340> near<00:01:24.640> and

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
system the frame rate was damn near and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.149 
system the frame rate was damn near and
you<00:01:25.689> didn't<00:01:25.899> lose<00:01:25.990> any<00:01:26.259> frames<00:01:26.619> on<00:01:26.829> this<00:01:26.950> can

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
you didn't lose any frames on this can

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.679 
you didn't lose any frames on this can
be<00:01:27.310> over<00:01:27.340> considered<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:28.179> fast<00:01:28.479> at<00:01:28.659> the

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
be over considered so fast at the

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.870 
be over considered so fast at the
assignment<00:01:29.259> it's<00:01:29.679> just<00:01:29.890> beautiful<00:01:30.100> terms<00:01:30.729> of

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
assignment it's just beautiful terms of

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.779 
assignment it's just beautiful terms of
service<00:01:32.039> what<00:01:33.039> it<00:01:33.130> brought<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.579> table

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
service what it brought to the table

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.130 
service what it brought to the table
that's<00:01:34.179> sort<00:01:34.360> of<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.450> uniqueness<00:01:34.780> so

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
that's sort of the uniqueness so

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.630 
that's sort of the uniqueness so
everything<00:01:35.560> else<00:01:35.709> here<00:01:35.920> there<00:01:36.399> is<00:01:36.490> nothing

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
everything else here there is nothing

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.789 
everything else here there is nothing
like<00:01:36.939> it<00:01:37.179> and<00:01:37.390> there's<00:01:38.140> still<00:01:38.319> nothing<00:01:38.469> like

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
like it and there's still nothing like

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.770 
like it and there's still nothing like

now since this is the early stages you

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.070 
now since this is the early stages you
can<00:02:05.930> pretty<00:02:06.230> much<00:02:06.580> grease<00:02:07.580> through<00:02:07.850> this<00:02:08.080> and

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
can pretty much grease through this and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.960 
can pretty much grease through this and
of<00:02:09.590> course<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:09.950> got<00:02:10.070> hit<00:02:10.250> on<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.580> thumb<00:02:10.850> ass

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.180 

not<00:02:16.570> sure<00:02:16.780> what<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:16.960> is<00:02:17.110> not<00:02:17.740> sure<00:02:17.950> what<00:02:18.100> it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
not sure what that is not sure what it

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.580

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.229 

I<00:02:20.890> guess<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:21.550> supposed<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.819> knock<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.209> off

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
I guess it's supposed to knock you off

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.869 
I guess it's supposed to knock you off
balance<00:02:22.739> they<00:02:23.739> got<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.890> lot<00:02:24.099> of<00:02:24.129> Easter<00:02:24.580> eggs<00:02:24.730> in
