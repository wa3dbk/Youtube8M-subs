00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you detangle your hair first and then

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.220 
you detangle your hair first and then
you<00:00:41.879> cleanse<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.750> don't<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
worry about it being tangled and have to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.990 
worry about it being tangled and have to
detangle<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.530> while<00:00:46.770> you're<00:00:47.070> conditioning<00:00:47.760> or
