00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
that I found on the internet that

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.800 
that I found on the internet that
commercial<00:01:28.409> Gordon<00:01:29.009> says<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.880> Bruce<00:01:30.240> Wayne<00:01:30.540> or

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.609 
actually actually I think he just says
it<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.780> someone<00:01:33.780> else<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.470> exactly

what he says Bruce Wayne is a nice young
chap<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.610> he<00:01:38.729> certainly<00:01:39.090> must<00:01:39.659> lead<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> boring
