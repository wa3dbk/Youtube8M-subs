for the North American release here's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710 
for the North American release here's
what<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.340> looks<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.640> when<00:01:17.850> two<00:01:18.030> players<00:01:18.390> are

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
what it looks like when two players are

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.399 
what it looks like when two players are
playing<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:19.320> once<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.310> clearly<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.869> person<00:01:22.290> is

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
playing at once so clearly one person is

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.050 
playing at once so clearly one person is
looking<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.030> portrait<00:01:24.990> view

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
looking at the portrait view

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.539 
looking at the portrait view
I'm<00:01:27.060> sorry<00:01:27.299> landscape<00:01:27.720> view<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.549> that's

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
I'm sorry landscape view and that's

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.490 
I'm sorry landscape view and that's
upright<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.360> them<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.990> course<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.320> can

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
upright for them of course you can

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.109 
upright for them of course you can
switch<00:01:32.310> lists<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.270> fly<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:35.130> player<00:01:35.820> 1

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
switch lists on the fly so the player 1

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.569 
switch lists on the fly so the player 1
and<00:01:36.150> player<00:01:36.329> 2<00:01:36.479> will<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.280> adjacent<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> their

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and player 2 will be adjacent to their

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.539 
and player 2 will be adjacent to their
screens<00:01:39.380> but<00:01:40.380> then<00:01:40.590> you'd<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.130> manually

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
screens but then you'd have to manually

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.770 
screens but then you'd have to manually
reverse<00:01:42.210> player<00:01:42.600> two's<00:01:43.070> controls<00:01:44.570> as<00:01:45.570> well<00:01:45.600> as

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
reverse player two's controls as well as

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.690 
reverse player two's controls as well as
player<00:01:46.049> 1<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.649> make<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.310> bit<00:01:47.399> more

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
player 1 to make this a little bit more

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.090 
player 1 to make this a little bit more
intuitive<00:01:48.140> now<00:01:49.140> again<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> whole<00:01:49.649> point<00:01:49.950> was

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
intuitive now again the whole point was

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.749 
intuitive now again the whole point was
to<00:01:51.320> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.590> want<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.040> play<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
to if you want to play like the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.880 
to if you want to play like the
old-school<00:01:54.240> two-player<00:01:54.899> cocktail<00:01:55.649> games

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
old-school two-player cocktail games

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.639 
old-school two-player cocktail games
like<00:01:56.399> pac-man<00:01:57.000> Galaga<00:01:57.450> which<00:01:57.990> were<00:01:58.229> released

in a cocktail form this setup would

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.319 
in a cocktail form this setup would
match<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.090> orientation<00:02:04.310> begin<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.610> practice

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
match that orientation begin in practice

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.690 
match that orientation begin in practice
it's<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.320> don't<00:02:07.500> find<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:08.539> useful<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:11.459> I'm

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it's I don't find it as useful but I'm

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.610
