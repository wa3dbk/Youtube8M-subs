00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

build these models to give people our
cells<00:00:37.440> frankly<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.250> certainly<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.800> folks

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
cells frankly and certainly the folks

that<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.370> might<00:00:41.550> come<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.570> tenants

that we might come in and the tenants
that<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.079> might<00:00:43.230> talk<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.809> retailers

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920

restaurant<00:00:46.920> tours<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.879> sense<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.270> what

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
restaurant tours just a sense of what

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.729 
restaurant tours just a sense of what
this<00:00:48.510> place<00:00:48.750> would<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.620> know

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
this place would be like but you know

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.590 
this place would be like but you know
we're<00:00:49.920> Disney<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.329> put<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> little

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
we're Disney so we like to put a little

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.069 
we're Disney so we like to put a little
pixie<00:00:51.989> dust<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> everything<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.770> do<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.309> so

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
pixie dust and everything we do and so

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.150 
pixie dust and everything we do and so
we've<00:00:55.079> devised<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.620> way<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.800> sort<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.039> bring

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
we've devised a way to sort of bring

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.860 
we've devised a way to sort of bring
Disney<00:00:56.489> springs<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.969> life<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.449> bit<00:00:57.600> more

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
Disney springs to life a little bit more

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.599 
Disney springs to life a little bit more
and<00:00:58.079> maybe<00:00:58.559> Kathy<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.160> do<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> honors

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
and maybe Kathy you can do the honors

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:09.690 
and maybe Kathy you can do the honors
there<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.120> go

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.789 

so<00:01:10.700> as<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.719> can<00:01:11.840> see<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.380> going<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.619> be<00:01:12.770> a

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
so as you can see this is going to be a

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.249 
so as you can see this is going to be a
special<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:13.850> vibrant<00:01:14.299> place<00:01:14.479> we've<00:01:15.110> actually

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
special and vibrant place we've actually

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.139 
special and vibrant place we've actually
we<00:01:15.920> focused<00:01:16.460> our<00:01:16.549> lighting<00:01:16.820> here<00:01:16.969> on<00:01:17.060> the

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
we focused our lighting here on the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.569 
we focused our lighting here on the
where<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.259> bulk<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:18.920> development<00:01:19.460> the

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
where the bulk of the development the

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.800 
where the bulk of the development the
new<00:01:19.700> development<00:01:20.119> be<00:01:20.179> for<00:01:20.329> disney<00:01:20.539> springs

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
new development be for disney springs

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.560 
new development be for disney springs
but<00:01:20.929> of<00:01:21.020> course<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.350> place<00:01:22.090> it's<00:01:23.090> it's<00:01:23.450> the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
but of course the place it's it's the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.510 
but of course the place it's it's the
whole<00:01:23.899> place<00:01:24.259> will<00:01:24.469> encompass<00:01:24.799> this

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
whole place will encompass this

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.279 
whole place will encompass this
transformation<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:26.450> kathy's<00:01:26.990> going<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.170> talk

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
transformation and kathy's going to talk

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.850 
transformation and kathy's going to talk
a<00:01:27.319> little<00:01:27.500> bit<00:01:27.710> more<00:01:27.890> about<00:01:28.549> that<00:01:29.360> in<00:01:30.110> just<00:01:30.500> a

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
a little bit more about that in just a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.609 
a little bit more about that in just a
second<00:01:31.280> but<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:32.600> technique<00:01:33.079> by<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.319> way<00:01:33.469> is

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
second but this technique by the way is

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.010 
second but this technique by the way is
something<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.069> actually<00:01:34.549> was<00:01:35.030> developed<00:01:35.509> by

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
something that actually was developed by

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.389 
something that actually was developed by
our<00:01:36.229> research<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.619> development<00:01:37.039> group<00:01:37.219> at

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
our research and development group at

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.100 
our research and development group at
Imagineering<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:38.210> we're<00:01:38.360> using<00:01:38.509> a<00:01:38.810> digital

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
Imagineering so we're using a digital

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.649 
Imagineering so we're using a digital
projection<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:40.610> bring<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.030> place<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:41.479> life

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
projection to bring this place to life

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.859 
projection to bring this place to life
in<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.289> way<00:01:42.439> that<00:01:42.709> goes<00:01:43.189> beyond<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:43.849> normal<00:01:44.750> model

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
in a way that goes beyond a normal model

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.570 
in a way that goes beyond a normal model
and<00:01:45.080> gives<00:01:45.229> really<00:01:45.439> people<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.950> sense<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.459> the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
and gives really people a sense of the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.219 
and gives really people a sense of the
place<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:46.939> maybe<00:01:47.149> kathy<00:01:47.509> can<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:47.750> just<00:01:47.899> give

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
place but maybe kathy can you just give

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.080 
place but maybe kathy can you just give
us<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.409> little<00:01:48.439> tour<00:01:48.799> of<00:01:48.890> duty<00:01:49.099> springs<00:01:49.459> sure<00:01:49.909> i

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
us a little tour of duty springs sure i

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.630 
us a little tour of duty springs sure i
don't<00:01:50.209> know<00:01:50.420> if<00:01:50.539> you<00:01:50.630> noticed<00:01:51.020> but<00:01:51.079> when<00:01:51.439> we

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
don't know if you noticed but when we

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.889 
don't know if you noticed but when we
transform<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:52.849> model<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.390> first<00:01:53.689> thing

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
transform this model the first thing

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.410 
transform this model the first thing
that<00:01:54.049> we<00:01:54.170> saw<00:01:54.439> come<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.459> life<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.970> model

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
that we saw come to life on the model

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
space where we're really taking

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.809

with pleasure island or downtown disney

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.569 
with pleasure island or downtown disney
and<00:02:17.989> so<00:02:18.109> this<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.769> really<00:02:19.040> think<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.459> as<00:02:19.549> the

heart of the development and this is

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.410 
heart of the development and this is
where<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.590> development<00:02:22.130> grew<00:02:22.430> from<00:02:22.850> these

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
where the development grew from these

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.840 
where the development grew from these
buildings<00:02:23.989> are<00:02:24.200> lower<00:02:24.500> level<00:02:25.100> one<00:02:25.370> single

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850

story they're just going to look a
little<00:02:27.980> bit<00:02:28.280> older<00:02:28.579> than<00:02:28.609> the<00:02:28.819> others<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.180> if

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
