cybertron<00:00:46.730> we<00:00:46.850> had<00:00:46.970> a<00:00:47.000> lot<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.239> characters<00:00:47.690> to

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
cybertron we had a lot of characters to

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.600 
cybertron we had a lot of characters to
choose<00:00:47.839> from<00:00:48.019> but<00:00:48.290> gameplay<00:00:48.920> variety<00:00:49.309> wasn't

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
choose from but gameplay variety wasn't

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.130 
choose from but gameplay variety wasn't
that<00:00:49.760> meaningful<00:00:50.210> now<00:00:50.449> maybe<00:00:50.629> one<00:00:50.839> guy<00:00:50.989> was

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
that meaningful now maybe one guy was

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.200 
that meaningful now maybe one guy was
slightly<00:00:51.350> faster<00:00:51.680> in<00:00:52.220> fall<00:00:52.550> of<00:00:52.640> cybertron<00:00:53.120> we

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
slightly faster in fall of cybertron we

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.149 
slightly faster in fall of cybertron we
topped<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:53.629> on<00:00:53.870> its<00:00:54.019> head<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:54.589> we<00:00:54.769> really

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
topped that on its head so we really

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.790 
topped that on its head so we really
have<00:00:55.399> pushed<00:00:55.699> every<00:00:56.300> aspect<00:00:56.809> of<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.079> game<00:00:57.110> to

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
have pushed every aspect of the game to

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.450 
have pushed every aspect of the game to
be<00:00:57.829> super<00:00:58.489> tight<00:00:58.750> really<00:00:59.750> clean<00:01:00.110> and

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
be super tight really clean and

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.829 
be super tight really clean and
incredibly<00:01:01.460> well-balanced<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.510> gameplay

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
incredibly well-balanced the gameplay

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.660 
incredibly well-balanced the gameplay
experience<00:01:03.320> can<00:01:03.559> can<00:01:03.979> change<00:01:04.189> dramatically

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
experience can can change dramatically

some<00:01:05.269> of<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.420> flying<00:01:05.630> missions<00:01:05.810> you're<00:01:06.110> able

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
some of the flying missions you're able

some of the flying missions you're able
to<00:01:06.380> fly<00:01:06.710> around<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:07.610> don't<00:01:07.640> get<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.939> drop

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
to fly around and you don't get the drop

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.060 
to fly around and you don't get the drop
on<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.630> enemy<00:01:08.750> from<00:01:08.930> above<00:01:09.260> how<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:09.619> use<00:01:09.920> that

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
on the enemy from above how you use that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.429 
on the enemy from above how you use that
as<00:01:10.220> a<00:01:10.729> viable<00:01:10.939> tactic<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.869> all<00:01:11.960> depends<00:01:12.259> on<00:01:12.320> how

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
as a viable tactic it all depends on how

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.990 
as a viable tactic it all depends on how
you<00:01:12.500> want<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.860> play<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.400> we've<00:01:13.549> definitely

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
a viable strategy throughout all these
