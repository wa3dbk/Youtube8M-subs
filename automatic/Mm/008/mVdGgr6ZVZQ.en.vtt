make ethanol I'm running cars on all
right<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:18.570> we've<00:04:19.570> got<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:20.670> barrel<00:04:21.670> of<00:04:21.940> bread

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
right so we've got a barrel of bread

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.160 
right so we've got a barrel of bread
smegma<00:04:23.650> that's<00:04:24.340> fermented<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.660> that<00:04:26.050> we're

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
smegma that's fermented and that we're

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.220 
smegma that's fermented and that we're
going<00:04:26.290> to<00:04:26.350> boil<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.860> off<00:04:27.040> and<00:04:27.730> send<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:28.780> into

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
going to boil it off and send it into

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.980 
going to boil it off and send it into
this<00:04:29.500> contraption<00:04:30.250> here

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.900 

what<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.200> this<00:04:35.470> crazy<00:04:35.800> thing<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.580> is<00:04:36.730> our

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
what is this crazy thing this is our

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.340 
what is this crazy thing this is our
ethanol<00:04:37.330> processor<00:04:38.290> that<00:04:39.060> separates<00:04:40.350> alcohol

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
ethanol processor that separates alcohol

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:50.720 
ethanol processor that separates alcohol
up<00:04:42.070> in<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.730> water<00:04:43.980> uh-huh<00:04:44.980> you<00:04:45.730> get<00:04:45.910> as<00:04:46.030> close

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.280 

and<00:04:51.730> I<00:04:51.940> guess<00:04:52.150> they<00:04:52.330> go<00:04:52.480> into<00:04:52.660> these<00:04:52.840> barrels

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
and I guess they go into these barrels

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:02.430 
and I guess they go into these barrels
here<00:04:57.990> what<00:04:58.990> else<00:04:59.170> do<00:04:59.350> you<00:04:59.380> got<00:04:59.620> over<00:05:00.220> here<00:05:01.440> mr.

intricacies of a reliable veggie car

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.190 
intricacies of a reliable veggie car
conversion<00:05:26.980> so<00:05:27.570> we're<00:05:28.570> just<00:05:28.600> going<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:28.960> leave

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
conversion so we're just going to leave

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.460 
conversion so we're just going to leave
it<00:05:29.230> at<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:30.180> but<00:05:31.180> it<00:05:31.270> runs<00:05:31.420> on<00:05:31.630> video<00:05:32.050> Matt
