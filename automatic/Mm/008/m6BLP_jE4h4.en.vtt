lee<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.820> Wi-Fi<00:00:39.210> doesn't<00:00:39.390> work<00:00:39.660> actually<00:00:39.899> i

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
lee the Wi-Fi doesn't work actually i

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.690 
lee the Wi-Fi doesn't work actually i
would<00:00:40.230> say<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.649> Wi-Fi<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.340> is

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
would say that the Wi-Fi on this is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.150 
would say that the Wi-Fi on this is
slightly<00:00:42.660> weaker<00:00:43.140> than<00:00:43.320> another<00:00:43.739> device<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
slightly weaker than another device to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880 
slightly weaker than another device to
try<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> reasons<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.739> i'm

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
try and it's one of the reasons that i'm

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.560 
try and it's one of the reasons that i'm
having<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.219> use<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.670> ethernet<00:00:48.090> lan

connection<00:00:49.129> down<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> let's<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
connection down here so let's go to

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.439

engadget.com<00:00:55.430> just<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.520> fairly<00:00:56.850> heavy<00:00:57.059> page

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.319 

and<00:01:00.449> everything<00:01:01.020> seems<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.739> load<00:01:02.149> early<00:01:03.149> well

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
sh6 which looks slightly smaller when

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.630 
sh6 which looks slightly smaller when
it's<00:03:03.150> open<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.049> fact<00:03:04.230> when<00:03:04.470> it's<00:03:04.640> closed

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
it's open but in fact when it's closed

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.710 
it's open but in fact when it's closed
it's<00:03:06.120> pretty<00:03:06.420> much<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:07.709> same<00:03:07.980> size<00:03:08.720> I've

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
it's pretty much the the same size I've

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.809 
it's pretty much the the same size I've
actually<00:03:09.870> got<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.260> strap<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:11.069> coaching

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
actually got the strap on the coaching

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.000 
actually got the strap on the coaching
show

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.850 

so<00:03:15.640> in<00:03:15.700> terms<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.150> size<00:03:16.390> continuous<00:03:17.200> 86<00:03:17.650> which

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
so in terms of size continuous 86 which

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.470 
so in terms of size continuous 86 which
is<00:03:18.010> also<00:03:18.159> the<00:03:18.420> vice<00:03:19.530> 37<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:21.150> exactly<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.269> same

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
is also the vice 37 is exactly the same

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.970 
is also the vice 37 is exactly the same
size<00:03:23.610> I've<00:03:24.610> got<00:03:25.000> also<00:03:25.599> a<00:03:25.629> q1<00:03:26.170> ultra<00:03:26.379> here<00:03:26.829> we

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
size I've got also a q1 ultra here we

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.220 
size I've got also a q1 ultra here we
can<00:03:27.250> compare<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.299> with<00:03:28.329> another<00:03:28.569> q1<00:03:28.900> ultra<00:03:28.989> as

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
can compare it with another q1 ultra as

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.850 
can compare it with another q1 ultra as
much<00:03:29.430> much<00:03:30.430> smaller<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.379> it<00:03:32.379> also<00:03:32.530> has<00:03:32.680> a

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
much much smaller and it also has a

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.119 
much much smaller and it also has a
7-inch<00:03:33.310> screen<00:03:36.629> you<00:03:37.629> can<00:03:37.810> see<00:03:38.049> there<00:03:38.319> there's

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
7-inch screen you can see there there's

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.410 
7-inch screen you can see there there's
a<00:03:39.250> fair<00:03:39.640> bit<00:03:39.670> of<00:03:39.819> difference<00:03:40.060> in<00:03:40.360> height<00:03:42.420> but

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
a fair bit of difference in height but

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.819 
a fair bit of difference in height but
of<00:03:43.510> course<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.870> q1<00:03:44.140> ultra<00:03:44.260> doesn't<00:03:44.680> have<00:03:44.799> a

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
of course the q1 ultra doesn't have a

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.289 
of course the q1 ultra doesn't have a
keyboard<00:03:45.099> if<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.489> add<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:45.730> keyboard<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.120> the

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
keyboard if you add the keyboard to the

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.930 
keyboard if you add the keyboard to the
q<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.810> ultra<00:03:47.250> then<00:03:48.250> you're<00:03:48.430> looking<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.849> out

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
q and ultra then you're looking it out

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:56.309 
q and ultra then you're looking it out
to<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.290> much<00:03:50.290> bigger<00:03:50.920> device<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.750> couple<00:03:56.200> more

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
to a much bigger device so a couple more

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.690 
to a much bigger device so a couple more
little<00:03:56.500> bits<00:03:56.799> of<00:03:56.950> information<00:03:57.159> about<00:03:57.549> the

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
little bits of information about the

Packard Bell is no to excess it's about

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.789 
Packard Bell is no to excess it's about
two<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.269> half<00:04:01.299> hours<00:04:01.780> battery<00:04:02.109> life<00:04:02.319> with

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
or typing you should be looking at about

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.729 
or typing you should be looking at about
three<00:04:18.190> hours<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.840> up<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.169> four<00:04:20.380> hours<00:04:20.560> if

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
obviously it's going to get compared to

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.450 
obviously it's going to get compared to
