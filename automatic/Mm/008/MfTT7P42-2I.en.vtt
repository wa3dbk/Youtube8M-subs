00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.850
 such as I have to do so 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:50.700
 let's go to the high suburban 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.720
 Let's go there 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.720

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.780
 I do not want to pick up your phone so 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.310
 let's go to the suburban while I'm going 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.890
 explaining the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.560
 well, I have not done a mission in the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.290
 what is a 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.509
 well let's call it a small 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.730
 reference that is not small 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.840
 max payne one of the 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.990
 of the payne screens of both the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.330
 2 as of the like of the last one I remember 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.890
 that in the last one is where it comes out 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.260
 exactly the screen 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.620
 It is a screen 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.230
 very cool that the one who has 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.640
 played will remember her not always the 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.650
 I will say so there are no problems 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.370
 As you can see, I have gone astray because it is 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.190
 let's take advantage 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.170
 since we are here we are going to enter the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.090
 because, as you see, I'm wearing 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.860
 this man a little 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.550
 as well to my ball 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.550
 so 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.649
 the only thing we are going to do 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.620
 it is this 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.350
 we are not going to leave quickie 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.520
 well and I think that 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.520
 we lack 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.990
 we are not perfect 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.990

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.700
 well let's go there 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.820
 let's take the car again 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.280
 As I said the car I tune it I do not know how 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.200
 what tunnel did I put the wheels with 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.270
 dollar symbol do not ask me where 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.270
 nor as a man I suppose in the saints 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.190
 just not but I do not remember it 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.190
 I remember having tuned it that way 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.470
 my mother whistle that was a day that 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.950
 I would be half drunk or something and 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.950
 He told me 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.320
 what .. here 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.320
 we can find the shirt 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.270
 I do not know if it 's this second that I'm going to look 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.150
 since it is not once 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.440
 let's look at shirts over here 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.440
 this is your 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.260
 It's similar to this one 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.650
 is this 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.470
 and I'm missing my pants 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.400
 I think they are worth any 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.250
 they do not have to be do not have to be one 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.600
 one of these 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.380

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.380
 that's 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.759
 I think it's this and now we're going to look 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.759
 hunting for all these glasses here 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.270
 to see how this man has it 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.100
 OK 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.930
 let's see that they are the most similar 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.080
 no no no no no no 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.220

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.610
 right and I'm missing the shoes 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.699

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.909
 I want to remember that if you had boots 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:54.260
 up with short trains 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.260
 Well, I think that's not bad, 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.430
 OK, perfect 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.889
