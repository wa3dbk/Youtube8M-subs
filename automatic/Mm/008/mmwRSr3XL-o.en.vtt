picture here these are trackside hand
guards<00:00:34.899> haven't<00:00:35.079> even<00:00:35.230> checked<00:00:35.469> to<00:00:35.649> see<00:00:35.679> if

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829

and after I'm gonna come around the
front<00:00:54.039> here<00:00:54.129> a<00:00:54.280> little<00:00:54.519> bit<00:00:54.609> if<00:00:54.699> you<00:00:54.789> can<00:00:54.819> kind

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
front here a little bit if you can kind

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.719 
front here a little bit if you can kind
of<00:00:55.179> see<00:00:55.420> it's<00:00:56.199> a<00:00:56.409> kind<00:00:56.829> of<00:00:56.859> a<00:00:56.979> tight<00:00:57.190> close-up

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
of see it's a kind of a tight close-up

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.160 
of see it's a kind of a tight close-up
here<00:00:57.969> we've<00:00:58.149> got<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.359> Sun<00:00:58.569> in<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.690> background

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
here we've got the Sun in the background

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.959 
here we've got the Sun in the background
but<00:00:59.379> like<00:00:59.920> we<00:01:00.069> talked<00:01:00.309> about<00:01:00.429> earlier<00:01:00.879> that

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
but like we talked about earlier that

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.539 
but like we talked about earlier that
the<00:01:01.479> width<00:01:01.719> of<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.019> Pegaso<00:01:02.589> is<00:01:02.739> fairly<00:01:03.129> narrow

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
the width of the Pegaso is fairly narrow

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.210 
the width of the Pegaso is fairly narrow
which<00:01:03.999> is<00:01:04.150> kind<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.479> nice<00:01:04.770> for<00:01:05.770> maneuvering

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
which is kind of nice for maneuvering

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.160 
which is kind of nice for maneuvering
between<00:01:06.370> things<00:01:06.880> but<00:01:07.120> it's<00:01:07.270> got<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.630> standard

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
between things but it's got the standard

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.420 
between things but it's got the standard
plastic<00:01:09.480> guards<00:01:10.480> that<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:12.010> know<00:01:12.100> they<00:01:12.250> do<00:01:12.310> a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
plastic guards that you know they do a

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.160 
plastic guards that you know they do a
reasonable<00:01:13.000> job<00:01:13.030> when<00:01:13.540> it<00:01:13.630> comes<00:01:13.870> to<00:01:14.020> keeping

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
reasonable job when it comes to keeping

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.530 
reasonable job when it comes to keeping
wind<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.130> rocks<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.760> stuff<00:01:15.970> from<00:01:16.150> bouncing

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
wind and rocks and stuff from bouncing

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.870 
wind and rocks and stuff from bouncing
off<00:01:16.660> your<00:01:16.690> fingers<00:01:17.250> maybe<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.400> little<00:01:18.580> bit<00:01:18.760> of

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
off your fingers maybe a little bit of

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.460 
off your fingers maybe a little bit of
brush<00:01:19.090> but<00:01:19.420> when<00:01:19.510> you<00:01:19.600> get<00:01:19.720> up<00:01:19.810> into<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.170> trees

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
brush but when you get up into the trees

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.430 
brush but when you get up into the trees
and<00:01:20.740> stuff<00:01:20.920> like<00:01:21.160> that<00:01:21.430> these<00:01:22.440> unfortunately

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
and stuff like that these unfortunately
