there<00:00:30.140> all<00:00:31.140> right<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.560> compressor<00:00:32.099> is

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
there all right the compressor is

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.639 
there all right the compressor is
sitting<00:00:32.730> directly<00:00:32.940> behind<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:34.260> under

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
sitting directly behind it it's under

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.380 
sitting directly behind it it's under
the<00:00:34.739> seat<00:00:35.040> under<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> passenger<00:00:35.700> side<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the seat under the passenger side and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.150 
the seat under the passenger side and
the<00:00:36.480> rear<00:00:36.600> seat

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the rear seat

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.450 
the rear seat
I<00:00:38.190> took<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.559> emergency<00:00:40.559> kit<00:00:40.770> box<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.430> I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
I took the emergency kit box out I

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520 
I took the emergency kit box out I
didn't<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> kit<00:00:42.390> anyways<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
didn't have the kit anyways it's a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.490 
didn't have the kit anyways it's a
secondhand<00:00:43.950> truck<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.989> go<00:00:45.989> ahead<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.350> just

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
secondhand truck so go ahead and just

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.709 
secondhand truck so go ahead and just
removed<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.250> that's<00:00:47.520> where<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> put<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.329> that

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
removed it that's where I put that that

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.459 
removed it that's where I put that that
tank<00:00:49.370> my<00:00:50.370> on/off<00:00:50.879> switch<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> compressor

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
tank my on/off switch for the compressor

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.600 
tank my on/off switch for the compressor
is<00:00:52.649> right<00:00:52.980> here<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:54.199> center<00:00:55.199> console<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
is right here in my center console and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.590 
is right here in my center console and
then<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.070> wire<00:00:59.309> it<00:01:00.109> to<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.530> horn<00:01:01.800> itself

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
then you can wire it to the horn itself

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.830 
then you can wire it to the horn itself
but<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.170> my<00:01:04.320> own<00:01:04.350> wired<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> switch<00:01:05.840> now

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
but I have my own wired to a switch now

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.810 
but I have my own wired to a switch now
this<00:01:07.049> switches<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.920> wire<00:01:08.100> goes<00:01:08.400> directly

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
this switches the wire goes directly

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.359 
this switches the wire goes directly

holes in it the air horn sets just about

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.059 
holes in it the air horn sets just about
perfect<00:02:26.440> right<00:02:26.620> there

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069

cord<00:02:44.049> I<00:02:44.260> know<00:02:44.349> it's<00:02:44.620> probably<00:02:45.069> fire<00:02:45.489> hazard

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
cord I know it's probably fire hazard

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.600 
cord I know it's probably fire hazard
but<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.959> know<00:02:47.079> what<00:02:47.260> if<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.650> works<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:48.160> was<00:02:48.280> we

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
but you know what if it works it was we

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.270 
but you know what if it works it was we
had<00:02:48.760> one<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.060> was<00:02:49.180> all<00:02:49.269> cut<00:02:49.480> up<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:50.280> it'll

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
had one that was all cut up so it'll
