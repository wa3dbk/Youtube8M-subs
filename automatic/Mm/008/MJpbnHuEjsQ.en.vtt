world were in the food sector and the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.640 
world were in the food sector and the
premium<00:01:21.450> food<00:01:21.659> sector<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.140> people<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.500> very

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
premium food sector so people are very

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.260 
premium food sector so people are very
interested<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.159> getting<00:01:23.280> premium<00:01:23.580> foods<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
interested in getting premium foods and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.870 
interested in getting premium foods and
we're<00:01:24.450> spending<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.840> lot<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:24.990> time<00:01:25.110> growing

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
we're spending a lot of time growing

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.010 
we're spending a lot of time growing
adding<00:01:26.880> jobs<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> time<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.750> this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
adding jobs all the time I think this

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.510 
adding jobs all the time I think this
year<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.259> probably<00:01:28.320> add<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.770> 15<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.280> 20

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
year would probably add about 15 to 20

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.370 
year would probably add about 15 to 20
jobs<00:01:29.700> alone<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.540> you've<00:01:30.750> actually<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.229> come
