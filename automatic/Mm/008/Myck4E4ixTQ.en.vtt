00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.540
 good afternoon today we will do 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.330
 trellis for grapes she will help 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.900
 form the position of the shoots 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.600
 providing a quick offensive 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.800
 fruitful front right 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.140
 equipped supports 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.199
 help shape the position of the bushes 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.420
 protect them from falling to the ground do 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.420
 convenient grape care and harvesting 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.219
 There are two types of school design 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.860
 One-plane and two-plane and 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.559
 Now we will show how to make 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.480
 one flat trellis for this 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.940
 metal pipes are required or 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.870
 corner of which will be made 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.870
 supports 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.420
 they will need to be buried in the ground not 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.520
 less than half a meter 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.460
 the total length of the blanks for the supports should 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.649
 be at least two and a half meters in 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.440
 our disposal has established 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.900
 metal pipe supports step 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.880
 installation of supports recommended 34 meters 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.390
 between the supports we will stretch the metal 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.540
 cable 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.810
 vinyl chloride coating protecting it from 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.810
 corrosion 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.310
 mark support 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.750
 first level 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.869
 located at a height of 50 centimeters from 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.869
 land 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.220
 second and subsequent levels in increments of 40 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.220
 centimeters 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.649
 the cable will be fixed to the support with 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.560
 roofing screws with washers on 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.240
 markup make holes for screws 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.329
 since our supports are made of thick-walled 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.329
 pipes 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:28.770
 baiting with screws we fix the end 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:28.770
 rope pull the coward between the supports 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.560
 fix the end 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:27.620
 we twist the screws to the end presses 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:28.189
 rose trellis ready this is the easiest 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.680
 option 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.689
 and reliable all plant will be 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.560
 be located and grow in one 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:39.099
 plane to care for grapes just 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.439
 ripening occurs evenly 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.919
 good harvest you subscribe to
