00:00:02.986 --> 00:00:05.720
You might remember
our previous ARMA III preview

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.728
It has been a long time since that,
so we were curious what's new

00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:17.077
ARMA 3 remains tactical military simulator

00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.543
It's the genre that we've
introduced in our previous games

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:26.731
However, we decided to improve,
change and expand some things

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:35.172
So ARMA 3 stands for larger terrain,
bigger than in our previous titles

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:38.035
We're going underwater

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.214
and be able to modify your
weapon and soldier as you want

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:49.329
Also ARMA 3 will bring huge
amount of military entertainment

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:51.047
So, what are the hot news?

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:55.545
This innovation you see,
is not really the hottest

00:00:55.615 --> 00:01:00.025
We've finally managed to
improve fighting underwater

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.230
Submarines, underwater
exploration, the seafloor...

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.869
We are about a few 
hundred meters far from the Stratis island

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.282
Here you can see
sank fishing boat

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:24.193
As you can see, there's
a lot of fishes in ARMA 3

00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:29.367
This vehicle is designed for infiltration,
so it doesn't exhale bubbles

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:31.549
Oh, and there we have seen a tuna :-)

00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:34.480
The vehicle is hardly noticeable

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:40.578
The seafloor apart from those small rocks

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:44.441
consists of these nice structures

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.120
Now, I can switch to the
commander's position

00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:56.743
which is not completely realistic

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:02.096
I gave him an order to
maintain periscope depth

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:06.577
and I can use the periscope

00:02:06.884 --> 00:02:15.626
That is the small part of island Stratis

00:02:15.731 --> 00:02:19.915
Another piece of news is
the island Stratis itself

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.481
ARMA 3 will feature 2 island,
however we planned only one

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:29.874
Apart from large Limnos

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:36.447
there is Aglos Efstratios,
shortly called Stratis

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:41.845
Stratis will be the first 
player's "base" in ARMA 3 campaign

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:48.139
Stratis is rather rocky island,
more "green" than Limnos

00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:54.999
Compared to reality, we added 
more towns, farms and villages

00:02:55.017 --> 00:02:59.974
and certainly this big anti-air radar,
which I'm heading to right now

00:03:00.104 --> 00:03:04.714
Like on Limnos, we changed 
the terrain for our own picture

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:07.641
We slightly made it smaller

00:03:07.693 --> 00:03:11.061
so infantry missions will be better

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:13.915
Here you can see the military base

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.009
large airport

00:03:15.087 --> 00:03:19.019
Everything you see is
still under development

00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:25.806
Thus some areas are not looking
as we yet desire

00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:34.254
Nonetheless, I can say Stratis 
is very nice alternative to Limnos

00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:39.415
For example, for those who want
to fight for the island

00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:42.202
will like this island

00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:46.828
Let's have a look at short gunfight

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:53.416
In between NATO soldiers
namely US light infantry

00:03:53.478 --> 00:03:57.662
and Iranian occupants

00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:02.688
As you can see, from now
the animations are improved

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.671
It's one of the things player 
will feel instead of seeing them directly

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:16.894
from the monitor

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:22.241
However I hope these short
examples will tell you something about it

00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:26.768
Of course, apart from improving animations

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.919
of movements

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.929
We also pay attention to guns' behaviour
such as recoil

00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:39.132
To be like real life,
when our designers

00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:42.909
went to the shooting range
and tried the weapons

00:04:43.812 --> 00:04:47.319
I still don't see any enemy

00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:49.976
I'm proceeding very incautiously

00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:54.811
Here you can see...
and that was pretty quick

00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:57.656
When you see the flash
it's already too late :-)

00:04:58.577 --> 00:05:01.667
There you can see who was killed

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:06.023
Last question, tell us something
you haven't told to anybody else

00:05:06.103 --> 00:05:10.843
It might have not been said,
but players will be able to use

00:05:10.903 --> 00:05:15.184
chemlights, those chemical lights

00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:19.742
You break it, throw into the grass
and it emits light

00:05:19.814 --> 00:05:23.338
Real soldiers like to use that

00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:29.361
One of my co-workers
who was in military

00:05:29.535 --> 00:05:37.367
Was really happy, when he found out
chemlights are included in game

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.619
And he's really looking forward
to use it in CO-OP missions

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:48.265
To mark routes, LZs, DZs and how
he will enjoy the game with his

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:56.000
I was really surprised of his reaction.
