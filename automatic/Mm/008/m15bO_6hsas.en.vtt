00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.170
 we are used to being the author of Acacia or 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.210
 the mode itself is turning the pussy of what screw 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.930
 Used for accurate and soft landing 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.400
 at failure david this is an emergency procedure 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:31.000
 actually so it is described varl 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.910
 in ordinary life sometimes we want to go on 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 landing on a round glide path 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.840
 quickly reset the speed and altitude 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.540
 nothing out of the ordinary 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.019
 the only condition we cannot hold 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.000
 airspeed less than 30 catch to 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.299
 don't get into so-called mode 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.180
 drinking ring and here we go on 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:01:00.460
 road from a height with long 350 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:03.280
 meters from the ground but power 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.390
 supplied to the carrying Windows is not enough 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.520
 and overrunning clutch in our helicopter 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.090
 starts to turn on periodically and 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.810
 turn it off leads to increased wear 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.850
 bypass snouts and listen as she 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.850
 reacts to our exercises 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.540
 now let's try to execute 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.850
 landing on the same road from the same height 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.740
 from the same point but in autorotation mode 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.640
 our only concern is 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.600
 to control 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.170
 rotational rotor hitting mode 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.880
 vortex ring excluded for us 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:27.510
 so the air speed of us is not 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:31.360
 worried we are not torturing our supporting hand and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:35.110
 autorotation mode is normal 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.440
 flight mode 0 to 100 led uterine 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.190
 the only thing that suffers is that we must 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.840
 make it quit autorotation 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.870
 normal flight mode 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.820
 airspeed of about 30 knots to 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:57.660
 don't get into the crooked ring and here we are 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.660
 landed safely and efficiently 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.519
 Flight pilot constantly monitors 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.250
 the mass of every parameter in mode 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.099
 autorotation this adds control 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.700
 rotor speed try this 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:27.049
 exercise we enter autorotation 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.069
 at a speed of 100 knots and then smoothly 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:33.489
 reduce the flight speed to 40 or 30 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.489
 knots 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.760
 tachometer needle 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:45.769
 the rotor should remain border 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:48.530
 98 102 percent after we lowered 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.280
 the speed of our helicopter 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:57.069
 we start remaining in autorotation mode 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.569
 smoothly and and increase to 100 knots 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.410
 when can you do it 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:07.069
 sure vas one problem and one 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.140
 autorotation care will be not only 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.140
 do it at a safe height 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.780
 here's an exercise once again just doing 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.380
 about two times mine 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.920
 pay more attention when 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.840
 active braking on autorotation 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.840
 the helicopter even gains some height 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.740
 only please 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.810
 perform this exercise with experienced 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.850
 instructor 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.500
 otherwise you risk throwing defense 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.780
 rotor or lost 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.480
 both can have 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.780
 disastrous consequences do not need about 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.780
 forget this 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:01.889
 sometimes we get distracted and turnaround rotors 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.130
 fall rapidly or grow as 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.600
 instantly fix the situation for everything 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.750
 know what 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.960
 helicopter rotor much faster 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.650
 reacts to the actions of the cyclic handle 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.850
 look at the steps of those in common as a pen 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.220
 cyclic step we can instantly 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:30.720
 change the trend of revolutions 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:35.700
 rotor loop on itself 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:39.570
 turnovers grow cycle turnovers for themselves 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:44.880
 stop rock it is clear that after 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:47.340
 cycle com acts handle common check 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.430
 loop on rotor 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.010
 act faster look this one 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:57.440
 part roller and several times and you will see 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:01.039
 how quickly can we respond to 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.919
 turnover and rotor and change and 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:06.919
 prevent undesirable consequences 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.919
 thank
