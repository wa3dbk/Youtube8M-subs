 Hello, Iâ€™ll tell you about diagnostics 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.059
 and troubleshooting to repair the rear 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:20.670
 variator pulley with a much higher can 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:24.050
 happen as first for example need 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.140
 check something not under the wedge 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:38.670
 it is generally to the variator which is a finger 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:41.090
 point you see and she still has 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.090
 these 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:01:00.900
 reveals the fact that the bearings so as not to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:08.340
 dangling accounting 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:19.440
 learn everything is fine pads so as not to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:25.370
 were wall and even pads and this 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.370
 like so little straight to such a hollow 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:36.180
 mail it on my experience met 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.020
 there were such instances of which 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:47.069
 spring broke 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:48.740
 so what are you checking too further here 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.770
 so you too 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:59.240
 anthers anther stood it with 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:02.719
 metal nut checks studying 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.719
 basically everything is here 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.370
 speed 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:17.440
 shawls for example 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.000
 to recognize it and so that it does not understand 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:28.800
 nothing shorter scooter will be bad 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.800
 go to blunt all kinds of failures will 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.670
 all on this all put huskies
