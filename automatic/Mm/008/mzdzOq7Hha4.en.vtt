however<00:02:03.000> long<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.600> been<00:02:03.689> I've<00:02:04.049> been<00:02:04.290> doing

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
however long it's been I've been doing

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.499 
however long it's been I've been doing
this<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:05.460> i<00:02:05.579> noticed<00:02:05.880> i<00:02:05.969> gained<00:02:06.149> weight<00:02:06.270> for

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
like the past two months I guess to be

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.170 
like the past two months I guess to be
honest<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.280> noticeable<00:02:11.959> like

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
honest it's not that noticeable like

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.300 
honest it's not that noticeable like
I<00:02:13.239> like<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.319> can<00:02:14.439> tell<00:02:14.650> like<00:02:14.799> a<00:02:14.920> little<00:02:15.159> bit

anything<00:02:18.129> like<00:02:18.579> no<00:02:18.760> one<00:02:18.879> thinks<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.299> I'd

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
anything like no one thinks that I'd

constantly of not sleeping enough of

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.259 
constantly of not sleeping enough of
taking<00:03:18.790> diet<00:03:19.419> pills<00:03:19.569> like<00:03:20.169> I<00:03:20.790> abused<00:03:21.790> my<00:03:21.909> body

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
taking diet pills like I abused my body

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.259 
taking diet pills like I abused my body
and<00:03:22.479> now<00:03:22.629> it's<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:22.989> healing<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.879> can't<00:03:24.879> expect

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
and now it's just healing I can't expect

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.309 
and now it's just healing I can't expect
to<00:03:25.419> reverse<00:03:25.659> the<00:03:25.840> damage<00:03:25.930> I've<00:03:26.290> done

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
to reverse the damage I've done

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.939 
to reverse the damage I've done
overnight<00:03:26.829> and<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.849> gonna<00:03:28.540> take<00:03:28.870> probably<00:03:29.560> a

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
overnight and it's gonna take probably a

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.649 
overnight and it's gonna take probably a
few<00:03:30.400> more<00:03:30.519> months<00:03:30.669> i'm<00:03:30.909> guessing<00:03:31.299> i<00:03:31.479> think

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
few more months i'm guessing i think

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.479 
few more months i'm guessing i think
it'll<00:03:31.810> like<00:03:32.470> how<00:03:32.590> i<00:03:32.620> see<00:03:32.859> it<00:03:32.889> is<00:03:33.040> however<00:03:33.220> long

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
it'll like how i see it is however long

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.520 
it'll like how i see it is however long
you<00:03:33.609> have<00:03:33.760> use<00:03:33.939> your<00:03:34.150> body<00:03:34.329> for<00:03:34.449> is<00:03:34.780> how<00:03:35.109> how

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
you have use your body for is how how

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.110 
you have use your body for is how how
long<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:35.889> going<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.069> take<00:03:36.159> generally<00:03:36.819> for<00:03:37.060> it

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
long it's going to take generally for it

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.899 
long it's going to take generally for it
to<00:03:37.269> heal<00:03:37.569> that<00:03:38.370> could<00:03:39.370> be<00:03:39.489> completely<00:03:39.699> wrong

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
to heal that could be completely wrong

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.999 
to heal that could be completely wrong
but<00:03:40.090> that's<00:03:40.359> just<00:03:40.510> what<00:03:40.659> I<00:03:40.720> think<00:03:40.989> if<00:03:41.829> you

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:42.009 
but that's just what I think if you

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:44.729 
but that's just what I think if you
think<00:03:42.609> anything<00:03:42.790> different<00:03:43.359> let<00:03:43.870> me<00:03:43.959> know<00:03:44.109> but

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
think anything different let me know but

of hypocritical about the weight thing

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.200 
of hypocritical about the weight thing

gain weight no one wants to look in the

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.900 
gain weight no one wants to look in the
mirror<00:05:53.740> and<00:05:53.770> say<00:05:53.860> oh<00:05:53.980> I<00:05:54.070> gained<00:05:54.460> weight<00:05:54.640> like

mirror and say oh I gained weight like

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.410 
mirror and say oh I gained weight like
I'm<00:05:55.660> not<00:05:55.840> I'm<00:05:56.560> not<00:05:56.620> happy<00:05:57.010> about<00:05:57.190> it<00:05:57.490> but<00:05:58.270> at

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
I'm not I'm not happy about it but at

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.270 
I'm not I'm not happy about it but at
the<00:05:58.540> same<00:05:58.780> time<00:05:59.020> like<00:05:59.410> I<00:05:59.650> have<00:05:59.860> the<00:06:00.070> bigger

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
the same time like I have the bigger

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.340 
the same time like I have the bigger
picture<00:06:00.610> in<00:06:00.940> mind<00:06:01.120> I<00:06:02.130> think<00:06:03.130> there<00:06:03.460> is<00:06:03.490> just

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
picture in mind I think there is just

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.510 
picture in mind I think there is just
too<00:06:05.350> much<00:06:07.470> emphasis<00:06:08.470> around<00:06:08.920> weight<00:06:09.190> in

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
too much emphasis around weight in

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.930 
too much emphasis around weight in
today's<00:06:10.510> society<00:06:10.690> and<00:06:11.350> I<00:06:11.440> think<00:06:11.710> that<00:06:12.610> it's

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
today's society and I think that it's

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.110 
today's society and I think that it's
not<00:06:13.150> a<00:06:13.890> good<00:06:14.890> message<00:06:15.100> to<00:06:15.460> give<00:06:15.610> young<00:06:15.790> girls

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
not a good message to give young girls

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.510 
not a good message to give young girls
and<00:06:16.500> I<00:06:17.500> think<00:06:17.770> it's<00:06:17.890> how<00:06:17.980> people<00:06:18.040> develop

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
and I think it's how people develop

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.790 
and I think it's how people develop
eating<00:06:18.850> disorders<00:06:18.970> in<00:06:19.360> the<00:06:19.450> first<00:06:19.660> place<00:06:19.780> so<00:06:20.170> I

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
eating disorders in the first place so I

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.830 
eating disorders in the first place so I
really<00:06:21.100> think<00:06:21.250> we<00:06:21.400> should<00:06:21.490> step<00:06:22.330> back<00:06:22.390> from

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
really think we should step back from

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.200 
really think we should step back from
the<00:06:22.900> whole<00:06:23.050> weight<00:06:23.290> aspect<00:06:23.860> that<00:06:24.730> 80<00:06:24.940> 10<00:06:25.180> 10

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
the whole weight aspect that 80 10 10

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.720 
the whole weight aspect that 80 10 10
brings<00:06:25.660> and<00:06:26.040> realize<00:06:27.040> all<00:06:27.220> the<00:06:27.340> other<00:06:27.460> things

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
brings and realize all the other things

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.420 
brings and realize all the other things
that<00:06:27.880> it<00:06:28.030> gives<00:06:28.210> us<00:06:29.010> so<00:06:30.010> if<00:06:30.130> you're<00:06:30.280> watching

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
that it gives us so if you're watching

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.610 
that it gives us so if you're watching
