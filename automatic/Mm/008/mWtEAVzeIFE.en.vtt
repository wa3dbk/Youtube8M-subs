struggling to open it and get it out now

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.289

these<00:02:18.260> lashes<00:02:18.500> are<00:02:18.860> pretty<00:02:19.190> long<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.880> I'm<00:02:20.060> just

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
these lashes are pretty long so I'm just

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.120 
these lashes are pretty long so I'm just
trimming<00:02:20.600> them<00:02:20.870> just<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.350> little<00:02:21.380> bit<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.069> then

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
trimming them just a little bit and then

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.539 
trimming them just a little bit and then
I'm<00:02:23.000> adding<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.569> lash<00:02:24.140> glue<00:02:24.410> make<00:02:25.220> sure<00:02:25.250> you

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
I'm adding the lash glue make sure you

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.120 
I'm adding the lash glue make sure you
wait<00:02:25.790> about<00:02:26.000> 30<00:02:26.420> seconds<00:02:26.930> before<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.650> apply

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
wait about 30 seconds before you apply

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.070 
wait about 30 seconds before you apply
them<00:02:28.430> on<00:02:28.700> your<00:02:29.209> lash<00:02:29.600> line<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:32.900> might

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
them on your lash line and you might

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.110 
them on your lash line and you might
notice<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.799> have<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.459> little<00:02:34.700> bit<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:34.940> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
notice that I have a little bit of the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.750 
notice that I have a little bit of the
residue<00:02:35.600> on<00:02:35.900> my<00:02:36.410> lid<00:02:36.920> but<00:02:37.310> that's<00:02:37.489> okay

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
residue on my lid but that's okay

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.300 
residue on my lid but that's okay
because<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:38.810> eyelash<00:02:39.080> glue<00:02:39.380> actually<00:02:39.980> dries

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
because this eyelash glue actually dries

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.370 
because this eyelash glue actually dries
