switched<00:02:45.489> on<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:47.400> brightness<00:02:48.400> would

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
switched on the brightness would

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.360 
switched on the brightness would
decrease<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.440> 75%<00:02:50.440> as<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.770> could<00:02:50.950> see<00:02:51.160> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
decrease to 75% as you could see the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.360 
decrease to 75% as you could see the
difference<00:02:52.140> between<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.440> brightness<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
difference between the brightness on the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.620 
difference between the brightness on the
screen<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.330> here<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.739> bread<00:02:57.120> eco<00:02:58.120> savings<00:02:58.270> is

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
screen so here the bread eco savings is

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.620 
screen so here the bread eco savings is
off<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.170> it's<00:02:59.350> screen<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.250> very<00:03:00.489> bright<00:03:00.760> if<00:03:01.450> I

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
off so it's screen is very bright if I

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.010 
off so it's screen is very bright if I
make<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.930> 50%<00:03:02.230> maybe<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.550> slightly<00:03:04.300> darker

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
make it 50% maybe it's a slightly darker

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.750 
make it 50% maybe it's a slightly darker
and<00:03:05.290> if<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.500> says<00:03:05.709> my<00:03:05.920> percentage<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.520> gets

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
and if it says my percentage it gets

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.360 
and if it says my percentage it gets
much<00:03:06.970> much<00:03:07.180> much<00:03:07.420> darker<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:08.770> would<00:03:09.160> like<00:03:09.280> to

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
much much much darker so I would like to

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.800 
much much much darker so I would like to
keep<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.640> off<00:03:09.970> for<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.420> moment<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:13.360> put<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
keep it off for the moment and I put the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.090 
keep it off for the moment and I put the
standby<00:03:14.230> LED<00:03:14.680> monitor<00:03:15.430> out<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.620> in

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
standby LED monitor out so this is in

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.259
