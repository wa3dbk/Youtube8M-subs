hi<00:00:00.539> today<00:00:01.319> I'm<00:00:01.410> going<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.680> show<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:02.190> fun<00:00:02.520> way<00:00:02.790> to

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hi today I'm going to show a fun way to

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.889 
hi today I'm going to show a fun way to
build<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.810> maintain<00:00:04.250> upper-body<00:00:05.250> strength

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
build and maintain upper-body strength

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.629 
build and maintain upper-body strength
basically<00:00:06.899> you<00:00:07.410> involves<00:00:07.890> learning<00:00:08.130> and

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
basically you involves learning and

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.030 
basically you involves learning and
performing<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.240> handstand<00:00:09.740> now<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.800> might

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
performing a handstand now you might

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.700 
performing a handstand now you might
think<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.550> don't<00:00:11.880> have<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.330> hand<00:00:12.540> step<00:00:12.870> but

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
think I don't have it on hand step but

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.410 
think I don't have it on hand step but
I'll<00:00:13.830> show<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.130> how<00:00:14.340> with<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.639> right<00:00:14.849> safety

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
I'll show you how with the right safety

catch your legs if you roll for now you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.680 
catch your legs if you roll for now you
can<00:00:52.290> extend<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.950> routine<00:00:53.520> by<00:00:54.240> making

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
can extend this routine by making

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.870 
can extend this routine by making
yourself<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.140> couple<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.500> parallettes<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
yourself a couple of parallettes and

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.550 
yourself a couple of parallettes and
doing<00:00:57.210> shoulder<00:00:57.450> press<00:00:57.840> while<00:00:58.200> suspended

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
doing shoulder press while suspended

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:11.210 
doing shoulder press while suspended
upside<00:00:59.220> down

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.620 

now<00:01:12.220> your<00:01:12.460> very<00:01:12.640> first<00:01:12.940> step<00:01:13.150> will<00:01:13.480> be<00:01:13.510> to

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
now your very first step will be to

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.900 
now your very first step will be to
learn<00:01:13.990> how<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.380> suspend<00:01:14.980> yourself<00:01:15.130> safely

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
learn how to suspend yourself safely

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.150 
learn how to suspend yourself safely
this<00:01:16.810> how<00:01:17.050> you<00:01:17.110> do<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:20.650> to<00:01:20.800> spend<00:01:21.040> yourself

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
this how you do is to spend yourself

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.910 
this how you do is to spend yourself
using<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:21.880> arms<00:01:22.210> first<00:01:22.570> then<00:01:23.380> bring<00:01:23.740> the

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
using the arms first then bring the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.620 
using the arms first then bring the
lower<00:01:24.310> body<00:01:24.640> up<00:01:24.910> like<00:01:25.030> this

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
lower body up like this

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.660 
lower body up like this
what's<00:01:26.500> he<00:01:26.680> comfortable<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:27.460> this<00:01:27.610> position

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
what's he comfortable in this position

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.520 
what's he comfortable in this position
and<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.420> able<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.750> hold<00:01:28.960> it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
and you able to hold it

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.120 
and you able to hold it
bring<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.190> legs<00:01:30.400> over<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.700> top<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:32.130> bend

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
bring the legs over the top and bend

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.820 
bring the legs over the top and bend
your<00:01:33.190> knees<00:01:33.430> and<00:01:33.870> then<00:01:34.870> you<00:01:34.990> can<00:01:35.170> slowly<00:01:35.470> let

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
your knees and then you can slowly let

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.790 
your knees and then you can slowly let
go<00:01:36.480> your<00:01:37.480> first<00:01:37.720> time<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:38.050> recommend<00:01:38.620> using

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
go your first time I recommend using

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.990 
go your first time I recommend using
some<00:01:39.160> cushions<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.290> case<00:01:41.440> you<00:01:41.620> fall<00:01:42.000> once

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
some cushions just in case you fall once

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.430 
some cushions just in case you fall once
you're<00:01:43.180> upside<00:01:43.480> down<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.870> I<00:01:43.900> will<00:01:44.110> put<00:01:44.320> your

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
you're upside down the I will put your

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.970 
you're upside down the I will put your
hands<00:01:44.680> on<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:44.980> ground<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:45.520> push<00:01:46.270> yourself<00:01:46.690> up

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
hands on the ground and push yourself up

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.560 
hands on the ground and push yourself up
so<00:01:47.980> this<00:01:48.160> will<00:01:48.400> begin<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.180> teach<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:52.420> you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
so this will begin to teach you if you

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.510 
so this will begin to teach you if you
make<00:01:53.200> your<00:01:53.350> quotient<00:01:53.800> with<00:01:53.950> being<00:01:54.130> upside

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
make your quotient with being upside

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.050 
make your quotient with being upside
down<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.510> having<00:01:55.810> your<00:01:56.020> weight<00:01:56.200> supported

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
down and having your weight supported

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.800 
down and having your weight supported
with<00:01:58.060> your<00:01:58.240> hands<00:01:59.400> dismount<00:02:00.420> let<00:02:01.420> go<00:02:01.570> with<00:02:01.780> one

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
with your hands dismount let go with one

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.150 
with your hands dismount let go with one
leg<00:02:03.000> bring<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.120> down<00:02:04.360> another<00:02:05.020> weight<00:02:05.290> comes

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
leg bring it down another weight comes

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.810 
leg bring it down another weight comes
down<00:02:07.110> once<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.229> perfect<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.490> can<00:02:09.670> then

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
down once you perfect that you can then

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.890 
down once you perfect that you can then
progress<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.440> doing<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.530> handstand<00:02:12.600> right<00:02:13.600> in

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
progress to doing a handstand right in

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:29.380 
progress to doing a handstand right in
front<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.160> horizontal<00:02:15.489> bar

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.410 

so<00:02:30.390> there<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:31.080> bun<00:02:31.500> yet<00:02:32.040> site-wide<00:02:32.850> to

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
so there it is a bun yet site-wide to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.709 
so there it is a bun yet site-wide to
build<00:02:33.660> your<00:02:33.840> hopper<00:02:34.050> body<00:02:34.319> strength
