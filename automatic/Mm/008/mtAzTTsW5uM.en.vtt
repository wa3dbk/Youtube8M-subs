00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.080 
curse has really warped his revenge so
much<00:00:21.869> now<00:00:22.320> that's<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.859> only<00:00:23.580> thing<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.970> he

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
much now that's the only thing that he

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.000 
much now that's the only thing that he
cares<00:00:24.359> about<00:00:24.539> he<00:00:24.779> doesn't<00:00:25.109> care<00:00:25.260> how<00:00:25.529> he<00:00:25.590> gets

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
cares about he doesn't care how he gets

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.700 
cares about he doesn't care how he gets
it<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.730> he's<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.150> abandon<00:00:27.810> everything<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it so he's just abandon everything and

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.740 
it so he's just abandon everything and
so<00:00:28.920> he's<00:00:29.130> literally<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.789> using<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.420> guilt

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
so he's literally just using this guilt

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.410 
so he's literally just using this guilt
to<00:00:31.439> find<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> book<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.040> end<00:00:32.309> not<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:33.300> worship

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
soref which makes a lot of sense it's

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.250 
soref which makes a lot of sense it's
just<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> curse<00:00:35.910> has<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.360> twisted<00:00:37.140> him

he had with the dark priest at the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.529 
he had with the dark priest at the
beginning<00:00:57.000> seemed<00:00:57.780> very<00:00:58.170> suspicious<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.910> me

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
beginning seemed very suspicious to me

beginning seemed very suspicious to me
and<00:01:00.960> he's<00:01:01.410> also<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> first<00:01:01.980> one<00:01:02.160> who<00:01:02.340> brought

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
Minerva thank you um I was kind of sad

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.490 
Minerva thank you um I was kind of sad
that<00:02:51.299> she<00:02:51.450> didn't<00:02:51.720> follow<00:02:51.810> after<00:02:52.349> them<00:02:52.470> and

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
that she didn't follow after them and

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.990 
that she didn't follow after them and
she<00:02:52.709> just<00:02:52.890> stayed<00:02:53.069> with<00:02:53.250> rogue<00:02:53.459> but<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.790> guess

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
she just stayed with rogue but I guess

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.020 
she just stayed with rogue but I guess
that<00:02:54.120> makes<00:02:54.269> more<00:02:54.480> sense<00:02:54.750> um<00:02:55.459> our<00:02:56.459> numbers

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
that makes more sense um our numbers

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.759 
that makes more sense um our numbers
might<00:02:57.209> be<00:02:57.329> more<00:02:57.450> even<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:57.959> juvia<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.500> Wendy

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
might be more even if juvia and Wendy

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.920 
might be more even if juvia and Wendy
eventually<00:02:59.190> show<00:02:59.370> up<00:02:59.430> because<00:02:59.760> which<00:03:00.690> would

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
eventually show up because which would

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.050 
eventually show up because which would
actually<00:03:01.290> make<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.829> numbers<00:03:01.950> even<00:03:02.280> because

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
actually make the numbers even because

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.600 
actually make the numbers even because
right<00:03:03.299> now<00:03:03.329> it's<00:03:03.810> eight<00:03:04.049> on<00:03:04.290> for<00:03:04.709> because<00:03:05.519> I'm

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
right now it's eight on for because I'm

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.270 
right now it's eight on for because I'm
not<00:03:05.730> including<00:03:06.329> happy<00:03:06.599> I'm<00:03:06.690> just<00:03:06.900> not<00:03:07.019> um<00:03:07.410> and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
not including happy I'm just not um and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.030 
not including happy I'm just not um and
then<00:03:08.640> if<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.120> take<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.540> spy<00:03:09.840> it'll<00:03:10.470> be<00:03:10.590> seven

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
then if you take the spy it'll be seven

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.850 
then if you take the spy it'll be seven
against<00:03:11.640> five<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.269> then<00:03:12.840> if<00:03:13.140> we<00:03:13.349> bring<00:03:13.590> back

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
against five and then if we bring back

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.550 
against five and then if we bring back
in<00:03:14.069> juvia<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.700> Wendy<00:03:15.120> it'll<00:03:15.750> be<00:03:15.900> even<00:03:16.110> numbers

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
in juvia and Wendy it'll be even numbers

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.099 
in juvia and Wendy it'll be even numbers
seven<00:03:17.010> on<00:03:17.130> seven<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.030> really<00:03:18.720> believe<00:03:19.079> that

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
seven on seven so I really believe that

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.539 
seven on seven so I really believe that
those<00:03:19.350> two<00:03:19.560> have<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.889> show<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.190> or<00:03:20.400> we're

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
those two have to show up or we're

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.979 
those two have to show up or we're
getting<00:03:20.639> in<00:03:20.880> new<00:03:21.030> fairytail<00:03:21.480> members<00:03:21.780> but

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
getting in new fairytail members but

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.259 
getting in new fairytail members but
juvia<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.069> Wendy<00:03:23.310> are<00:03:23.340> already<00:03:23.819> kind<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.120> a

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
juvia and Wendy are already kind of a

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.930 
juvia and Wendy are already kind of a
part<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.569> this<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.069> personally<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.459> believe<00:03:26.639> it

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
part of this so personally I believe it

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.910 
part of this so personally I believe it
makes<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.239> most<00:03:27.510> sense<00:03:27.690> at<00:03:28.139> least<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:28.590> even

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
makes the most sense at least with even

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.330 
makes the most sense at least with even
numbers<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.519> bring<00:03:29.819> in<00:03:30.000> juvia<00:03:30.569> and<00:03:31.100> um<00:03:32.100> and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
numbers to bring in juvia and um and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.090 
numbers to bring in juvia and um and
Wendy<00:03:32.810> last<00:03:33.810> thing<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.200> just<00:03:34.380> kind<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.889> thing

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
Wendy last thing is just kind of a thing

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.349 
Wendy last thing is just kind of a thing
that<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.400> think<00:03:35.639> a<00:03:35.700> lot<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.000> Internet's

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
that I think a lot of the Internet's

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.800 
that I think a lot of the Internet's
been<00:03:36.480> playing<00:03:36.780> with<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.260> Mary<00:03:38.060> she's<00:03:39.060> very

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
been playing with this Mary she's very
