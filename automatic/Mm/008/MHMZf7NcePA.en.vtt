the ipad is the most advanced piece of
technology<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:09.270> I've<00:05:09.479> ever<00:05:09.690> worked<00:05:09.900> on<00:05:10.139> a

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
technology that I've ever worked on a

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.589 
technology that I've ever worked on a
nap<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:11.430> innovation<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.240> product

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
nap the innovation and the product

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.450 
nap the innovation and the product
really<00:05:12.810> starts<00:05:13.229> with<00:05:13.440> multi-touch<00:05:13.860> itself

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
really starts with multi-touch itself

really starts with multi-touch itself
this<00:05:14.970> multi-touch<00:05:15.690> is<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.110> largest<00:05:16.500> that

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
this multi-touch is the largest that

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.279 
this multi-touch is the largest that
we've<00:05:17.069> ever<00:05:17.250> built<00:05:17.580> in<00:05:17.789> a<00:05:17.879> product<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.569> it's

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
we've ever built in a product and it's

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.200 
we've ever built in a product and it's
on<00:05:19.470> multi-touch<00:05:20.129> of<00:05:20.340> this<00:05:20.580> size<00:05:20.819> that<00:05:21.180> you

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
on multi-touch of this size that you

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.330 
on multi-touch of this size that you
really<00:05:21.900> feel<00:05:22.199> the<00:05:22.470> power<00:05:22.740> and<00:05:23.099> performance

really feel the power and performance
that<00:05:24.000> multi-touch<00:05:24.479> can<00:05:24.750> offer

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
that multi-touch can offer

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.520 
that multi-touch can offer
by<00:05:26.760> putting<00:05:27.000> well<00:05:27.270> over<00:05:27.540> a<00:05:27.600> thousand<00:05:28.140> sensors

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
by putting well over a thousand sensors

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.790 
by putting well over a thousand sensors
in<00:05:28.710> this<00:05:29.040> multi-touch<00:05:29.640> design<00:05:30.140> the<00:05:31.140> level<00:05:31.710> of

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
in this multi-touch design the level of

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.770 
in this multi-touch design the level of
multi-touch<00:05:32.310> accuracy<00:05:33.030> that<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.300> customer

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
multi-touch accuracy that the customer

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.380 
multi-touch accuracy that the customer
experience<00:05:33.810> is<00:05:34.590> unprecedented<00:05:35.300> when<00:05:36.300> you

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
experience is unprecedented when you

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.660 
experience is unprecedented when you
take<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.750> product<00:05:37.020> out<00:05:37.320> of<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.680> box<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.340> hit

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
take the product out of the box and hit

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.080 
take the product out of the box and hit
the<00:05:38.820> power<00:05:39.030> button

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
the power button

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.659 
the power button
the<00:05:40.419> display<00:05:40.810> maybe<00:05:41.350> comes<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.800> life<00:05:41.980> and<00:05:42.280> I

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
the display maybe comes to life and I

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.460 
the display maybe comes to life and I
think<00:05:43.000> our<00:05:43.150> customers<00:05:43.630> experience<00:05:44.020> with<00:05:44.440> that

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
think our customers experience with that

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.980 
think our customers experience with that
would<00:05:44.860> be<00:05:45.010> wow<00:05:45.370> this<00:05:45.730> is<00:05:45.790> a<00:05:46.000> really<00:05:46.510> vibrant

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
the custom silicon then we designed for

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.020 
the custom silicon then we designed for
this<00:06:19.720> product<00:06:20.260> that<00:06:20.440> silicon<00:06:21.370> is<00:06:21.460> called<00:06:21.790> a

fool

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.950 
fool
and<00:06:23.100> it's<00:06:23.580> really<00:06:23.700> built<00:06:24.210> by<00:06:24.420> our<00:06:24.570> hardware

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
and it's really built by our hardware

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.800 
and it's really built by our hardware
team<00:06:25.230> in<00:06:25.440> concert<00:06:25.860> of<00:06:26.130> software<00:06:26.640> and<00:06:27.030> what

team in concert of software and what

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.330 
team in concert of software and what
that<00:06:27.960> gives<00:06:28.230> you<00:06:28.380> as<00:06:28.500> a<00:06:28.530> level<00:06:28.770> of<00:06:28.950> performance

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
that gives you as a level of performance

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.240 
that gives you as a level of performance
that<00:06:29.580> you<00:06:29.820> can<00:06:30.060> achieve<00:06:30.180> any<00:06:30.600> other<00:06:30.840> one<00:06:31.250> it
