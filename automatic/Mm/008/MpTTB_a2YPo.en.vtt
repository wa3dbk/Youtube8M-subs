00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:15.700
 2 we are here in chapter 5 of the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.560
 house 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.800
 4 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.800
 is called 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.550
 and finally after so many chapters 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.439
 complaining because my prediction was 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.870
 shit thanks to the command because no 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.900
 I had a lot and always fit metro 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.210
 in the next chapter and I never 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.260
 left and we are eliminating the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.010
 chapters and finally I have if my aim 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.239
 is still shit 5 the world does not 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.890
 like it is that to recharge it is enough 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.430
 annoying and as I do not have like the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.740
 template of tweets like to put the 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.820
 I send 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.820
 and as templates 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:11.220
 and if it is that 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.410
 and this has been the case and the truth is 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.980
 pretty good it's pretty easy it would be 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.980
 more complicated 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.880
 I remember when tired of seeing well 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.630
 Well, do not do that 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.630
 you were telling me 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:48.579
 5 in the forest now 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.579
 more complicated is very but very 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.189
 although below you put guest credits 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.189
 nice with three credits and five 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:16.060
 and left 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.129
 comment how they have come from 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.129
 subscribers 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.000
 because 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:42.900
 If it's not for this game either, 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:48.890
 let's say exclusive 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.890
 I was watching to see the secrets 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.230
 specific 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.530
 and not only have they come out very recently for 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.400
 give pressure 3 lived that time and my 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.319
 working for the pc but could not 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.360
 is not so interesting easy ea the 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.490
 mission itself is very simple 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.080
 William Godos 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.080
 and the relationship is simple 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.270
 5 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.430
 and it's also a good part of him that 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.730
 live the head 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.170
 negative ones that have contributed most to the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.200
 digital 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.200
 here is hotel or site where they created 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.050
 like now 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.580
 and we invite you to think so 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.210
 cobos 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.180
 let us see your chest and say those 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.180
 things 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.050
 you have to shoot 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:28.380
 It's very good but if it's like me 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.380
 I forget about three or four lives 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.830
 --classification 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.849
 3 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.590
 one 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:59.860
 and a little life 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:02.190
 you have to be very quick a gun and the 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.190
 speed 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.610
 very fast because I demand of you 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.040
 as it is a bit difficult to treat 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.980
 to two places and now it's better bad 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.140
 request what then when it ends 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.140
 make chapter guide series 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.180
 At least I will continue with the second 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.180
 part 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.690
 additional 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.389
 in English 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.430
 and good and remember timeline to communicate and 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.830
 subscribe or if it still suffers because 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.789
 a basic to follow I think you lose 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.789
 in the morning 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:01.750
 it's a video of black ops and we already have 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:07.540
 something quite complicated but finally what 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:09.370
 after this I think it's a marker 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.290
 James 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.280
 and well we finished in this episode 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.280
 a chapter 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:24.950
 well then try the chapter 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:28.040
 and the incredible franco see gove and close 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:32.470
 he talks about access and until the next 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.470
 chapter of subscribe goodbye
