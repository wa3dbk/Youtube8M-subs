 valley did not see you today 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.890
 such a mini mini package wrapped 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.880
 a small neat bag came 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.120
 In general, an elephant for about a month was rated 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.950
 eight bucks with logan konung sky mail 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.079
 in principle, the parcels are going well now 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.130
 quick 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:47.420
 let's see what's here 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:51.649
 is in general here should be 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.899
 replacing this miracle device as you 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:00.620
 understood this knife should be 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:03.739
 legs because this man honest 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.860
 saying a little bit can not cope with their 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.860
 duties 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:16.909
 packed general of course all so cool 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:21.130
 neatly let's open back here 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.130
 with better title 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.549
 Here is a little box 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 memo I will teach the box we do not need 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.689
 we need the contents here all the soups 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.990
 here he is handsome 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:51.850
 here he is handsome yes he even looks 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:57.539
 much better than in the picture so 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:03.789
 make a rich blue color 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:06.340
 this is not like a matte metal coating 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.549
 from two sides equally as you can see that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.120
 I chose there were such options that 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:15.849
 the back was just well just 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.980
 black or white there well here found such 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.090
 option that it is two-way ie they 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:27.370
 on whom there is such a spring then 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.569
 there can be a belt or somewhere but so 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:37.760
 here it is such a leaf taiwan 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:45.200
 written 154 centimeters is full of it 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:48.910
 the length here is good so weighty for 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:54.430
 unpacking i think just right let's 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.430
 try to cut something like that 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:10.940
 Normally normal cuts, that is, if 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.630
 parcel open just fine so 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.720
 how who watches we see seen 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.860
 one of the commercials I got injured 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.730
 the help of this knife 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.860
 that is, as you can see, he is a little bit like that 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.780
 Basically he is good for 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.239
 but not everyday use then 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.640
 have to carry it in your pocket there somewhere in 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.890
 koshelechke there handy handy sometimes 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.700
 get and use but use 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.820
 constantly since i use for 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.420
 unpacking 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:48.140
 fits too flimsy and 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.910
 Generally after I do not disassemble it 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.980
 I have it collected constantly 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:58.750
 but as you can see after a few dozen 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.739
 opening times he starts in these places 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.519
 plastic starts to burst 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.340
 and with the further use of it 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.989
 there is a lay out fold just here 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.350
 this part overheat and fall off 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.820
 so , then the knife is good if I 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.440
 I'm not using it all the time 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.650
 attempt of such need yes here is this thing 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.160
 Of course a good solid all on 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.590
 shurupchikov on bolts crowded 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.600
 so it closes with us here 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:39.460
 probably a name like 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.460
 so hello 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.739

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:54.919
 pancakes thought you just have to press on top 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:05:00.069
 Here is this itch on these teeth need 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.069
 pours in and fine it closes and 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:07.699
 personally opens gave so so 

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:10.969
 a small hand movement that is here 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:14.559
 all this can be done with one hand 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:18.249
 I liked such a good knife 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:22.869
 powerful nothing backlash all carpenter 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:24.049

 hiding exactly the parcels is very convenient these 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:56.569
 for the fact that the blade is rounded that is 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:00.889
 blunt such blades as it were right 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:03.759
 for the sharp yet this ac3 and sharpening part 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:07.489
