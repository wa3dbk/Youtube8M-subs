00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.930 
companies like these in the past they
usually<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> bundle<00:00:47.129> both<00:00:47.460> towns<00:00:47.730> together

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
usually be a bundle both towns together

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.880 
usually be a bundle both towns together
for<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> cheaper<00:00:48.600> price<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> wouldn't<00:00:49.710> be

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
for a cheaper price so I wouldn't be

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.229 
for a cheaper price so I wouldn't be
surprised<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.430> they<00:00:50.550> released<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.000> pack<00:00:51.210> for

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
surprised if they released a pack for

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.119 
surprised if they released a pack for
like<00:00:51.510> both<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.930> 5<00:00:52.140> bucks<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.890> that's<00:00:52.920> not

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
like both for 5 bucks so that's not

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.290 
like both for 5 bucks so that's not
really<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.370> bad<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.149> choose

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
really that bad if you have to choose

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.700 
really that bad if you have to choose
between<00:00:54.390> both<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.989> would<00:00:55.079> suggest<00:00:55.260> Super

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
between both I would suggest Super

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.049 
between both I would suggest Super
Saiyan<00:00:55.920> Bardock<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.520> he's<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> lot<00:00:57.030> more

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
