00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 each movie today we premiere a new 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.660
 section entering the cinema that is called the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.130
 people think I am eduardo and we are 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.130
 entering the cinema I have to spend 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.080
 yes 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.259
 imagine 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.920
 saiz press 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.920
 let's see what they think about both 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.509
 with that one that you thought the movie 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.079
 is very father perfect 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.159
 3d I like 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.159
 I like very much 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.199
 good 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.010
 meets your expectations but 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.030
 but not 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.170
 that he really did not get over it because 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.170
 It brought a lot of expectation 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:05.649
 It is so good but is a bit long 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.649
 suddenly but 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.020
 I thought it was very good it was very, very 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.570
 good the movie the truth is that I've 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.330
 I met all my expectations because 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.910
 you have low high expectations had 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.670
 tastes lower than what I 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.870
 I expected the truth is that I was surprised 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.870
 more than accustomed 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:37.590
 in good or bad 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.840
 well or not in the same role of comedian 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.569
 as always already much better than before 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.569
 be more 0 and good or bad porros 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.900
 the protagonist what did you think if 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.900
 met expectations or not 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.570
 Comedy structures 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.030
 I'm not for me because I know 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.800
 apart from experience 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.840
 10 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.619
 part of the one in which this 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.630
 superhero take takes the form of a 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.010
 part many more real than he did me 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.410
 loved I think it's a person with 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.410
 mistakes and also 40 is good 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:36.380
 from 1 to 10 when you put 8,698 of 1 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.380
 to 10 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.990
 our 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.530
 look, I would tell you the truth is that I 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.530
 move 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.280
 good and I think that's a movie 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.260
 different from the others of marvel but if 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.630
 they are marvel fan have to see the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.470
 gunpowder is very fun and if fulfilled 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.470
 my expectations 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.540
