00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.469
 so welcome flowed back 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.990
 to a new tutorial counter strike 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.599
 global offensive a very short 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.699
 tutorial i want a series here 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.439
 introduce 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.760
 with whom you live the life of the enemy 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.269
 online mode, so to speak, a bit 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.430
 Hardly makes different tips 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.640
 and tricks and exercises you do 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.439
 can be found in skill and courage in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.239
 to improve this game because everything 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.590
 is very important and everything together 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.120
 Of course, this gives a very good one 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 player if you really mastered that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.920
 and that's where I want to go today 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.520
 a simple relatively simple trick 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.530
 to begin 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.450
 but the euro is also yours 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.950
 accuracy with the weapon and in general 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.100
 the feeling with the weapon improved 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.180
 That's right, just 23 points 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.000
 from about the same distance too 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.750
 more biting and then you always take yourselves 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.699
 these three points 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.719
 move to the next point without the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.299
 move mouse and shoot that makes 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.900
 now just a two three magazines 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.049
 one after the other welcome 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.000
 slowly a feeling out how long you 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.530
 have to stand still so you can with the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 weapon could shoot out 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.600
 it is just the case here as well 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.380
 can you have the right moment 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.140
 find if your weapon is accurate again 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.110
 is and the aggression and again 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.869
 accuracy is simply recovered 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.520
 and thereby a better and a better one 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.840
 Better accuracy can be related 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.610
 that just makes a few 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.380
 magazine until about a bit 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.680
 feel for your weapon right now 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.229
 It really uses every weapon 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.200
 and ye shall all the world 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.189
 improve quickly and can still 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.759
 to which the opponents simply run 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.610
 kill 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.820
 because we can just do it like that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.170
 keep moving back and forth 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.580
 then the opponent again balancing 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.330
 complete when the opponent moves 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.679
 usually not when the corner is and to 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.050
 example , the opponent should I ask 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.310
 the opponent in the box in front of the moves 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.850
 Not everyone thinks you're coming 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.490
 over and over again and then comes around the corner 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.390
 and shoot the ball away 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.250
 Of course he can not do that fast 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.170
 react because the human eye 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.620
 directly or generally the human one 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.620
 has a reaction behavior of one second 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.230
 So just about so one could 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.160
 now , of course, one is playing 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.980
 Reaction time but have the most 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.810
 have been able to us time by one second 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.180
 that act one second right 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.190
 how they want it and we just use it 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.989
 this trick is crazy 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.230
 Reaction time of people and do it 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.610
 Just instant around the corner with it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.840
 you too , for example , against life 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.190
 very difficult or even fight 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.540
 if you can see history are 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.709
 not on me like a harmless one there 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.200
 set and the race rather from 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.070
 effect as fighting against me though 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.450
 we can do that 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.989
 you move it is a bit early 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.049
 you died when you move 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:17.840
 do not rule out that it's 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:21.810
 move and shoot the chicken 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.250
 while you move , do yours 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.040
 mouse a bit always move on that 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.560
 For example, we have the bag for the target 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.950
 not again because I just 210 times 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.500
 try again 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.250
 Just move and hit the target immediately 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.980
 like the drag 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.980
 a separate one with the opening game 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.269
 I can myself not so good that 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.409
 not himself still doing so long 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.760
 but that could be the life of the 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.349
 make opponents really hard because the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.999
 then suddenly start talking 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.819
 because they do not know anymore what they are doing 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:59.269
 because you should be fast all the time 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.430
 moves and always shoots at the opponent 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.439
 I am reasonably accurate 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.170
 Of course it is not so good in the beginning 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.180
 it may of course not as good must 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.409
 just expect the right time is yours 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.409
 weapon is accurate again 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:16.139
 until then that would just have to practice 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.690
 example a deathmatch mode in online 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.479
 mode and et cetera you can do everything 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:27.449
 try to improve fire 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:28.650
 to optimize this exercise for example 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.970
 You see, that I just do not 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.830
 meet properly I would move me 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.400
 but i just need i am easy 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.590
 too fast 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.020
 Class of the weapon does not have enough time itself 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.509
 to recover and that's what I can do 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.889
 Do not meet the audience at the mine 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.979
 last man 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.349
 and then I just want to tell you if 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.599
 The video has fallen again 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.250
 it remains something to criticize 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.080
 I come here and if you are more 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.159
 see it soon subscribe to us and 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.159
 See you in the next series
