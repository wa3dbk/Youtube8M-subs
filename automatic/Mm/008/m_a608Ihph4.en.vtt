and one of the new things for 2012 is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.910 
and one of the new things for 2012 is
the<00:00:46.280> Kashima<00:00:46.970> coating<00:00:47.450> on<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.840> high-end<00:00:48.680> rear

shock<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:49.490> here<00:00:50.000> we're<00:00:50.120> looking<00:00:50.180> at<00:00:50.360> an<00:00:50.480> RP<00:00:50.780> 23

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.070 
with Kashima body tube and a new damping
system<00:00:56.030> which<00:00:56.180> they<00:00:56.330> call<00:00:56.540> adaptive<00:00:56.900> logic

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
system which they call adaptive logic

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.900 
system which they call adaptive logic

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
pedal function from what it used to be

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.190 
pedal function from what it used to be
with<00:01:05.630> an<00:01:05.930> off<00:01:06.200> position<00:01:06.230> and<00:01:07.660> an<00:01:08.660> adjustable

on position from from levels one two and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.790 
on position from from levels one two and
three<00:01:12.830> with<00:01:13.520> an<00:01:13.640> open<00:01:14.060> position<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.800> the

three with an open position in the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.940 
three with an open position in the
opposite<00:01:16.220> what<00:01:16.970> we<00:01:17.090> end<00:01:17.270> up<00:01:17.420> with<00:01:17.660> is<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.740> on

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
opposite what we end up with is the on

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.760 
opposite what we end up with is the on
position<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:19.700> fixed<00:01:19.970> at<00:01:20.300> three<00:01:20.660> and<00:01:21.530> now<00:01:21.710> we

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
position is fixed at three and now we

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.010 
position is fixed at three and now we
can<00:01:22.040> set<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.430> open<00:01:22.760> position<00:01:23.240> between<00:01:23.420> open

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
can set the open position between open

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.910 
can set the open position between open
Pro<00:01:24.710> pedal<00:01:25.070> one<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.520> Pro<00:01:25.760> pedal<00:01:26.090> two<00:01:26.300> so<00:01:27.260> if

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
Pro pedal one and Pro pedal two so if

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.340 
Pro pedal one and Pro pedal two so if
you're<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.310> kind<00:01:28.550> of<00:01:28.610> guy<00:01:28.790> that<00:01:29.060> lights<00:01:29.960> might

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
you're the kind of guy that lights might

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.940 
you're the kind of guy that lights might
be<00:01:30.619> sort<00:01:31.160> of<00:01:31.190> punchy<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.500> responds<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.740> but

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
be sort of punchy and responds it but

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.530 
be sort of punchy and responds it but
wants<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.310> little<00:01:34.490> bit<00:01:34.700> more<00:01:34.910> for<00:01:35.119> climbing

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
wants a little bit more for climbing

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.320 
wants a little bit more for climbing
then<00:01:36.260> you<00:01:36.380> can<00:01:36.530> end<00:01:36.710> up<00:01:36.860> with<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:37.190> say<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.060> two

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
then you can end up with a say a two

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.620 
then you can end up with a say a two
position<00:01:38.750> for<00:01:39.590> your<00:01:39.740> pro<00:01:40.580> pedal<00:01:40.910> off<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.450> a

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
position for your pro pedal off and a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.020 
position for your pro pedal off and a
three<00:01:41.990> for<00:01:42.560> your<00:01:42.650> pro<00:01:42.860> pedal<00:01:43.220> on<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.880> just

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
three for your pro pedal on so you just

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.520 
three for your pro pedal on so you just
get<00:01:44.180> slightly<00:01:44.600> different<00:01:44.780> levels<00:01:45.410> of

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
get slightly different levels of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.960 
get slightly different levels of
compression<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.580> it's<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.759> lot<00:01:46.940> more

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
compression so it's a lot more

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.520 
compression so it's a lot more
adjustable<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:47.840> makes<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.110> lot<00:01:48.259> more<00:01:48.320> sense

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
adjustable and makes a lot more sense

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.310 
adjustable and makes a lot more sense
for<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.310> kind<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:50.000> riding<00:01:50.479> we<00:01:50.660> do<00:01:50.899> in<00:01:51.050> Britain

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
for the kind of riding we do in Britain

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.180 
for the kind of riding we do in Britain
which<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:53.050> guess<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.080> bit<00:01:54.380> more<00:01:54.590> hardcore<00:01:54.950> than

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
which I guess a bit more hardcore than

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.279 
which I guess a bit more hardcore than
the<00:01:55.429> rest<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.759> world<00:01:56.000> hence<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.080> lower

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
the rest of the world hence the lower

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.740 
the rest of the world hence the lower
numbers<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.740> 29<00:01:58.369> errs<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.300> rest<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.690> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
numbers of 29 errs that the rest of the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.130 
numbers of 29 errs that the rest of the
features<00:02:00.200> are<00:02:00.350> kind<00:02:00.619> of<00:02:01.690> similar<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.720> what<00:02:02.869> we

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
features are kind of similar to what we

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.540 
features are kind of similar to what we
have<00:02:03.320> before<00:02:03.530> you've<00:02:03.860> got<00:02:04.009> all<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.310> same

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550

options<00:02:13.700> one<00:02:14.060> thing<00:02:14.300> we<00:02:14.420> have<00:02:14.600> had<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.960> do<00:02:15.110> this

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
options one thing we have had to do this

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.200 
options one thing we have had to do this
year<00:02:15.500> with<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.770> Kashima<00:02:16.160> coated<00:02:16.670> shocks<00:02:17.000> is

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
year with the Kashima coated shocks is

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.340 
year with the Kashima coated shocks is
actually<00:02:18.100> make<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.220> bass<00:02:19.430> tunings<00:02:20.350> slightly

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
actually make the bass tunings slightly

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.980 
actually make the bass tunings slightly
firmer<00:02:21.680> because<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.120> little<00:02:23.450> stitching

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
firmer because the so little stitching

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.230 
firmer because the so little stitching
that<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.740> end<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:25.040> having<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.460> run<00:02:25.640> more<00:02:25.940> damp

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
that you end up having to run more damp

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.820 
that you end up having to run more damp
in<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.630> control<00:02:27.080> movement<00:02:28.210> so<00:02:29.319> all<00:02:30.319> in<00:02:30.500> all<00:02:30.620> I

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
in to control movement so all in all I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.650 
in to control movement so all in all I
think<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.190> really<00:02:31.490> good<00:02:31.670> step<00:02:32.090> forward<00:02:32.510> with

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
think a really good step forward with

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.210 
think a really good step forward with
the<00:02:32.750> shocks<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.290> we<00:02:33.410> should<00:02:33.620> be<00:02:33.770> able<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.980> try

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
the shocks and we should be able to try

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.760 
the shocks and we should be able to try
that<00:02:34.370> today<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.960> snotty<00:02:36.410> muddy

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
that today in the snotty muddy

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.160 
that today in the snotty muddy
conditions<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.520> can<00:02:37.700> car<00:02:37.970> never<00:02:38.690> gets<00:02:38.780> muddy

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
conditions that can car never gets muddy

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.910 
conditions that can car never gets muddy
does<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.620> so

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:51.090
