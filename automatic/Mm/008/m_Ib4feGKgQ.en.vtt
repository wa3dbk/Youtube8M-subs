00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
typically feature alarm clock off apps

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.310 
typically feature alarm clock off apps
often<00:00:08.970> because<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.630> know<00:00:09.780> their<00:00:09.960> alarm<00:00:10.230> clock

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
often because you know their alarm clock

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.419 
often because you know their alarm clock
apps<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.920> they're<00:00:11.010> not<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.340> most

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
apps and they're not the most

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.799 
apps and they're not the most
interesting<00:00:11.790> they're<00:00:12.150> sort<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.420> study<00:00:12.630> and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
interesting they're sort of a study and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.690 
interesting they're sort of a study and
forget<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.230> type<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.530> thing<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.460> apps

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
forget it type of thing but this apps

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.060 
forget it type of thing but this apps
different<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.839> not<00:00:16.740> only<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.039> it

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
different in that it not only is it

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
different in that it not only is it
designed<00:00:17.550> beautifully<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.750> animation<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
designed beautifully the animation the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.560 
designed beautifully the animation the
gestures<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.460> overall<00:00:20.820> look<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.330> are

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
gestures just the overall look of it are

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.140 
gestures just the overall look of it are
a<00:00:21.869> really<00:00:22.439> really<00:00:22.650> top-notch<00:00:22.880> but<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.000> does

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
a really really top-notch but it does

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.120 
a really really top-notch but it does
something<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.660> every<00:00:25.289> alarm<00:00:25.470> clock<00:00:25.769> app<00:00:25.980> I

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
something that every alarm clock app I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.290 
something that every alarm clock app I
believe<00:00:26.400> should<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.670> at<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.849> point<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
believe should do at this point and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.419 
believe should do at this point and
that's<00:00:27.359> cloud<00:00:27.840> sync<00:00:28.289> between<00:00:28.470> devices<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
that's cloud sync between devices and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.060 
that's cloud sync between devices and
also<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.269> allows<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.689> manage<00:00:31.080> alarms

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
also it allows you to manage alarms

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.860 
also it allows you to manage alarms
between<00:00:32.610> multiple<00:00:33.000> devices<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> same

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
between multiple devices at the same

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.959 
between multiple devices at the same
time<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.500> which<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.250> pretty<00:00:35.460> amazing<00:00:35.670> if

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
time which is which is pretty amazing if

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.540 
time which is which is pretty amazing if
you<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.180> multiple<00:00:36.570> phones<00:00:36.899> or<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.520> a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
you have multiple phones or you have a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.580 
you have multiple phones or you have a
tablet<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.300> used<00:00:39.600> four<00:00:39.750> alarms<00:00:40.110> sometimes

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
tablet that used four alarms sometimes

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.170 
tablet that used four alarms sometimes
or<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> phone<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.399> sometimes<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.059> can

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180

sync<00:00:42.480> those<00:00:42.629> sort<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.170> between<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.100> um<00:00:44.480> let's

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
sync those sort of between so um let's

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.240

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
widget has Google now integration in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.810 
widget has Google now integration in
case<00:00:49.230> you're<00:00:49.379> setting<00:00:49.590> alarms<00:00:50.010> instead<00:00:50.730> of

I believe there's a stock sort of theme

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.260 
I believe there's a stock sort of theme
and<00:01:13.290> yes<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:14.010> are<00:01:14.040> custom<00:01:14.729> themes<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.119> can

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and yes there are custom themes you can

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.640 
and yes there are custom themes you can
do<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.600> could<00:01:15.750> sort<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.960> change<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> way

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
do you could sort of change the way

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.280 
do you could sort of change the way
everything<00:01:17.400> looks<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> main

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
everything looks in here so the main

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560 
everything looks in here so the main

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
notice that each screen has a different

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.160 
notice that each screen has a different
look<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.509> actually<00:01:57.780> allow<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:57.990> to

customize the look of everything now on

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.420 
customize the look of everything now on
the<00:02:01.049> main<00:02:01.170> clock<00:02:01.500> screen<00:02:01.770> there's<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> button

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the main clock screen there's a button

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.800 
the main clock screen there's a button
down<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.119> allows<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> change

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
down here that allows you to change

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.260 
down here that allows you to change
between<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.229> digital<00:02:04.649> or<00:02:04.799> analog<00:02:05.219> clock<00:02:05.579> I

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
between the digital or analog clock I

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.850 
between the digital or analog clock I
would<00:02:06.780> imagine<00:02:06.990> there's<00:02:07.320> gonna<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.649> other

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
would imagine there's gonna be other

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.859 
would imagine there's gonna be other
options<00:02:08.340> or<00:02:08.580> maybe<00:02:09.000> even<00:02:09.090> developers<00:02:09.690> can

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
options or maybe even developers can

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.360 
options or maybe even developers can
build<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.289> different<00:02:10.649> looks<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:11.009> there<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.280> you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
build in different looks in there so you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.130 
build in different looks in there so you
could<00:02:11.489> probably<00:02:11.610> have

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
could probably have

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.110 
could probably have
different<00:02:12.350> looks<00:02:12.620> which<00:02:13.550> could<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:13.850> kind<00:02:14.060> of

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
different looks which could be kind of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.340 
different looks which could be kind of
cool<00:02:14.270> but<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.480> can<00:02:14.600> sort<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.810> change<00:02:15.020> these

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
cool but you can sort of change these

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.350 
cool but you can sort of change these
now<00:02:16.160> that's<00:02:16.400> sort<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.610> what<00:02:16.730> my<00:02:16.850> clock<00:02:17.090> looks

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
now that's sort of what my clock looks

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.630 
now that's sort of what my clock looks
like<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:18.200> where<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.440> takes<00:02:18.590> another<00:02:18.950> step<00:02:19.370> is

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
like but where it takes another step is

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.340 
like but where it takes another step is
if<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:20.000> go<00:02:20.209> into<00:02:20.240> menu

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
if you go into menu

to do noon done or canceled but actually

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.350 
to do noon done or canceled but actually
I<00:03:30.799> could<00:03:30.980> grab<00:03:31.160> that<00:03:31.190> again<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:31.760> just<00:03:31.820> drag<00:03:32.209> it

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360

I could grab that again and just drag it
to<00:03:32.480> you<00:03:32.600> say<00:03:32.840> like<00:03:33.079> 3:00<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:34.519> there's<00:03:34.730> an<00:03:34.850> alarm

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
I hit done and that's the time my new

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.810 
I hit done and that's the time my new
alarm<00:03:37.700> is<00:03:38.170> okay<00:03:39.200> there's<00:03:39.890> an<00:03:40.040> on/off<00:03:40.220> toggle

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
alarm is okay there's an on/off toggle

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.110 
alarm is okay there's an on/off toggle
button<00:03:41.269> so<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.450> could<00:03:41.660> toggle<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:42.079> on<00:03:42.290> or<00:03:42.680> off

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
button so I could toggle that on or off

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.580 
button so I could toggle that on or off
but<00:03:44.120> if<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.299> tap<00:03:44.540> down<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:45.019> here<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:45.500> actually

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
but if I tap down in here it actually

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.710 
but if I tap down in here it actually
takes<00:03:46.010> me<00:03:46.190> into<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.610> entire<00:03:46.910> alarm<00:03:47.180> so

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
takes me into the entire alarm so

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.630 
takes me into the entire alarm so
there's<00:03:48.110> this<00:03:48.260> smart<00:03:48.650> rise<00:03:48.860> option<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:49.549> could

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
there's this smart rise option you could

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.949 
there's this smart rise option you could
check<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.239> if<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:50.480> hit<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.660> little<00:03:50.720> question

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
check and if you hit the little question

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.720 
check and if you hit the little question
mark<00:03:51.320> it<00:03:51.440> talks<00:03:51.620> about<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:52.459> is<00:03:52.579> where

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
mark it talks about it and this is where

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.190 
mark it talks about it and this is where
we<00:03:52.850> get<00:03:52.970> into<00:03:53.090> sleep<00:03:53.450> cycle<00:03:53.780> stuff<00:03:53.959> where<00:03:54.140> it

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
we get into sleep cycle stuff where it

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.380 
we get into sleep cycle stuff where it
tries<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.410> lightly<00:03:54.890> wake<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.549> up<00:03:55.610> over<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.060> 30
