00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.889
 to try for yourself 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.990
 today you have the series 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.009
 maximum muscle building and last video 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.750
 I say have been what actually 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.930
 progressive engine pay actually 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.000
 means or progressive download and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.710
 We also looked at what are 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.420
 actually makes the most sense 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.099
 namely, the light and the rise 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.900
 repetitions and today we look 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.390
 as well a few upgrade strategies 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.030
 on and in the later then still practical 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.020
 Implementations and how we do it all on 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.969
 can increase the best on the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.690
 easiest actually with the single 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.219
 progression 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.870
 Here is just the weight of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.090
 workout to workout increases the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.370
 Repeat range is fixed and that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.820
 is the only slope we make 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.770
 only the court later in the training though 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.300
 it gets more complicated and sort of like that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.280
 it can not work anymore 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.230
 just make sense that you are in it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.789
 progression with pure takes then one has 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.379
 namely a repetition range of 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.300
 four to six repetitions and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.460
 then rise naturally in the long run 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.930
 also the weight and it looks like us 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.729
 have a revocation area of 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.130
 four to six repetitions here in 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.170
 this example now and we start with 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.479
 One hundred fell at the lower end of the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.950
 Repeat range with 304 going up 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.479
 We saw each other over the week for so long 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.009
 until we just repeat this 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.439
 area completely in all sentences full 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.960
 and then just here at 36 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.150
 arrived and increase next to that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.250
 weight of course down with the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.790
 repetitions and rise here again 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.380
 Three times four repeats a 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.360
 it makes sense for any further 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.220
 advanced athletes or just at 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.750
 Exercises where it is not so easy 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.350
 it here with the single progression too 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.170
 increase 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.840
 For example, at the time of lifting sometime 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.920
 he will always hard jump the 25 kilos 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.509
 in the gym each time to increase 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.100
 that's why it can make sense that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.950
 you just repeat yourself one 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.520
 Area 1 1 added eight to twelve 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.140
 repetitions or something and then serve 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.509
 so far power up until you just at the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.840
 upper end has arrived and next to it 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.080
 the weight increases and again 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.890
 that's what you can do now 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.720
 even further, they spin 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.840
 triple progression the same three 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.000
 Factors change the weight 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.760
 the repetitions and the sentence area 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.410
 and we can already see that is one 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.790
 huge long list and i have here 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.220
 even a point from the point 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.930
 abbreviated that takes quite a long time 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.510
 you will eventually come back 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.040
 putting weight on it means that's it 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.400
 really something for far and wide 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.630
 those athletes somehow progressed 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.540
 whole years need to ever 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.250
 to increase once and that is really 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.390
 you have to go very far 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.980
 have progressed 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.670
 that's probably going to be the case with most 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.860
 People here are not somehow mutable 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.180
 be resp 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.549
 should not be used because of it 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.790
 just takes extremely long and you only 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.530
 The time is robbing offers whole works 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.110
 you are also doing this repetitive 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.360
 area full first as soon as the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.180
 Repeat area is full of 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.310
 increased and we have here yes 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.880
 also field of application therefore becomes here 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.660
 increased to 44 and if you look that out 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.420
 expects 3 x 6 18 and 44 16 that's her name 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.049
 have a backward step in the 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.700
 total load but that can also be a far 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.560
 advanced athlete may be completely 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.650
 good use because he just over a long time 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.329
 not always completely so fast 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.739
 can increase and then it is quite 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.010
 pleasant if you have such a small wave 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.840
 then there are whole here full 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.120
 is so much further increased until 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.310
 just the sentence area as well 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.579
 the repeat area full and 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.489
 then the weight is increased first 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.410
 See, it is really extremely long so 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:54.480
 for very very advanced 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.480
 athletes fighting for every kilo 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.590
 So practically the practical implementation 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.440
 Training plan should be on the true 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.239
 so notice the performance level 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.920
 can be very easily from his single 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.480
 Benefit because it's easy 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.940
 you can work from training too 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.680
 increase training and that should also yes 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.690
 considered in your training plan 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.239
 become 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.949
 then you have to be in a good training schedule 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.930
 then just before the increase 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.300
 be given so for example at 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.979
 our plan of code fitness will be 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.630
 We practically gave up on you 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.610
 it should have increased and it should 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.250
 in a good training schedule always with 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.660
 it is because otherwise not yet like 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.820
 back way could then boost like that 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.520
 stay long street racing progression 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.860
 that's just easier for you 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.770
 just a factor somehow too 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.449
 manipulate and you can do it all 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.330
 these stretch a little longer 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.449
 beginners sing and progression phase in 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.160
 which he micro plates or so small 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.650
 magnets you use the dumbbell 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.750
 contagious just does not depend on it 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.550
 to be that 25 kilo jumps in the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.039
 but can do gym 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.960
 then a kilo or 0 5 kilo jumps 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.120
 and that's just it 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.370
 enjoyable 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.139
 Very important is the technology you have to 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.460
 somehow make it that way 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.910
 every repetition with you the same 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.280
 looks 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.660
 it does not do anything when banking 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.180
 Every repetition we give differently 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.930
 looks to the deep and you have 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.400
 then somehow none at all 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.860
 Comparability of the repetitions 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.510
 and increases but max one is then 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.770
 it may be less profound and then im 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.930
 next training its like the deep 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.590
 and that is a bit problematic 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.020
 So technology is very important and also 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.479
 very important to avoid muscle failure 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.880
 You have to remember that you are yours 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.550
 wanted to keep frequency and you have to 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.680
 off that you think just the yes 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.860
 repetitions from sentence to sentence equal 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.669
 wanted to have and look at us but max 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.650
 in the video 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.510
 since it is then muscle failure and 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.699
 What impact it may have on it 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.470
 your success and I hope we see 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.160
 The next year we are doing a good ten 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.160
 euro p 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.469
 Yes
