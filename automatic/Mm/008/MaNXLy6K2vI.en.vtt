00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.109 
party as a lot of you guys know back in
August<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.289> 2014<00:00:17.039> club<00:00:17.520> him<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.820> had<00:00:17.970> their

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
August of 2014 club him and had their

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.060 
August of 2014 club him and had their
first<00:00:18.150> frozen<00:00:18.690> party<00:00:19.170> which<00:00:19.500> was<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> takeover

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
first frozen party which was a takeover

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.650 
first frozen party which was a takeover
and<00:00:20.310> inspired<00:00:20.640> by<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> original<00:00:21.180> movie

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
and inspired by the original movie

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.130 
and inspired by the original movie
frozen

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
frozen

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.340 
frozen
so<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.039> guess<00:00:23.340> kind<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.640> as<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.090> second<00:00:25.080> party

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
so I guess kind of as a second party

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.720 
so I guess kind of as a second party
they're<00:00:25.500> gonna<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.769> having<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> frozen<00:00:26.400> fever

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
they're gonna be having the frozen fever

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.080 
they're gonna be having the frozen fever
party<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.900> frozen<00:00:28.230> fever<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:29.090> it's

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
party and what frozen fever is it's

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.429 
party and what frozen fever is it's
somewhat<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.510> short<00:00:30.779> animation<00:00:31.170> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
somewhat of a short animation that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.780 
somewhat of a short animation that
they're<00:00:31.560> gonna<00:00:31.710> play<00:00:31.890> before<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.369> Cinderella

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
they're gonna play before the Cinderella

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.819 
they're gonna play before the Cinderella
movie<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.540> theaters<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.440> guess<00:00:34.590> when<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
movie in theaters and I guess when you

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.560 
movie in theaters and I guess when you
buy<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.160> DVD<00:00:35.340> it'll<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.360> well

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
buy it on DVD it'll be in there as well

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.139 
buy it on DVD it'll be in there as well
but<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.160> actually<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> movie<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
but because it's not actually a movie I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.150 
but because it's not actually a movie I
was<00:00:39.510> very<00:00:39.690> surprised<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.620> were<00:00:40.829> having

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
was very surprised that they were having

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
was very surprised that they were having
this<00:00:41.309> take<00:00:41.579> over<00:00:41.879> or<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.690> party<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
this take over or this this party I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.810 
this take over or this this party I
don't<00:00:43.590> know<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.040> kind<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> small

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
don't know if it's kind of as a small

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790 
don't know if it's kind of as a small
event<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.420> far<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.379> actually

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
event but as far as I know it's actually

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
event but as far as I know it's actually
going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> party<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.420> going

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
going to be a party so I was going

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.060 
going to be a party so I was going
around<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.930> few<00:00:49.079> blogs<00:00:49.350> including<00:00:49.590> Club

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
around a few blogs including Club

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.319 
around a few blogs including Club
Penguin's<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.640> noticed<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.120> there<00:00:51.239> was

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
Penguin's and I noticed that there was

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.150 
Penguin's and I noticed that there was
another<00:00:51.629> snapshot<00:00:51.989> from<00:00:52.410> one<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.680> ask<00:00:52.829> polo

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
another snapshot from one of ask polo

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.639 
another snapshot from one of ask polo
fields<00:00:53.550> questions<00:00:54.030> where<00:00:54.629> somebody<00:00:55.170> asks<00:00:55.530> him

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
fields questions where somebody asks him

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.950 
fields questions where somebody asks him
a<00:00:55.739> question<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.250> his<00:00:56.699> response<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.420> I've<00:00:57.690> got

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
a question and his response is I've got

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.229 
a question and his response is I've got
a<00:00:57.989> fever<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.670> only<00:00:59.879> leads<00:01:00.090> me<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
a fever now this not only leads me to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.310 
a fever now this not only leads me to
believe<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.539> there's<00:01:00.780> gonna<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> frozen

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
believe that there's gonna be the frozen

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.680 
believe that there's gonna be the frozen
fever<00:01:01.770> party<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.850> also<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.449> they're<00:01:03.570> gonna

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
fever party but also that they're gonna

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.899 
fever party but also that they're gonna
do<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> very<00:01:04.080> soon<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.799> my<00:01:05.010> guess<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.549> it's

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
do it very soon so my guess is that it's

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
do it very soon so my guess is that it's
going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.420> April<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:07.650> also

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
going to be in April there was also

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.700 
going to be in April there was also
another<00:01:08.280> snapshot<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.780> code<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.350> line<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
another snapshot of a code a line of

another snapshot of a code a line of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
code from one of Club Penguin's I guess

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.630 
code from one of Club Penguin's I guess
SWF<00:01:13.680> file<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.950> don't<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.220> know<00:01:14.400> where<00:01:14.549> it

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
SWF file I don't really know where it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
SWF file I don't really know where it
came<00:01:14.790> from<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.960> about<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
came from but this is about the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.770 
came from but this is about the
catalogue<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.790> here's<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.509> snapshot

so<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.259> says<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.100> only

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
so that's what it says and that only

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.819 
so that's what it says and that only
leads<00:01:26.640> me<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.850> believe<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.619> kind<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
leads me to believe that this is kind of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.219 
leads me to believe that this is kind of
a<00:01:28.950> confirmation<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.360> frozen<00:01:30.930> fever

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
a confirmation for the frozen fever

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.719 
a confirmation for the frozen fever
party<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.070> don't<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.549> what's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
party but we don't really know what's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.399 
party but we don't really know what's
going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.939> take<00:01:33.090> place<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.540> April<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.140> we're

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
going to take place in April so we're

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.960 
going to take place in April so we're
just<00:01:34.439> gonna<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.979> wait<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.820> what

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
just gonna have to wait and see what

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969

to see new things happening so I'm just

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.550 
to see new things happening so I'm just
a<00:02:09.970> little<00:02:10.150> bit<00:02:10.240> interested<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.810> see<00:02:11.020> how<00:02:11.320> they

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
a little bit interested to see how they

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.780 
a little bit interested to see how they
gonna<00:02:11.680> make<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.010> party<00:02:12.310> new<00:02:12.550> and

gonna make this party new and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.880 
gonna make this party new and
interesting<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.570> think<00:02:14.080> what<00:02:14.380> they<00:02:14.470> should<00:02:14.680> do

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
interesting I think what they should do

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.770 
interesting I think what they should do
is<00:02:15.160> create<00:02:15.670> new<00:02:15.850> items<00:02:16.210> that<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.570> do<00:02:16.750> with

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
is create new items that have to do with

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.260 
is create new items that have to do with
frozen<00:02:17.140> but<00:02:17.560> also<00:02:17.980> make<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> better<00:02:18.700> storyline

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
frozen but also make a better storyline

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.090 
frozen but also make a better storyline
because<00:02:19.450> last<00:02:19.780> time<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.140> believe<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.830> kind<00:02:21.010> of

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
because last time I believe it kind of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.740 
because last time I believe it kind of
came<00:02:21.280> out<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.430> nowhere<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.970> think<00:02:22.540> if<00:02:22.660> they

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
came out of nowhere I think if they

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.930 
came out of nowhere I think if they
amped<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.140> up<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.440> they<00:02:23.560> did<00:02:23.710> for<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.280> puffle

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
amped it up like they did for the puffle

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.720 
amped it up like they did for the puffle
video<00:02:25.180> or<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.660> puffle<00:02:26.230> party<00:02:26.530> 2015<00:02:26.950> when<00:02:27.610> they

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
video or the puffle party 2015 when they

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.400 
video or the puffle party 2015 when they
kind<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.030> tied<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.360> in<00:02:28.480> from<00:02:28.750> August<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.350> the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
kind of tied it in from August and the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.380 
kind of tied it in from August and the
Sasquatch<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.550> mascot<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.240> how<00:02:31.330> we

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
Sasquatch in the mascot and how we

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.210 
Sasquatch in the mascot and how we
didn't<00:02:31.630> really<00:02:31.810> know<00:02:31.930> who<00:02:32.110> he<00:02:32.260> was<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.650> really

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
liked that because it allowed us to kind

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.360 
liked that because it allowed us to kind
of<00:02:34.900> develop<00:02:35.140> ideas<00:02:35.410> about<00:02:35.800> who<00:02:36.040> he<00:02:36.160> was<00:02:36.190> and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
of develop ideas about who he was and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.640

when<00:02:36.910> he<00:02:36.940> was<00:02:37.120> finally<00:02:37.300> introduced<00:02:38.020> it<00:02:38.380> made

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
when he was finally introduced it made

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.890
