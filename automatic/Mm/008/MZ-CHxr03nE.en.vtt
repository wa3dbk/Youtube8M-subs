00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
like I mentioned before which is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.929 
like I mentioned before which is

throughout<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> whole<00:01:23.880> game<00:01:23.909> word<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:25.020> in

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
throughout the whole game word there in

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.380 
throughout the whole game word there in
each<00:01:25.290> match<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.790> got<00:01:26.939> do<00:01:27.180> their

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
each match and you just got do their

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.569 
each match and you just got do their
objectives<00:01:28.110> throughout<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> match<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.950> get

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
objectives throughout the match to get

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.319 
objectives throughout the match to get
points<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.900> I'm<00:01:31.490> not<00:01:32.490> sure<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.880> protect<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
points so I'm not sure they protect it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.130 
points so I'm not sure they protect it
at<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> moment<00:01:35.060> but<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.240> switches<00:01:36.540> through

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
at the moment but it switches through

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.469 
at the moment but it switches through
five<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.590> them<00:01:37.680> throughout<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> whole<00:01:38.040> game

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
five of them throughout the whole game

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.999 
five of them throughout the whole game
so<00:01:39.479> as<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.079> straight<00:01:40.470> away<00:01:40.500> even

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
so as you can see straight away even

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.560 
so as you can see straight away even
though<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.549> game<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:42.090> playing<00:01:42.420> online

though this game is on playing online
right<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> graphics<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:43.770> absolutely

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
right now the graphics are absolutely

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.030 
right now the graphics are absolutely
brilliant<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.540> good<00:01:45.840> they've<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.860> done<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
brilliant so good they've really done a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.210 
brilliant so good they've really done a
great<00:01:47.250> job<00:01:47.720> getting<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> power<00:01:49.140> full<00:01:49.890> power

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
great job getting the power full power

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.330 
great job getting the power full power
out<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.420> PSP<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:51.899> graphics<00:01:52.340> capabilities

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
out of the PSP as graphics capabilities

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.020 
out of the PSP as graphics capabilities
and<00:01:53.520> everything

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and everything

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.289 
and everything
the<00:01:54.450> meaning<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.380> looks<00:01:56.369> probably

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the meaning is so good looks probably

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.050 
the meaning is so good looks probably
the<00:01:57.360> best-looking<00:01:57.899> via<00:01:58.560> game<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.549> far<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.850> would

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the best-looking via game so far I would

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.120 
the best-looking via game so far I would
say<00:02:00.409> looks<00:02:01.409> really<00:02:01.740> good

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
say looks really good

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.310 
say looks really good
the<00:02:02.969> only<00:02:03.180> thing<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.450> didn't<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.229> like

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
the only thing I didn't really like

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.649 
the only thing I didn't really like
about<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:05.340> game<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.759> far<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.240> slightly

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
about this game so far is slightly

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.249 
about this game so far is slightly
sluggishness<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> gameplay<00:02:08.209> but<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.750> mean

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
sluggishness of the gameplay but I mean

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.170 
sluggishness of the gameplay but I mean
I<00:02:10.470> guess<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.069> could<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.370> with<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.610> after<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> while

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
I guess I could do with it after a while

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.290 
I guess I could do with it after a while
especially<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.810> they've

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
especially that they've

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.490 
especially that they've
I<00:02:13.330> did<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:14.280> aiming<00:02:15.540> with<00:02:16.540> motion<00:02:17.020> on<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
I did the aiming with motion on the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.200 
I did the aiming with motion on the
video<00:02:17.740> so<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.160> actually<00:02:18.280> use<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.760> motion

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
video so you can actually use the motion

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.250 
video so you can actually use the motion
on<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:21.090> BTS<00:02:22.090> video<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.600> actually<00:02:22.870> aim<00:02:23.050> like

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
on the BTS video to actually aim like

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.750 
on the BTS video to actually aim like
that<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.710> like<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:23.980> was<00:02:24.100> in<00:02:24.130> uncharted

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
that just like it was in uncharted

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
that just like it was in uncharted
golden<00:02:25.060> Abyss<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.360> could<00:02:25.450> probably<00:02:25.570> see

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
golden Abyss you could probably see

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.250 
golden Abyss you could probably see
right<00:02:25.990> there

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
right there

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.350 
right there
and<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.920> comes<00:02:27.130> really<00:02:27.610> useful<00:02:28.000> if<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.210> want

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
and that comes really useful if you want

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.410 
and that comes really useful if you want
to<00:02:28.420> aim<00:02:29.430> like<00:02:30.430> if<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.910> want<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.120> aim<00:02:31.210> really

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
to aim like if you want to aim really

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.260 
to aim like if you want to aim really
precisely<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.320> get<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.890> perfect<00:02:33.040> shot<00:02:33.490> so

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
precisely and get the perfect shot so

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.940 
precisely and get the perfect shot so
I'll<00:02:34.660> try<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.870> demonstrate<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.440> in<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.650> second

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
I'll try to demonstrate that in a second

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.860 
I'll try to demonstrate that in a second
here<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:39.250> should<00:02:39.430> be<00:02:39.490> some<00:02:39.700> anything<00:02:40.360> yep

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
here it should be some anything yep

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.480 
here it should be some anything yep
there's<00:02:41.140> one<00:02:41.260> right<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.560> well<00:02:42.340> there's<00:02:42.460> a

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
there's one right that well there's a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.620 
there's one right that well there's a
couple<00:02:42.520> there<00:02:44.310> I've<00:02:45.310> got<00:02:45.520> one<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.790> them<00:02:45.910> he

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
couple there I've got one of them he

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.000 
couple there I've got one of them he
could<00:02:46.660> switch<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.140> gun<00:02:47.320> right<00:02:47.500> here<00:02:47.680> he<00:02:47.830> using

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
could switch a gun right here he using

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.620 
could switch a gun right here he using
the<00:02:48.040> touchscreen<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:52.830> tried<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.060> aim<00:02:55.060> using<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
the touchscreen I tried to aim using the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.450 
the touchscreen I tried to aim using the
motion<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.050> he<00:02:56.260> got<00:02:56.410> me<00:02:56.530> before<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.070> there

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
motion that he got me before and there

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.980 
motion that he got me before and there
to<00:02:57.580> sprint<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.270> this<00:02:58.390> game<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.720> actually

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
to sprint in this game you actually

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.020 
to sprint in this game you actually
double<00:02:59.500> tap<00:02:59.740> and<00:02:59.770> hold<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.400> back<00:03:00.580> touchpad

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
double tap and hold the back touchpad

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.250 
double tap and hold the back touchpad
like<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.790> think<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.840> works<00:03:05.020> quite<00:03:05.140> well

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
like so and I think it works quite well

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.410 
like so and I think it works quite well
you<00:03:06.070> don't<00:03:06.190> it's<00:03:06.460> not<00:03:06.520> very<00:03:06.820> hard<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.150> do<00:03:07.240> at

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
you don't it's not very hard to do at

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.240 
you don't it's not very hard to do at
all<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:08.260> once<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.560> get<00:03:08.680> used<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.040> actually

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
all and once you get used to it actually

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.980 
all and once you get used to it actually
really<00:03:09.520> easy<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.060> can<00:03:10.510> also<00:03:10.690> if<00:03:10.960> you

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
really easy and you can also if you

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.720 
really easy and you can also if you
press<00:03:11.230> forward<00:03:11.710> and<00:03:11.830> circle<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.310> does<00:03:12.640> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
press forward and circle it does the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.780 
press forward and circle it does the
same<00:03:12.880> thing<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.750> just<00:03:13.780> toggle<00:03:14.140> sprint<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.920> if

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
same thing you just toggle sprint and if

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.070 
same thing you just toggle sprint and if
you<00:03:15.880> just<00:03:16.030> press<00:03:16.180> circle<00:03:16.390> on<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.690> spot<00:03:16.930> it

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
you just press circle on the spot it

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.650 
you just press circle on the spot it
crowd<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.830> character<00:03:18.130> Crouch<00:03:18.340> like<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.820> so

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
crowd the character Crouch like that so

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.260 
crowd the character Crouch like that so
I<00:03:19.900> think<00:03:20.020> they<00:03:20.200> made<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.380> controls<00:03:20.770> quiet

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
I think they made the controls quiet

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.090 
I think they made the controls quiet
easy<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.540> use<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.350> I'm<00:03:23.470> quite<00:03:23.620> happy<00:03:23.680> with<00:03:24.010> that

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
easy to use so I'm quite happy with that

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.580 
easy to use so I'm quite happy with that
see<00:03:24.370> if<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.489> can<00:03:24.610> any<00:03:24.820> motions<00:03:25.780> oh<00:03:25.810> yes<00:03:26.290> going
