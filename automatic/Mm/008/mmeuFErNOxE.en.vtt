00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.990
 Good day and welcome back last 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.890
 play clash of plants today one day 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.719
 Maybe there was a special consequence 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.349
 seen 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:16.770
 and jammer if i have to be short anyway 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.270
 The watch and special episode 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.859
 maybe without knowing it 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.300
 where it is not necessarily implement 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.119
 are a few bizarre news the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.949
 I chose and yes catch 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.480
 We're basically here right now 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.720
 a few units instructor 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.320
 I can tell you that right now 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.850
 google is working on one or has 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.120
 Share exchange more so I could 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.820
 next one yes google is working on one 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.200
 Contact lens for diabetics and yes the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.300
 The sense of the contact lens is actually 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.449
 rather , he will say the insulin level too 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.719
 do not measure the tears 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.239
 I know how much that makes sense 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.460
 as I'm currently still in one 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.600
 correction mount because now 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.850
 do not choose how far that makes sense 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.439
 or maybe that's just for the sake of it 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.810
 maybe a few dates too 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.250
 win over the man he was the one who 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.990
 I want to know me now not so 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.810
 to express but definitely remember 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.680
 would be very interesting in any case 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.840
 maybe here for the resort completely 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.860
 interesting minsk with his red eyes 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.530
 have again a new disco am 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.520
 right back there so yes if the third 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.380
 right the direction must do that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.390
 Everywhere is good with bluestacks again 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.150
 a real pleasure to record here 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.000
 Definitely not next message 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.030
 what had i got then in australia ? 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.350
 has all seven year old his 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.979
 drunken father on the train after 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.490
 driven home 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.869
 I also found very amusing indeed only once 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.850
 Consider that of course the child 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.079
 first time in the tracks 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.610
 that is already asking very much 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.140
 Questionable and then of course until 3 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.659
 watch night stay on him is the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.560
 little boy and then by the father 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.350
 Drunk home case is the yes you see 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.360
 This is the next disco section 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.619
 moment still a small cut so me 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.630
 have now changed a full screen 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.369
 no idea if that brings anything 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.840
 no idea but I wanted one 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.379
 to break and attack but that is the case 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.370
 that of course rather bad but us 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.319
 Just look like me over the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.560
 I already have 143 then I can still 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.700
 what say yes as I said seven year old 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.900
 Fed are drunk fathers home 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.550
 Of course, the police 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.730
 then stopped the officials 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.239
 probably not quite so 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.040
 probably quite baffled 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.970
 Looked aging little boy at the wheel 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.220
 I can imagine sitting and yes what 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.410
 there was only iceland left 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.970
 so winterized and a beer brewed 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.510
 and did not think so, but 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.970
 so very special beer 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.569
 I'm about to take the mouse 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.069
 and well kept in the screen 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.500
 to knock 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.870
 I do not know why sometimes that's the thing 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.099
 goes off how schmidts cat sometimes is 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:03.349
 Just jing around next day 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.349
 severe incision it is a qual 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.180
 Now I've done a cut and 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.769
 is still the length of quasi I know 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.239
 not why I do not know why one 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.849
 new friends 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.690
 What a shit that was 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.430
 I just have a nice story 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.560
 tells about Iceland and then comes 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.239
 a poke out of it but back to 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.000
 winterfest in iceland and have them 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.080
 thought we'll do it again 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.819
 special beer and there was more in it 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.690
 Altair actually wanted to fool me 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.180
 he is a chance completely 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.950
 Great, really great program 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.120
 here in any case if you are horny 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.980
 wanted to record and so you take 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.870
 bluestacks that's great for gambling 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.760
 something happens always happens 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.489
 faultless the error message and so on 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.659
 And so on, he does not go to war 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.129
 but no eye cancer of it if you 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.580
 some splinters look that is one 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.400
 super great program really terrific but 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.810
 I can run more in comparison 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.069
 also you can basically take the pictures 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.410
 can quit completely now, too 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.980
 because I already have 80 cuts in it 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.560
 yes that's great because there is such a 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.420
 a bit of moonwalk move moderately 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.530
 before that 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.470
 but that's not the case 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.770
 well well and I was saying only times so 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.810

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.220

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.200
 I therefore so thanks anyway out today 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.370

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.960
 angry when a thumb down 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.250
 but I would also, of course, connected 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.130
 I would give one up, though 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.840
 Well, you have to decide that yourself 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.680
