00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 a small demonstration of the smappee 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.230
 application 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.660
 more on my tablet you see that i am now 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.550
 892 watts consumption I have one 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.769
 slumber consumption of 60 because I have 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.610
 unfortunately no solar panels 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.930
 let's see what happens 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.789
 when I turn on the oven, cook something 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.550
 normal alley day and when sees are 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.470
 but you will also see that here 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.570
 over now it detects usage 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.029
 rises and normally he leaves too 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.109
 see here once but did look over 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.000
 have really seen 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.489
 fifteen hundred did come so I 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.930
 this is the oven i am cooking now 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.270
 and I can also be alert to this 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.250
 set when you look here 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.520
 to all devices 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.860
 wait I go in on it from shooter 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.210
 energy consumption is not intended 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.469
 when here you go to that device 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.320
 You can also see that I have the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.449
 have a cooking category in which I cross 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.149
 where I buy it have 4 stitches 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.649
 one in which I have the microwave so 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.210
 i need some other things i need 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.469
 still set so you see as folder 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.460
 appliances case my eats for example 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.200
 find me 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.049
 6 that is a device that is now 440 150 watts 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.030
 uses what is on and off on 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.710
 certain times and I have to go there now 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.159
 go and see what I put in or 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.159
 switched off 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.820
 One way to find this device is 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.439
 also that i am actually here in this 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.450
 dot screen from now on will appear 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.890
 that I fenced in this boat too 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.790
 when I see something switch on 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.770
 to show up 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.700
 which unidentified device is there 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.799
 is turned on 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.829
 and so can i again ajax is that 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.509
 device the rat saw you 195 plus that stand 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.909
 is something and consumption when I find you 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.110
 as something not clearly bringing home 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.329
 and he goes so statistically 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.649
 analyze that amount even though that amount is still there 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.509
 a number of times they come back 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.950
 that I recognize a pattern there and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.960
 we already say that is exactly one 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.759
 device but if we have no patterns 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.530
 it is not recognized from the list of 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.090
 devices you see here 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.090
 it is not added to 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.380
 what i can also show is that you 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.030
 next to the boat you also have a screen 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.110
 detailed screen can get so 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.570
 when you press this and 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.460
 Learn to fill 100 in now 200 wat 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.990
 more than before 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.990
 maybe the central heating 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.060
 Attached that I might not see 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.040
 here also the detail getting a look 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.410
 this is what i have consumed today here 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.480
 do you see the chart today i can 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.990
 which can also be placed in landscape and is possible 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.050
 even both horizontally miss crown 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.120
 music for several days as a vertical 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.050
 When I as obviously not really 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.610
 simple 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.340
 when i give you the lord and watch 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.350
 of those few hundred what is it like 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.709
 surged more what I still miss in 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.510
 application I saw there have a way 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.700
 that i say from look i got myself in 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.770
 new device and I am doing here on the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.300
 starter when I turn on my device 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.920
 and those here on the stop button when 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.020
 every device then stops such a one 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.720
 easy way to connect devices 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.510
 defining what i also miss is that i 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.670
 have an overview of devices out there 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.270
 is a my events blogs 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.640
 all neatly put back to portrait 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.000
 this my event war that one 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.540
 side loading agree with another reason 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.540
 takes that long 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.489
 because I vianen to put put 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.350
 I don't know why it takes a long time 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.299
 here you can see which devices are on and off 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.920
 in which order 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.350
 dance on the holland but whatever i am 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.340
 miss is an overview of everything 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.470
 the kitchen 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.820
 which one did I use how much for it 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.290
 it for cooking 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.299
 which days did I use how much 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.890
 ahead the lighting and the like 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.480
 I'll actually take those bulbs 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.920
 I suspect maybe it will come 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.959
 because I only just use the 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.420
 apply that when you know more 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.830
 about him and my devices about that 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.870
 there is indeed a graph 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.900
 so here in the very very that 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.459
 events that is smaller by scrolling 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.769
 so when the over on and off 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.570
 is when the confusion is on 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.970
 the disease is not alec between heating 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.850
 but the pumps of the plant 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.070
 heating on fuel oil unfortunately only something 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.720
 so I mean it would be fun 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.459
 you had to in this main screen 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.440
 when you see your consumption here 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.920
 when you could press it and 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.959
 I see 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.060
 I press this and I see smaller ones 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.870
 balls appear with it next to it 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.970
 Cook 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.870
 the lighting on pressing consumers 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.250
 and so on 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.600
 but maybe both the intention i can 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.549
 not imagine why else and 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.470
 has chosen such a sphere interface 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.930
 Also remember this is a very early one 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.940
 version of the application so I suspect 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.430
 that everything is going to change 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.200
 and things do not show yet 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.940
 you can also set an alert so when 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.120
 I'm here my devices say you look 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.080
 i want to know when that is about it 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.150
 is turned on than I can here 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.490
 alert for setting and then I got one 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.930
 message when someone switches to 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.400
 so when just my wife starts to 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.229
 we are cooking here in an exceeds 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.389
 then I can say by number no more 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.800
 so the food is ready 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.800
 that is certainly the intention
