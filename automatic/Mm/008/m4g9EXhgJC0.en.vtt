until you find the one that you prefer

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.569 
until you find the one that you prefer
in<00:01:30.299> my<00:01:30.540> opinion<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.560> there's<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.250> one

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
in my opinion I think there's just one

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.219 
in my opinion I think there's just one
clear-cut<00:01:33.119> winner<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.479> which<00:01:33.630> one's<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.049> best

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
clear-cut winner on which one's the best

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.469 
clear-cut winner on which one's the best
but<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.579> why<00:01:35.729> some<00:01:35.970> other<00:01:36.090> people

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
but I can see why some other people

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.140 
but I can see why some other people
might<00:01:36.689> prefer<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> other<00:01:37.829> ones<00:01:38.150> so

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
might prefer one of the other ones so

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.490 
might prefer one of the other ones so
that's<00:01:39.509> why<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.049> important<00:01:40.470> for

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that's why I think it's important for

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
that's why I think it's important for
you<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.710> compare<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.520> what's

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you to compare them and see what's

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
you to compare them and see what's
better<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.659> I'll<00:01:43.530> turn<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> volume

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
better for you I'll turn up the volume

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.010 
better for you I'll turn up the volume
in<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> second<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.509> hear<00:01:45.780> some<00:01:45.990> of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
in just a second so you can hear some of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.109 
in just a second so you can hear some of
the<00:01:46.200> difference<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.070> keep<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.399> mind<00:01:47.640> that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
the difference but keep in mind that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.880 
the difference but keep in mind that
what<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.360> hear<00:01:48.720> through<00:01:48.990> YouTube<00:01:49.380> video<00:01:49.710> is

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
what you hear through YouTube video is

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.530 
what you hear through YouTube video is
going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> sound<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.670> lot<00:01:50.909> different<00:01:51.390> than

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
going to sound a lot different than

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.539 
going to sound a lot different than
through<00:01:51.810> your<00:01:51.840> headset<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.560> TV<00:01:52.890> speakers<00:01:53.340> or

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
through your headset or TV speakers or

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
through your headset or TV speakers or
or<00:01:54.000> whatever<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.810> use<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.380> your<00:01:55.500> gaming

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
or whatever you use for your gaming

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.520 
or whatever you use for your gaming
audio<00:01:56.100> okay<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.390> ahead<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.840> listen<00:01:58.259> for

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
audio okay so go ahead and listen for

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:24.589 
audio okay so go ahead and listen for
these<00:01:58.649> footsteps

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.449 

so<00:02:25.599> I<00:02:25.900> think<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.230> super<00:02:26.560> crunch<00:02:26.799> preset<00:02:27.250> is

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
so I think the super crunch preset is

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.420 
so I think the super crunch preset is
the<00:02:27.700> best<00:02:28.030> by<00:02:28.269> far<00:02:28.439> but<00:02:29.439> I<00:02:29.650> can<00:02:29.799> understand<00:02:30.280> why

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the best by far but I can understand why

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.580 
the best by far but I can understand why
someone<00:02:30.670> might<00:02:30.909> not<00:02:31.030> prefer<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.599> it<00:02:32.230> turns

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
someone might not prefer that it turns

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.649 
someone might not prefer that it turns
up<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.920> volume<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.400> all<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.030> sound<00:02:34.269> effects

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
up the volume of all the sound effects

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.899 
up the volume of all the sound effects
in<00:02:34.719> the<00:02:34.780> game<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.650> footsteps<00:02:36.250> are<00:02:36.430> definitely

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
in the game so footsteps are definitely

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.209 
in the game so footsteps are definitely
louder<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:37.750> still<00:02:38.409> might<00:02:38.709> get<00:02:38.890> drowned<00:02:39.129> out

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:39.219 
louder but still might get drowned out

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.429 
louder but still might get drowned out
by<00:02:39.280> other<00:02:39.579> sounds<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:40.780> after<00:02:41.049> playing<00:02:41.200> a

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
by other sounds but after playing a

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.500 
by other sounds but after playing a
couple<00:02:41.650> games<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.159> each<00:02:42.340> preset<00:02:42.939> I<00:02:43.150> can

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
couple games with each preset I can

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.300 
couple games with each preset I can
honestly<00:02:43.780> say<00:02:44.140> without<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.709> doubt<00:02:44.859> that<00:02:45.280> I

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
honestly say without a doubt that I

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.280 
honestly say without a doubt that I
definitely<00:02:46.060> noticed<00:02:46.390> more<00:02:46.510> footsteps<00:02:46.989> with

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
definitely noticed more footsteps with

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.220 
definitely noticed more footsteps with
the<00:02:47.409> super<00:02:47.709> crunch<00:02:47.950> preset<00:02:48.569> so<00:02:49.569> that's<00:02:50.019> my

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
the super crunch preset so that's my

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.129 
the super crunch preset so that's my
premise<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.209> for<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.299> first<00:02:52.510> time<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.930> black

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
premise and for the first time in black

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.589 
premise and for the first time in black
ops<00:02:53.409> 2<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:54.609> hear<00:02:54.879> footsteps

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
ops 2 I can hear footsteps

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.899 
ops 2 I can hear footsteps
even<00:02:55.870> without<00:02:56.200> awareness<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.069> it's<00:02:57.639> even

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
even without awareness and it's even

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.660 
even without awareness and it's even
better<00:02:58.090> with<00:02:58.359> it<00:02:58.799> well<00:02:59.799> that's<00:03:00.129> all<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.370> have
