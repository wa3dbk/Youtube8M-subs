of<00:00:52.860> bugging<00:00:53.070> me

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
of bugging me

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.770 
of bugging me
here<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> my<00:00:55.829> header<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.059> actually<00:00:57.390> stock

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
working a long time ago and then I've

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.340 
working a long time ago and then I've

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
been trying to figure out what to do

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.170 
been trying to figure out what to do
about<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:45.180> order<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.870> get<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.470> fixed

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
about it and in order to get it fixed

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.510 
about it and in order to get it fixed
because<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:49.500> whole<00:02:49.680> case<00:02:49.980> had<00:02:50.220> actually

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
because the the whole case had actually

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.110 
because the the whole case had actually
cracked<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:52.170> would<00:02:52.350> cost<00:02:52.530> me<00:02:52.740> $300<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.880> said

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
cracked it would cost me $300 and I said

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.320 
cracked it would cost me $300 and I said
screw<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.870> I'm<00:02:55.080> not<00:02:55.350> paying<00:02:55.620> $300<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.120> took

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
screw that I'm not paying $300 so I took

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.240 
screw that I'm not paying $300 so I took
it<00:02:57.480> off<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.020> I'm<00:02:58.290> actually<00:02:58.500> really<00:02:58.710> happy
