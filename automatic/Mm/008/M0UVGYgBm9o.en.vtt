palm grip I don't like claw and I don't

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.910 
palm grip I don't like claw and I don't
like<00:01:24.000> finger<00:01:24.299> tip<00:01:24.680> despite<00:01:25.680> all<00:01:25.830> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
like finger tip despite all that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.420 
like finger tip despite all that
movement<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.020> fits<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.890> 19

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
movement and it fits this is a 19

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
movement and it fits this is a 19
centimeter<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.350> if<00:01:34.350> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
centimeter from there to there so if you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.890 
centimeter from there to there so if you
have<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> hand<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.220> roughly<00:01:35.640> similar<00:01:35.909> size<00:01:36.299> then

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
have a hand of roughly similar size then

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.359 
have a hand of roughly similar size then
you<00:01:36.930> should<00:01:37.350> feel<00:01:37.560> pretty<00:01:37.710> comfortable<00:01:37.890> palm

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
you should feel pretty comfortable palm

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.490 
you should feel pretty comfortable palm
gripping<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.820> well<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.930> are<00:01:39.960> clawed

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
gripping as well if you are clawed

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.940 
gripping as well if you are clawed
gripping<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.799> mouse

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
gripping which is I think that the mouse

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.170 
gripping which is I think that the mouse
is<00:01:44.130> actually<00:01:44.250> built<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> anyway<00:01:45.119> so

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
is actually built for you anyway so

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.840 
is actually built for you anyway so
you're<00:01:45.509> gonna<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.780> fine<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:47.250> weight<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
you're gonna be fine now the weight it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.460 
you're gonna be fine now the weight it
does<00:01:48.000> feel<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.630> weighted<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> back

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
does feel like it's weighted at the back

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.670 
does feel like it's weighted at the back
a<00:01:49.500> little<00:01:49.829> bit<00:01:49.979> too<00:01:50.220> much<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:50.759> times<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
a little bit too much at times so I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.080 
a little bit too much at times so I
don't<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:52.979> that's<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> design<00:01:53.520> flaw<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
don't know if that's a design flaw and

see<00:02:00.910> our<00:02:00.940> rattles<00:02:01.420> ye<00:02:02.050> how<00:02:02.440> it<00:02:02.590> rattles<00:02:04.350> it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
see our rattles ye how it rattles it

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.350 
see our rattles ye how it rattles it
just<00:02:05.560> films<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.920> bit<00:02:06.340> flimsy<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:07.210> could

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
just films a bit flimsy you could

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.700 
just films a bit flimsy you could
probably<00:02:07.540> do<00:02:07.900> with<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:08.080> bit<00:02:08.290> more<00:02:08.440> weight<00:02:08.560> up

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
probably do with a bit more weight up

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.370 
probably do with a bit more weight up
there<00:02:08.890> but<00:02:09.160> it's<00:02:09.399> not<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.610> deal-breaker<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.450> did

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
there but it's not a deal-breaker I did

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.230 
there but it's not a deal-breaker I did
put<00:02:11.560> blue<00:02:11.770> tack<00:02:12.010> here<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.520> here<00:02:12.730> for<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> while

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
put blue tack here in here for a while

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.200 
put blue tack here in here for a while
and<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:14.620> just<00:02:14.830> helped<00:02:15.010> balance<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.060> weight

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
and that just helped balance the weight

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.480 
and that just helped balance the weight
a<00:02:16.240> bit<00:02:16.480> more<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:17.710> did<00:02:17.860> make<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.160> feel<00:02:18.310> good

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
a bit more and it did make it feel good

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.980 
a bit more and it did make it feel good
but<00:02:18.670> now<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.000> I've<00:02:19.120> used<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.510> for<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.690> few<00:02:19.720> days

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
but now that I've used it for a few days

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.450 
but now that I've used it for a few days
I<00:02:20.200> can<00:02:20.320> remove<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.920> feels<00:02:21.100> fine<00:02:21.280> as

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
I can remove it and it feels fine as

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.610 
I can remove it and it feels fine as
well

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
well

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.690 
well
so<00:02:23.620> that's<00:02:23.770> something<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.010> be<00:02:24.160> aware<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.400> but

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
so that's something to be aware of but

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.350 
so that's something to be aware of but
not<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:24.850> big<00:02:25.030> deal

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
not a big deal

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.870 
not a big deal
ah<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:26.080> scroll<00:02:26.830> wheel<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.190> actually<00:02:27.700> really

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
ah this scroll wheel is actually really

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
ah this scroll wheel is actually really
good<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.330> can<00:02:28.510> see<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:30.570> just<00:02:31.570> want<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> do

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
good you can see that I just want to do

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.180 
good you can see that I just want to do
it<00:02:32.020> once<00:02:32.680> or<00:02:32.890> twice<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.620> it's<00:02:35.740> got<00:02:35.890> very

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
it once or twice I can so it's got very

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.330 
it once or twice I can so it's got very
good<00:02:36.280> control<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:36.790> when<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.150> do<00:02:37.330> click<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:38.340> it

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
good control and when you do click it it

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.730 
good control and when you do click it it
doesn't<00:02:39.930> rotate<00:02:40.930> at<00:02:41.260> all<00:02:41.520> sorry<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:44.680> a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
doesn't rotate at all sorry it's a

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.260 
doesn't rotate at all sorry it's a
little<00:02:44.770> harder<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.370> do<00:02:45.459> cuz<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.790> mouse<00:02:46.030> wheel

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
little harder to do cuz this mouse wheel

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.170 
little harder to do cuz this mouse wheel
on<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.660> Death<00:02:46.870> Adder<00:02:47.020> is<00:02:47.290> very<00:02:47.770> soft<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.910> one

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
on the Death Adder is very soft this one

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.310 
on the Death Adder is very soft this one
is<00:02:49.330> quite<00:02:49.570> rigid<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.420> must<00:02:52.690> say<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.840> do<00:02:53.050> prefer

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
is quite rigid so I must say I do prefer

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.660 
is quite rigid so I must say I do prefer
this<00:02:53.470> one<00:02:53.620> even<00:02:53.950> though<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.160> one<00:02:54.370> feels

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
this one even though this one feels

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.900 
this one even though this one feels
better<00:02:54.880> this<00:02:55.750> one<00:02:55.959> has<00:02:56.170> better<00:02:56.320> functionality

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
better this one has better functionality

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.300 
better this one has better functionality
so<00:02:57.910> I'd<00:02:58.030> have<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.209> go<00:02:58.390> with<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.660> one<00:02:59.280> so<00:03:00.280> now

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
so I'd have to go with this one so now

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.070 
so I'd have to go with this one so now
to<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.580> buttons<00:03:01.030> they<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:01.480> apparently<00:03:01.810> put

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
to the buttons they have apparently put

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.590 
to the buttons they have apparently put
a<00:03:02.110> lot<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.410> effort<00:03:02.680> into<00:03:02.830> this<00:03:03.570> clicking<00:03:05.070> and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
a lot of effort into this clicking and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.910 
a lot of effort into this clicking and
it<00:03:07.600> just<00:03:07.810> feels<00:03:07.959> like<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.170> mouse<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.590> me<00:03:08.680> it's

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
it just feels like a mouse to me it's

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.780 
it just feels like a mouse to me it's
probably<00:03:09.220> quite<00:03:09.430> good<00:03:09.730> but<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:11.340> do<00:03:12.340> prefer<00:03:12.760> the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
probably quite good but I do prefer the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.479 
probably quite good but I do prefer the
DeathAdder<00:03:13.330> weighted<00:03:13.840> click<00:03:14.530> as<00:03:14.769> soon<00:03:15.400> it

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
DeathAdder weighted click as soon it

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.729 
DeathAdder weighted click as soon it
takes<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.790> bit<00:03:15.940> more<00:03:15.970> effort<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.420> click<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:16.959> then

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
takes a bit more effort to click in then

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.090 
takes a bit more effort to click in then
again<00:03:18.040> if<00:03:18.670> you're<00:03:18.970> gaming<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:20.410> am<00:03:20.620> maybe

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
again if you're gaming and I am maybe

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.590 
again if you're gaming and I am maybe
it's<00:03:21.340> better<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.640> have<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.910> fast<00:03:22.150> clicking

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
it's better to have the fast clicking

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.800 
it's better to have the fast clicking
buttons<00:03:23.410> there<00:03:24.120> even<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.209> size<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.660> so

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
buttons there even the size of and so

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.660 
buttons there even the size of and so
they<00:03:26.110> click<00:03:26.350> in<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:26.709> fine<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.220> haven't<00:03:27.550> had<00:03:27.640> a

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
they click in just fine I haven't had a

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.470 
they click in just fine I haven't had a
problem<00:03:27.880> with<00:03:28.090> them<00:03:28.209> at<00:03:28.300> all

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
problem with them at all

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.990 
problem with them at all
so<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.170> buttons<00:03:29.500> feel<00:03:29.709> quite<00:03:29.890> good<00:03:30.070> side

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
so the buttons feel quite good side

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.040 
so the buttons feel quite good side
right<00:03:31.590> left<00:03:32.590> Mouse<00:03:33.400> 3<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:34.120> even<00:03:34.480> scroll<00:03:34.840> well

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
right left Mouse 3 and even scroll well

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.160 
right left Mouse 3 and even scroll well
oh<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.070> have<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.310> DPI<00:03:36.640> switch<00:03:36.910> here<00:03:37.170> you

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
oh and you have the DPI switch here you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.320 
oh and you have the DPI switch here you
can<00:03:38.350> set<00:03:38.560> up<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.890> five<00:03:39.190> different<00:03:39.430> DPI's<00:03:39.940> I

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
can set up to five different DPI's I

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.960 
can set up to five different DPI's I
think<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.290> have<00:03:41.410> four<00:03:41.739> in<00:03:41.890> there<00:03:42.070> but<00:03:42.430> really<00:03:42.700> no

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
think I have four in there but really no

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.870 
think I have four in there but really no
reason<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:44.380> now<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.860> important<00:03:45.400> part<00:03:45.430> so

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
reason so now to the important part so

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.680 
reason so now to the important part so
that's<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.360> shape<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:47.410> can<00:03:47.590> see

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.410 

so<00:03:51.530> this<00:03:51.830> is<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.010> small<00:03:52.340> Mouse<00:03:52.550> and<00:03:52.820> I've

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
so this is a small Mouse and I've

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.120 
so this is a small Mouse and I've
actually<00:03:53.630> changed<00:03:54.050> from<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.470> death<00:03:54.650> attitude

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
actually changed from the death attitude

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.980 
actually changed from the death attitude
this<00:03:55.280> mouse<00:03:55.520> now<00:03:55.730> because<00:03:56.240> I<00:03:56.270> found<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
this mouse now because I found that the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.930 
this mouse now because I found that the
bigger<00:03:57.170> mice<00:03:57.440> although<00:03:58.370> they<00:03:58.550> feel<00:03:58.790> more

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
bigger mice although they feel more

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.180 
bigger mice although they feel more
comfortable<00:03:59.120> in<00:03:59.480> their<00:03:59.600> hand<00:03:59.890> they<00:04:00.890> don't

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
comfortable in their hand they don't

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.940 
comfortable in their hand they don't
allow<00:04:01.610> for<00:04:01.640> as<00:04:02.330> much<00:04:02.510> freedom<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.620> when<00:04:03.830> you're

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
allow for as much freedom so when you're

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.400 
allow for as much freedom so when you're
aiming<00:04:04.160> or<00:04:04.640> flicking<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.180> mouse<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.690> can't

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
aiming or flicking the mouse you can't

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.960 
aiming or flicking the mouse you can't
do<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.650> as<00:04:06.740> easily<00:04:06.920> as<00:04:07.250> with<00:04:07.490> this<00:04:07.610> all<00:04:07.790> Mouse

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
do it as easily as with this all Mouse

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.030 
do it as easily as with this all Mouse
and<00:04:08.240> I<00:04:08.330> always<00:04:08.810> wondered<00:04:09.320> why<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.530> was<00:04:09.770> able<00:04:10.010> to

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
and I always wondered why I was able to

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.280 
and I always wondered why I was able to
aim<00:04:10.160> better<00:04:10.490> with<00:04:10.670> Diamondback<00:04:11.300> the<00:04:12.050> Razer

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
aim better with Diamondback the Razer

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.090 
aim better with Diamondback the Razer
Diamondback<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:13.040> I<00:04:13.100> think<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:13.490> might<00:04:13.700> be<00:04:13.730> it

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
Diamondback and I think that might be it

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.620 
Diamondback and I think that might be it
now<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.459> probably<00:04:16.640> can't<00:04:16.940> see<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.330> cuz<00:04:17.510> it's

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
now you probably can't see it cuz it's

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.130 
now you probably can't see it cuz it's
out<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.780> camera<00:04:18.260> there<00:04:18.560> there<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.489> is<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:20.660> what

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
out of camera there there it is so what

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.630 
out of camera there there it is so what
I've<00:04:21.260> done<00:04:21.410> to<00:04:21.590> get<00:04:21.709> that<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:22.160> basically<00:04:22.520> just

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
I've done to get that is basically just

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.990 
I've done to get that is basically just
turn<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.360> mouse<00:04:23.510> over<00:04:23.900> twice<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:25.000> it's

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
turn the mouse over twice and it's

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.880 
turn the mouse over twice and it's
created<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.390> loop<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:26.930> avoids<00:04:27.320> any<00:04:27.680> need

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
created a loop and that avoids any need

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.820 
created a loop and that avoids any need
for<00:04:27.920> a<00:04:28.250> mouse<00:04:28.610> bungee<00:04:29.120> or<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.390> weight<00:04:30.350> on<00:04:30.650> the

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
for a mouse bungee or a weight on the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.040 
for a mouse bungee or a weight on the
mouse<00:04:31.070> cord<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:32.330> stop<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:32.630> from<00:04:32.750> moving<00:04:32.810> around

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
mouse cord to stop it from moving around

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.960 
mouse cord to stop it from moving around
so<00:04:33.380> much<00:04:33.410> all<00:04:33.770> falling<00:04:34.160> off<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.340> desk<00:04:34.520> or<00:04:34.700> even

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
so much all falling off the desk or even

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.750 
so much all falling off the desk or even
tearing<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:35.960> error<00:04:36.200> which<00:04:37.190> I<00:04:37.340> have<00:04:37.550> had

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
tearing this error which I have had

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.000 
tearing this error which I have had
before<00:04:37.940> not<00:04:38.660> torn<00:04:38.930> out<00:04:39.080> but<00:04:39.290> it<00:04:39.410> did<00:04:39.530> break<00:04:39.770> the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
before not torn out but it did break the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.820 
before not torn out but it did break the
cable<00:04:40.490> I<00:04:40.610> think<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:40.850> was<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:40.970> faulty<00:04:41.270> Mouse<00:04:41.830> so

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
cable I think it was a faulty Mouse so

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.000 
cable I think it was a faulty Mouse so
to<00:04:42.890> avoid<00:04:43.160> any<00:04:43.400> Mouse<00:04:44.120> breakage<00:04:45.020> I've<00:04:45.800> just

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
to avoid any Mouse breakage I've just

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.830 
to avoid any Mouse breakage I've just
created<00:04:46.670> a<00:04:46.850> little<00:04:47.060> loop<00:04:47.180> here<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:47.420> when<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.720> do

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
created a little loop here so when I do

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.560 
created a little loop here so when I do
move<00:04:48.140> it<00:04:48.260> around<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.970> know<00:04:49.970> it's<00:04:50.300> not<00:04:50.420> gonna

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
move it around you know it's not gonna

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.100 
move it around you know it's not gonna
break<00:04:50.810> anything<00:04:51.050> it's<00:04:51.410> got<00:04:51.560> some<00:04:51.740> slack<00:04:51.980> there

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
break anything it's got some slack there

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.720 
break anything it's got some slack there
so<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.230> DPI<00:04:54.560> of<00:04:54.650> this<00:04:54.860> mouse<00:04:55.070> is<00:04:55.100> only<00:04:55.550> four

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
so the DPI of this mouse is only four

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.580 
so the DPI of this mouse is only four
thousand<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.360> that's<00:04:56.630> nothing<00:04:57.050> for<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.470> head

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
thousand and that's nothing for the head

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.080 
thousand and that's nothing for the head
to<00:04:57.740> I<00:04:57.770> love<00:04:58.160> the<00:04:58.190> mice<00:04:58.490> out<00:04:58.700> there<00:04:58.910> these<00:04:59.030> days

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
to I love the mice out there these days

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.530 
to I love the mice out there these days
but<00:04:59.740> dpi<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:00.950> marketing<00:05:01.340> gimmick<00:05:01.490> it's<00:05:02.330> the

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
but dpi is a marketing gimmick it's the

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.150 
but dpi is a marketing gimmick it's the
acceleration<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.320> have<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.590> care<00:05:03.800> about<00:05:03.890> it

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
acceleration you have to care about it

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.680 
acceleration you have to care about it
if<00:05:04.310> your<00:05:04.490> mouse<00:05:04.670> is<00:05:04.850> spinning<00:05:05.210> out<00:05:05.330> then<00:05:05.570> it

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
if your mouse is spinning out then it

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.110 
if your mouse is spinning out then it
has<00:05:05.870> a<00:05:05.900> problem<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:07.370> can<00:05:07.520> see<00:05:07.730> as<00:05:07.940> I'm

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
has a problem you can see as I'm

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.330 
has a problem you can see as I'm
flicking<00:05:08.390> this<00:05:08.660> Mouse<00:05:08.990> like<00:05:09.260> crazy<00:05:09.710> doing

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
flicking this Mouse like crazy doing

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.870 
flicking this Mouse like crazy doing
these<00:05:10.460> rocket<00:05:10.820> jumps<00:05:11.980> there's<00:05:12.980> absolutely<00:05:13.550> no

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
these rocket jumps there's absolutely no

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.420 
these rocket jumps there's absolutely no
loss<00:05:14.690> of<00:05:14.930> traction<00:05:15.169> or<00:05:15.650> spinning<00:05:16.100> out<00:05:16.220> or

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
loss of traction or spinning out or

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.659 
loss of traction or spinning out or
anything<00:05:16.730> this<00:05:17.120> sensor<00:05:17.780> is<00:05:17.810> beautiful<00:05:18.710> it<00:05:19.430> is

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
anything this sensor is beautiful it is

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.810 
anything this sensor is beautiful it is
hitting<00:05:19.910> every<00:05:20.390> point<00:05:20.660> perfectly<00:05:21.350> I<00:05:21.820> haven't

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
hitting every point perfectly I haven't

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.550 
hitting every point perfectly I haven't
had<00:05:22.940> any<00:05:23.150> issues<00:05:23.330> with<00:05:23.510> it<00:05:23.780> so<00:05:23.930> far<00:05:24.140> I've<00:05:24.440> only

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
had any issues with it so far I've only

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.500 
had any issues with it so far I've only
had<00:05:24.740> it<00:05:24.800> for<00:05:24.890> days<00:05:25.220> but<00:05:25.580> I've<00:05:25.760> played<00:05:25.970> probably

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
had it for days but I've played probably

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.750 
had it for days but I've played probably
16<00:05:26.990> hours<00:05:27.260> just<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.560> get<00:05:27.680> a<00:05:27.710> real<00:05:27.890> feel<00:05:28.100> for

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
16 hours just to get a real feel for

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.370 
16 hours just to get a real feel for
so<00:05:30.760> in<00:05:31.030> conclusion<00:05:31.180> I<00:05:31.750> really<00:05:32.050> like<00:05:32.230> this

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
so in conclusion I really like this

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.200 
so in conclusion I really like this
Mouse<00:05:32.590> I'm<00:05:33.490> going<00:05:33.700> to<00:05:33.790> keep<00:05:33.940> on<00:05:34.090> eating

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
Mouse I'm going to keep on eating

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.450 
Mouse I'm going to keep on eating
instead<00:05:34.690> of<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:34.840> death<00:05:35.020> that<00:05:35.050> oh<00:05:35.280> it's<00:05:36.280> a
