00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.560 

the<00:00:00.599> cherry<00:00:00.930> picker<00:00:01.230> in<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.939> previous<00:00:03.300> series

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
the cherry picker in the previous series

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.559 
the cherry picker in the previous series
we<00:00:04.319> did<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.950> slow<00:00:05.279> cherry<00:00:05.670> picker<00:00:05.940> or<00:00:06.240> the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
we did the slow cherry picker or the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.600 
we did the slow cherry picker or the
tick-tock<00:00:07.250> which<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.460> this<00:00:10.400> okay

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
tick-tock which is this okay

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.730 
tick-tock which is this okay
now<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:13.280> slight<00:00:14.280> variation<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:16.310> this

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
now a slight variation of this is this

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.960 
now a slight variation of this is this
okay<00:00:19.760> the<00:00:20.760> cherry<00:00:21.210> picker<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:23.789> most

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
okay the cherry picker is the most

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
okay the cherry picker is the most
difficult<00:00:24.210> part<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.930> both<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.199> those<00:00:25.470> tricks

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
difficult part of both of those tricks

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.580 
difficult part of both of those tricks
combined<00:00:26.689> so<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:27.869> you're<00:00:28.050> doing<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
combined so what you're doing is the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.500 
combined so what you're doing is the
balls<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.130> traveling<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.849> an<00:00:30.000> upside-down

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
balls are traveling in an upside-down

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.160 
balls are traveling in an upside-down
pyramid<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.489> circle<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> you're<00:00:33.780> grabbing

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
pyramid in a circle and you're grabbing

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.130 
pyramid in a circle and you're grabbing
it<00:00:34.410> at<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> apex<00:00:35.090> shoving<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> over<00:00:36.450> along<00:00:36.899> an

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it at the apex shoving it over along an

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.580 
it at the apex shoving it over along an
imaginary<00:00:37.739> line<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.309> dropping<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.350> this

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
imaginary line and dropping it so this

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:52.420 
imaginary line and dropping it so this
is<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> cherry<00:00:41.340> picker<00:00:41.579> looks<00:00:41.910> like

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.100 

okay<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> most<00:00:53.910> difficult<00:00:54.120> part<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.870> this

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
okay now the most difficult part of this

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.630 
okay now the most difficult part of this
is<00:00:55.670> twofold<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.289> having<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.800> throw<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
is twofold it is having the throw be the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.549 
is twofold it is having the throw be the
right<00:00:59.879> right<00:01:00.690> height<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.379> don't

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
right right height so that you don't

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.750 
right right height so that you don't
have<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.859> reach<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
have to reach for it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.329 
have to reach for it
so<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> looks<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.930> though<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.290> top<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:05.100> on

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so that it looks as though the top is on

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.100 
so that it looks as though the top is on
a<00:01:05.369> shelf<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.210> are<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.540> pushing<00:01:06.810> them

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
a shelf and you are just pushing them

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.679 
a shelf and you are just pushing them
along<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.439> shelf<00:01:07.880> that's<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.299> most<00:01:09.450> difficult

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
along a shelf that's the most difficult

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.280 
along a shelf that's the most difficult
part<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:11.010> getting<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> throw<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.570> stop<00:01:12.990> at

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
part one is getting the throw to stop at

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.920 
part one is getting the throw to stop at
its<00:01:13.439> apex<00:01:13.670> right<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.119> same<00:01:15.330> plane<00:01:15.659> every

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
its apex right on the same plane every

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.490 
its apex right on the same plane every
time<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:17.250> difficult<00:01:17.759> part<00:01:18.000> too<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
time the difficult part too is the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100 
time the difficult part too is the
release<00:01:20.180> when<00:01:21.180> you're<00:01:21.299> releasing<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
release when you're releasing it on the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840 
release when you're releasing it on the
other<00:01:22.229> side<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.130> don't<00:01:23.310> want<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> throw<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
other side you don't want to throw it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.460 
other side you don't want to throw it
you<00:01:24.330> don't<00:01:24.479> want<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> flick<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you don't want to flick it and you

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.690 
you don't want to flick it and you
definitely<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.950> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> push<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.400> down

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
definitely don't want to push it down

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.080 
definitely don't want to push it down
you<00:01:27.150> need<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.570> able<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.869> drop<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.880> which<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you need to be able to drop it which is

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
you need to be able to drop it which is
much<00:01:30.509> harder<00:01:30.689> than<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.470> sounds<00:01:32.040> it's

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
much harder than it then it sounds it's

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.780 
much harder than it then it sounds it's
very<00:01:33.000> hard<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:34.200> move<00:01:34.380> your<00:01:34.619> arm<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.340> quickly

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
very hard to move your arm that quickly

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.690 
very hard to move your arm that quickly
and<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.900> drop<00:01:37.350> without<00:01:37.890> having<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> ball

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and then drop without having the ball

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.450 
and then drop without having the ball
continue<00:01:39.689> along<00:01:39.900> its<00:01:40.079> path<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.710> fly<00:01:41.070> out<00:01:41.689> so

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
continue along its path and fly out so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.260 
continue along its path and fly out so
the<00:01:44.460> way<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> start<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:47.090> start<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.210> your

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the way to start is start with your

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.249 
the way to start is start with your
tick-tock<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:50.780> instead<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.899> doing<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
tick-tock and instead of doing the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:00.680 
tick-tock and instead of doing the
tick-tock<00:01:52.680> part<00:01:54.320> try<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> move<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.680> over<00:01:58.640> okay

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
tick-tock part try to move it over okay

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.720 
tick-tock part try to move it over okay
it's<00:02:00.810> another<00:02:01.590> way<00:02:01.830> would<00:02:02.010> be<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.190> practice

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
it's another way would be to practice

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.430 
it's another way would be to practice
your<00:02:02.910> underarm<00:02:03.390> throw<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.900> instead<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.230> doing

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
your underarm throw and instead of doing

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.120 
your underarm throw and instead of doing
a<00:02:04.530> chop<00:02:04.830> downward<00:02:05.570> this<00:02:06.710> try<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.740> move<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.040> over

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
a chop downward this try to move it over

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.560 
a chop downward this try to move it over
and<00:02:08.490> eventually<00:02:09.420> with<00:02:10.110> enough<00:02:10.380> practice

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
and eventually with enough practice

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.380 
and eventually with enough practice
you'll<00:02:12.570> be<00:02:12.630> able<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.960> get<00:02:13.110> them<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:14.030> sit<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
you'll be able to get them to sit in the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.920 
you'll be able to get them to sit in the
same<00:02:15.600> spot<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:17.240> obviously<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.450> farther<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
same spot and obviously the farther you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.080 
same spot and obviously the farther you
can<00:02:19.050> move<00:02:19.350> them<00:02:19.530> over<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.400> wider<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.940> can

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
can move them over and the wider you can

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.510 
can move them over and the wider you can
make<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.450> triangle<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.920> better<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.370> trick

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
make that triangle the better the trick

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.040 
make that triangle the better the trick
looks<00:02:23.990> so<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.590> cherry<00:02:25.800> picker
