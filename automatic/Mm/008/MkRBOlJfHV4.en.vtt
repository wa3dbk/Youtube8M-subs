Bulls on a Purina a curation just to
kind<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.680> help<00:03:20.920> them<00:03:21.130> along<00:03:21.280> we<00:03:21.460> don't<00:03:21.640> really

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
kind of help them along we don't really

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.310 
kind of help them along we don't really
push<00:03:22.060> our<00:03:22.210> bulls<00:03:22.450> very<00:03:22.750> much<00:03:22.990> because<00:03:23.200> we

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
push our bulls very much because we

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.200 
push our bulls very much because we
don't<00:03:23.350> like<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.650> get<00:03:23.890> them<00:03:24.010> overly<00:03:24.340> fat<00:03:24.580> but<00:03:25.090> if

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
don't like to get them overly fat but if

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.550 
don't like to get them overly fat but if
you<00:03:25.300> can<00:03:25.420> see<00:03:25.600> some<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.870> these<00:03:26.050> you<00:03:26.440> can<00:03:26.500> see

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
you can see some of these you can see

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.380 
you can see some of these you can see
these<00:03:26.830> bulls<00:03:27.070> aren't<00:03:27.370> really<00:03:27.610> overly<00:03:27.970> fat<00:03:28.180> but

way<00:06:20.800> we<00:06:21.009> can<00:06:21.099> kind<00:06:21.219> of<00:06:21.309> toughen<00:06:21.669> these<00:06:21.819> Bulls

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
way we can kind of toughen these Bulls

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.149 
way we can kind of toughen these Bulls
up<00:06:22.360> a<00:06:22.479> little<00:06:22.659> bit<00:06:22.839> after<00:06:23.019> once<00:06:23.740> they<00:06:23.860> come<00:06:24.129> off

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
up a little bit after once they come off

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:25.709 
up a little bit after once they come off
of<00:06:24.370> this<00:06:24.459> test<00:06:24.729> toughen<00:06:25.209> them<00:06:25.330> up<00:06:25.389> a<00:06:25.539> little

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:25.719 
of this test toughen them up a little

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.689 
of this test toughen them up a little
more<00:06:25.930> so<00:06:26.469> that<00:06:26.649> way<00:06:26.800> when<00:06:27.039> the<00:06:27.219> when<00:06:27.519> these
