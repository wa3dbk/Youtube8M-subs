00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:12.000
 Booty car 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:17.010
 That's why a little hand the hair to cut Netto Palmer came out 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.200
 Is I'm a pretty big event of in and take me say that'd power is the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:26.750
 Because it has the intention like would be multiplied many more times in that the rest of your life Well before 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:32.450
 But also this timelapse 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:36.680
 Though it's app Tteyuu the second child of the time lapse from the right from on the second chic 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:42.170
 If you try to use for the first time in a while, it is quite updated 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:46.770
 I a place that is still to edit the material that took the like, so the effect has been added softening function 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.560
 I'd use a reflector in the fact that I would like to show you a little 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.370
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.370
 If you look at something from behind you feel quite awkward, but it's okay or not company 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:06.730
 Unfortunately I was not able to shoot well 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:12.610
 Head reflector is also up and ready. 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:16.150
 It says the new project material in its project in this time-lapse app 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:23.020
 I'm an attempt is made to read, but its material 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:24.400
 It was 3 minutes and 15 seconds after shooting in timelapse, but it is probably too long 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.860
 I suppose 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:35.409
 Even if I try to load it well, I'm forced to quit the app itself 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:40.899
 I couldn't help but I wasn't able to show you where to edit 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:44.530
 What it is and say whether I wanted to show you quite in the editing screen 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:49.390
 It I'm so can many work it is or apply effects 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.679
 I wanted to show such a place , but the right side was shot with timelapse 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.430
 It is 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:59.170
 It is the ones that say you press the shutter once every 30 seconds I de likely 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.330
 Leo to show you a little shorter 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:10.460
 We fast forward at 140% 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:12.709
 And the screen on the left was taken using hd rmv 1 and this is 4300% 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.420
 We fast forward to 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.650
 We Are you fast-forward of what Kako um this 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:24.120
 It's interesting that the warmer of the Palmer behind is spinning around 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:29.250
 Good really, even if such it is good to leave it to the video 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:34.140
 Though it is feeling that we are really sorry when we think from the standpoint of person who can show picture 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:39.860
 By'm Well can feel free to shoot at it that time-lapse Well iphone 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.860
 I think it will be interesting if you try variously Please try it by all means 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.150

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:57.069
 Now the streets to Chinami is hot topic in the topic of ps 4 but 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.880
 8 I can not get on that wave unfortunately 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.290
 Oh dear 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:08.019
 If you start playing the game, you just destroy yourself 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.990
