four forty which isn't anything

four forty which isn't anything
impressive<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.099> probably<00:00:14.340> not<00:00:14.429> going<00:00:14.519> to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
impressive and is probably not going to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.279 
impressive and is probably not going to
be<00:00:14.700> overly<00:00:15.120> challenging<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.780> don't<00:00:15.929> know<00:00:16.049> I

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
be overly challenging I don't know I

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.870 
be overly challenging I don't know I
think<00:00:16.710> what<00:00:17.010> I'm<00:00:17.100> going<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.340> do<00:00:17.490> instead<00:00:17.640> is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
think what I'm going to do instead is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.880 
think what I'm going to do instead is
just<00:00:18.029> work<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> heavy<00:00:18.900> set<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.260> three<00:00:19.650> and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
just work up to a heavy set of three and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.380 
just work up to a heavy set of three and
that<00:00:20.070> might<00:00:20.279> be<00:00:20.430> something<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.850> might<00:00:21.000> just

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
that might be something I might just

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.580 
that might be something I might just
implement<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.869> program<00:00:22.230> meaning<00:00:22.439> all

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
implement in the program meaning all

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.109 
implement in the program meaning all
right<00:00:22.680> here's<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> prescribed<00:00:23.430> reps<00:00:23.880> and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
right here's the prescribed reps and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.990 
right here's the prescribed reps and
sets<00:00:24.900> based<00:00:25.199> off<00:00:25.380> these<00:00:25.529> percentages<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.490> if

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
sets based off these percentages but if

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.210 
sets based off these percentages but if
you<00:00:27.180> feeling<00:00:27.539> extra<00:00:27.900> good<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:28.980> feeling

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
you feeling extra good and I'm feeling

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.769 
you feeling extra good and I'm feeling
extra<00:00:29.429> good<00:00:29.580> okay<00:00:30.000> I'm<00:00:30.210> looking<00:00:30.330> extra<00:00:30.660> good

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
extra good okay I'm looking extra good

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.730 
extra good okay I'm looking extra good
today<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:30.990> I'm<00:00:31.109> feeling<00:00:31.349> extra<00:00:31.560> good<00:00:31.710> today

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
today but I'm feeling extra good today

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.709 
today but I'm feeling extra good today
go<00:00:32.640> ahead<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.969> kind<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.149> play<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.480> just

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
go ahead and kind of play with it just

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.330 
go ahead and kind of play with it just
work<00:00:33.899> up<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> heavy<00:00:34.649> set<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.980> three<00:00:35.219> instead

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
work up to a heavy set of three instead

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.280 
work up to a heavy set of three instead
so<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.940> might<00:00:36.059> give<00:00:36.270> people<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
so it might give people that kind of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.869 
so it might give people that kind of
leeway<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:38.129> myself<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.670> kind<00:00:38.790> of

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
leeway and get myself that kind of

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.150 
leeway and get myself that kind of
leeway<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.450> these<00:00:39.719> days<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> mix<00:00:41.070> things

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
leeway in these days just to mix things

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
leeway in these days just to mix things
up<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.700> make<00:00:41.820> sure<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.270> you're<00:00:42.480> feeling<00:00:42.930> good

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
up and make sure if you're feeling good

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.869 
up and make sure if you're feeling good
you<00:00:43.200> take<00:00:43.379> advantage<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.730> way<00:00:44.820> if

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
you take advantage of it and that way if

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.130 
you take advantage of it and that way if
you're<00:00:45.000> not<00:00:45.090> feeling<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.480> good<00:00:45.629> you'd<00:00:45.840> still

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
you're not feeling so good you'd still

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.660 
you're not feeling so good you'd still
with<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> percentage<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.160> what<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.489> hit

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
with it a percentage of what you can hit

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520 
with it a percentage of what you can hit
so<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> hope<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.270> makes<00:00:48.450> sense<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.200> doesn't

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so I hope that makes sense if it doesn't

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.690 
so I hope that makes sense if it doesn't
we'll<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.920> go<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.100> gym<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
we'll just go in the gym and see what I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.010 
we'll just go in the gym and see what I
do<00:00:50.760> I'll<00:00:51.000> probably<00:00:51.030> fail<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.809> just

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
do I'll probably fail because I just

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.360 
do I'll probably fail because I just
said<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.199> felt<00:00:52.440> good<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.620> was<00:00:52.800> gonna<00:00:52.920> hit<00:00:53.070> better

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
said I felt good I was gonna hit better

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.010 
said I felt good I was gonna hit better
than<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.360> there's<00:00:54.629> only<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
than that but there's only one way to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.229 
than that but there's only one way to
find<00:00:55.260> out<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.739> tape<00:00:55.949> will<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:56.309> lie<00:00:56.520> enable

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
find out the tape will not lie enable

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
find out the tape will not lie enable
the<00:00:57.300> bar<00:00:57.510> let's<00:00:57.840> go<00:00:57.960> inside<00:00:58.280> alright<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> sit

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the bar let's go inside alright so I sit

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.979 
the bar let's go inside alright so I sit
in<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.850> car<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.390> gonna<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.840> bit

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
in the car this is gonna be a little bit

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.450 
in the car this is gonna be a little bit
of<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> play<00:01:01.350> around<00:01:01.559> day<00:01:01.829> working<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
of a play around day working up to a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.219 
of a play around day working up to a
heavy<00:01:02.730> set<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.090> three<00:01:03.329> rather<00:01:03.570> than<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:03.960> for

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
heavy set of three rather than do for

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.170 
heavy set of three rather than do for
forty<00:01:04.559> four<00:01:04.710> five<00:01:04.920> sets<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> three<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.119> the

forty four five sets of three and the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.609 
forty four five sets of three and the
reason<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.570> doing<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> because<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.380> want

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
reason I'm doing this is because I want

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.950 
reason I'm doing this is because I want
to<00:01:07.710> give<00:01:07.799> myself<00:01:07.979> some<00:01:08.310> leeway<00:01:08.790> now<00:01:09.510> initially

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
to give myself some leeway now initially

to give myself some leeway now initially
this<00:01:10.110> was<00:01:10.290> supposed<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.650> 80<00:01:10.920> percent<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.549> my

this was supposed to be 80 percent of my

this was supposed to be 80 percent of my

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
one rep max which for this first phase

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.410 
one rep max which for this first phase
of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> program<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.220> set<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> lower<00:01:15.030> number

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420

of<00:01:15.710> 550<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.460> trying<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.820> rebuild

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
of 550 but I'm really trying to rebuild

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
of 550 but I'm really trying to rebuild
myself<00:01:18.420> after<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.049> injury<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.439> want<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.680> come

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
myself after this injury I want to come

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.530 
myself after this injury I want to come
back<00:01:19.860> stronger<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.640> build<00:01:20.939> strength<00:01:21.240> more

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
back stronger so build strength more

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
back stronger so build strength more
than<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> test<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:22.830> my<00:01:22.950> second

than I want to test it I see my second

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.030 
than I want to test it I see my second
set<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.960> 455<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.009> I

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
set here of 455 and that's really what I

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.230 
set here of 455 and that's really what I
want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> accomplish<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.790> program

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
want to accomplish with this program

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.359 
want to accomplish with this program
give<00:01:27.479> myself<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.080> ability<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:28.770> dynamic

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
give myself the ability to be dynamic

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
give myself the ability to be dynamic
meaning<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.030> come<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.960> want<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.480 
meaning that if I come in and I want to
hit<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> certain<00:01:31.680> weight<00:01:31.860> or<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.340> push

myself I have that option the same thing

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.230 
myself I have that option the same thing
being<00:01:35.070> said<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.700> program<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
being said the way my program is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.999 
being said the way my program is
currently<00:01:36.450> set<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.290> phase<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.770> two

days<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.790> day<00:01:39.000> off<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.780> being<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> case

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
days on one day off that being the case

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.660 
days on one day off that being the case
you're<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> same

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you're not going to have the same

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.280 
you're not going to have the same
workout<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> same<00:01:42.600> day<00:01:42.840> each<00:01:43.049> week

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
meaning that today is a deadlift day but

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.060 
meaning that today is a deadlift day but
because<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> days<00:01:46.140> off<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.829> how<00:01:46.890> they

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that because in the past if I've missed

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.749 
that because in the past if I've missed
a<00:01:54.930> certain<00:01:55.229> workout<00:01:55.649> I'd<00:01:56.040> kind<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.460> throw<00:01:56.670> off

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
those workouts were really regimented in

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
those workouts were really regimented in
terms<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.780> percentages<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.530> gonna<00:02:01.979> give

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
terms of percentages so gonna give

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770 
terms of percentages so gonna give
myself<00:02:02.399> some<00:02:02.790> play<00:02:02.969> again<00:02:03.180> still<00:02:03.420> crafting

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
this out to see what works best if you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.510 
this out to see what works best if you
see<00:02:05.790> my<00:02:05.969> next<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.420> last<00:02:06.570> set<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.810> 5<00:02:07.049> 15<00:02:07.560> 4<00:02:07.829> 3<00:02:08.099> the

see my next to last set of 5 15 4 3 the
poles<00:02:08.759> felt<00:02:09.060> fairly<00:02:09.300> strong<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.869> was<00:02:09.959> kind<00:02:10.170> of

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
poles felt fairly strong I was kind of

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.059 
poles felt fairly strong I was kind of
feeling<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.709> little

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
feeling it a little

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.890 
feeling it a little
in<00:02:11.280> my<00:02:11.459> right<00:02:11.730> groin<00:02:12.000> from<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.450> squats<00:02:12.750> the

in my right groin from the squats the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.360 
in my right groin from the squats the
other<00:02:13.019> day<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.769> I<00:02:13.799> didn't<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.129> want<00:02:14.340> to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
other day so I didn't really want to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.610 
other day so I didn't really want to
push<00:02:14.579> myself<00:02:14.760> too<00:02:15.180> hard<00:02:15.209> decide<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.109> do<00:02:16.260> my<00:02:16.379> Mac

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
push myself too hard decide to do my Mac

push myself too hard decide to do my Mac
set<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:17.280> at<00:02:17.540> 5:45<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> set<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.170> three<00:02:19.260> and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
set here at 5:45 for a set of three and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.280 
set here at 5:45 for a set of three and
this<00:02:20.189> moves<00:02:20.489> really<00:02:20.909> really<00:02:21.120> slowly<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:21.840> it

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
this moves really really slowly but it

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.800 
this moves really really slowly but it
moves<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.010> that's<00:02:23.670> really<00:02:24.000> all<00:02:24.359> that<00:02:24.390> counts

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
moves and that's really all that counts

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.750 
moves and that's really all that counts
in<00:02:24.900> my<00:02:24.989> opinion<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.409> got<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.739> reps<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.219> felt<00:02:26.609> good

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
in my opinion I got the reps I felt good

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.130 
in my opinion I got the reps I felt good
I<00:02:26.819> felt<00:02:27.150> accomplished<00:02:27.629> on<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.780> strength

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
I felt accomplished on the strength

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.929 
I felt accomplished on the strength
training<00:02:28.319> day<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.890> think<00:02:29.220> that's<00:02:29.400> exactly<00:02:29.549> what

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
training day I think that's exactly what

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.420 
training day I think that's exactly what
I<00:02:30.120> did<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.840> worked<00:02:31.439> up<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> heavy<00:02:31.950> set<00:02:32.159> like<00:02:32.340> I

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
I did so worked up to a heavy set like I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.160 
I did so worked up to a heavy set like I
said<00:02:32.609> here<00:02:32.819> five<00:02:33.090> forty<00:02:33.390> five<00:02:33.420> four<00:02:34.140> three

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
said here five forty five four three

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.309 
said here five forty five four three
slow<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.670> still<00:02:35.909> good<00:02:36.180> need<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.989> work<00:02:37.109> on<00:02:37.230> that

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
slow but still good need to work on that

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.530 
slow but still good need to work on that
explosiveness<00:02:37.920> no<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.849> last<00:02:39.150> couple<00:02:39.420> of
