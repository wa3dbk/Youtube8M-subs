an offset as this really helpful for you
slices<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:55.809> tends<00:00:56.019> to<00:00:56.080> reduce<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.530> slice

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
slices it tends to reduce the slice

slices it tends to reduce the slice
we'll<00:00:56.949> talk<00:00:57.070> more<00:00:57.220> about<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:57.430> later<00:00:57.610> but

these and I've hit quite a few now is
how<00:01:08.049> high<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.890> ball<00:01:09.070> goes<00:01:09.400> which<00:01:09.729> is

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
how high the ball goes which is

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.090 
how high the ball goes which is
fantastic<00:01:10.440> callaway<00:01:11.440> have<00:01:11.560> been<00:01:11.740> quite

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.230 
fantastic callaway have been quite
clever<00:01:12.340> with<00:01:12.580> what<00:01:12.729> they've<00:01:12.880> done<00:01:13.000> with<00:01:13.119> the

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
clever with what they've done with the

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.140 
clever with what they've done with the
salt<00:01:13.479> is<00:01:13.659> wider<00:01:14.350> broader<00:01:14.920> than<00:01:15.220> than<00:01:15.729> normal

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
salt is wider broader than than normal

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.820 
salt is wider broader than than normal
and<00:01:16.540> what<00:01:16.659> that's<00:01:16.840> allowed<00:01:16.990> them<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.350> do<00:01:17.619> is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
and what that's allowed them to do is

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.190 
and what that's allowed them to do is
move<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.190> center<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.610> gravity<00:01:18.760> away<00:01:19.270> from<00:01:19.869> the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
move the center of gravity away from the

move the center of gravity away from the
club<00:01:20.409> face<00:01:20.619> they've<00:01:20.860> also<00:01:21.040> made<00:01:21.790> it<00:01:21.970> deeper<00:01:22.600> as

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
club face they've also made it deeper as

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.350 
club face they've also made it deeper as
well<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.440> consequently<00:01:23.920> get<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.549> lovely<00:01:24.970> high

one<00:01:29.049> thing<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:29.290> also<00:01:29.439> get<00:01:29.740> with<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:29.950> cask<00:01:30.159> up

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
one thing you also get with the cask up

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.420 
one thing you also get with the cask up
is<00:01:30.580> very<00:01:30.850> often<00:01:31.690> a<00:01:31.780> shootie<00:01:32.410> kind<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.220> flight

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
is very often a shootie kind of flight

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.150 
is very often a shootie kind of flight
now<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:34.030> PVD<00:01:34.660> finish<00:01:34.690> actually<00:01:35.320> dampens<00:01:35.800> that

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
now the PVD finish actually dampens that

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.090 
now the PVD finish actually dampens that
slightly<00:01:36.430> so<00:01:36.640> that's<00:01:36.820> slightly<00:01:37.270> less<00:01:37.480> than<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
slightly so that's slightly less than a

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.200 
slightly so that's slightly less than a
normal<00:01:39.430> car<00:01:39.610> set<00:01:39.940> which<00:01:40.120> is<00:01:40.300> good<00:01:40.860> last<00:01:41.860> thing

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
normal car set which is good last thing

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.080 
normal car set which is good last thing
the<00:01:43.210> offset<00:01:43.660> now<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.530> tends<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:45.040> reduce<00:01:45.790> a

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
the offset now that tends to reduce a

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.810 
the offset now that tends to reduce a
slice<00:01:46.690> a<00:01:47.020> little<00:01:47.200> bit<00:01:47.470> what<00:01:47.980> it<00:01:48.070> does<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.610> sets

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
slice a little bit what it does it sets

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.970 
slice a little bit what it does it sets
the<00:01:48.970> hands<00:01:49.360> forward<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.260> this<00:01:50.530> fashion

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
the hands forward in this fashion

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.850 
the hands forward in this fashion
and<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.520> enables<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.270> golfer<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.380> swing<00:01:53.620> more

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
and it enables a golfer to swing more

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.310 
and it enables a golfer to swing more

the inside the foot would point over to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
the wards a left post then you get that

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.930 
the wards a left post then you get that
draw<00:02:01.870> spin<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:02.950> offset<00:02:03.460> would

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
draw spin so this offset would

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.050 
draw spin so this offset would
definitely<00:02:04.330> help<00:02:04.480> reduce<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.650> slice

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.860

now if you're in the mid to high

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.570 
now if you're in the mid to high
handicap<00:02:12.380> range<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.890> need<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.370> know<00:02:13.550> that

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
have to say I struggled to do that a

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.690 
have to say I struggled to do that a
little<00:03:27.440> bit<00:03:27.590> one<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.100> features<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.430> this

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
little bit one of the features of this

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.640 
little bit one of the features of this
club<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:29.300> don't<00:03:29.600> get<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.380> much

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
club is that you don't get that much

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.640 
club is that you don't get that much
size<00:03:31.310> bit<00:03:31.640> not<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:32.720> good<00:03:32.870> for<00:03:32.989> me<00:03:33.110> could<00:03:33.620> be

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
size bit not so good for me could be
