there<00:00:24.769> it's<00:00:25.769> all<00:00:25.980> ready<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.400> calibrate<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
there it's all ready to calibrate and

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.839 
there it's all ready to calibrate and
then<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.650> finish<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> setup<00:00:29.250> after<00:00:29.670> that's

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
then I finish the setup after that's

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.319 
then I finish the setup after that's
done<00:00:30.260> so<00:00:31.260> we'll<00:00:31.410> turn<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.679> thing<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:32.210> get<00:00:33.210> it

want all this up won't tell you
something<00:02:56.820> here

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.940 

you<00:03:02.440> see<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.769> shadows<00:03:03.220> cast<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:03.790> not<00:03:03.970> here

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
you see the shadows cast in not here

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.530 
you see the shadows cast in not here
the<00:03:05.950> reason<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.370> casting<00:03:06.819> themselves<00:03:06.970> is

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
the reason is casting themselves is

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.369 
the reason is casting themselves is
because<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:09.220> part<00:03:09.459> this<00:03:09.670> doctor<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:11.230> low

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
because the part this doctor is the low

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.479 
because the part this doctor is the low
spot<00:03:11.769> in<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.129> road<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:13.750> road<00:03:14.349> has<00:03:14.980> got<00:03:15.250> a

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
spot in this road this road has got a

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:22.190 
spot in this road this road has got a
thin<00:03:15.849> spot<00:03:16.209> war<00:03:16.480> in<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:17.220> because<00:03:18.220> has<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.610> run

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
to be replaced with a new one because it

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.970 
to be replaced with a new one because it
was<00:06:23.830> gouged<00:06:24.250> out<00:06:24.720> we<00:06:25.720> would<00:06:25.900> have<00:06:26.050> to<00:06:26.260> match<00:06:26.620> it

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
was gouged out we would have to match it

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:48.220 
was gouged out we would have to match it
as<00:06:27.220> well

we have a nice shiny new rotor and this

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.530 
we have a nice shiny new rotor and this
mystical<00:06:56.940> drop<00:06:57.180> it<00:06:57.330> sending<00:06:57.660> this<00:06:57.840> or<00:06:58.560> pad

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540 
mystical drop it sending this or pad

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.300 
mystical drop it sending this or pad

it's<00:07:02.670> like<00:07:02.850> you<00:07:03.030> just<00:07:03.830> whistle<00:07:04.830> smooth<00:07:05.220> up

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:11.670 
that that cut finish just makes it less

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.240 
that that cut finish just makes it less

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.570 
going to have the light on run out which

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.770 
going to have the light on run out which
will<00:07:51.720> cause<00:07:51.960> uneven<00:07:52.740> runner<00:07:53.430> thickness<00:07:54.090> which

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780 
will cause uneven runner thickness which

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.490 
will cause uneven runner thickness which
in<00:07:54.990> turn<00:07:55.230> causes<00:07:55.560> break<00:07:56.010> pulsation<00:07:57.320> so<00:07:58.320> there

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 
in turn causes break pulsation so there

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.910 
in turn causes break pulsation so there
you<00:07:58.590> have<00:07:58.650> it<00:07:58.800> our<00:07:59.180> job<00:08:00.180> is<00:08:00.600> done<00:08:00.900> hope<00:08:01.740> you

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:01.920 
you have it our job is done hope you
