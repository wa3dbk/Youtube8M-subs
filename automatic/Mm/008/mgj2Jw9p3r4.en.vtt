wouldn't really go on a long walk I
don't<00:01:01.230> think<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:02.010> least<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.329> these<00:01:03.510> this

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
don't think at least not with these this

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.330 
don't think at least not with these this
dog<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.769> these<00:01:04.979> boots<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:06.950> it's<00:01:07.950> been<00:01:08.220> an

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
dog and these boots but it's been an

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.370 
dog and these boots but it's been an
endless<00:01:08.820> winter<00:01:09.450> spring<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.740> year<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:12.380> our

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
endless winter spring this year and our

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.690 
endless winter spring this year and our
yard<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.920> essentially<00:01:14.580> all<00:01:14.909> mud<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
yard is essentially all mud and the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.620 
yard is essentially all mud and the
alternative<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> boots<00:01:19.170> would<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:20.630> having

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
alternative to the boots would be having

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.300 
alternative to the boots would be having
to<00:01:21.780> wash<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.890> dogs<00:01:23.189> feet<00:01:23.970> off<00:01:24.950> every<00:01:25.950> time<00:01:26.159> you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to wash the dogs feet off every time you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.240 
to wash the dogs feet off every time you
went<00:01:26.490> outside<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> front<00:01:28.159> spin<00:01:29.159> them

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
went outside so to the front spin them

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.810 
went outside so to the front spin them
around

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:40.749 

hold<00:01:32.820> them<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:34.549> do<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.759> back<00:01:35.939> feet<00:01:39.680> such

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
hold them up and do the back feet such

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.139 
hold them up and do the back feet such
and<00:01:42.259> as<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:45.450> doesn't<00:01:46.079> take<00:01:46.530> that

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
and as you can see it doesn't take that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.359 
and as you can see it doesn't take that
long

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
long
