00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.340
 Yes. Hello everyone. 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.440
 It is Miura. 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.260
 Today, I would like to explain about this book, “Practical Writing on Clip-on,” which was released on March 26th. 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.700
 What I wrote is me and two of the Kawakami photographers written above. 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.580
 So actually, what kind of tools do you explain today? 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.760
 Such a clip-on flash. I think everyone is probably familiar, but 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.800
 I bound these things to my umbrella, 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.840
 Try putting in such box light, 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.800
 Then you can use something like a tube like this to make it look like a lightsaber, 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:53.800
 What's more, using black wool paper as a tube makes it easy to snout. 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.880
 Then, I can create a color on the background by attaching color filters of these various colors to this luminous surface. 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.900
 These things can be done in various ways. 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:15.320
 And, although this strobe is written, the name is struck like "A" or "B", 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:26.480
 This controls the group A, group B and group C with the commander to adjust the light. 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.000
 The commander is attached to the camera head. in this way. 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.960
 And by pressing the button here, things like light intensity or TTL auto of A group, B group and C group become possible here. 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.720
 First of all, this is the main light. 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.000
 This is the main light. 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.600
 I put the umbrella on the umbrella, softened the light with the atlet, and the main light. 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.180
 Next is this group B strobe. 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.780
 This lights up the fluffy part of your head and gives it a little bit of texture here. 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.400
 Then it's a bit hard to see, but I've put a C flash here, 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.720
 This C strobe has a blue filter. 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.720
 This blue filter adds a blue color to the background here. 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.740
 This will be three. 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:25.680
 Then, further, this is the same C group, this little strobe lights up here and tries to lighten up a little face. 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:35.000
 Then, although this is a reflex board, a reflex board is for receiving the light of the main and trying to put out the details of this area after all. 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.640
 Then, in this state, first, let's see how it looks from the main light. 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.060
 First, I will go from the main light. A. 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.800
 A group. This is already a single light, so it's an image where light is coming from the left. 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.900
 I will go to group B next time. 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.740
 The B group has been fluffy there. 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.600
 First turn this on. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.500
 Yes. 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:18.820
 In this photo, the light from the left of the main and the texture of the white fluffy place came out by this single light, and a little three-dimensional effect comes out. 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.240
 Furthermore, this time C. 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.160
 Try putting a blue background behind. 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.540
 Yes. 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.720
 With the light behind it, you say it's a subject or this model suddenly feels like it's coming out in front of you. 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.040
 Well, there is no problem in this condition, but one more light. 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:58.960
 The lower part of the jaw below this skin. I'm going to put a light that is bouncing on this floor as a C group, as this is a little bit more lightening. 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.720
 Yes. 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.120
 So, this is the finished photo. 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:15.380
 In this way, I use four lights in total, which will be the main light, then the hair light at the fluffy texture of the head, and then the backlight, and the shadow on this side. 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.120
 How was the practice writing? 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.980
 I think it was quite interesting. 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.320
 In fact, this book contains some of the practical writings I just described. 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.260
 After, from basics to application, lighting, strobe selection, and accessories at the end, 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.060
 It contains various information for using the clip-on flash. 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.380
 I hope you read this book and try new photos.
