inside also but it was too bright so I

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.600 
inside also but it was too bright so I
ended<00:02:30.750> up<00:02:30.870> picking<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.410> darker<00:02:31.950> color<00:02:32.190> which

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
ended up picking this darker color which

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.900 
ended up picking this darker color which
I<00:02:32.700> did<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.940> controller<00:02:33.300> in

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
and I was much happier with it so I set

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.210 
and I was much happier with it so I set
the<00:02:44.020> system<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.440> side<00:02:44.650> because<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:45.040> course

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
the system to the side because of course

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.160 
the system to the side because of course
the<00:02:45.310> control<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.970> system<00:02:46.750> don't<00:02:46.930> match

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
one if you remember the first one had

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.940 
one if you remember the first one had
black<00:03:47.850> trim<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.110> want<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.350> admit<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.620> did

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
black trim and I want to admit I did

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.320 
black trim and I want to admit I did
silver<00:03:50.340> trim<00:03:50.610> with<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:50.880> one<00:03:51.000> because<00:03:51.090> I

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
silver trim with this one because I

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.360 
silver trim with this one because I
wanted<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.260> red<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.590> really<00:03:52.830> stand<00:03:53.100> out

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
wanted the the red to really stand out

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.240 
wanted the the red to really stand out
and<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.760> think<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.090> worked<00:03:54.270> i<00:03:54.390> think<00:03:54.600> this<00:03:54.720> is

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
and I think it worked i think this is

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.050 
and I think it worked i think this is
better<00:03:56.250> than<00:03:56.550> that<00:03:56.910> one<00:03:57.090> was<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:59.060> think

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
better than that one was and I think

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:18.250 
better than that one was and I think
that's<00:04:00.240> saying<00:04:00.600> something<00:04:00.740> so<00:04:02.390> look
