00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:19.490

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.770
 how to for the atx it is so extreme 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.360
 Hot here only plays for the recording 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.509
 I would not manage otherwise 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.970
 is to be found I would go to bed 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.220
 lie and just want it that way was then 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.710
 partly I have the team pull something 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.890
 hinkriegt because my mind, I have 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.130
 admit 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.579

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.670

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.300
 time purchase 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.300
 I wanted to get a little bit 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.650
 goes through that the people in the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.060
 heat can rip off, I wonder 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.770
 that I think I can find lukas 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.210
 even with the pc fan trick would have to 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.870
 actually higher not filled that 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:05.470
 two times out but that's so hard 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:08.180
 From there comes quite good could raushauen 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.259
 at some point is enough heated 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.259
 to darken the sun 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.119
 Do not you get out and I'm ahead of you 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.810
 to protect the sun 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:23.740
 and shortened you thought that was 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 It's really difficult for gamer 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.819
 age is the same as many towels 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.159
 I already sucked full with sweat 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:47.210
 already to 50 liters or crass one 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:49.100
 annoying me is outside 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.110
 I would have come to the sgx 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.920
 nothing done as far as I am 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.920
 just did not do anything 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.340
 the marten stand age needs my 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:08.920
 whole place if you because of you 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:13.640
 It could be a technical stock exchange 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:21.470
 it's more popular shit on you 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:23.720
 bad jokes it is so it is now 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:30.110
 The shock george is disappearing here 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:41.269
 So what's the last resort 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:43.340
 yes, we too with here again torment 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.980
 at germania borne the next moment 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.180
 I'll go somewhere else 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.870
 and I know that every time I say it 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.870
 is that I'm more artificial dreamer 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:22.829

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:23.879

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.980
 have so much water I think I think 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.269
 There is a lottery ticket 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.419
 Do not get a bottle of water from you 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:49.109
 because I met no chris then 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:50.430
 I would have to sell everything in order 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:04:01.250

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:03.599
