 Buddha Seconik use various 8 d 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.500
 This exposure meter is a cat meat exposure meter this place luxury 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.300
 Part that receives light 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.300

 Well, you are a flat dove fan 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.550
 Since the students sudden the things of society is what you are simulating a subject If you take a planar body 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.829
 And 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:48.190
 You can use the plane two factory format of 200 say that if you take the ratio of the exposure 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.829
 Normally when light is shining like this 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.540
 We use as two high grade

 1.8 1 Bunishi at that time of 30 minutes when the ISO 100, which is called here we go 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.010
 Is the indicated value 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.570
 With 20 suke

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.250
 You can see people who are facing this child luxury to the camera 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.540
 But this time one strong spotting 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.960
 There is no component as environmental light to say that this is a shadow 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.140
 At the time of this kind of wind condition is 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.979
 Two luxury 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:49.180
 I will measure a little towards the light 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:49.720
 This means that the old character in the class simulates the light hitting this object 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.850
 I will 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:58.180
 Because it simulates how the light strikes 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.540
 While facing the light and the face of the class 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.820
 In such a state that it looks to the camera 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:13.570
