is<00:01:51.689> good<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.650> that's<00:01:53.250> some<00:01:54.150> of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> reason<00:01:54.659> but

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
is good so that's some of the reason but

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.550 
is good so that's some of the reason but
um<00:01:55.909> other<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> want<00:01:57.960> scientific

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
um other like if you want scientific

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.410 
um other like if you want scientific
technical<00:01:59.070> reasons<00:01:59.610> why<00:01:59.759> manami<00:02:00.119> grains

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
technical reasons why manami grains

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.890 
technical reasons why manami grains
there<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> lot<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> them<00:02:02.060> they've<00:02:03.060> won<00:02:03.450> they

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
there are a lot of them they've won they

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.749 
there are a lot of them they've won they
don't<00:02:04.080> contain<00:02:04.380> anything<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:05.040> them<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
don't contain anything in them that you

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.789 
don't contain anything in them that you
can't<00:02:06.030> get<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.450> other<00:02:06.750> foods<00:02:07.110> such<00:02:07.770> as

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
can't get in other foods such as

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.219 
can't get in other foods such as
vegetables<00:02:08.489> or<00:02:08.640> meat<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.420> there's<00:02:09.690> kind<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.170> no

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
vegetables or meat so there's kind of no

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.229 
vegetables or meat so there's kind of no
reason<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.890> if<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> good<00:02:11.700> source<00:02:12.000> of

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
reason to if you have a good source of

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.030 
reason to if you have a good source of
vegetables<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.900> meats<00:02:13.050> if<00:02:13.260> not<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.830> need

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
vegetables and meats if not and you need

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.120 
vegetables and meats if not and you need
calories<00:02:14.340> obviously<00:02:15.209> their<00:02:15.420> grades<00:02:15.720> are<00:02:16.130> a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
calories obviously their grades are a

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.870 
calories obviously their grades are a
way<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.880> get<00:02:18.209> calories<00:02:18.480> because<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:20.700> know<00:02:20.819> you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
way to get calories because you know you

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.120 
way to get calories because you know you
need<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.209> eat<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.569> live<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:22.170> if<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.739> good

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
need to eat to live but if you have good

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.850 
need to eat to live but if you have good
sources<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.550> vegetables<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.120> each<00:02:24.209> i<00:02:24.420> do<00:02:24.860> then

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
sources of vegetables in each i do then

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.949 
sources of vegetables in each i do then
that's<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.910> better<00:02:27.300> place<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.720> get<00:02:27.840> your

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
that's a better place to get your

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.630 
that's a better place to get your
nutrients<00:02:30.019> grains<00:02:31.019> contain<00:02:31.380> things<00:02:32.310> called

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
nutrients grains contain things called

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.949 
nutrients grains contain things called
anti<00:02:33.030> nutrients<00:02:33.540> such<00:02:33.660> as<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:34.080> lectins<00:02:34.680> and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
phytates and gluten which i'm sure a lot

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.400 
phytates and gluten which i'm sure a lot
of<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.180> know<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> lot<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.870> people<00:02:39.959> are<00:02:40.200> allergic

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
of you know a lot of people are allergic

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.039 
of you know a lot of people are allergic
to<00:02:40.650> gluten<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> lot<00:02:42.269> of<00:02:42.300> problems

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
to gluten and have a lot of problems

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.300 
to gluten and have a lot of problems
even<00:02:43.230> they're<00:02:43.500> not<00:02:43.590> allergic<00:02:43.830> they<00:02:44.190> have

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
even they're not allergic they have

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.640 
even they're not allergic they have
problems<00:02:44.790> trying<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> digest<00:02:45.299> gluten<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.620> a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
problems trying to digest gluten so a

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.900 
problems trying to digest gluten so a
lot<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:46.950> grains<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.340> them<00:02:47.519> some<00:02:47.700> grains

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
lot of grains have them some grains

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.410 
lot of grains have them some grains
don't<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.410> other<00:02:49.769> most<00:02:50.700> grains<00:02:50.940> do<00:02:51.209> have

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
don't but the other most grains do have

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.030 
don't but the other most grains do have
the<00:02:51.600> electives<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.110> anti-nutrients<00:02:52.890> to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the electives in the anti-nutrients to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.800 
the electives in the anti-nutrients to
fight<00:02:53.220> aids<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.730> what<00:02:54.239> those<00:02:54.390> are<00:02:54.630> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
fight aids and what those are is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.539 
fight aids and what those are is
basically<00:02:55.410> when<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.750> seed<00:02:58.130> because<00:02:59.130> grains<00:02:59.370> are

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
basically when a seed because grains are

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.729 
basically when a seed because grains are
see<00:02:59.790> basically<00:03:00.269> when<00:03:00.510> they're<00:03:00.660> eaten<00:03:01.140> they

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
see basically when they're eaten they

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.470 
see basically when they're eaten they
don't<00:03:02.010> want<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.280> be<00:03:02.370> digested<00:03:03.030> because<00:03:03.329> they

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
don't want to be digested because they

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.420 
don't want to be digested because they
want<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.750> come<00:03:03.989> out<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.799> animal<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.280> eats

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
want to come out of the animal that eats

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.150 
want to come out of the animal that eats
them<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.900> able<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:08.040> know

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
them and and then be able to you know

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.440 
them and and then be able to you know
grow<00:03:08.430> an<00:03:08.579> implant<00:03:08.940> that's<00:03:09.120> their<00:03:09.329> whole

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
grow an implant that's their whole

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.229 
grow an implant that's their whole
purpose<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:10.500> they<00:03:10.890> don't<00:03:11.640> want<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.850> be<00:03:11.940> eaten

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
purpose so they don't want to be eaten

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.610 
purpose so they don't want to be eaten
so<00:03:12.420> they<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.660> these<00:03:12.750> anti<00:03:13.140> nutrients<00:03:13.500> in

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
so they have these anti nutrients in

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.349 
so they have these anti nutrients in
them<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.859> keep<00:03:14.070> them<00:03:14.280> from<00:03:14.310> sprouting<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.209> your

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
them to keep them from sprouting in your

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.960 
them to keep them from sprouting in your
body<00:03:15.570> or<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:17.040> keep<00:03:17.190> them<00:03:17.340> from<00:03:17.370> sprouting<00:03:17.880> in

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
body or to keep them from sprouting in

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.550 
body or to keep them from sprouting in
general<00:03:18.359> so<00:03:18.720> when<00:03:18.870> your<00:03:18.989> body<00:03:19.140> tries<00:03:19.410> to

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
general so when your body tries to

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.050 
general so when your body tries to
digest<00:03:19.920> them<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.280> have<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.579> use<00:03:20.700> up<00:03:20.880> all<00:03:21.000> your

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
digest them it have to use up all your

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.180 
digest them it have to use up all your
enzymes<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.900> order<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.260> do<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.769> if<00:03:22.859> you<00:03:22.980> do

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
enzymes in order to do so so if you do

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.930 
enzymes in order to do so so if you do
eat<00:03:23.220> grains<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.940> way<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.180> get<00:03:24.420> rid<00:03:24.630> of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
eat grains a way to get rid of

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.370 
eat grains a way to get rid of
lessons<00:03:25.240> and<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.510> anti-nutrients<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.290> those

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
lessons and the anti-nutrients and those

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.960 
lessons and the anti-nutrients and those
kinds<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.680> things<00:03:26.800> are<00:03:27.070> just<00:03:27.340> soap<00:03:27.940> your

are in your grains and make them buy
unavailable<00:04:48.040> they<00:04:48.220> make<00:04:48.550> them<00:04:48.730> so<00:04:48.970> that<00:04:49.000> your

unavailable they make them so that your

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.180 
unavailable they make them so that your

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
body cannot take them out so can't

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.760 
body cannot take them out so can't
really<00:04:51.250> get<00:04:51.550> good<00:04:51.790> minerals<00:04:52.150> from<00:04:52.560> grains<00:04:53.560> if

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
really get good minerals from grains if

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.110 
really get good minerals from grains if
they<00:04:53.890> haven't<00:04:54.100> been<00:04:54.310> soaked<00:04:54.610> or<00:04:54.790> properly

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
they haven't been soaked or properly

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.450 
they haven't been soaked or properly
spread<00:04:55.510> if<00:04:55.840> you<00:04:55.960> sprout<00:04:56.320> or<00:04:56.500> soak<00:04:56.680> them<00:04:56.919> then

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
spread if you sprout or soak them then

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.189 
spread if you sprout or soak them then
easier<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:57.699> digest<00:04:58.030> but<00:04:58.810> there's<00:04:58.990> still<00:04:59.080> a

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
easier to digest but there's still a

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.900 
easier to digest but there's still a
really<00:04:59.590> high<00:04:59.740> source<00:05:00.009> of<00:05:00.190> carbohydrates

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
really high source of carbohydrates

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.270 
really high source of carbohydrates
which<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.419> try<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.930> not<00:05:02.229> get<00:05:02.440> too<00:05:03.009> many

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
which I try to not get too many

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.969 
which I try to not get too many
carbohydrates<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.120> my<00:05:04.360> diet<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.530> if<00:05:05.860> I

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
carbohydrates and my diet and so if I

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.809 
carbohydrates and my diet and so if I
eat<00:05:06.250> like<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.580> big<00:05:06.910> thing<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.270> kale<00:05:08.199> and<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:09.580> safe

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
eat like a big thing of kale and a safe

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.719 
eat like a big thing of kale and a safe
that's<00:05:10.210> good<00:05:10.870> but<00:05:11.770> I<00:05:11.979> don't<00:05:12.250> need<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.520> grains

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
that's good but I don't need the grains

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.070 
that's good but I don't need the grains
on<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.030> side<00:05:13.210> so<00:05:13.419> that<00:05:13.539> I'll<00:05:13.630> just<00:05:13.780> eat<00:05:13.900> more

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
on the side so that I'll just eat more

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.610 
on the side so that I'll just eat more
kale<00:05:14.940> and<00:05:15.940> there's<00:05:16.449> lots<00:05:16.599> of<00:05:16.720> butter<00:05:16.930> yes<00:05:17.620> um

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620
