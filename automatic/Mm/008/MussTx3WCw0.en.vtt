worry about saying that this is just for
girls<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.200> could<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.500> used<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.770> multiple

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
girls that could be used for multiple

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
girls that could be used for multiple
children<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.329> then<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> middle<00:01:54.960> here

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
children and then in the middle here

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.030 
children and then in the middle here
there<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.430> cool<00:01:56.939> mirror<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.890> actually

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
there is a cool mirror and it actually

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.149 
there is a cool mirror and it actually
lights<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:00.990> pop<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.860> some

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
lights up you just have to pop in some

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.660 
lights up you just have to pop in some
batteries<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.560> then<00:02:04.560> turn<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.520> off

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
batteries and then turn the on or off

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.150 
batteries and then turn the on or off
button<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.350> downfall<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.009> is

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
button on so the downfall of that is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.949 
button on so the downfall of that is
