just want to go into a few reasons why

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.209 
just want to go into a few reasons why
this<00:00:12.240> diet<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.870> extremely<00:00:13.410> unhealthy<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:14.070> not

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
this diet is extremely unhealthy for not

only herself but also for her baby so

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.720 
only herself but also for her baby so
one<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> first<00:00:17.039> reasons<00:00:17.340> why<00:00:17.460> we<00:00:17.609> know

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
one of the first reasons why we know

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.130 
one of the first reasons why we know
that<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.300> girl<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.630> going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.840> die<00:00:18.960> right

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
that this girl is going to die right

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.510 
that this girl is going to die right
away<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.590> know<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.920> bananas<00:00:20.340> are

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
away is that we know that bananas are

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.310 
away is that we know that bananas are
very<00:00:20.699> high<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:20.939> potassium<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.689> potassium<00:00:21.750> is

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
very high in potassium and potassium is

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170 
very high in potassium and potassium is
actually<00:00:22.650> very<00:00:22.830> toxic<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> body<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.000> body

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
actually very toxic to the body the body

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.700 
actually very toxic to the body the body
doesn't<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:24.630> potassium<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> body<00:00:25.350> doesn't

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
doesn't like potassium the body doesn't

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.769 
doesn't like potassium the body doesn't
use<00:00:25.830> potassium<00:00:26.300> she's<00:00:27.300> basically<00:00:27.480> going<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
use potassium she's basically going to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.870 
use potassium she's basically going to
become<00:00:27.990> hyperkalemic<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.010> she's<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
become hyperkalemic and she's going to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.330 
become hyperkalemic and she's going to
die<00:00:30.109> even<00:00:31.109> though<00:00:31.199> we've<00:00:31.349> calculated<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.099> in

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
die even though we've calculated that in

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
die even though we've calculated that in
order<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.730> basically<00:00:33.239> get<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.450> lethal<00:00:33.809> dose<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
order to basically get a lethal dose of

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.440 
order to basically get a lethal dose of
potassium<00:00:35.010> from<00:00:35.520> bananas<00:00:35.940> you'd<00:00:36.300> actually

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
potassium from bananas you'd actually

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.500 
potassium from bananas you'd actually
need<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> consume<00:00:37.110> about<00:00:37.410> 300<00:00:38.070> bananas<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.610> 30

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
need to consume about 300 bananas in 30

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.630 
need to consume about 300 bananas in 30
seconds<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> lethal<00:00:40.829> dose<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.550> if

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
seconds to get a lethal dose but if

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.060 
seconds to get a lethal dose but if
she's<00:00:41.790> eating<00:00:41.940> 10<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> 20<00:00:42.660> per<00:00:42.809> day<00:00:43.070> that

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
she's eating 10 to 20 per day that

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.010 
she's eating 10 to 20 per day that
that's<00:00:44.370> that's<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:44.969> too<00:00:45.120> much<00:00:45.270> too<00:00:45.870> many

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that's that's just too much too many

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.510 
that's that's just too much too many
bananas<00:00:46.140> another<00:00:46.710> reason<00:00:47.039> why<00:00:47.129> she's<00:00:47.340> going

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
bananas another reason why she's going

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.650 
bananas another reason why she's going
to<00:00:47.610> die<00:00:47.730> right<00:00:47.969> away<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.360> she's<00:00:48.510> not

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
to die right away is that she's not

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.590 
to die right away is that she's not
getting<00:00:48.870> enough<00:00:49.170> protein<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.219> very<00:00:50.940> very

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
getting enough protein this is very very

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.250 
getting enough protein this is very very
serious

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
serious

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.650 
serious
if<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:53.010> not<00:00:53.160> consume<00:00:53.640> enough<00:00:54.180> protein

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
if you do not consume enough protein

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.150 
if you do not consume enough protein
you're<00:00:55.020> basically<00:00:55.410> going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.770> die<00:00:55.920> because

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you're basically going to die because

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
you're basically going to die because
the<00:00:56.670> reason<00:00:56.969> why<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.360> many<00:00:57.420> people<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:57.930> dying

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the reason why so many people are dying

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.410 
the reason why so many people are dying
in<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:59.340> day<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.670> age<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.270> they're

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
in this day and age is because they're

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.630 
in this day and age is because they're
consuming<00:01:01.020> too<00:01:01.320> little<00:01:01.559> protein<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.550> they

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
consuming too little protein so they

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.039 
consuming too little protein so they
should<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.850> consuming<00:01:03.329> protein<00:01:03.510> powders

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
should be consuming protein powders

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.130 
should be consuming protein powders
bananas<00:01:04.830> only<00:01:05.489> contain<00:01:05.970> 4<00:01:06.540> percent<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.990> their

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
bananas only contain 4 percent of their

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.310 
bananas only contain 4 percent of their
calories<00:01:07.560> coming<00:01:07.979> from<00:01:08.310> protein<00:01:08.760> 4<00:01:09.689> percent

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
calories coming from protein 4 percent

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.770 
calories coming from protein 4 percent
that's<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.189> enough<00:01:11.700> even<00:01:12.330> though<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> World

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that's not enough even though the World

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
that's not enough even though the World
Health<00:01:13.020> Organization<00:01:13.799> figured<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.549> that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
Health Organization figured out that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.340 
Health Organization figured out that
humans<00:01:15.150> only<00:01:15.390> require<00:01:15.689> two<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> half

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
humans only require two and a half

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.990 
humans only require two and a half
percent<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:16.920> calories<00:01:17.250> coming<00:01:17.790> from

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
basically live healthy another reason

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
basically live healthy another reason
why<00:01:21.810> she's<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.470> die<00:01:22.619> basically<00:01:23.070> within

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
why she's going to die basically within

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.609 
why she's going to die basically within
a<00:01:23.400> few<00:01:23.610> hours<00:01:23.939> actually<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:24.720> she's<00:01:24.990> consuming

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
a few hours actually if she's consuming

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.690 
a few hours actually if she's consuming
way<00:01:26.310> too<00:01:26.909> much<00:01:27.479> sugar<00:01:28.080> too<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:28.770> sugar<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.549> all

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
way too much sugar too much sugar we all

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.789 
way too much sugar too much sugar we all
know<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.970> bananas<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.509> also<00:01:30.720> very<00:01:31.500> high<00:01:31.770> in

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
know that bananas are also very high in

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.950 
know that bananas are also very high in
sugar<00:01:32.000> even<00:01:33.000> though<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> body's<00:01:33.570> preferred

sugar even though the body's preferred

it's glucose and sugar even though we

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.170

know that eating too many bananas not

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.639 
know that eating too many bananas not
good<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.720> body<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> body

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
good for the body because the body

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.620 
good for the body because the body
doesn't<00:01:44.040> know<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:45.090> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
doesn't know what to do with all that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.300 
doesn't know what to do with all that
glucose<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.560> sugar<00:01:46.799> basically

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
glucose and all that sugar basically

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.520 
glucose and all that sugar basically
she's<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> become<00:01:48.030> diabetic<00:01:48.530> really

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
she's going to become diabetic really

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.469 
she's going to become diabetic really
really<00:01:49.829> quickly<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:50.460> she<00:01:50.700> isn't<00:01:50.820> diabetic

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
really quickly if she isn't diabetic

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.149 
really quickly if she isn't diabetic
already<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.380> means<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.680> her<00:01:52.829> baby

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
already and this means that her baby

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.590 
already and this means that her baby
it's<00:01:53.640> probably<00:01:53.939> going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.149> type<00:01:54.420> 1

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it's probably going to be type 1

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
it's probably going to be type 1
diabetic<00:01:55.110> I'm<00:01:55.380> extremely<00:01:55.890> concerned<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
diabetic I'm extremely concerned for it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.090 
diabetic I'm extremely concerned for it
because<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.630> sugar<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.439> body<00:01:58.680> doesn't

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
because all that sugar the body doesn't

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.249 
because all that sugar the body doesn't
know<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.790> do<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.810> why<00:02:01.020> when

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
know what to do with it that's why when

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.649 
know what to do with it that's why when
I<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.560> diabetics<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:02.969> them<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.329> sneaking

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
I see diabetics I see them just sneaking

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.350 
I see diabetics I see them just sneaking
in<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.950> bananas<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.640> dates<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.030> see<00:02:06.180> them

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
in in in bananas and dates I see them

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.880 
in in in bananas and dates I see them
just<00:02:06.390> sneaking<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.200> eating<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.649> all<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
just sneaking it and eating it all the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.190 
just sneaking it and eating it all the
time<00:02:08.129> that's<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.060> reason<00:02:09.479> why<00:02:09.989> they're

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
time that's the reason why they're

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.080 
time that's the reason why they're
diabetic<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:11.069> because<00:02:11.370> they're<00:02:11.819> eating

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
diabetic it's not because they're eating

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.800 
diabetic it's not because they're eating
too<00:02:12.450> many

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
too many

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.170 
too many
saturated<00:02:13.530> fats<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:13.980> too<00:02:14.430> many<00:02:14.520> processed

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
saturated fats in too many processed

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.839 
saturated fats in too many processed
foods<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.630> too<00:02:15.840> much<00:02:15.989> fast<00:02:16.380> food<00:02:16.580> that's<00:02:17.580> not

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
foods and too much fast food that's not

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.330 
foods and too much fast food that's not
the<00:02:18.060> reason<00:02:18.480> why<00:02:18.690> they're<00:02:19.319> diabetic<00:02:19.770> it's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
the reason why they're diabetic it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.089 
the reason why they're diabetic it's
because<00:02:20.970> they're<00:02:21.480> eating<00:02:21.930> fruit<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.680> I'm<00:02:22.770> very

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
because they're eating fruit so I'm very

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.309 
because they're eating fruit so I'm very
concerned<00:02:23.849> for<00:02:24.090> low<00:02:24.420> need<00:02:24.569> rain<00:02:24.750> as<00:02:24.959> well<00:02:25.170> as<00:02:25.290> a
