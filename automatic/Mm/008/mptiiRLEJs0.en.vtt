things<00:00:13.320> along<00:00:13.680> this<00:00:13.889> inside<00:00:14.460> inside<00:00:14.970> of<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
things along this inside inside of the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.470 
things along this inside inside of the
box<00:00:15.360> here<00:00:15.599> have<00:00:16.080> beat<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.850> area<00:00:18.270> out

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
box here have beat this area out

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.439 
box here have beat this area out
especially<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.440> next<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.010> door

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
especially right here next to the door

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.160 
especially right here next to the door
so<00:00:21.449> what<00:00:21.570> we<00:00:21.690> get<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:23.600> expanded<00:00:24.600> methyl<00:00:24.960> it's

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
so what we get is expanded methyl it's

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.439 
so what we get is expanded methyl it's
like<00:00:25.350> an<00:00:25.470> oil<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.949> problem<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:27.330> we're

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
like an oil can problem so what we're

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.760 
like an oil can problem so what we're
going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.600> do<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.990> we're<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.289> eliminate

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
going to do is we're going to eliminate

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.640 
going to do is we're going to eliminate
that<00:00:28.820> by<00:00:29.820> heating<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.359> steel<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:31.080> cooling<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that by heating the steel and cooling it

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.160 
that by heating the steel and cooling it
and<00:00:31.800> by<00:00:32.099> heating<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.610> including<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.690> rapidly

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and by heating it including it rapidly

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.930 
and by heating it including it rapidly
it<00:00:34.350> will<00:00:34.500> shrink<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.070> steel<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.700> time

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it will shrink the steel and time

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:59.189 
it will shrink the steel and time
tighten<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.750> out

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.079 

now<00:00:59.739> when<00:00:59.890> you're<00:01:00.010> doing<00:01:00.160> this<00:01:00.370> don't<00:01:00.760> be<00:01:00.910> too

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
now when you're doing this don't be too

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.669 
now when you're doing this don't be too
alarmed<00:01:01.210> because<00:01:01.960> what's<00:01:02.199> going<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.350> happen

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
alarmed because what's going to happen

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.270 
alarmed because what's going to happen
is<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:03.609> steel<00:01:03.969> is<00:01:04.360> going<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.750> expand<00:01:05.290> and<00:01:05.710> then

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
is the steel is going to expand and then

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.830 
is the steel is going to expand and then
it's<00:01:06.400> going<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.580> actually<00:01:07.020> make<00:01:08.020> them<00:01:08.560> give<00:01:08.830> it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it's going to actually make them give it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
it's going to actually make them give it
or<00:01:10.840> low<00:01:11.200> spot

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.070 

or<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:24.450> expand<00:01:24.840> outward<00:01:25.820> convex<00:01:26.820> Li<00:01:27.080> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
or will expand outward convex Li and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.040 
or will expand outward convex Li and
make<00:01:28.230> high<00:01:28.410> spots<00:01:29.330> but<00:01:30.330> if<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.690> it<00:01:30.840> right

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
make high spots but if you do it right

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:52.130 
make high spots but if you do it right
it<00:01:31.770> will<00:01:31.800> shrink

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.070 

using<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> soap<00:01:53.220> rag<00:01:56.390> we<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.570> cool<00:01:57.750> steel

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
using a soap rag we can cool steel

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.640 
using a soap rag we can cool steel
rapidly<00:01:58.740> rapidly<00:01:59.330> I'd<00:02:00.330> like<00:02:00.480> to<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:01.440> give<00:02:01.620> a

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
rapidly rapidly I'd like to just give a

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.710 
rapidly rapidly I'd like to just give a
bonehead<00:02:02.340> reminder<00:02:02.910> make<00:02:03.180> sure<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.540> there's

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
bonehead reminder make sure that there's

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.660 
bonehead reminder make sure that there's
nothing<00:02:03.900> flammable<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.070> other<00:02:05.190> side<00:02:05.520> of

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
nothing flammable on the other side of

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
nothing flammable on the other side of
the<00:02:05.730> wall<00:02:05.910> that<00:02:05.940> you're<00:02:06.270> coming<00:02:06.420> up

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.920 

just<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.500> little<00:02:25.620> bit<00:02:25.830> more<00:02:26.010> we're<00:02:26.220> here<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.780> now

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
just a little bit more we're here so now

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.450 
just a little bit more we're here so now
we're<00:02:31.080> getting<00:02:31.200> rid<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.740> oil<00:02:31.830> candy<00:02:32.340> you

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
we're getting rid of that oil candy you

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:40.240 
we're getting rid of that oil candy you
can<00:02:32.520> tell<00:02:32.850> because<00:02:34.310> Steel<00:02:35.310> has<00:02:38.300> expanded

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
can tell because Steel has expanded

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:49.160 
can tell because Steel has expanded
it's<00:02:40.790> mr.<00:02:41.270> point

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.930 

at<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.380> point<00:02:50.620> where<00:02:51.010> we've<00:02:51.250> got<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.550> run<00:02:51.820> on

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
at the point where we've got a run on

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.880 
at the point where we've got a run on
the<00:02:52.090> edge<00:02:52.210> of<00:02:52.450> being<00:02:52.660> shrunk<00:02:53.200> enough<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.740> make

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
the edge of being shrunk enough to make

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:09.260 
the edge of being shrunk enough to make
a<00:02:53.920> difference

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.280 

and<00:03:09.780> now<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.050> doesn't<00:03:10.290> all<00:03:10.410> can

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.330 

pretty<00:03:14.980> stiff<00:03:16.290> that's<00:03:17.290> how<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.530> do<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
pretty stiff that's how you do it the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.940 
pretty stiff that's how you do it the
other<00:03:18.370> advantage<00:03:19.000> if<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.239> want<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.110> is<00:03:20.260> when

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
other advantage if you want it is when

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.039 
other advantage if you want it is when
you<00:03:21.040> heat<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.549> steel<00:03:21.849> up<00:03:22.090> real<00:03:22.390> hot<00:03:22.659> and<00:03:22.690> then

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
you heat the steel up real hot and then

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.800 
you heat the steel up real hot and then
rapidly<00:03:23.680> cool<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.159> it<00:03:24.340> hardens<00:03:24.879> so<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.659> not

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
rapidly cool it it hardens so it's not

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.089 
rapidly cool it it hardens so it's not
as<00:03:25.930> flexible<00:03:26.170> as<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.650> was<00:03:28.560> we<00:03:29.560> can<00:03:29.739> do<00:03:29.830> just<00:03:29.860> a

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
as flexible as it was we can do just a

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.059 
as flexible as it was we can do just a
little<00:03:30.280> bit<00:03:30.370> more<00:03:30.549> up<00:03:30.640> here<00:03:31.500> but<00:03:32.500> down<00:03:32.530> here<00:03:32.950> is

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
little bit more up here but down here is

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.350 
little bit more up here but down here is
its<00:03:33.400> salt<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:36.549> we<00:03:36.640> have<00:03:36.730> just<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.030> little<00:03:37.150> low

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
its salt so we have just a little low

00:03:37.360 --> 00:04:15.250 
its salt so we have just a little low
spot<00:03:37.690> here

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.949 

a<00:04:15.290> little<00:04:15.860> more<00:04:15.980> water<00:04:16.160> would<00:04:16.370> be<00:04:16.489> good<00:04:16.639> but

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
a little more water would be good but

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.099 
a little more water would be good but
and<00:04:17.959> bring<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.230> bucket<00:04:18.440> with<00:04:18.709> me<00:04:20.109> the

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
and bring a bucket with me the

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:28.689 
and bring a bucket with me the
demonstration

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.719 

also<00:04:29.699> watch<00:04:29.850> out<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:31.460> water<00:04:32.460> doesn't

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
also watch out that the water doesn't

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.610 
also watch out that the water doesn't
scold<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.449> because<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.900> gets<00:04:34.020> really<00:04:34.139> hot<00:04:34.440> on

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
scold you because it gets really hot on

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:43.089 
scold you because it gets really hot on
the<00:04:34.710> rag<00:04:34.949> that<00:04:35.690> you're<00:04:36.690> using<00:04:39.949> there<00:04:40.949> you<00:04:41.039> go
