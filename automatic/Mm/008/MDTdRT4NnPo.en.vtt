and I've always been a huge fan of him
and<00:04:11.980> reason<00:04:12.280> why<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.690> he<00:04:13.690> used<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.380> do<00:04:14.470> like

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
and reason why is he used to do like

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.379 
and reason why is he used to do like
black<00:04:14.920> ops<00:04:15.100> videos<00:04:15.549> if<00:04:15.880> you<00:04:16.030> look<00:04:16.239> at<00:04:16.329> as

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
black ops videos if you look at as

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.330 
black ops videos if you look at as
earliest<00:04:16.750> videos<00:04:17.019> or<00:04:17.200> like<00:04:17.320> black<00:04:17.590> ops<00:04:17.799> and

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
earliest videos or like black ops and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.479 
earliest videos or like black ops and
then<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.150> see<00:04:19.329> he<00:04:19.510> uploaded<00:04:20.049> in<00:04:20.650> amnesia

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
then you see he uploaded in amnesia

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.190 
then you see he uploaded in amnesia
video<00:04:21.909> and<00:04:22.210> that's<00:04:22.479> what<00:04:22.659> started<00:04:23.050> his

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
video and that's what started his

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.870 
video and that's what started his
channel<00:04:23.560> off

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
channel off

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
channel off

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
watch my video but the thing is that I'm

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
watch my video but the thing is that I'm
trying<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.280> make<00:05:08.790> I<00:05:09.090> need<00:05:09.600> to<00:05:09.660> make<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:10.970> just

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
trying to make I need to make a just

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.100 
trying to make I need to make a just
trying<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.210> figure<00:05:12.330> out<00:05:12.420> what<00:05:12.690> that<00:05:12.720> could

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
trying to figure out what that could

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.660 
trying to figure out what that could
possibly<00:05:13.170> be<00:05:13.650> that<00:05:13.920> could<00:05:14.100> make<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.640> that

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
possibly be that could make it so that

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.690 
possibly be that could make it so that
more<00:05:15.270> people<00:05:15.780> watch<00:05:16.080> my<00:05:16.290> videos<00:05:16.370> active<00:05:17.370> so

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
more people watch my videos active so

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.760 
more people watch my videos active so
just<00:05:18.060> my<00:05:18.660> subscribers<00:05:19.140> are<00:05:19.230> more<00:05:19.350> active

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
just my subscribers are more active

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.760 
just my subscribers are more active
because<00:05:20.250> as<00:05:20.550> it<00:05:20.700> stands<00:05:20.850> right<00:05:20.970> now<00:05:21.200> um<00:05:22.200> like

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
because as it stands right now um like

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.670 
because as it stands right now um like
under<00:05:23.730> nine<00:05:24.000> percent<00:05:24.450> I<00:05:24.750> think<00:05:25.110> it's<00:05:25.320> like<00:05:25.410> six

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
under nine percent I think it's like six

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.950 
under nine percent I think it's like six
percent<00:05:26.100> as<00:05:26.280> of<00:05:26.460> right<00:05:26.580> now<00:05:26.640> was<00:05:27.600> that<00:05:27.750> one

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
percent as of right now was that one

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.390 
percent as of right now was that one
divided<00:05:28.200> by<00:05:28.230> 1/9

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
divided by 1/9

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.000 
divided by 1/9
I<00:05:30.210> think<00:05:30.630> that's<00:05:30.780> let's<00:05:31.530> look<00:05:31.680> it<00:05:31.770> up<00:05:31.800> on<00:05:31.980> a

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
I think that's let's look it up on a

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.630 
I think that's let's look it up on a
Microsoft<00:05:32.550> calculator<00:05:33.530> 1/9<00:05:35.150> that's<00:05:36.150> 11%<00:05:36.870> so<00:05:37.110> a

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
Microsoft calculator 1/9 that's 11% so a

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.520 
Microsoft calculator 1/9 that's 11% so a
long<00:05:38.640> %<00:05:38.970> of<00:05:39.060> my<00:05:39.180> subscribers<00:05:39.540> are<00:05:40.140> watching<00:05:40.470> my

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
long % of my subscribers are watching my

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.440 
long % of my subscribers are watching my
videos<00:05:40.560> so<00:05:40.950> I<00:05:41.070> have<00:05:41.430> to<00:05:41.580> change<00:05:41.820> I<00:05:42.030> got<00:05:42.210> turned

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450
