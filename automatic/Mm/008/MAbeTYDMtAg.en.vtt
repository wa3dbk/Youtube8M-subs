00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
your cheese's you don't want to

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.950 
your cheese's you don't want to
overcrowd<00:02:43.970> your<00:02:44.240> platter<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.750> want<00:02:44.900> to

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
reason for this is so that when your

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.300 
reason for this is so that when your
desks<00:02:48.260> are<00:02:48.350> cutting<00:02:48.650> their<00:02:48.680> not<00:02:48.950> sticking

their knuckles in other cheeses and it

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.710 
their knuckles in other cheeses and it
just<00:02:51.710> becomes<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.100> big<00:02:52.250> mess<00:02:52.460> you<00:02:53.270> also<00:02:53.420> want<00:02:53.540> to

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
just becomes a big mess you also want to

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.780 
just becomes a big mess you also want to
try<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.930> use<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.170> different<00:02:54.350> night<00:02:55.130> for<00:02:55.610> each

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.580 
try to use a different night for each
cheese<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.570> you're<00:02:56.660> not<00:02:56.690> mixing<00:02:57.200> all<00:02:57.470> of

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590
