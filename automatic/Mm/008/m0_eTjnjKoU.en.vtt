00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
pipe this is a way of having an overflow

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.030 
pipe this is a way of having an overflow
and<00:00:11.309> being<00:00:12.179> very<00:00:12.389> quiet<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
and being very quiet this is a this is

and being very quiet this is a this is
this<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.370> used<00:00:14.670> for<00:00:14.940> like<00:00:15.030> an<00:00:15.150> overflow<00:00:15.599> where

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
this is used for like an overflow where

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.189 
this is used for like an overflow where
it<00:00:16.590> would<00:00:16.740> come<00:00:16.949> out<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.850> bottom<00:00:18.300> like<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
it would come out the bottom like the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.140 
it would come out the bottom like the
water<00:00:19.680> flow<00:00:19.949> at<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> bottom<00:00:20.520> where<00:00:21.000> that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
water flow at the bottom where that

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.679 
water flow at the bottom where that
square<00:00:21.480> would<00:00:21.570> be<00:00:21.600> drilled<00:00:21.960> or<00:00:22.199> maybe<00:00:22.680> even

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
square would be drilled or maybe even

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.330 
square would be drilled or maybe even
the<00:00:24.689> side<00:00:24.960> really<00:00:25.350> low<00:00:25.500> down<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:26.010> not<00:00:26.189> sure

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the side really low down I'm not sure

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.950 
the side really low down I'm not sure
when<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.550> would<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.730> used<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.180> there<00:00:27.810> always

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
when that would be used but there always

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.859 
when that would be used but there always
could<00:00:28.230> be<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> chance<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.220> used<00:00:29.630> I'll<00:00:30.630> just

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
could be a chance to be used I'll just

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
pieces are dimensions to the size if

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.889 
pieces are dimensions to the size if
you're<00:00:50.629> actual<00:00:50.899> like<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.920> your<00:00:52.670> whole<00:00:52.940> inside

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
you're actual like a your whole inside

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.340 
you're actual like a your whole inside
your<00:00:54.170> your<00:00:55.239> main<00:00:56.239> display<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:56.869> like<00:00:57.170> whatever

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
your your main display so like whatever

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.869 
your your main display so like whatever
your<00:00:57.530> bulkhead<00:00:57.890> fitting<00:00:58.190> sizes<00:00:58.609> you're<00:00:58.760> going

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
your bulkhead fitting sizes you're going

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.939 
your bulkhead fitting sizes you're going
to<00:00:58.940> get<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.239> same<00:00:59.449> size<00:00:59.989> fitting<00:01:00.530> line<00:01:00.710> in

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
to get the same size fitting line in

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.639 
to get the same size fitting line in
this<00:01:01.280> case<00:01:01.339> is<00:01:01.699> 1.5<00:01:02.180> inch<00:01:03.039> so<00:01:05.170> this<00:01:06.170> is<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.380> tea

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
this case is 1.5 inch so this is a tea

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.690 
this case is 1.5 inch so this is a tea
really<00:01:07.640> simple<00:01:08.860> it's<00:01:09.860> one<00:01:10.250> part<00:01:10.460> you're<00:01:10.580> going

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
really simple it's one part you're going

really simple it's one part you're going
to<00:01:10.759> need<00:01:11.560> another<00:01:12.560> part<00:01:12.979> is<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.159> 90<00:01:13.460> degree

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
to need another part is a 90 degree

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.749 
to need another part is a 90 degree
angle<00:01:13.759> one<00:01:14.630> with<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.869> small<00:01:15.500> angle<00:01:16.069> so<00:01:16.369> it<00:01:16.490> fits

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
angle one with a small angle so it fits

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.190 
angle one with a small angle so it fits
inside<00:01:16.970> this<00:01:17.240> tea<00:01:17.530> snugly<00:01:18.530> like<00:01:18.649> this<00:01:20.200> like

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
inside this tea snugly like this like

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.640 
inside this tea snugly like this like
that<00:01:21.229> there<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.740> go

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.780 

other<00:01:25.650> piece<00:01:25.830> you're<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> need<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.490> its

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
other piece you're going to need is its

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.480 
other piece you're going to need is its
top<00:01:27.420> top<00:01:28.200> cap<00:01:28.470> you're<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> need<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
top top cap you're going to need to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.100 
top top cap you're going to need to
drill<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:29.820> hole<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.360> that's<00:01:30.960> so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
drill a little hole in here that's so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560 
drill a little hole in here that's so
the<00:01:31.229> water<00:01:31.409> our<00:01:32.130> air<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.729> allowed<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:32.970> flow<00:01:33.390> in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the water our air is allowed to flow in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.240 
the water our air is allowed to flow in
so<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:33.960> complete<00:01:34.350> siphon<00:01:34.799> because

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so it's not a complete siphon because

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.859 
so it's not a complete siphon because
it's<00:01:35.340> complete<00:01:35.700> siphon<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.210> something<00:01:36.509> crap

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
it's complete siphon and something crap

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.679 
it's complete siphon and something crap
and<00:01:37.049> stops<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.799> siphon<00:01:38.189> it'll<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.450> flow

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
and stops the siphon it'll just not flow

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.920 
and stops the siphon it'll just not flow
out<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.049> you'll<00:01:40.310> overflow<00:01:41.310> your<00:01:41.930> main

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
out and you'll overflow your main

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.590 
out and you'll overflow your main
display<00:01:43.170> from<00:01:43.560> your<00:01:43.710> sump<00:01:44.330> also<00:01:45.330> it's

I'll<00:03:33.100> just<00:03:33.280> block<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.670> screws<00:03:34.030> okay<00:03:34.650> we're

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
I'll just block the screws okay we're

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.560 
I'll just block the screws okay we're
not<00:03:35.740> seeing<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.280> out<00:03:36.400> now<00:03:37.060> hold<00:03:37.330> it<00:03:37.450> for<00:03:37.540> a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
not seeing it out now hold it for a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.410 
not seeing it out now hold it for a
second<00:03:38.490> that<00:03:39.490> start<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.760> siphon<00:03:40.090> out<00:03:40.150> really

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
second that start to siphon out really

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.699 
second that start to siphon out really
quickly

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.610 

right<00:03:43.250> there

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.300 

that's<00:03:48.190> thought<00:03:48.430> they<00:03:48.730> actually

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.760 

it's<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.819> way<00:03:54.940> I've<00:03:55.120> shown<00:03:55.209> how<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.750> do<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.319> so

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
it's the way I've shown how to do it so

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.350 
it's the way I've shown how to do it so
now<00:03:56.860> this<00:03:57.069> is<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> if<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:58.000> don't<00:03:58.180> have<00:03:58.270> that

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
now this is a if you don't have that

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.059 
now this is a if you don't have that
hole<00:03:58.569> this<00:03:58.720> is<00:03:58.780> what<00:03:59.020> is<00:03:59.260> really<00:03:59.500> mimic<00:03:59.860> a

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
hole this is what is really mimic a

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.949 
hole this is what is really mimic a
siphon<00:04:00.790> block<00:04:01.000> you<00:04:01.150> can<00:04:01.270> see<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.780> water

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
siphon block you can see that the water

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.610 
siphon block you can see that the water
is<00:04:02.260> creeping<00:04:03.100> up<00:04:03.190> now<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:04.620> almost

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
is creeping up now and almost

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.130 
is creeping up now and almost
overflowing<00:04:06.360> that's<00:04:07.360> my<00:04:07.510> name<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.870> look<00:04:08.050> at

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
overflowing that's my name is I look at

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
overflowing that's my name is I look at
almost<00:04:09.010> creeping<00:04:09.340> up<00:04:09.459> over<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.819> side

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
almost creeping up over the side

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.090 
almost creeping up over the side
I<00:04:12.190> like<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.940> now<00:04:13.360> it's<00:04:13.540> like<00:04:13.690> almost<00:04:14.100> build

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
I like that now it's like almost build

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.820 
I like that now it's like almost build
over<00:04:15.310> it's<00:04:15.850> going<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.120> leak<00:04:16.290> now<00:04:17.290> it'll<00:04:17.560> go<00:04:17.590> out

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
over it's going to leak now it'll go out

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.740 
over it's going to leak now it'll go out
again<00:04:18.330> and<00:04:19.330> they'll<00:04:19.480> return<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.260> its<00:04:20.470> natural

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
again and they'll return to its natural

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.280 
again and they'll return to its natural
water<00:04:22.750> level<00:04:24.420> there<00:04:25.420> yeah<00:04:25.540> that's<00:04:25.960> why<00:04:26.170> you

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
water level there yeah that's why you

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.080 
water level there yeah that's why you
need<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.500> little<00:04:26.920> hole<00:04:27.040> on<00:04:27.190> there<00:04:27.400> that's

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
need that little hole on there that's

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.209 
need that little hole on there that's
absolutely<00:04:28.600> essential

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:32.219 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.919 

also<00:04:32.939> in<00:04:32.999> this<00:04:33.089> little<00:04:33.300> area<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.779> run<00:04:34.709> my<00:04:34.949> heater

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:35.929 
also in this little area I run my heater

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:38.379 
also in this little area I run my heater
which<00:04:36.929> is<00:04:37.080> good

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
which is good

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.730 
which is good
that's<00:04:38.990> good

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.890 

okay<00:04:46.740> think<00:04:47.730> about<00:04:47.820> sums<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.390> up<00:04:48.510> that's<00:04:48.780> how

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
okay think about sums it up that's how

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.830 
okay think about sums it up that's how
you're<00:04:49.200> so<00:04:49.350> standpipe<00:04:49.850> works<00:04:50.850> there's<00:04:51.690> other

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
you're so standpipe works there's other

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
you're so standpipe works there's other
options<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.500> do

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
options to do

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.070 
options to do
that's<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.400> chose<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.880> one<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.180> chose<00:04:54.420> it's

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
that's to chose the one I chose it's

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.490 
that's to chose the one I chose it's
most<00:04:55.260> easiest<00:04:55.620> because<00:04:55.920> all<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:57.410> thing<00:04:58.410> you

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
most easiest because all the thing you

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.710 
most easiest because all the thing you
need<00:04:58.650> buyers<00:04:58.890> from<00:04:59.670> the<00:04:59.910> local<00:05:00.600> hardware

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
need buyers from the local hardware

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.290 
need buyers from the local hardware
store<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.520> usually<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.760> usually<00:05:02.910> have<00:05:03.270> a

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
store and usually you usually have a

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.740 
store and usually you usually have a
easy<00:05:04.140> bulkhead<00:05:04.680> fitting<00:05:05.040> for<00:05:05.250> your<00:05:05.750> overflow

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
easy bulkhead fitting for your overflow

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.960 
easy bulkhead fitting for your overflow
so<00:05:07.050> it's<00:05:07.740> use<00:05:07.890> like<00:05:08.100> 3/4<00:05:08.700> if<00:05:08.790> you<00:05:08.850> have<00:05:08.940> a

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
so it's use like 3/4 if you have a

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.420 
so it's use like 3/4 if you have a
really<00:05:09.120> small<00:05:09.270> tank<00:05:09.600> 1.5<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:10.800> sometimes<00:05:11.130> two

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
really small tank 1.5 and sometimes two

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.150 
really small tank 1.5 and sometimes two
point<00:05:11.670> or<00:05:12.180> two<00:05:12.450> I'm<00:05:12.810> really<00:05:13.320> large<00:05:13.530> 90<00:05:13.950> gallon

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
point or two I'm really large 90 gallon

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.570 
point or two I'm really large 90 gallon
systems<00:05:14.520> and<00:05:14.820> such<00:05:15.330> like<00:05:15.480> that<00:05:16.280> one<00:05:17.280> way<00:05:17.400> 5

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
systems and such like that one way 5

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.850 
systems and such like that one way 5
gallons<00:05:17.880> should<00:05:18.030> be<00:05:18.120> really<00:05:18.360> good<00:05:18.510> for<00:05:18.810> 30<00:05:19.380> to

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
gallons should be really good for 30 to

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.310 
gallons should be really good for 30 to
about<00:05:20.580> 90<00:05:21.060> then<00:05:21.210> if<00:05:21.330> you're<00:05:21.450> if<00:05:21.570> you're<00:05:22.290> going

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
about 90 then if you're if you're going

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.850

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
to have a high gallons per hour return

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.740 
to have a high gallons per hour return
pump<00:05:26.130> you're<00:05:26.490> going<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:26.700> want<00:05:26.880> to<00:05:26.970> get<00:05:27.330> maybe<00:05:27.630> a
