00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello here olivier rolland and welcome 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.069
 in this new video in which 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.700
 I will share with you a tip 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.679
 super simple to have free internet 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.910
 in upscale hotels because 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.679
 I think it's a practice 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.540
 sorry but there are a lot of hotels 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.449
 high end that tend like that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.090
 to charge the internet either 5,10 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.279
 sometimes more than 2 dollars a day 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.480
 to have internet before it's like 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.180
 usually are free to receive 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.800
 for free so well my 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.269
 Zen book and happy by clicking on the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.189
 cover that appears there or on the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.050
 link that appears here or by going on 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.540
 Olivier thiery role in pointe and vestas 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.920
 zen so what is this trick all 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.020
 simple and you will be able to apply 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.239
 the next time you go in 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 a hotel like that ben me what am I doing 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.020
 in general here I go to the reception 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 and when I am told I always ask 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.829
 is the internet included and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.420
 when I am told ah no no it is necessary 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.289
 must pay for internet 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.539
 I look at the person like that and I 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.260
 say, do I have to pay for 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.070
 electricity 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.409
 so here is this simple sentence in 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.909
 general of the blow the person makes himself said 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.110
 wow no you did not pay for 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.850
 electricity she says herself ah yeah 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.640
 it's true we do not pay for 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.170
 electricity then for him it's true 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.430
 that it is also indispensable 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.869
 electricity so that's it but the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.549
 a good person in a good 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.189
 provision in relation to you this is 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.110
 pretty funny and it's efficient so 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.150
 sometimes and well the person will tell you 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 ok ok bah I offer it directly to you 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.820
 works well in the United States in particular 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.100
 since they have a sense of service 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.040
 client who is pretty strong enough otherwise 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.780
 do not hesitate right after you say 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.270
 because here you are doing paper for 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.439
 then electricity is what I 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.210
 see why I repeat for the internet 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.829
 for me it's as indispensable as 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.200
 electricity for me in addition I can 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.430
 to say that I have business on the internet and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.649
 that it's really important 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.670
 then after I say so what is it 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.920
 what you can offer 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.079
 and it's still pretty rare that the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.399
 nobody says no because for his 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.880
 hotels finally there is always a 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.140
 margin of negotiations and 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.390
 here it is easter and it is not a 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.350
 extravagant demand then good the good 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.820
 new is that there is less 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.829
 less hotel that practices it me 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.329
 find it really scandalous to do 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.280
 pay internet today that's I 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.450
 come on when I started asking this 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.849
 question I mean it was not at the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.140
 Funny I really ask myself for 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.610
 all they charge internet why 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.230
 not to pay electricity also finally 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.580
 for me it's part of the package when 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.890
 we go to a hotel and it's 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.450
 completely absurd to charge 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.000
 internet by the way when hotels 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.250
 refused in general and well I my notes 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.900
 which is less important on good 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.560
 tripadvisor or expedia because I 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.130
 find it a practice 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.019
 scandalous 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.910
 here is in any case do not hesitate to test 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.010
 this the next time it happens to you 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.840
 and you will tell me news and then 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.670
 way you have nothing to lose then that 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.500
 makes a great challenge for those 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.790
 you who are a little shy and who 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.580
 have never negotiated in their life or 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.959
 for whom it is a little bit 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.819
 something that makes them nervous 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.380
