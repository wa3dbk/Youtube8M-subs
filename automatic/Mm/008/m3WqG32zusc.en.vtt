platinum<00:00:55.879> it<00:00:56.879> isn't<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.239> hard<00:00:57.600> don't<00:00:58.260> think

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
platinum it isn't that hard don't think

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.950 
platinum it isn't that hard don't think
that<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.760> can't<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.660> every

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that is you can't do this with every

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.779 
that is you can't do this with every
single<00:01:00.989> speck<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:01.980> speck<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.460> don't

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
single speck the one speck I don't

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.640 
single speck the one speck I don't
recommend<00:01:03.059> doing<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.960> probably<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
recommend doing this and probably it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.440 
recommend doing this and probably it
doesn't<00:01:04.890> even<00:01:05.129> work<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> rates

easily sometimes you have taken a little
distance<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.470> take<00:01:16.650> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
distance for it but you have to take it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
distance for it but you have to take it
for<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.640> fall<00:01:17.970> people<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.479> believe<00:01:18.659> me

and half two hour or something but

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.630 
and half two hour or something but
sometimes<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> retry<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.220> twenty

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640

to thirty times just to get one part
level<00:01:34.799> fifty<00:01:35.210> just<00:01:36.210> depends<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.600> how<00:01:36.689> lucky

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
