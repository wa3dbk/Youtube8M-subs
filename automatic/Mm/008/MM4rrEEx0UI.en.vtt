one hit to the rockslide even if it has

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.140 
one hit to the rockslide even if it has
a<00:04:28.090> sash<00:04:28.419> because<00:04:28.690> of<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.870> sandstorm<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.700> go

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
a sash because of the sandstorm so I go

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.600 
a sash because of the sandstorm so I go
for<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.390> light<00:04:31.540> screen<00:04:31.840> now<00:04:32.220> because<00:04:33.220> just<00:04:33.520> in

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
for a light screen now because just in

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.070 
for a light screen now because just in
case<00:04:33.760> chuckle<00:04:34.060> dies<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.480> get<00:04:34.630> that<00:04:34.750> extra<00:04:34.930> bit

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
case chuckle dies I get that extra bit

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.440 
case chuckle dies I get that extra bit
of<00:04:35.140> special<00:04:35.530> defense<00:04:35.800> but<00:04:36.550> he<00:04:36.580> just<00:04:37.030> gives<00:04:37.240> up

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
of special defense but he just gives up

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.210 
of special defense but he just gives up
which<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:37.960> suppose<00:04:38.290> it's<00:04:38.500> understandable

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
which I suppose it's understandable

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.210 
which I suppose it's understandable
because<00:04:39.400> my<00:04:40.120> shaco<00:04:40.620> was<00:04:41.620> probably<00:04:42.010> going<00:04:42.100> to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
because my shaco was probably going to

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.130 
because my shaco was probably going to
one<00:04:42.370> shot<00:04:42.610> both<00:04:42.790> of<00:04:42.820> them<00:04:43.090> anyway<00:04:43.419> I<00:04:43.630> kind<00:04:44.110> of

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
one shot both of them anyway I kind of

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.450 
one shot both of them anyway I kind of
wish<00:04:44.290> she<00:04:44.380> hadn't<00:04:44.650> given<00:04:44.740> up<00:04:44.980> though<00:04:45.190> just<00:04:45.430> so

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
wish she hadn't given up though just so

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.740 
wish she hadn't given up though just so
I<00:04:45.550> could<00:04:45.730> have<00:04:45.970> gone<00:04:46.120> through<00:04:46.390> with<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.630> whole

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
I could have gone through with the whole

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.400 
I could have gone through with the whole
battle<00:04:47.169> but<00:04:47.890> whatever<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:49.660> can<00:04:49.870> kind<00:04:50.350> of

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
battle but whatever you can kind of

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.679 
battle but whatever you can kind of
predict<00:04:50.770> how<00:04:51.010> it<00:04:51.190> out<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.580> how<00:04:51.729> it<00:04:51.940> goes

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:52.689 
predict how it out of how it goes
