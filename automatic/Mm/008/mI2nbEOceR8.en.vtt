00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:04.170
 quality that we have 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:08.570

 is next to me is no reason to leave 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.300
 while beyond pleasure with nothing 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.300
 to hide anything 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.890

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.890
 message iphone iphone 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.210
 as you can see it lets us synchronize the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.860
 of our iphone and if we do it from the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.860
 erased everything we have divisions 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 so 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.259
 life on this but the 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.409
 coincidences experiences and what I do 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.569
 is to see what they will sleep like 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.539
 addicted to dream stones in the heyday 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.670
 of the routine everything is for the money everything 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.129
 it's for the family everything is worth nothing 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.510
 when the end approaches and it's better to 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.620
 smile and know with which you have 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.159
 [Music] 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.159

 and we could be called 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.880
 it's called itunes 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.060
 It is an energy plant 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.909
 a scorching settler that generates heat 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.720
 for everyone to the extra that leads to the street 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.480

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.340
 [Music] 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.980
 The method sector is positive 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.610
 wants strength 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.690
 three large and stronger 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.840

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.840
 pay big while woman 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.620
 the night 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.620
 two 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.580
 emotion 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.800
 with your desk 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.850
 [Music] 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.960
 tonight 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.420
 system files for laziness 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.400
 and does not follow much 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.400
 for example here I am going to import 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.030
 let's see 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.240
 with this girl 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.479
 and we are going to 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.479
 [Music] 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.220
 [Music] 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.650
 and in keeping our assets 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.020
 tell me what it takes to make your days 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.440
 so you can show joy and thank 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.560
 day by day you're alive maybe life 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.780
 is one and they are not born for pleasure but 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.280
 many times there are everywhere 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.560
 pilgrims the health and well - being of their 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.990
 brothers people who want and always 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.850
 they shake your hand 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.950
 what's wrong I cried nothing if the 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.290
 motive is that he wands his eyes for 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.690
 forget about a day if you live in the 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.300
 fear I have a trial you did not know how to overcome 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.640
 that today we are what we do joke 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.500
 get up if you fall down that of the 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.780
 you will not defend 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.780
 you can move the sun but not cover it 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.430
 If you have smoke, I have another neighborhood and 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.530
 I continue to look at myself and against two 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:26.950
 we are the same only with you and me 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.950
 I guess tomorrow not on safe road 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:41.530
 a little safer walks at a steady pace 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.530
 of the road you are only your people 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.569
 life is as short as second I 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.430
 transports a trance I do not care 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:55.409
 say I love you with a floor and 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.409
 unfortunately nothing is how I want 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:13.130
 [Music] 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.130
 we are going 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.680
 only me 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:38.550
 and we 're going
