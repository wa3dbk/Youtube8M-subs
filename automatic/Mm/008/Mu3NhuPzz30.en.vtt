00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.039 
i'm not sure what is called mountain i
guess<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:11.040> over<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:11.610> these<00:01:11.909> locations<00:01:12.900> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
guess but over all these locations that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.840 
guess but over all these locations that
you're<00:01:13.260> really<00:01:13.439> similar<00:01:13.790> portrait<00:01:14.790> i

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you're really similar portrait i

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.580 
you're really similar portrait i
couldn't<00:01:15.090> find<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> best<00:01:15.570> picture<00:01:15.990> tool<00:01:16.259> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
couldn't find the best picture tool I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.039 
couldn't find the best picture tool I
guess<00:01:16.979> sum<00:01:17.340> them<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.720> can't

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
guess sum them all up but I can't

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.090 
guess sum them all up but I can't
guarantee<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.470> they're<00:01:19.740> actually<00:01:19.890> really

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
guarantee that they're actually really

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.290 
guarantee that they're actually really
similar

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.180 

so<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.900> next<00:01:27.020> location<00:01:27.260> is<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.800> Los<00:01:27.980> Santos

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
so the next location is the Los Santos

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.100 
so the next location is the Los Santos
Gun<00:01:28.580> Club<00:01:28.760> which<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.450> obviously<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.810> place

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
Gun Club which is obviously the place

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.110 
Gun Club which is obviously the place
where<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:30.380> buy<00:01:30.620> all<00:01:30.770> of<00:01:30.800> our<00:01:30.980> weapons<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.430> TT<00:01:31.850> 5

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
where we buy all of our weapons in TT 5

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.360 
where we buy all of our weapons in TT 5
so<00:01:32.660> I<00:01:32.720> literally<00:01:33.020> everything<00:01:33.410> is<00:01:33.710> everybody

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370

goes spends all the money but it's

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.360

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.200 
similar and as you can see the size of
each<00:01:44.960> building<00:01:45.380> look<00:01:45.620> quite<00:01:46.070> similar<00:01:46.310> but<00:01:46.640> I

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
each building look quite similar but I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.060 
each building look quite similar but I
guess<00:01:47.420> it's<00:01:47.750> of<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:48.050> rage<00:01:48.260> in<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.590> difference<00:01:48.950> of

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
guess it's of a rage in a difference of

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.530 
guess it's of a rage in a difference of
way<00:01:49.280> like<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.610> doors<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:49.940> different<00:01:50.360> place

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
way like the doors in different place

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.570 
way like the doors in different place
but<00:01:51.200> if<00:01:51.440> you<00:01:51.560> put<00:01:51.770> them<00:01:51.890> all<00:01:51.980> together<00:01:52.130> like<00:01:52.460> if

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
but if you put them all together like if

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.620 
but if you put them all together like if
you<00:01:52.670> flatten<00:01:52.880> them<00:01:53.120> out<00:01:53.210> they<00:01:53.420> would<00:01:53.510> look

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
you flatten them out they would look

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.930 
you flatten them out they would look
pretty<00:01:53.870> similar<00:01:54.140> now<00:01:54.980> the<00:01:55.040> elegant<00:01:55.640> club<00:01:55.820> is

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
pretty similar now the elegant club is

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.120 
pretty similar now the elegant club is
similar<00:01:56.420> interior<00:01:57.020> design<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.560> LS<00:01:57.920> gun

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
similar interior design to the LS gun

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.310 
similar interior design to the LS gun
club<00:01:58.340> as<00:01:58.490> where<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.570> guns<00:01:59.780> can<00:01:59.930> be<00:01:59.960> go<00:02:00.110> live<00:02:00.290> a

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
club as where the guns can be go live a

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.930 
club as where the guns can be go live a
little<00:02:00.530> place<00:02:00.890> where<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.430> we've<00:02:01.550> gathered

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
little place where the we've gathered

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.030 
little place where the we've gathered
behind<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.420> counter<00:02:02.600> that's<00:02:03.380> actually<00:02:03.770> really

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
behind a counter that's actually really

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.190 
behind a counter that's actually really
similar<00:02:04.370> now<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.660> reason<00:02:05.810> for<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.050> is

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
similar now the reason for that is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.390 
similar now the reason for that is
because<00:02:06.230> the<00:02:06.470> guns<00:02:06.800> are<00:02:06.980> actually<00:02:07.280> on<00:02:07.370> the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
because the guns are actually on the

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.060 
because the guns are actually on the
wall<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.910> there's<00:02:08.270> also<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.570> glass<00:02:08.869> box<00:02:09.170> with

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
wall and there's also the glass box with

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.230 
wall and there's also the glass box with
the<00:02:10.100> gun<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.490> decide<00:02:10.730> which<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:10.940> can<00:02:11.060> see

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
the gun to decide which you can see

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.300 
the gun to decide which you can see
through<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.600> bit<00:02:11.840> like<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.470> ls<00:02:12.860> cookbook

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
through it a bit like in the ls cookbook

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.310 
through it a bit like in the ls cookbook
as<00:02:14.120> also<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.450> shooting<00:02:14.870> range<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.200> the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
as also the shooting range and the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.900 
as also the shooting range and the
shooting<00:02:15.650> range<00:02:15.680> looks<00:02:16.160> very<00:02:16.370> similar<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.760> the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
shooting range looks very similar to the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.050 
shooting range looks very similar to the
LA<00:02:17.510> gun<00:02:17.810> full<00:02:17.990> of<00:02:18.050> shooting<00:02:18.470> range<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.060> recent

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
LA gun full of shooting range and recent

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.370 
LA gun full of shooting range and recent
that's<00:02:20.210> because<00:02:20.450> like<00:02:20.690> they're<00:02:20.930> all<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.170> sort

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
that's because like they're all in sort

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.510 
that's because like they're all in sort
of<00:02:21.440> similar<00:02:21.710> kind<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.070> line<00:02:22.190> they're<00:02:22.340> all<00:02:22.430> in

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
of similar kind of line they're all in

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.670 
of similar kind of line they're all in
like<00:02:22.610> stalls<00:02:23.000> all<00:02:23.660> go<00:02:23.960> in<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.140> silver<00:02:24.410> gets

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
like stalls all go in the silver gets

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.920 
like stalls all go in the silver gets
the<00:02:24.800> same<00:02:25.010> direction<00:02:25.220> it's<00:02:26.210> also<00:02:26.420> basically

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
the same direction it's also basically

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.660 
the same direction it's also basically
laid<00:02:27.320> out<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.740> same<00:02:28.010> kind<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.280> weight<00:02:28.460> and

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
laid out in the same kind of weight and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.790 
laid out in the same kind of weight and
I<00:02:29.210> quite<00:02:29.420> like<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.110> if<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.410> guys<00:02:30.560> didn't

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
I quite like that and if you guys didn't

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.229 
I quite like that and if you guys didn't
actually<00:02:30.890> know<00:02:31.190> there's<00:02:31.640> only<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:32.180> think

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
actually know there's only I think

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.930 
actually know there's only I think
there's<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.750> two<00:02:33.050> two<00:02:33.739> or<00:02:33.890> three<00:02:34.130> Los<00:02:34.640> Santos

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
there's a two two or three Los Santos

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.970 
there's a two two or three Los Santos
gun<00:02:35.360> clubs<00:02:35.660> which<00:02:35.840> actually<00:02:36.020> have<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:36.739> kind

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
gun clubs which actually have this kind

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.760 
gun clubs which actually have this kind
of<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.370> guess<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.270> kind<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.540> way<00:02:38.690> one<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.650> them

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
of I guess this kind of way one of them

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.340 
of I guess this kind of way one of them
being<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.310> where<00:02:41.090> it's<00:02:41.420> basically<00:02:41.930> just

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
being this where it's basically just

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.550 
being this where it's basically just
like<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.120> gun<00:02:44.330> store<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:44.900> looking<00:02:45.170> another

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
like a the gun store but looking another

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.500 
like a the gun store but looking another
fit<00:02:45.770> onto<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.190> if<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.700> guys<00:02:46.850> didn't<00:02:47.150> know<00:02:47.180> that

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
fit onto it if you guys didn't know that

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.390 
fit onto it if you guys didn't know that
imagine<00:02:48.350> what<00:02:48.440> if<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.620> will<00:02:48.770> but<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.280> know

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
imagine what if you will but you know

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.490 
imagine what if you will but you know
but<00:02:49.910> over<00:02:50.180> all<00:02:50.239> these<00:02:50.660> buildings<00:02:50.930> actually

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
but over all these buildings actually

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.110 
but over all these buildings actually
really<00:02:51.830> similar<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.370> i<00:02:52.910> would<00:02:53.030> actually

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
really similar and i would actually

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.580 
really similar and i would actually
never<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.630> known<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.080> elif's<00:02:54.440> gun

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
never have known that the elif's gun

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.440 
never have known that the elif's gun
club<00:02:54.830> was<00:02:55.040> actually<00:02:55.310> bracing<00:02:55.610> for<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> LA<00:02:56.000> jun

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
club was actually bracing for the LA jun

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.600 
club was actually bracing for the LA jun

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
foot

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.520 
foot
so<00:02:59.610> flat<00:02:59.790> last<00:02:59.939> location<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.840> fun<00:03:01.019> Preston

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
so flat last location is the fun Preston

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.740 
so flat last location is the fun Preston
Burke<00:03:01.680> hotel<00:03:02.129> which<00:03:02.579> is<00:03:02.700> located<00:03:02.849> in<00:03:03.359> vinewood

Burke hotel which is located in vinewood
Boulevard<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.409> this<00:03:05.040> building<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.430> actually

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
Boulevard and this building is actually

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.190 
Boulevard and this building is actually
based<00:03:05.819> on<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.209> Roosevelt<00:03:06.659> Hotel<00:03:06.719> which<00:03:07.170> is

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
based on the Roosevelt Hotel which is

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.530 
based on the Roosevelt Hotel which is
located<00:03:07.439> in<00:03:07.799> hollywood<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.370> both<00:03:09.060> buildings

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
located in hollywood and both buildings

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.140 
located in hollywood and both buildings
are<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.109> similar<00:03:10.439> is<00:03:10.680> actually<00:03:10.709> unreal<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.730> mean

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
are so similar is actually unreal I mean

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.789 
are so similar is actually unreal I mean
they're<00:03:12.329> exactly<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.840> same<00:03:12.930> as<00:03:13.260> shape<00:03:13.469> kind

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
they're exactly the same as shape kind

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.860 
they're exactly the same as shape kind
of<00:03:13.859> I<00:03:14.099> guess<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.450> weather<00:03:15.599> so<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.750> mean

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
of I guess so like the weather so I mean

that this was actually based at the
river<00:03:53.549> hotel<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:54.180> mean<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.689> pretty<00:03:54.989> cool<00:03:55.139> to
