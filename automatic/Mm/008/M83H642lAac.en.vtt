good<00:00:08.510> morning<00:00:08.990> folks<00:00:09.260> were<00:00:09.559> starting<00:00:09.980> once

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
good morning folks were starting once

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.129 
good morning folks were starting once
again<00:00:10.519> with<00:00:10.700> the<00:00:10.820> um<00:00:10.969> Berlin<00:00:11.420> mezzo<00:00:11.690> spot

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
again with the um Berlin mezzo spot

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.369 
again with the um Berlin mezzo spot

still and calm of a star needing a nap

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.870 
still and calm of a star needing a nap
but<00:00:18.350> there<00:00:18.529> is<00:00:18.680> still<00:00:18.830> plenty<00:00:19.160> to<00:00:19.340> discuss

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
but there is still plenty to discuss

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.730 
but there is still plenty to discuss
and<00:00:20.180> start<00:00:20.510> with<00:00:20.630> space<00:00:20.930> weather<00:00:20.960> as<00:00:21.410> always

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
and start with space weather as always

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.439 
and start with space weather as always
where<00:00:21.920> we<00:00:22.010> find<00:00:22.279> solar<00:00:22.550> flaring<00:00:22.970> still<00:00:23.240> down

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
where we find solar flaring still down

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.419 
where we find solar flaring still down
in<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.660> dumps<00:00:23.869> even<00:00:24.289> with<00:00:24.439> some<00:00:24.619> new<00:00:24.830> spots<00:00:25.160> on

in the dumps even with some new spots on

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.999 
in the dumps even with some new spots on
the<00:00:25.580> disk<00:00:25.820> growth<00:00:26.630> has<00:00:26.929> all<00:00:27.140> but<00:00:27.320> halted<00:00:27.829> and

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
the disk growth has all but halted and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.819 
the disk growth has all but halted and
magnetic<00:00:28.849> complexity<00:00:29.539> has<00:00:29.869> not<00:00:30.109> changed<00:00:30.589> much

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
magnetic complexity has not changed much

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.950 
magnetic complexity has not changed much
since<00:00:30.859> yesterday<00:00:31.669> let's<00:00:32.450> move<00:00:32.660> on<00:00:32.840> to

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
since yesterday let's move on to

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.930 
since yesterday let's move on to
something<00:00:33.410> that<00:00:33.440> isn't<00:00:33.800> allegedly<00:00:34.550> real

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
something that isn't allegedly real

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.900 
something that isn't allegedly real
folks<00:00:35.750> there<00:00:36.230> are<00:00:36.350> planned<00:00:36.650> sto<00:00:37.220> maneuvers

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
folks there are planned sto maneuvers

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.000 
folks there are planned sto maneuvers
and<00:00:38.090> then<00:00:38.300> there<00:00:38.660> are<00:00:38.810> space<00:00:39.230> quakes<00:00:39.620> where<00:00:39.920> it

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
and then there are space quakes where it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.560 
and then there are space quakes where it
looks<00:00:40.219> like<00:00:40.280> a<00:00:40.399> wave<00:00:40.730> just<00:00:41.059> hit<00:00:41.359> the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
looks like a wave just hit the

spacecraft briefly and while the
official<00:00:44.210> science<00:00:44.660> says<00:00:44.930> it's<00:00:45.199> not<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.559> solar

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
official science says it's not the solar

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.110 
official science says it's not the solar
wind<00:00:46.399> doing<00:00:46.820> it

wind doing it

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.229 
wind doing it
I<00:00:47.149> can<00:00:47.780> peg<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.050> solar<00:00:48.440> wind<00:00:48.769> shift<00:00:49.129> to<00:00:49.250> everyone

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
I can peg a solar wind shift to everyone

I can peg a solar wind shift to everyone
I've<00:00:50.510> ever<00:00:50.809> seen<00:00:51.289> the<00:00:52.070> one<00:00:52.250> yesterday<00:00:52.519> was

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
I've ever seen the one yesterday was

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.180 
I've ever seen the one yesterday was
around<00:00:53.120> 1500<00:00:54.050> UTC<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.829> that's<00:00:54.949> when<00:00:55.160> a

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
around 1500 UTC and that's when a

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.819 
around 1500 UTC and that's when a
density<00:00:55.789> shock<00:00:56.059> wave<00:00:56.329> swept<00:00:56.750> past<00:00:56.780> our<00:00:57.289> planet

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
density shock wave swept past our planet

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.979 
density shock wave swept past our planet
it<00:00:58.280> was<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.640> leading<00:00:58.850> edge<00:00:59.179> of<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.480> coronal

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
it was the leading edge of a coronal

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.630 
it was the leading edge of a coronal
hole<00:01:00.140> stream<00:01:00.469> where<00:01:00.679> slower<00:01:01.010> particles

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
hole stream where slower particles

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.459 
hole stream where slower particles
bunched<00:01:02.030> up<00:01:02.149> on<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:02.510> bow<00:01:02.660> shock<00:01:02.960> leaving<00:01:03.379> the

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
bunched up on the bow shock leaving the

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
faster particles perfect time match here

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.820 
faster particles perfect time match here
as<00:01:06.680> always<00:01:07.550> now<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.690> stream<00:01:08.990> isn't<00:01:09.350> too<00:01:09.500> fast

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
as always now the stream isn't too fast

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.130 
as always now the stream isn't too fast
so<00:01:10.160> despite<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.580> signature<00:01:11.299> of<00:01:11.329> impact<00:01:11.960> in

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
so despite the signature of impact in

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.350 
so despite the signature of impact in
the<00:01:12.229> electron<00:01:12.650> flux<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.159> magnetometer<00:01:13.670> we

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360

saw<00:01:14.540> no<00:01:14.840> magnetic<00:01:15.320> storms<00:01:15.860> just<00:01:16.159> some

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
saw no magnetic storms just some

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.520 
saw no magnetic storms just some
instability<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.210> minor<00:01:17.450> satellite<00:01:18.049> charging

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
instability and minor satellite charging

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.130 
instability and minor satellite charging
hazards<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.759> coronal<00:01:20.270> hole<00:01:20.450> is<00:01:20.630> moving<00:01:20.960> on

hazards the coronal hole is moving on

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.340 
hazards the coronal hole is moving on
now<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.460> are<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.000> planets<00:01:23.479> earthquake

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350
