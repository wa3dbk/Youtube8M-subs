that<00:01:43.570> they're<00:01:43.719> just<00:01:43.869> not<00:01:43.990> registering<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.679> me

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
that they're just not registering to me

at<00:01:44.859> all<00:01:45.039> I've<00:01:45.369> got<00:01:45.780> quite<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.929> light<00:01:47.350> steering

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
at all I've got quite a light steering

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.649 
at all I've got quite a light steering
rack<00:01:47.950> but<00:01:48.159> very<00:01:48.520> direct<00:01:48.999> and<00:01:49.179> I<00:01:49.270> have<00:01:49.390> got<00:01:49.539> some

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
fill coming back through it so that's

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.190 
fill coming back through it so that's
important<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.569> moment<00:01:52.840> i<00:01:52.899> tipped<00:01:53.140> the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
current is little chicane here I've got

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.919 
current is little chicane here I've got
quite<00:01:56.109> a<00:01:56.140> lot<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.679> initial<00:01:57.159> roll<00:01:57.460> but<00:01:58.450> as<00:01:58.600> the

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
quite a lot of initial roll but as the

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.719 
quite a lot of initial roll but as the
car<00:01:59.170> takes<00:01:59.469> the<00:01:59.619> compression<00:02:00.130> on<00:02:00.219> that<00:02:00.399> corner

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
car takes the compression on that corner

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.700 
car takes the compression on that corner
that's<00:02:01.030> rolling<00:02:01.359> you<00:02:01.960> feel<00:02:02.170> some<00:02:02.350> support

coming through and that's the hydraulic

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.170

yeah<00:02:06.870> interesting<00:02:07.500> I've<00:02:07.650> got<00:02:07.830> quite<00:02:07.980> a<00:02:08.100> soft

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
yeah interesting I've got quite a soft

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.430 
yeah interesting I've got quite a soft
car<00:02:08.940> at<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.240> moment<00:02:09.600> because<00:02:09.929> I've<00:02:10.050> got<00:02:10.259> no

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
car at the moment because I've got no

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.400 
car at the moment because I've got no
role<00:02:10.649> sniffles<00:02:11.039> everything<00:02:11.340> set<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.730> normal

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
role sniffles everything set to normal

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.330 
role sniffles everything set to normal
powertrain<00:02:13.410> feels<00:02:13.680> quite<00:02:13.860> order<00:02:14.160> at<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
powertrain feels quite order at the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.070 
powertrain feels quite order at the
moment<00:02:14.610> I've<00:02:14.700> not<00:02:14.910> got<00:02:15.060> much<00:02:15.090> noise<00:02:15.510> doesn't

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
moment I've not got much noise doesn't

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.930 
moment I've not got much noise doesn't
really<00:02:16.290> sound<00:02:16.470> like<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.740> v8<00:02:17.010> throttle<00:02:17.910> response

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
really sound like a v8 throttle response

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.360 
really sound like a v8 throttle response
is<00:02:18.420> quite<00:02:18.840> lazy<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.010> doesn't<00:02:20.190> want<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
is quite lazy and it doesn't want to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.230 
is quite lazy and it doesn't want to
kick<00:02:20.520> down

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.200 

so<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.900> changed<00:02:26.290> from<00:02:26.470> active<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:28.000> i'm<00:02:28.090> going

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
so I changed from active and i'm going

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.840 
so I changed from active and i'm going
to<00:02:28.270> move<00:02:28.420> from<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.960> normal<00:02:29.230> setting<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.860> sport

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
to move from the normal setting to sport

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.290 
to move from the normal setting to sport
in<00:02:31.480> both<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.620> i'm<00:02:32.740> going<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.890> have<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.310> manual

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
in both and i'm going to have a manual

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.220 
in both and i'm going to have a manual
gear<00:02:34.660> change<00:02:34.990> now<00:02:35.260> let's<00:02:36.220> try<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:37.230> now

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
gear change now let's try that now

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.320 
gear change now let's try that now
immediately<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:39.190> powertrain<00:02:39.520> sounds

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
immediately the powertrain sounds

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.000 
immediately the powertrain sounds
different<00:02:40.750> I've<00:02:40.900> got<00:02:41.080> more<00:02:41.320> induction<00:02:41.650> noise

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
different I've got more induction noise

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.730 
different I've got more induction noise
and<00:02:42.610> I've<00:02:42.700> got<00:02:43.020> very<00:02:44.020> different<00:02:44.440> throttle

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
and I've got very different throttle

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.020 
and I've got very different throttle
response<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.640> course<00:02:45.790> I'm<00:02:45.910> now

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
response and of course I'm now

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.200 
response and of course I'm now
controlling<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.690> gearbox<00:02:47.050> manually

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
controlling the gearbox manually

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.460 
controlling the gearbox manually
steering<00:02:49.210> doesn't<00:02:49.810> feel<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> whole<00:02:50.410> lot

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
steering doesn't feel a whole lot

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.230 
steering doesn't feel a whole lot
different<00:02:50.770> but<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.310> can<00:02:51.490> feel<00:02:51.700> immediately

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
different but you can feel immediately

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.110 
different but you can feel immediately
there's<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.870> level<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.200> support<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.830> yeah<00:02:54.490> get

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
there's a level of support and yeah get

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.550 
there's a level of support and yeah get
that<00:02:55.150> engine<00:02:55.360> noise<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.960> am<00:02:56.520> got<00:02:57.520> it<00:02:57.700> fast<00:02:58.560> still

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
that engine noise I am got it fast still

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.260 
that engine noise I am got it fast still
not<00:02:59.770> that<00:03:00.040> aggressive<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.670> mean<00:03:00.700> this<00:03:00.910> does<00:03:01.090> not

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
not that aggressive I mean this does not

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.720 
not that aggressive I mean this does not
feel<00:03:01.600> like<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.870> 45<00:03:02.230> out<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.590> moment<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.670> is

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
feel like a 45 out of the moment this is

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.400 
feel like a 45 out of the moment this is
interesting<00:03:04.330> now<00:03:04.480> with<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.690> roll<00:03:04.990> stiffness

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
interesting now with the roll stiffness

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.610 
interesting now with the roll stiffness
of<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.830> car<00:03:06.210> I've<00:03:07.210> still<00:03:07.600> got<00:03:07.870> an<00:03:08.140> amazingly

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
of the car I've still got an amazingly

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.010 
of the car I've still got an amazingly
compliant<00:03:09.310> ride<00:03:09.550> over<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.390> bumps<00:03:10.720> down<00:03:10.840> the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
compliant ride over the bumps down the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.780 
compliant ride over the bumps down the
straights<00:03:11.350> at<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.920> moment<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.190> pitch<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.550> car

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
straights at the moment I pitch the car

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.150 
straights at the moment I pitch the car
in<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.180> can<00:03:13.420> actually<00:03:13.570> feel<00:03:14.110> all<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.500> support

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
in I can actually feel all that support

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.809 
in I can actually feel all that support
coming<00:03:15.550> up

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
coming up

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.660 
coming up
I've<00:03:17.810> definitely<00:03:18.140> got<00:03:18.560> more<00:03:18.950> flipping

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
I've definitely got more flipping

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.390 
I've definitely got more flipping
allowed<00:03:19.939> by<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.239> chassis<00:03:20.829> so<00:03:21.829> what<00:03:21.980> Carl<00:03:22.219> have

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
allowed by the chassis so what Carl have

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.670 
allowed by the chassis so what Carl have
I<00:03:22.519> got<00:03:22.730> at<00:03:22.909> the<00:03:22.969> moment<00:03:22.999> then<00:03:23.389> in<00:03:23.540> in<00:03:23.840> in<00:03:24.109> sport

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
I got at the moment then in in in sport

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.319 
I got at the moment then in in in sport
mode<00:03:24.799> with<00:03:25.129> the<00:03:25.159> manual<00:03:25.430> gearbox<00:03:25.790> I'd<00:03:26.030> say

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
mode with the manual gearbox I'd say

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.860 
mode with the manual gearbox I'd say
I've<00:03:26.480> got<00:03:27.760> something<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:28.999> approximates<00:03:29.239> to

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
I've got something that approximates to

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.860 
I've got something that approximates to
us<00:03:30.049> sort<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.409> normal<00:03:30.889> 430<00:03:31.790> Ferrari<00:03:32.389> that's

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
us sort of a normal 430 Ferrari that's

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.959 
us sort of a normal 430 Ferrari that's
what<00:03:32.989> I'd<00:03:33.109> say<00:03:33.319> but<00:03:33.799> with<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.340> lot<00:03:34.579> more<00:03:34.609> ride

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:34.969 
what I'd say but with a lot more ride

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.179 
what I'd say but with a lot more ride
company<00:03:35.389> with<00:03:35.510> an<00:03:35.599> ability<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.799> go<00:03:36.950> over

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:37.189 
company with an ability to to go over

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.429 
company with an ability to to go over
bumps<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.670> you<00:03:37.790> wouldn't<00:03:38.060> believe<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:39.079> now

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 
bumps that you wouldn't believe so now

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.030 
bumps that you wouldn't believe so now
let's<00:03:39.859> go<00:03:40.189> into<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:42.079> last<00:03:42.680> mode<00:03:42.889> which<00:03:43.010> is

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
let's go into the last mode which is

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.959 
let's go into the last mode which is
track<00:03:43.489> mode<00:03:45.099> so<00:03:46.099> track<00:03:46.340> mode<00:03:46.519> gives<00:03:46.790> me

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:46.969 
track mode so track mode gives me

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.959 
track mode so track mode gives me
maximum<00:03:47.659> supports<00:03:48.319> on<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:49.280> chassis<00:03:49.489> for<00:03:49.909> the

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:49.969 
maximum supports on the chassis for the

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:51.970 
maximum supports on the chassis for the
handling<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.810> gives<00:03:51.019> me<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.590> most

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
handling and it gives me the most

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.679 
handling and it gives me the most
aggressive<00:03:52.400> powertrain<00:03:53.120> set<00:03:53.329> it<00:03:53.450> as<00:03:53.510> well<00:03:53.659> so

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
aggressive powertrain set it as well so

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.780 
aggressive powertrain set it as well so
I've<00:03:53.840> got<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:53.989> fast<00:03:54.290> gear<00:03:54.530> change<00:03:54.889> yeah

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
I've got a fast gear change yeah

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.699 
I've got a fast gear change yeah
everything<00:03:56.389> is<00:03:56.510> about<00:03:56.629> going<00:03:56.930> fast<00:03:57.290> now<00:03:57.560> and

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
everything is about going fast now and

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.159 
everything is about going fast now and
sharpening<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.129> car<00:03:58.370> up<00:03:58.579> so<00:03:59.569> immediately<00:04:00.079> we

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
sharpening the car up so immediately we

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.319 
sharpening the car up so immediately we
turn<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.799> to<00:04:01.340> this<00:04:01.459> second<00:04:01.849> gear<00:04:01.969> turn<00:04:02.180> that

year<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:03.349> just<00:04:03.590> feels<00:04:03.739> like<00:04:03.980> I've<00:04:04.219> added<00:04:04.370> a

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
year it just feels like I've added a

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.099 
year it just feels like I've added a
load<00:04:04.730> more<00:04:04.969> spring<00:04:05.269> rate<00:04:05.449> to<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.689> car<00:04:05.870> really

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109

which<00:04:06.469> of<00:04:06.620> course<00:04:06.650> technically<00:04:07.370> we<00:04:08.060> have

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
which of course technically we have

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.119 
which of course technically we have
because<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.109> hydraulic<00:04:09.590> system<00:04:09.620> is<00:04:10.010> now

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
because the hydraulic system is now

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.619 
because the hydraulic system is now
supporting<00:04:10.579> that<00:04:10.639> I've<00:04:10.849> got<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.030> lot<00:04:11.209> more<00:04:11.239> slip

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
as you can see from the ESP so I'm

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.220 
as you can see from the ESP so I'm
getting<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:13.790> bit<00:04:13.909> of<00:04:14.000> oversteer<00:04:15.009> there
