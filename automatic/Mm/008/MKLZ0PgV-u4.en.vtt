 steve mandanda who stayed on 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.000
 his supports a straw ball is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.670
 impeccable for thomas but the old 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.110
 bastiais completely unscrews his volley 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.150
 we are gaining momentum on the side of 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.879
 marseille the center of dja djedje is at 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.369
 barely cut by andré pierre gignac and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.119
 the monopoly of the balloon intensifies side 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.430
 Marseille 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:04.379
 the heelade for florian thauvin the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.090
 center is impeccable abdelaziz barrada 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.770
 was completely lonely amid 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.320
 the Girondin defense but fails 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.050
 not to dominate his ball and slammed his 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.730
 head right in front of cédric carrasso andré 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.210
 pierre gignac makes andré pierre 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.770
 Gignac 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.530
 he is walking right foot but it's without 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.570
 no danger for cédric carrasso 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 burgundy in all this reacts by 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.290
 sequences with this very good balloon no 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.930
 Offside position for wahbi khazri 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.580
 is a new time steve mandanda is 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.060
 flawless he did not have a lot of 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.860
 things to do 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.320
 the international guardian in this 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.250
 first period but he managed everything 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.870
 brilliantly 0 to 0 at the break at the end 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.150
 of a first period of a very big 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.159
 intensity the opportunities swept away from 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.909
 share and other marseilles globally 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.530
 dominated but burgundy holds and rebuffs 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.060
 sporadically the advocated gambling system 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.409
 by a ticket it requires a big 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.880
 debauchery of energy will have to be 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.190
 attentive and see if the Marseillais 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.320
 can display such a volume in the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.700
 second act is the answer she's going 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.650
 to be scathing we always see the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.330
 Marseille close to the surface of 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.030
 Cedric Carrasso who owes a new 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.729
 time intervene before mario the mines to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.370
 just like on this attempt to 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.840
 gianelli imbula marseille is clearly 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.380
 in a big time in these ten 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.480
 first 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.520
 minutes of the second period the corner 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.470
 is the Baptist head to the water and who 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.360
 ricochet on the crossbar of 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.460
 cédric carrasso marseille plays well and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.680
 in trust too much perhaps to the image of 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.180
 this reckless risk taking of 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.730
 mendy the suite is going very fast 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.340
 maurice belay eliminates water and 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.440
 goes into the tempo is perfect for 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.750
 thomas touré who does not need to 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.230
 control and can adjust quietly 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.000
 steve mandanda of a foot dish 1 0 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.560
 for the girondins of Bordeaux it is 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.330
 true against the course of the game 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.780
 second goal of the season for thomas 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.970
 round which allows bordeaux to lead 1-0 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.720
 and not for long because five minutes 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.760
 later on this dimitri caviar payet 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.670
 it's mario limina who slam his head 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.590
 in the small net of cédric carrasso 1 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.660
 goal everywhere 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.370
 then buzeins the 85th a new 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.890
 dimitri payet offering for andré 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.020
 pierre gignac the 11th goal of andré pierre 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.640
 gignac who gets rid of the marking of 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.810
 nicolas pallois he had not scored 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.590
 since three matches 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.330
 gignac and allows the om to lead 2-1 and 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.310
 the end portion is selected Michibata 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.310
 which will give more magnitude to success 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.040
 Olympian by scoring his first goal in 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.110
 league 1 final score 3 goals 1 for the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.880
 first time this season the om wins 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.590
 a match after being led for the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.480
 first time this season burgundy loses 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.610
 after leading marseille recovers his 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.090
 leading position the Girondins slips into 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.090
 fifth position
