 [Music] 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.179
 [Applause] 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:26.880
 and how am I 6 serrano and I'm going to 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.260
 teach how to make a tiny pokemon 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.140
 how is it 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.440
 It is a ball with a ping ball 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.550
 pong with a little button nothing is very 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 simple you can only do it in nothing in 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.280
 in ten minutes you have a good for 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.520
 start then we need the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.810
 following ingredients 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.810
 ping pong balls 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.400
 felt pens 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.210
 cutter 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.110
 scissors 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.970
 sandpaper 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.210
 a rule 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.980
 thumbtacks 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.010
 and black electrical tape 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.620
 let's go to it is the first thing we buy 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.140
 the ping pong balls and then we look 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.570
 if they have any symbol or something in this 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.930
 this case has a symbol but 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.820
 good we will remove it with sandpaper 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.120
 we will take and start to rub up 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.950
 get him out when when 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.110
 let's have taken out 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.299
 well we do it with a little more if 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.200
 we want and if not then we can start 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.210
 to put the black strip that we will put 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.429
 with the insulating tape we have to measure 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.579
 first what is the diameter of the ball 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.039
 to the greatest and then then 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.810
 we will take insulating tape we will measure it 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.680
 with 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.680
 with a rule 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.770
 we will take the insulating tape 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.229
 it's pretty much a ping pong ball 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.050
 they are about 12 centimeters and a half more or 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.560
 least so we'll put it on top of a 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.330
 tablet or something that we have 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.260
 so that we can cut well with the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:26.470
 cutter and we changed the table 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.470
 we take a cutter and cut it 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.940
 [Applause] 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.830
 but as you will see it is too big and 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.050
 obviously we can not place it like this 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.880
 it would be very rough then we have to 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.470
 cut it roughly in half or 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.840
 make us a brand with another piece of paper 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.660
 that we have done with a brand 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.700
 with shorter paper to put it 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.240
 over and can guide us if not by eye 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.400
 it is also good 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.340
 all right 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.680
 Well, we cut it well when we have it 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.260
 already cut we just have to start the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.189
 pull and put it on 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.239
 but also good we have already stuck 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.239
 tape 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.610
 in the ping pong ball we already have it 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.209
 placed well placed the center and now 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.610
 what we would have to do is place 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.069
 the black sphere that has below the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.090
 button that opens the mouth vol third ni 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.099
 big we also see with insulating tape 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.239
 and obviously it's a little bit bigger 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:29.800
 that the thickness of this one of this tape by 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.800
 what we will take our scissors 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.040
 our tape or the tape left over 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.720
 remains of what we had and for what 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.260
 we cut when we have already the 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.160
 the black sphere of the tape we have to 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.110
 look for the point where the two joined 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.390
 the two ends of the tape and what 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.390
 we stick on pressing hard 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.720
 and we will not have more or less if there 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.640
 something like that 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.950
 and think that you do not know everything black because 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.760
 obviously we have to put the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:12.400
 button that goes here in the middle for that 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:19.329
 we will take a label can be flat 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.329
 white and we will place it in the center 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.090
 of the black sphere we will press with 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:31.020
 force and we will have it placed and 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.320
 we have the skeleton of the appo that bolt 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.460
 the black insulating tape the black circle 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.670
 and the little button now we only have left 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.680
 Color the pokemon that we would have more 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.980
 or less like this if we apply only one 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.140
 layer I have put a layer and it looks more like 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.600
 tone like that pink but that's because the color 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.400
 what's below is white and if we put it together 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.380
 the red with the white becomes a color 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.810
 more so pink but nothing happens if you 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.700
 we apply another layer dry it is arrived 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.890
 very fast if another layer is applied 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.570
 it will already be a redder tone and so 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.600
 we can do for the population because 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.940
 We want well, we have already finished 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.780
 do the pokemons we've done six 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.310
 because you different 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.480
 and good now that you know how to do because 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.830
 come on with ping pong balls 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.680
 now you can take advantage of them and make them 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:27.090
 with larger balls 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:31.900
 painted or unpainted and the same is the 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:34.180
 trick of putting the thumbtack 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.120
 a white paper below or a sticker 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.440
 white or something and you're just that because 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.380
 Nothing, I hope you liked the 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.550
 tutorial and see you soon 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.780

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:48.300
