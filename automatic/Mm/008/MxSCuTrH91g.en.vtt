00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.350
 that reported for a long time 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.840
 the spirit of the competition 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.379
 to whistle that they take it 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.619
 The Netherlands 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.549

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.809
 not with their profits I want the province's comment 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.919

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.560
 3 our people play 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 it is primarily the succession 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.979
 the living legend now lives 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.689
 erp 8 8 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.879

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.879
 the whole thing 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.879

 my dad to do that 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.230
 In addition, it is not for nothing that the child in the intermediate round is doing well 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.829
 and that is very unfortunate that the ground 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.599
 it all becomes too long without measures being taken 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.769

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.460

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.949
 the turningpoint 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.370
