let's<00:00:28.920> start<00:00:29.220> by<00:00:29.460> looking<00:00:29.670> at<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> burner

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
let's start by looking at the burner

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.160 
let's start by looking at the burner
which<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.289> same<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.890> dual<00:00:32.099> fuel<00:00:32.550> burner

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.610 

so<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.379> dual<00:00:37.589> fuel<00:00:37.949> burner<00:00:38.339> comes<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.659> screw

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
so the dual fuel burner comes in a screw

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.270 
so the dual fuel burner comes in a screw
top<00:00:40.890> container<00:00:41.549> that<00:00:42.510> has<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.900> lid<00:00:43.409> that<00:00:43.920> serves

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
as an esper talk about that in a minute

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.939 
as an esper talk about that in a minute
and<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:48.239> bottom<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> serves<00:00:49.080> as<00:00:49.290> an<00:00:49.409> alcohol

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
and a bottom that serves as an alcohol

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.990 
and a bottom that serves as an alcohol
burner<00:00:50.220> and<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:51.360> has<00:00:51.540> carbon<00:00:51.900> felt<00:00:52.379> inside

burner and it has carbon felt inside

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.439 
burner and it has carbon felt inside
which<00:00:54.000> helps<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.449> alcohol<00:00:54.989> burn<00:00:55.260> nicely<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
which helps the alcohol burn nicely and

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.310 
which helps the alcohol burn nicely and
the<00:00:57.449> pot<00:00:57.659> stand<00:00:58.080> is<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> stainless<00:00:59.280> steel<00:00:59.309> mesh

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
fabric that's welded it's the same as

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.070 
fabric that's welded it's the same as
what's<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> Firefly<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.820> floor<00:01:06.119> and

what's in the Firefly for the floor and
you<00:01:07.230> can<00:01:07.440> store<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.980> flat<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.020> or

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
you can store it flat if you like or

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380 
you can store it flat if you like or
it's<00:01:10.260> easily<00:01:10.710> bent<00:01:11.160> into<00:01:11.460> any<00:01:11.730> shape<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.120> you

things<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:20.170> will<00:02:20.350> do<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:21.070> serve<00:02:21.520> as<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.850> nice

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
things that will do is serve as a nice

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.820 
things that will do is serve as a nice
ground<00:02:23.610> shield<00:02:24.610> for<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.060> Firefly<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.170> if

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
ground shield for the Firefly and if

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.180 
ground shield for the Firefly and if
you're<00:02:27.040> using<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.810> Flex<00:02:28.810> port<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.980> burn

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
you're using the Flex port to burn

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.120 
you're using the Flex port to burn
longer<00:02:30.550> pieces<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.330> wood<00:02:31.540> it's<00:02:32.500> nice<00:02:32.800> because

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
longer pieces of wood it's nice because

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.730 
longer pieces of wood it's nice because
it<00:02:33.430> has<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> little<00:02:33.970> bit<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.270> an<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:35.560> an

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
it has a little bit of an of an

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.100 
it has a little bit of an of an
extension<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.940> goes<00:02:37.240> under<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.630> wood<00:02:37.930> in

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
extension that goes under the wood in

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.980 
extension that goes under the wood in
case<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> little<00:02:38.709> bit<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.010> ash<00:02:39.360> or<00:02:40.360> cinders

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
case a little bit of ash or cinders

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.790 
case a little bit of ash or cinders
fallout<00:02:41.820> fallout<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:43.000> door<00:02:43.240> side<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:44.500> that's

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
fallout fallout the door side so that's

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.080 
fallout fallout the door side so that's
the<00:02:45.270> hinged<00:02:46.270> windshield<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.280> basically<00:02:48.280> it's

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
the hinged windshield and basically it's

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.720 
the hinged windshield and basically it's
used<00:02:49.420> as<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> ground<00:02:50.020> shield<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.800> also<00:02:51.520> we'll

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
used as a ground shield and also we'll

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.790 
used as a ground shield and also we'll
see<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.090> minute<00:02:52.209> how<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:53.050> used<00:02:53.350> in<00:02:53.620> its

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
see in a minute how it's used in its

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.780 
see in a minute how it's used in its
hinged<00:02:54.250> fashion<00:02:54.790> as<00:02:54.940> part<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:56.020> a<00:02:56.790> windshield

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
hinged fashion as part of a windshield

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.479 
hinged fashion as part of a windshield
around<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:59.459> alcohol<00:03:00.459> or<00:03:00.730> esbit<00:03:01.209> burner<00:03:02.489> so

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
around the alcohol or esbit burner so

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.990 
around the alcohol or esbit burner so
that's<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.940> dual<00:03:04.150> fuel<00:03:04.600> stove<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:06.100> hinged

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
that's the dual fuel stove the hinged

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.500 
that's the dual fuel stove the hinged
windshield<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:09.090> stainless<00:03:10.090> steel<00:03:10.270> pot

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
windshield and the stainless steel pot

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.070 
windshield and the stainless steel pot
stand<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.680> terms<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:15.160> how<00:03:15.340> things<00:03:16.080> work

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
stand so in terms of how things work

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.830 
stand so in terms of how things work
with<00:03:17.320> different<00:03:17.530> pots<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:19.030> first<00:03:19.330> thing<00:03:19.600> to

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
with different pots the first thing to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.070 
with different pots the first thing to
do<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.410> take<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.239> bottom<00:03:22.239> mesh<00:03:22.510> out<00:03:22.810> of

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
do is to take the bottom mesh out of

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.670 
do is to take the bottom mesh out of
Firefly<00:03:23.739> if<00:03:24.070> you've<00:03:24.280> already<00:03:24.519> assembled<00:03:25.209> it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
Firefly if you've already assembled it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.830 
Firefly if you've already assembled it
and<00:03:26.680> then<00:03:29.730> what<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.880> want<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.209> do<00:03:31.390> is<00:03:31.600> just

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
and then what you want to do is just

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.400 
and then what you want to do is just
open<00:03:32.380> up<00:03:32.500> one<00:03:32.799> corner<00:03:33.430> of<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.670> stove<00:03:34.410> to

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
open up one corner of the stove to

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.890 
open up one corner of the stove to
basically<00:03:35.920> create<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:38.790> foldable<00:03:39.900> partial

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
basically create a foldable partial

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.460 
basically create a foldable partial
windscreen<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.970> which<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:44.610> hinged

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
windscreen to which the hinged

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.190 
windscreen to which the hinged
windshield<00:03:47.470> can<00:03:47.860> be<00:03:48.070> added<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:49.690> create<00:03:50.170> a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
windshield can be added to create a

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.490 
windshield can be added to create a
larger<00:03:51.040> windscreen<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.810> idea<00:03:53.230> would<00:03:53.440> be

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
larger windscreen and the idea would be

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.390 
larger windscreen and the idea would be
that<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:54.690> hinged<00:03:55.690> windshield<00:03:56.380> would<00:03:56.980> go<00:03:57.160> into

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
that the hinged windshield would go into

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.370 
that the hinged windshield would go into
the<00:03:57.640> wind<00:03:57.880> since<00:03:58.299> it<00:03:58.450> comes<00:03:58.660> all<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:58.959> way<00:03:59.079> down

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
the wind since it comes all the way down

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.920 
the wind since it comes all the way down
to<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.590> ground<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:01.420> rest<00:04:01.630> of<00:04:01.810> the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
to the ground and the rest of the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.050 
to the ground and the rest of the
Firefly<00:04:02.530> would<00:04:02.829> serve<00:04:03.100> as<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.489> rest<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
Firefly would serve as the rest of the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.520 
Firefly would serve as the rest of the
windshield<00:04:05.070> with<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.780> dual<00:04:07.780> fuel<00:04:08.140> burner

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
windshield with the dual fuel burner

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.930 
windshield with the dual fuel burner
either<00:04:08.980> as<00:04:09.340> better<00:04:09.670> alcohol<00:04:10.299> inside<00:04:11.940> so

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
either as better alcohol inside so

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.810 
either as better alcohol inside so
that's<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.420> basic<00:04:13.870> concept<00:04:14.560> let's<00:04:15.370> look<00:04:15.610> at

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
that's the basic concept let's look at

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.699 
that's the basic concept let's look at
how<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.150> works<00:04:16.419> with<00:04:16.780> different<00:04:17.290> kinds<00:04:17.620> of

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
how it works with different kinds of

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.400 
how it works with different kinds of
pots<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:19.120> first<00:04:19.419> of<00:04:19.630> all<00:04:19.810> if<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.169> have<00:04:20.380> a

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
pots so first of all if you have a

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.089 
pots so first of all if you have a
foster<00:04:21.100> scan<00:04:21.489> pot<00:04:21.960> or<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.200> have<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.440> heineken

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
foster scan pot or you have a heineken

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.029 
foster scan pot or you have a heineken
can<00:04:24.370> pot<00:04:24.729> one<00:04:25.690> of<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.900> nice<00:04:26.110> things<00:04:26.140> about<00:04:26.710> the

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
can pot one of the nice things about the

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:27.620 
can pot one of the nice things about the
dual<00:04:27.220> few

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
dual few

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.610 
dual few
burner<00:04:27.930> is<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.460> pot<00:04:29.670> support<00:04:30.320> just<00:04:31.320> fits

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
burner is that the pot support just fits

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.670 
burner is that the pot support just fits
perfectly<00:04:32.250> into<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.880> bottom<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.480> your

Heineken can or the bottom of your
Foster's<00:04:36.510> can<00:04:36.810> pot<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.650> will<00:04:38.280> sit<00:04:38.580> right<00:04:38.820> over

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
Foster's can pot and will sit right over

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.410 
Foster's can pot and will sit right over
your<00:04:39.570> duel<00:04:40.380> fuel<00:04:40.710> burner<00:04:41.150> without<00:04:42.150> any

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
your duel fuel burner without any

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.260 
your duel fuel burner without any
difficulty<00:04:43.170> so<00:04:44.100> that's<00:04:44.280> just<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.730> nice<00:04:44.940> feature

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
difficulty so that's just a nice feature

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.070 
difficulty so that's just a nice feature
and<00:04:45.780> that<00:04:45.960> works<00:04:46.200> well<00:04:46.760> so<00:04:47.760> basically<00:04:48.270> having

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
and that works well so basically having

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.770 
and that works well so basically having
set<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.620> up<00:04:49.740> that<00:04:49.770> way<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:51.120> would<00:04:51.300> just<00:04:51.540> create

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
set it up that way you would just create

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.470 
set it up that way you would just create
a<00:04:51.930> windscreen<00:04:52.730> with<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:53.910> rest<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.360> the

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
a windscreen with the rest of the

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.500 
a windscreen with the rest of the
Firefly<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:56.610> would<00:04:56.760> just<00:04:56.940> orient<00:04:57.860> the

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
Firefly and you would just orient the

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.810 
Firefly and you would just orient the
open<00:05:00.510> side<00:05:00.780> towards<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.290> wind<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.040> put<00:05:02.640> the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
open side towards the wind and put the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.620 
open side towards the wind and put the
hinged<00:05:03.830> windshield<00:05:04.830> there<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:06.000> deflect<00:05:06.480> the

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
hinged windshield there to deflect the

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.250 
hinged windshield there to deflect the
wind<00:05:06.870> so<00:05:07.770> that<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.520> alcohol<00:05:09.030> burner<00:05:09.690> can<00:05:10.050> burn

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
wind so that the alcohol burner can burn

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.790 
wind so that the alcohol burner can burn
nicely<00:05:10.500> under<00:05:10.980> your<00:05:11.100> pot<00:05:12.350> so<00:05:13.350> let's<00:05:13.560> say<00:05:13.770> you

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
nicely under your pot so let's say you

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.280 
nicely under your pot so let's say you
have<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.130> little<00:05:14.400> bit<00:05:14.580> larger<00:05:14.850> pot<00:05:15.360> so<00:05:15.930> this<00:05:16.110> is

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
have a little bit larger pot so this is

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.010 
have a little bit larger pot so this is
a<00:05:16.320> kind<00:05:16.590> of<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.860> tall<00:05:17.720> 900cc<00:05:18.720> pot<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:21.780> it's

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
a kind of a tall 900cc pot and it's

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.500 
a kind of a tall 900cc pot and it's
going<00:05:22.260> to<00:05:22.350> go<00:05:22.500> on<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.890> dual<00:05:23.100> fuel<00:05:23.430> burner<00:05:23.730> the

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
going to go on the dual fuel burner the

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.070 
going to go on the dual fuel burner the
same<00:05:24.810> way<00:05:25.050> that<00:05:25.350> they<00:05:25.470> all<00:05:25.650> do<00:05:26.010> and<00:05:27.080> then

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
same way that they all do and then

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.960 
same way that they all do and then
you're<00:05:28.260> just<00:05:28.290> going<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.920> put<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.370> Firefly

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
you're just going to put the Firefly

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.510 
you're just going to put the Firefly
again<00:05:30.590> kind<00:05:31.590> of<00:05:31.710> around<00:05:32.130> it<00:05:33.590> with<00:05:34.590> the<00:05:34.860> wind

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
again kind of around it with the wind

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.060 
again kind of around it with the wind
coming<00:05:36.030> this<00:05:36.180> way<00:05:36.450> and<00:05:36.840> then<00:05:37.350> just<00:05:37.620> put<00:05:37.890> the

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
coming this way and then just put the

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.610 
coming this way and then just put the
hinged<00:05:38.900> windshield<00:05:39.980> right<00:05:40.980> there<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:42.810> you

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
hinged windshield right there and you

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.250 
hinged windshield right there and you
can<00:05:43.770> kind<00:05:44.010> of<00:05:44.160> orient<00:05:44.640> it<00:05:44.850> so<00:05:45.090> it's<00:05:45.270> reasonably

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
can kind of orient it so it's reasonably

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.460 
can kind of orient it so it's reasonably
snug<00:05:46.770> around<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:48.000> burner<00:05:48.270> because<00:05:48.660> all<00:05:49.290> the

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
snug around the burner because all the

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.040 
snug around the burner because all the
surfaces<00:05:49.710> are<00:05:50.190> titanium<00:05:50.640> so<00:05:51.480> they'll<00:05:51.660> hold<00:05:51.870> up

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
surfaces are titanium so they'll hold up

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.330 
surfaces are titanium so they'll hold up
to<00:05:52.260> heat<00:05:52.440> very<00:05:52.680> well<00:05:53.840> and<00:05:54.840> so<00:05:55.530> on<00:05:55.710> you<00:05:55.980> can<00:05:56.010> go

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
to heat very well and so on you can go

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.850 
to heat very well and so on you can go
up<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.760> a<00:05:56.790> little<00:05:57.390> bit<00:05:57.540> larger<00:05:58.050> size<00:05:58.290> this<00:05:58.620> is<00:05:58.680> a

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
up to a little bit larger size this is a

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.260 
up to a little bit larger size this is a
squat<00:05:59.930> 900cc<00:06:00.930> pot<00:06:01.470> and<00:06:01.830> you<00:06:02.760> can<00:06:03.000> see<00:06:03.240> that

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
squat 900cc pot and you can see that

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.620 
squat 900cc pot and you can see that
that's<00:06:03.600> going<00:06:03.960> to<00:06:04.020> work<00:06:04.170> fine<00:06:04.530> and<00:06:05.630> even

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
that's going to work fine and even

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.240 
that's going to work fine and even
here's<00:06:06.900> a<00:06:06.960> 1.3<00:06:07.890> liter<00:06:08.130> ever<00:06:08.460> knew<00:06:08.760> and<00:06:10.250> that's

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
here's a 1.3 liter ever knew and that's

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.920 
here's a 1.3 liter ever knew and that's
going<00:06:11.640> to<00:06:11.700> need<00:06:11.910> to<00:06:11.940> be<00:06:12.210> just<00:06:12.510> a<00:06:12.630> little<00:06:12.660> bit

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
going to need to be just a little bit

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.060 
going to need to be just a little bit
bigger<00:06:13.940> but<00:06:14.940> you<00:06:15.150> can<00:06:15.360> set<00:06:15.630> that<00:06:15.810> in<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:16.440> put

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
bigger but you can set that in and put

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.370 
bigger but you can set that in and put
the<00:06:17.190> hinged<00:06:17.520> wind<00:06:17.760> screen<00:06:18.120> around<00:06:18.420> and<00:06:18.810> in

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
the hinged wind screen around and in

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.160 
the hinged wind screen around and in
fact<00:06:19.650> it's<00:06:20.280> going<00:06:20.430> to<00:06:20.610> cover<00:06:20.910> all<00:06:21.720> of<00:06:21.780> the

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
fact it's going to cover all of the

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.700 
fact it's going to cover all of the
sides<00:06:22.410> nicely<00:06:23.570> so<00:06:24.570> that's<00:06:24.780> basically<00:06:25.050> how<00:06:25.500> the

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
sides nicely so that's basically how the

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.700 
sides nicely so that's basically how the
new<00:06:25.980> dual<00:06:26.250> fuel<00:06:26.610> system<00:06:27.180> works<00:06:27.450> in<00:06:27.720> terms<00:06:28.440> of

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
new dual fuel system works in terms of

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.220 
new dual fuel system works in terms of
being<00:06:29.310> flexible<00:06:29.880> to<00:06:30.630> work<00:06:30.810> with<00:06:31.020> different

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
being flexible to work with different

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.010 
being flexible to work with different
kinds<00:06:31.800> of<00:06:31.890> pots<00:06:33.650> so<00:06:34.650> there<00:06:34.920> you<00:06:35.100> have<00:06:35.130> it

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
kinds of pots so there you have it

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.159 
kinds of pots so there you have it
