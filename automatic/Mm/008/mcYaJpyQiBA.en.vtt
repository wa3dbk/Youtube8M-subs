one specific feature of the Xbox one

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.920 
one specific feature of the Xbox one
with<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> controller<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.450> receive

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
with the controller you receive

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.410 
with the controller you receive
something<00:00:40.290> called<00:00:40.489> force<00:00:41.489> feedback<00:00:42.090> feature

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
something called force feedback feature

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.810 
something called force feedback feature
that<00:00:42.719> they<00:00:42.840> want<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.050> put<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> triggers

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
you know you actually get feedback from

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.139 
you know you actually get feedback from
you<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.289> accelerating<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.309> braking<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you know accelerating and braking in a

car in an FPS in any game really through
the<00:00:54.360> triggers<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.440> brilliant<00:00:56.340> idea

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you're actually feeling the feedback of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.100 
you're actually feeling the feedback of
the<00:01:05.700> kind<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.180> actually<00:01:06.360> understand<00:01:07.049> the

the kind you can actually understand the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960

going that sort of thing and to have it
in<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> triggers<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.400> places<00:01:11.939> where<00:01:12.090> you're

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
in the triggers that places where you're

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.289 
in the triggers that places where you're
pushing<00:01:12.689> down<00:01:12.770> its<00:01:13.770> fat<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.340> feels<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.909> sounds

pushing down its fat it feels and sounds

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.289 
pushing down its fat it feels and sounds
fantastic<00:01:17.330> you<00:01:18.330> would<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.909> thing<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
fantastic you would think so one thing I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.020 
fantastic you would think so one thing I
found<00:01:21.509> strange<00:01:21.900> straight<00:01:22.500> away<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.729> force

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
found strange straight away is the force

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
found strange straight away is the force
feedback<00:01:24.360> feature<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.320> tried<00:01:25.710> during

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
feedback feature that I tried during

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.600 
feedback feature that I tried during
Eurogamer<00:01:27.950> wasn't<00:01:28.950> really<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.430> would

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
Eurogamer wasn't really what I would

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
Eurogamer wasn't really what I would
classes<00:01:30.299> forst<00:01:30.750> forst<00:01:30.960> forst<00:01:32.060> feedback<00:01:33.860> when

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
classes forst forst forst feedback when

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.590 
classes forst forst forst feedback when
I<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.310> force<00:01:35.520> feedback<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.210> would<00:01:36.240> think

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
I think of force feedback I would think

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
I think of force feedback I would think
of<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.049> steering<00:01:37.500> wheel<00:01:37.530> steering<00:01:38.220> wheel<00:01:38.369> that

you'd played for answer isno are no need
to<00:01:40.650> speed<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.880> steering<00:01:42.150> wheel<00:01:42.240> say

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
to speed on the steering wheel say

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.149 
to speed on the steering wheel say
you're<00:01:42.869> losing<00:01:43.110> control<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.710> car<00:01:43.920> it

you're losing control of your car it

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.880 
you're losing control of your car it
will<00:01:44.369> force<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.360> direction<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.170> will<00:01:46.649> try

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
will force in one direction you will try

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.740 
will force in one direction you will try
and<00:01:47.040> force<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> other<00:01:48.240> directions<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and force it in the other directions to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.170 
and force it in the other directions to
try<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.110> correct<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.070> me<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.909> what

try and correct it that to me is what

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.920 
try and correct it that to me is what
force<00:01:51.509> feedback<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.820> but<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.000> Microsoft<00:01:54.689> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
force feedback is but to Microsoft it

distracts<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.600> from<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.930> actual<00:03:53.200> game<00:03:53.620> it

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
distracts you from the actual game it

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.470 
distracts you from the actual game it
when<00:03:54.040> in<00:03:54.190> racing<00:03:54.639> it's<00:03:54.819> not<00:03:54.970> really<00:03:55.239> a<00:03:55.269> good

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
when in racing it's not really a good

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.479 
when in racing it's not really a good
idea<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.959> be<00:03:56.109> distracted<00:03:56.739> from<00:03:56.889> the<00:03:57.100> game<00:03:57.280> and

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
idea to be distracted from the game and

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.569 
idea to be distracted from the game and
it<00:03:58.239> just<00:03:58.540> takes<00:03:59.500> away<00:03:59.769> from<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.280> game<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:02.579> I

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
it just takes away from the game and I

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.120 
it just takes away from the game and I
can<00:04:04.510> understand<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.049> logic<00:04:05.349> behind<00:04:05.380> wanting

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
can understand the logic behind wanting

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.460 
can understand the logic behind wanting
this<00:04:06.340> but<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.450> was<00:04:07.660> really<00:04:07.690> badly

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
this but I it was really badly

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.470 
this but I it was really badly

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
was very early you know I probably

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.810 
was very early you know I probably
played<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.780> e3<00:04:22.290> or<00:04:22.500> Gamescom<00:04:23.130> built<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.580> these

games and controllers and stuff put

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.260 
games and controllers and stuff put
together<00:04:27.980> but<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.520> was<00:04:29.760> still<00:04:30.030> something

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
together but it was still something

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.300 
together but it was still something
really<00:04:30.750> stupid<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.290> if<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.680> is<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:32.070> final

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
really stupid and if this is the final

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.100 
really stupid and if this is the final
you<00:04:32.880> know<00:04:33.000> version<00:04:33.480> of<00:04:33.660> it<00:04:33.840> which<00:04:33.960> I'm

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
you know version of it which I'm

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.800 
you know version of it which I'm
guessing<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.680> probably<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.550> close<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.330> I'm

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
guessing it probably is close to it I'm

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
thing off straight away it takes away it

thing off straight away it takes away it
distracts<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:44.130> hurts<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:47.220> know<00:04:47.310> it's<00:04:47.910> just

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
distracts it hurts it you know it's just

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.510 
distracts it hurts it you know it's just
really<00:04:48.389> annoying<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.889> have<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:50.280> as

really annoying and to have that as
something<00:04:51.300> in<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.900> game<00:04:52.139> it's<00:04:53.070> rather<00:04:53.400> silly

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
something in the game it's rather silly

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:54.260 
something in the game it's rather silly
to<00:04:53.940> me

to me

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.830 
to me
I<00:04:54.979> don't<00:04:55.979> understand<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.490> do<00:04:57.389> you<00:04:57.450> understand
