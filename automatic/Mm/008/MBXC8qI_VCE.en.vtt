is a google reader synchronization tool

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.169 
is a google reader synchronization tool
I<00:00:21.140> know<00:00:21.949> it's<00:00:22.220> a<00:00:22.279> little<00:00:22.489> bit<00:00:22.579> complicated<00:00:22.939> to

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
application on your android it's more

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.910 
application on your android it's more
web-based<00:00:31.270> but<00:00:32.270> it's<00:00:32.840> still<00:00:33.140> useful<00:00:33.380> it's<00:00:33.860> a

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
web-based but it's still useful it's a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.430 
web-based but it's still useful it's a
lot<00:00:34.040> better<00:00:34.220> than<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.970> google<00:00:35.780> reader<00:00:35.960> mobile

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
lot better than the google reader mobile

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.460 
lot better than the google reader mobile
site<00:00:36.760> definitely<00:00:37.760> a<00:00:37.790> lot<00:00:37.940> better<00:00:38.320> but<00:00:39.320> they're

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
site definitely a lot better but they're

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.070

all<00:00:39.590> is<00:00:39.800> also<00:00:40.220> an<00:00:40.340> option<00:00:40.700> for<00:00:41.080> local

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
all is also an option for local

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.080 
all is also an option for local
synchronization<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.190> don't<00:00:43.400> get<00:00:43.550> me<00:00:43.670> wrong<00:00:43.880> by

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
synchronization so don't get me wrong by

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.600 
synchronization so don't get me wrong by
all<00:00:44.150> means<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.570> can<00:00:44.600> download<00:00:45.590> every<00:00:46.190> single

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
out on me now let's take a look at the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.210 
out on me now let's take a look at the
application<00:00:52.930> it's<00:00:53.930> right<00:00:54.050> here<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:54.980> can<00:00:55.130> have

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
application it's right here you can have

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.040 
application it's right here you can have
to<00:00:55.460> see<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:55.730> is<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:55.910> main<00:00:56.120> screen<00:00:56.329> this<00:00:56.990> is

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
to see this is the main screen this is

where you get all your feet set now if
you<00:01:00.140> look<00:01:00.260> at<00:01:00.440> some<00:01:00.650> of<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.829> settings<00:01:02.350> one<00:01:03.350> is

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
you look at some of the settings one is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.130 
you look at some of the settings one is
your<00:01:03.860> synchronization<00:01:04.610> type<00:01:04.850> which<00:01:05.719> I

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
your synchronization type which I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.139 
your synchronization type which I
usually<00:01:06.469> just<00:01:06.679> keep<00:01:07.009> it<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.340> keep<00:01:07.579> it<00:01:07.700> on<00:01:07.850> all

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
usually just keep it and keep it on all

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.120 
usually just keep it and keep it on all
articles<00:01:08.659> but<00:01:09.409> you<00:01:09.469> can<00:01:09.619> change<00:01:09.829> it<00:01:09.979> if<00:01:10.069> you

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
articles but you can change it if you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.940 
articles but you can change it if you
want<00:01:10.659> auto<00:01:11.659> synchronization<00:01:12.409> this<00:01:12.590> is<00:01:12.740> really

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
want auto synchronization this is really

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.580 
want auto synchronization this is really
cool<00:01:13.249> if<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.749> let's<00:01:14.749> say<00:01:14.929> you're<00:01:15.079> out<00:01:15.140> in

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
get any 3g but you know there might be

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.950 
get any 3g but you know there might be
some<00:01:19.039> Wi-Fi<00:01:19.429> and<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.149> see<00:01:20.299> some<00:01:20.479> Wi-Fi<00:01:20.840> and

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
you want to hop on well enable Wi-Fi

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.340 
you want to hop on well enable Wi-Fi
only<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:26.240> will<00:01:26.359> never<00:01:26.569> sink<00:01:26.899> will<00:01:27.049> even

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
only and it will never sink will even

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.779 
only and it will never sink will even
when<00:01:27.469> you're<00:01:27.590> on<00:01:27.710> 3g<00:01:28.130> only<00:01:28.549> when<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:28.759> have

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
when you're on 3g only when you have

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.699 
when you're on 3g only when you have
Wi-Fi<00:01:29.119> won't<00:01:29.719> waste<00:01:29.899> your<00:01:30.079> battery<00:01:30.259> as<00:01:30.530> much

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
and you know specifically when it will

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.039 
and you know specifically when it will
sink<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.429> obviously<00:01:34.549> set<00:01:34.999> when<00:01:35.749> you<00:01:35.869> want

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
sink you can obviously set when you want

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.800 
sink you can obviously set when you want
to<00:01:36.170> sync<00:01:36.409> if<00:01:37.189> your<00:01:37.459> big<00:01:37.700> google<00:01:38.060> reader<00:01:38.420> thing

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
to sync if your big google reader thing

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.800 
to sync if your big google reader thing
reader<00:01:39.319> like<00:01:39.560> me<00:01:39.789> you<00:01:40.789> probably<00:01:40.819> do<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.479> every

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
reader like me you probably do it every

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.230 
reader like me you probably do it every
hour<00:01:41.959> but<00:01:42.829> obviously<00:01:43.670> if<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:43.909> only<00:01:44.029> have<00:01:44.209> a

hour but obviously if you only have a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.980 
hour but obviously if you only have a
few<00:01:44.539> feeds<00:01:44.810> maybe<00:01:45.619> every<00:01:45.799> day<00:01:45.950> i<00:01:46.719> was<00:01:47.719> like<00:01:47.959> i

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
few feeds maybe every day i was like i

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.260 
few feeds maybe every day i was like i
said<00:01:48.229> offline<00:01:48.709> use<00:01:48.979> when<00:01:49.789> you<00:01:49.880> want<00:01:49.909> it<00:01:50.119> to
