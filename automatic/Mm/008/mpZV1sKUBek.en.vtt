how much we're going to cut off of
course<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.630> could<00:03:48.780> always<00:03:48.989> just<00:03:49.410> try<00:03:49.650> an

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
course you could always just try an

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.289 
course you could always just try an
eyeball<00:03:50.160> exactly<00:03:50.639> how<00:03:50.760> much<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.090> need<00:03:51.120> to

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
take off although I personally cannot do

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.069 
take off although I personally cannot do
that<00:03:53.370> very<00:03:53.880> well<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.329> if<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.569> can<00:03:54.780> then<00:03:55.049> you

definitely should or if you want to make

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.150 
definitely should or if you want to make
a<00:03:57.389> small<00:03:57.780> mark<00:03:58.079> right<00:03:58.349> here<00:03:58.379> you<00:03:58.829> can<00:03:58.980> always

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
a small mark right here you can always

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.530 
a small mark right here you can always
do<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.849> and<00:03:59.879> then<00:04:00.090> just<00:04:00.329> kind<00:04:00.510> of

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
make sure that you cut on each of the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.580 
make sure that you cut on each of the
marks<00:04:03.269> on<00:04:03.389> each<00:04:03.599> piece<00:04:03.870> don't<00:04:04.079> forget<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.470> put

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
marks on each piece don't forget to put

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.500 
marks on each piece don't forget to put
a<00:04:04.620> mark<00:04:04.829> on<00:04:04.919> both<00:04:05.069> pieces<00:04:05.519> though<00:04:05.700> because<00:04:05.940> we

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
a mark on both pieces though because we

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.909 
a mark on both pieces though because we

the<00:04:16.979> ends<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.400> can<00:04:17.549> use<00:04:17.699> either<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:18.000> ruler<00:04:18.419> or<00:04:18.660> a

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
the ends you can use either a ruler or a

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.050 
the ends you can use either a ruler or a
measuring<00:04:19.349> tape<00:04:19.500> if<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.799> have<00:04:19.979> one<00:04:20.250> remember

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
measuring tape if you have one remember

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.820 
measuring tape if you have one remember
not<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.239> stretch<00:04:21.599> the<00:04:21.810> fabric<00:04:21.930> because<00:04:22.500> that

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
not to stretch the fabric because that

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.409 
not to stretch the fabric because that
will<00:04:23.010> distort<00:04:23.430> how<00:04:23.610> much<00:04:23.789> you<00:04:23.910> actually<00:04:24.270> need

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
will distort how much you actually need

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.060 
will distort how much you actually need
to<00:04:24.510> cut<00:04:24.660> off<00:04:24.810> even<00:04:25.380> though<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.770> doesn't<00:04:25.919> have

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
to cut off even though it doesn't have

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.589 
to cut off even though it doesn't have
to<00:04:26.280> be<00:04:26.370> perfect<00:04:26.789> because<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.240> is<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:27.360> stretchy

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
to be perfect because it is a stretchy

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.140 
to be perfect because it is a stretchy
material<00:04:28.280> so<00:04:29.280> what<00:04:29.370> I'm<00:04:29.490> doing<00:04:29.550> here<00:04:29.910> is<00:04:29.970> I

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
material so what I'm doing here is I

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.760 
material so what I'm doing here is I
laid<00:04:30.330> out<00:04:30.360> one<00:04:30.690> end<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.050> fabric<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:31.590> I'm

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
laid out one end of the fabric and I'm

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.439 
laid out one end of the fabric and I'm
just<00:04:31.979> going<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.250> use<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.729> scissors<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.060> mark

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
just going to use the scissors to mark

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.450 
just going to use the scissors to mark
off<00:04:33.599> how<00:04:33.870> much<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.260> decided<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.860> wanted<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.280> cut

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
off how much I decided I wanted to cut

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.260 
off how much I decided I wanted to cut
off<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.760> ends<00:04:37.400> what's<00:04:38.400> great<00:04:38.610> about<00:04:38.639> this<00:04:39.000> is

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
off the ends what's great about this is

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.730 
off the ends what's great about this is
that<00:04:39.300> it<00:04:39.630> doesn't<00:04:39.840> have<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:39.990> be<00:04:40.169> an<00:04:40.289> exactly

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
that it doesn't have to be an exactly

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.350 
that it doesn't have to be an exactly
straight<00:04:41.070> line<00:04:41.280> because<00:04:41.610> you're<00:04:42.000> going<00:04:42.240> to

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
straight line because you're going to

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.600 
straight line because you're going to
sew<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.780> ends<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.229> we<00:04:43.349> cut<00:04:43.590> into<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.220> fabric

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
sew the ends that we cut into the fabric

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.640 
sew the ends that we cut into the fabric
so<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.449> won't<00:04:45.630> be<00:04:45.720> visible<00:04:45.840> from<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.349> outside

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
so it won't be visible from the outside

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.230 
so it won't be visible from the outside
so<00:04:46.860> don't<00:04:47.010> worry<00:04:47.160> if<00:04:47.310> it's<00:04:47.460> not<00:04:47.550> straight<00:04:48.000> and

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
so don't worry if it's not straight and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.700 
so don't worry if it's not straight and
it<00:04:48.330> doesn't<00:04:48.570> look<00:04:48.630> professional<00:04:49.200> because<00:04:49.469> you

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
it doesn't look professional because you

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.480 
it doesn't look professional because you
won't<00:04:49.800> be<00:04:49.919> able<00:04:50.039> to<00:04:50.159> tell

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.249 

so<00:04:53.850> here<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.060> am<00:04:54.180> just<00:04:54.539> doing<00:04:54.630> my<00:04:54.750> best<00:04:54.990> if

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
so here I am just doing my best if

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.350 
so here I am just doing my best if
cutting<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.919> fabric<00:04:56.370> as<00:04:56.699> you<00:04:56.729> can<00:04:57.000> tell<00:04:57.150> mine

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
cutting the fabric as you can tell mine

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.719 
cutting the fabric as you can tell mine
doesn't<00:04:57.600> look<00:04:57.750> perfect<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:59.280> I'm<00:04:59.400> just<00:04:59.550> going

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
doesn't look perfect and I'm just going

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.670 
doesn't look perfect and I'm just going
to<00:04:59.789> go<00:04:59.910> ahead<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.419> repeat<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:00.870> step<00:05:01.139> on<00:05:01.380> the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
to go ahead and repeat that step on the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.309 
to go ahead and repeat that step on the
other<00:05:01.710> side<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:03.360> reason<00:05:03.479> I<00:05:03.720> didn't<00:05:03.930> just<00:05:04.139> take

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
other side the reason I didn't just take

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.020 
other side the reason I didn't just take
all<00:05:04.530> of<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.800> lengths<00:05:05.009> off<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.430> one<00:05:05.580> side<00:05:05.819> which

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
all of the lengths off of one side which

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.640 
all of the lengths off of one side which
you<00:05:06.150> can<00:05:06.300> definitely<00:05:06.449> do<00:05:06.930> is<00:05:07.139> because<00:05:07.470> the

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
you can definitely do is because the

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.290 
you can definitely do is because the
ends<00:05:07.919> of<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.099> fabric<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.550> had<00:05:08.729> looked<00:05:08.940> kind<00:05:09.210> of

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
ends of the fabric I had looked kind of

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.330 
ends of the fabric I had looked kind of
weird<00:05:09.539> so<00:05:10.319> I<00:05:10.349> wanted<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.680> cut<00:05:10.830> off<00:05:10.949> both<00:05:11.160> of<00:05:11.190> the

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
weird so I wanted to cut off both of the

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.409 
weird so I wanted to cut off both of the
ends<00:05:11.580> so<00:05:13.729> here<00:05:14.729> I<00:05:14.759> am<00:05:14.849> repeating<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.479> process

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
ends so here I am repeating the process

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.820 
ends so here I am repeating the process
so<00:05:18.419> once<00:05:18.569> you're<00:05:18.750> done<00:05:18.780> cutting<00:05:19.139> place<00:05:19.650> the

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
so once you're done cutting place the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.240 
so once you're done cutting place the
fabric<00:05:20.039> side<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.669> you<00:05:20.759> want<00:05:20.789> to<00:05:21.180> be<00:05:21.330> shown

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
fabric side that you want to be shown

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.559 
fabric side that you want to be shown
facedown<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.520> bring<00:05:23.819> all<00:05:23.970> of<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.210> corners

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
facedown and bring all of the corners

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.740 
facedown and bring all of the corners
together<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:27.000> next<00:05:27.240> thing<00:05:27.360> we're<00:05:27.509> going<00:05:27.630> to

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
together the next thing we're going to

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.659 
together the next thing we're going to
do<00:05:27.930> is<00:05:28.110> sew<00:05:28.320> all<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.590> way<00:05:28.770> up<00:05:28.919> this<00:05:29.070> side<00:05:29.370> so

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
do is sew all the way up this side so

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.310 
do is sew all the way up this side so
that<00:05:29.699> way<00:05:29.940> we<00:05:30.090> make<00:05:30.240> that<00:05:30.419> continuous<00:05:31.020> loop<00:05:31.199> of

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
that way we make that continuous loop of

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.710 
that way we make that continuous loop of
fabric<00:05:31.710> that<00:05:31.740> we<00:05:32.009> want<00:05:32.479> unfortunately<00:05:33.479> when<00:05:33.690> I

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
fabric that we want unfortunately when I

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.300 
fabric that we want unfortunately when I
was<00:05:33.930> sewing<00:05:34.139> this<00:05:34.440> it<00:05:34.680> was<00:05:34.770> totally<00:05:35.160> out<00:05:35.280> of

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
was sewing this it was totally out of

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.969 
was sewing this it was totally out of
frame<00:05:35.690> but<00:05:36.690> you<00:05:36.930> get<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.229> general<00:05:37.500> idea<00:05:37.620> you

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
frame but you get the general idea you

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.350 
frame but you get the general idea you
want<00:05:38.160> to<00:05:38.250> make<00:05:38.370> sure<00:05:38.400> you<00:05:38.699> sell<00:05:38.910> all<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.270> way

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
from the bottom to the top so once

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.830 
from the bottom to the top so once
you're<00:05:44.699> done<00:05:44.729> sewing<00:05:45.030> your<00:05:45.300> seam<00:05:45.509> it<00:05:45.690> should

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
you're done sewing your seam it should

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.999 
you're done sewing your seam it should
look<00:05:45.960> something<00:05:46.020> like<00:05:46.380> this

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
look something like this

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.800 
look something like this

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
and what you're going to do next is just

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.900 
and what you're going to do next is just
flip<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.080> inside<00:05:49.259> out

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
flip it inside out

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.910 
flip it inside out
so<00:05:51.600> once<00:05:51.780> you've<00:05:51.930> finished<00:05:52.140> sewing<00:05:52.770> and

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
so once you've finished sewing and

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.530 
so once you've finished sewing and
you've<00:05:53.010> got<00:05:53.250> your<00:05:53.400> little<00:05:53.580> seam<00:05:53.880> down<00:05:54.390> the

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
you've got your little seam down the

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.300 
you've got your little seam down the
back<00:05:54.720> the<00:05:55.320> next<00:05:55.590> thing<00:05:55.710> you're<00:05:55.800> going<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.160> do

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
back the next thing you're going to do

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.160 
back the next thing you're going to do
is<00:05:56.550> take<00:05:56.850> your<00:05:57.000> loop<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:57.540> you're<00:05:57.720> just<00:05:57.900> going

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
is take your loop and you're just going

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.250 
is take your loop and you're just going
to<00:05:58.230> cross<00:05:59.220> it<00:05:59.520> over<00:05:59.700> once<00:06:00.210> like<00:06:00.630> this<00:06:00.900> and

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
to cross it over once like this and

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.560 
to cross it over once like this and
cross<00:06:01.800> it<00:06:01.950> over<00:06:02.010> again<00:06:02.220> so<00:06:02.910> that's<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.270> exact

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
cross it over again so that's the exact

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.270 
cross it over again so that's the exact
same<00:06:03.600> thing<00:06:03.840> that<00:06:04.080> we<00:06:04.200> did<00:06:04.470> earlier<00:06:04.860> when<00:06:05.160> we

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
same thing that we did earlier when we

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.100 
same thing that we did earlier when we
were<00:06:05.460> putting<00:06:05.910> it<00:06:06.120> across<00:06:06.390> our<00:06:06.660> head<00:06:06.840> twice

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
were putting it across our head twice

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.130 
were putting it across our head twice
it's<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:07.740> exact<00:06:08.010> same<00:06:08.040> thing<00:06:08.280> so<00:06:08.840> once<00:06:09.840> you<00:06:09.990> do

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
it's the exact same thing so once you do

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.600 
it's the exact same thing so once you do
that<00:06:10.170> it'll<00:06:10.620> come<00:06:10.890> out<00:06:10.920> looking<00:06:11.370> something

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
that it'll come out looking something

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.510 
that it'll come out looking something
like<00:06:11.790> this<00:06:12.380> so<00:06:13.380> just<00:06:13.590> to<00:06:13.710> illustrate<00:06:13.830> this<00:06:14.280> one

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
like this so just to illustrate this one

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.100 
like this so just to illustrate this one
more<00:06:14.700> time<00:06:14.910> you<00:06:15.270> want<00:06:15.450> to<00:06:15.540> twist<00:06:15.690> it<00:06:15.900> and<00:06:15.990> make

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
more time you want to twist it and make

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.560 
more time you want to twist it and make
like<00:06:16.260> an<00:06:16.530> infinity<00:06:17.070> symbol<00:06:17.280> and<00:06:17.670> then<00:06:18.180> twist

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
like an infinity symbol and then twist

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.810 
like an infinity symbol and then twist
it<00:06:18.720> again<00:06:18.840> then<00:06:19.710> you're<00:06:19.860> going<00:06:20.040> to<00:06:20.160> stack<00:06:20.490> the

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
it again then you're going to stack the

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.610 
it again then you're going to stack the
part<00:06:21.060> that<00:06:21.240> has<00:06:21.360> the<00:06:21.660> seam<00:06:21.870> on<00:06:21.900> it<00:06:22.170> underneath

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
part that has the seam on it underneath

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.570 
part that has the seam on it underneath
the<00:06:22.980> other<00:06:23.130> side<00:06:23.490> so<00:06:23.730> you<00:06:23.790> can<00:06:24.030> hide<00:06:24.210> the<00:06:24.390> seam

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
the other side so you can hide the seam

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.160 
the other side so you can hide the seam
so<00:06:26.580> once<00:06:26.790> you've<00:06:26.910> got<00:06:27.120> that<00:06:27.300> all<00:06:27.360> done<00:06:27.510> what

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
so once you've got that all done what

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.660 
so once you've got that all done what
