00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 a greeting to all readers of 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.029
 hdblog from iron man 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.710
 because we have two lamps a phone 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.620
 on the table because today we go to 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.349
 review phillips you feel y sistema di 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.059
 domotica obviously very light motive 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.740
 which allows us to replace ours 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.740
 old light bulbs these from those that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.779
 we used before with a new type of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.390
 light bulb in the package are included 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.210
 three are of this form and are lamps 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.660
 intelligent because intelligent because 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.830
 through these three bulbs and a 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.460
 controller that goes to stick to the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.829
 our router creates a system there 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.399
 allows you to wirelessly monitor the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.910
 lamp light through ours 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.910
 smartphone 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.020
 let's see how the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.969
 simply the system boots 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.280
 our package is installed 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.100
 3 bulbs if we have only three 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 or we can buy others separately 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.420
 and control and in any case bears a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.890
 number greater than 3 we go to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.260
 simply unscrew the old one 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.869
 light bulb inhabiting that new attack e 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.790
 what stars we usually stick to 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.920
 controller download the application 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.920
 let's go immediately to see its functions 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.840
 first let's start with the settings 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.299
 settings that allow us to go 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.290
 to let the phone recognize the bridge 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.270
 that the control of which we spoke and 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.890
 recognize the bulbs if then in a 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.930
 second time we want to add some 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.190
 new we can simply re-click 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.690
 on the button find new bulbs 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.720
 the application comes with this 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.640
 window interface each of 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.590
 these windows the reality a pre set 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.240
 so we simply click 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.950
 above we are going to vary the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.380
 brightness now you can see a reflection 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.030
 on my hands and red because this 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.120
 nativity set the three bulbs on 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.860
 three colors all tending to red if 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.350
 we go back and go for 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.240
 example select blue you see that the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.580
 blue crib has changed now there is this 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.630
 similar violet effect on mine 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.310
 hands 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.259
 we can for example go to choose 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.990
 a neutral light therefore a light more on the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.360
 white for example on this present in 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.340
 particular there are four options 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.530
 different or a relaxing light one for the 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.600
 voice more than I have more brought to make us 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.330
 concentrate more clear then more 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.360
 brilliant the energizing light and one 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.040
 light that allows you to read better 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.830
 so hardly the eye when you are less 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.410
 go to read all these options then 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.630
 all cribs can be scheduled 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.700
 with the new application ie the new one 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.200
 application update we can 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.940
 create an effect similar to that of 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.100
 wake up light which is always a product 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.010
 by philips that in addition to the alarm clock 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.330
 also associated a gradual a gradual 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.920
 turning on the light he had 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.290
 integrated to create an effect 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.720
 similar to that of the sun entering from 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.210
 window at dawn here we can precisely 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.420
 use the alarm function e 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.660
 now we have not set it but it will be enough 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.820
 simply set the time of 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.230
 wake up and the light will go on 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.000
 beyond the alarm clock there is also, for example 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.220
 in Italy we cannot therefore make it payable 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.960
 set a timer for our lights 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.090
 by clicking on the lamp button we can 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.010
 go and choose which of the lights here 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.260
 we have three but if we had 5 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.210
 it would be the same thing as lights 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.650
 in this scene they must light must 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.300
 turn on for example if we set the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.170
 scene just for the living room where we have 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.170
 two lights we will turn off the light 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.640
 of the room this allows 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.860
 turn on the physical switch 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.650
 lights and then forget about it because everything 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.030
 it is managed via smartphone in fact 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.700
 right now the lights are on 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.220
 you can see the shadows on the hand if we 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.170
 click on the button turn off turns off 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.840
 all automatically beyond 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.820
 switching off and on so I am now 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.560
 all the lights out we can turn them on 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.740
 also individually therefore in this 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.410
 In case we are going to turn on just one 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.990
 of the two lights of the living room or alone 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.070
 all the living room lights or alone 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.070
 the light of the room 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.500
 another particularity and the possibility 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.760
 to modulate light intensity 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.760
 so we will go to 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.630
 choose a softer light as you can 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.060
 see right now or 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.430
 gradually increase its intensity on 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.380
 all for every single light then every 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.840
 single item can be modulated a 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.600
 our liking and beyond that 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.540
 we can use the presets we see 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.820
 here therefore what for example the 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.890
 reference to the sea with more shades 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.250
 blue one that recalls the mountain then 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.510
 with light blue and white and so on 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.460
 saying but we can also go 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.040
 simply to create a new scene 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.370
 choosing an image from the library 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:05.190
 go to procure is one example 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:10.650
 here we have green or here we have 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:13.770
 of red we resize our own 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.290
 image and choose which lights should 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.450
 to belong to this scene simply 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.730
 moving the cursor we see that the 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.070
 our light number 2 must be red 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.090
 our light number 3 must be 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.270
 we save this basin e 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.240
 we give a name is automatically 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.130
 clicking on the scene all the lights that 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.780
 we set it fit on that 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.850
 color therefore a system enough 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.880
 simple really easy to control 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.919
 one click to turn off a click to 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.690
 re-light on a given scene 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.550
 interesting indeed the possibility of 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.800
 therefore modulate for example if we go to 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.229
 see a movie we can turn down 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.419
 the intensity and create an effect that 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.940
 however it does not tire the eyes but 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:03.889
 let not have that glare 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.360
 of the lights therefore phillips this 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.639
 is our system review really 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.580
 simple to make the smarter 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.470
 home and all in figures that are not 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.600
 really exaggerated we talk about 200 euros 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.690
 around 100 euros for the kit with three 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.550
 bulbs the controller the application is 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.110
 obviously free 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.060
 another interesting thing that you 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.940
 we update before you leave is that who 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.760
 he has a philips tv with ambilight then 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.940
 with the halo of light around the screen 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.870
 from 2011 onwards then a my model 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.030
 2011 and later can be added to fil 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.750
 y the youtube application 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:45.110
 This is the handy light application 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:48.200
 in practice it allows to connect 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.970
 then accompany the TV to the light anbi 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.430
 of the TV allows you to add to the 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.400
 bild of the tv also the lights so if in 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.979
 hall we have a light on the right and one 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.139
 left of the TV the ambilight will be 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.490
 the effect will be much more amplified 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:04.520
 much nicer and much more 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.320
 cinematographic well with the fil y is everything 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.889
 greetings to all readers of hdblog e 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.889
