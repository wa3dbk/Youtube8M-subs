this<00:00:26.099> theory<00:00:26.460> suggests<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.689> player

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
this theory suggests that you the player

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.620 
this theory suggests that you the player
has<00:00:28.560> killed<00:00:28.859> Gary's<00:00:29.369> beloved<00:00:29.849> Rattata<00:00:30.300> which

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
later evolved to eradicate evidence

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.520 
later evolved to eradicate evidence
supporting<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.390> theory<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
supporting this theory is that in the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
supporting this theory is that in the
battle<00:00:34.800> between<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.520> Gary<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.000> the

pokemon tower eradicate is nowhere to be

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.340 
pokemon tower eradicate is nowhere to be
seen<00:00:38.550> due<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> fact<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.809> many<00:00:40.079> pokemon

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
seen due to the fact that many pokemon

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.380 
seen due to the fact that many pokemon
are<00:00:40.649> buried<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> pokemon<00:00:41.460> tower<00:00:41.670> one

could<00:00:42.600> suggest<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.649> ratchet<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.489> dead<00:00:44.940> this

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
could suggest that ratchet is dead this

could suggest that ratchet is dead this
brings<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.289> an<00:00:46.410> interesting<00:00:46.469> point<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.700> did

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
brings up an interesting point what did

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.180 
brings up an interesting point what did
happen<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.270> Gary's<00:00:48.690> Rattata<00:00:49.140> where<00:00:49.739> did<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.980> go

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
happen to Gary's Rattata where did it go

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.700 
happen to Gary's Rattata where did it go
I<00:00:50.750> suggest<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.870> has<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.379> him<00:00:52.500> being

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
I suggest that has to do with him being

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.650 
I suggest that has to do with him being

Rocket<00:05:01.720> is<00:05:02.260> that<00:05:02.500> almost<00:05:02.770> every<00:05:03.550> single<00:05:03.910> time

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
Rocket is that almost every single time

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.450 
Rocket is that almost every single time
that<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.480> encounter<00:05:04.900> Team<00:05:05.140> Rocket<00:05:05.530> gary<00:05:06.250> is

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
that you encounter Team Rocket gary is

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.580 
that you encounter Team Rocket gary is
present<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.180> only<00:05:07.390> time<00:05:07.630> that<00:05:07.660> Gary<00:05:08.170> is<00:05:08.290> not

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
present the only time that Gary is not

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.890

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
present when team rocket is is at the

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.170 
present when team rocket is is at the
game<00:05:11.080> corner<00:05:11.530> now<00:05:12.040> I<00:05:12.070> could<00:05:12.490> speculate<00:05:12.850> about

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
game corner now I could speculate about

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.280 
game corner now I could speculate about
why<00:05:13.540> he's<00:05:13.810> not<00:05:13.960> at<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.200> game<00:05:14.380> corner<00:05:15.780> my<00:05:16.780> main

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
why he's not at the game corner my main

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.680 
why he's not at the game corner my main
reason<00:05:17.560> for<00:05:17.770> thinking<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:18.820> according<00:05:19.660> to

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
reason for thinking this according to

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.750 
reason for thinking this according to
this<00:05:19.900> theory<00:05:20.169> is<00:05:20.320> that<00:05:20.500> he<00:05:21.250> doesn't<00:05:21.550> need<00:05:21.700> to

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
this theory is that he doesn't need to

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.120 
this theory is that he doesn't need to
be<00:05:22.090> there<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.330> mean<00:05:22.660> Team<00:05:23.440> Rocket<00:05:23.770> doesn't<00:05:24.040> need

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
be there I mean Team Rocket doesn't need

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.790 
be there I mean Team Rocket doesn't need
every<00:05:24.400> single<00:05:24.730> person<00:05:25.120> at<00:05:25.360> their<00:05:26.320> base<00:05:27.300> but<00:05:28.800> in

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
every single person at their base but in

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.340 
every single person at their base but in
all<00:05:29.950> honesty<00:05:30.550> I<00:05:30.580> mean<00:05:31.030> it's<00:05:31.300> an<00:05:31.540> inconsistency

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
all honesty I mean it's an inconsistency

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.310 
all honesty I mean it's an inconsistency
it<00:05:32.770> is<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.130> only<00:05:33.360> thing<00:05:34.360> pointing<00:05:34.960> towards

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
it is the only thing pointing towards

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.920 
it is the only thing pointing towards
this<00:05:35.470> theory<00:05:36.310> simply<00:05:36.850> just<00:05:37.120> being<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.540> theory

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
this theory simply just being a theory

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.820 
this theory simply just being a theory
but<00:05:38.290> it<00:05:38.410> is<00:05:38.650> interesting<00:05:39.390> how<00:05:40.390> he<00:05:41.110> is<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.650> last

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
but it is interesting how he is the last

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.340 
but it is interesting how he is the last
person<00:05:42.010> you<00:05:42.430> fight<00:05:42.729> before<00:05:43.150> Giovanni<00:05:44.050> in

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
person you fight before Giovanni in

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.730 
person you fight before Giovanni in
Saffron<00:05:45.010> City<00:05:45.540> another<00:05:46.540> tiny<00:05:46.960> detail<00:05:47.470> that

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
Saffron City another tiny detail that

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.260 
Saffron City another tiny detail that
also<00:05:48.160> could<00:05:48.310> point<00:05:48.520> to<00:05:48.610> him<00:05:48.790> being<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:49.120> member

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
also could point to him being a member

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.150 
also could point to him being a member
