00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.320 
time engineering I had seen at that time
a<00:02:19.020> prototype<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.490> PlayStation<00:02:21.060> which<00:02:21.210> was

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
a prototype of the PlayStation which was

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.100 
a prototype of the PlayStation which was
about<00:02:21.510> as<00:02:21.690> big<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.170> Xerox<00:02:22.920> machine<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:24.110> it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
about as big as a Xerox machine and it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.620 
about as big as a Xerox machine and it
looked<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.440> little<00:02:25.590> bit<00:02:25.800> like<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> Xerox<00:02:26.460> machine

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
looked a little bit like a Xerox machine

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.000 
looked a little bit like a Xerox machine
people<00:02:27.630> finally<00:02:27.870> believed<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.950> was

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
people finally believed that it was

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.340 
people finally believed that it was
possible<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.790> do<00:02:30.270> these<00:02:30.450> kinds<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.840> graphics

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
possible to do these kinds of graphics

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.530 
possible to do these kinds of graphics
and<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.190> kind<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.520> audio<00:02:32.820> quality<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.480> a

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
and have that kind of audio quality on a

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.270 
and have that kind of audio quality on a
platform<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.860> know<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.670> small<00:02:36.030> before<00:02:36.810> then

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
platform you know this small before then

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.010 
platform you know this small before then
but<00:02:38.280> before<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:38.760> had<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.150> physical<00:02:39.720> unit

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
but before we had this physical unit

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.800 
but before we had this physical unit
people<00:02:40.890> were<00:02:41.040> always<00:02:41.280> asking<00:02:41.400> well<00:02:41.970> yeah<00:02:42.300> okay

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
people were always asking well yeah okay

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.530 
people were always asking well yeah okay
so<00:02:42.990> you<00:02:43.230> can<00:02:43.410> do<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:44.250> box<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:44.760> big<00:02:44.970> can

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
so you can do it in a box this big can

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.380 
so you can do it in a box this big can
you<00:02:45.600> do<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.900> box<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.710> big<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.270> when<00:02:48.270> we

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
you do it in a box this big and when we

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.230 
you do it in a box this big and when we
finally<00:02:49.020> had<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.350> box<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.980> show<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.430> showed

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
finally had that box to show and showed

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.500 
finally had that box to show and showed
the<00:02:51.360> same<00:02:51.540> demonstration<00:02:52.460> software<00:02:53.510> people

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
the same demonstration software people

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.830 
the same demonstration software people
were<00:02:54.920> people<00:02:55.920> were<00:02:56.040> sold<00:02:56.330> because<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.450> 3d<00:02:57.690> ohs

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
were people were sold because of 3d ohs

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.620 
were people were sold because of 3d ohs
lack<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.680> success<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.730> had<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.970> overcome<00:03:00.390> the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
lack of success we had to overcome the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.660 
lack of success we had to overcome the
fact<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:01.050> oh<00:03:01.380> you're<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.100> another<00:03:02.310> three

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
fact that oh you're just another three

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.900 
fact that oh you're just another three
do<00:03:02.820> or<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.840> know<00:03:04.320> you're<00:03:04.830> just<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.190> all<00:03:05.400> the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
do or you know you're just like all the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.220 
do or you know you're just like all the
systems<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:06.330> had<00:03:06.480> come<00:03:06.600> before<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:07.110> had

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
systems that had come before that had

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.650 
systems that had come before that had
failed<00:03:07.550> what<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.670> Sony<00:03:08.880> know<00:03:09.120> about<00:03:09.360> video

failed what is Sony know about video

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.810 
failed what is Sony know about video
gaming<00:03:10.110> now<00:03:10.620> today<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.250> seems<00:03:11.520> completely

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
gaming now today that seems completely

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.120 
gaming now today that seems completely
ridiculous<00:03:12.450> we<00:03:13.230> were<00:03:13.350> trying<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.710> sell<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.040> as

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
ridiculous we were trying to sell it as

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.700 
ridiculous we were trying to sell it as
a<00:03:14.160> product<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:15.150> publishers<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:16.410> game

a product to publishers to game
developers<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.730> was<00:03:17.850> very<00:03:17.880> difficult<00:03:18.240> for<00:03:18.480> us

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
developers it was very difficult for us

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.110 
developers it was very difficult for us
to<00:03:18.720> overcome<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.830> success<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.490> Sega<00:03:20.820> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
to overcome the success of Sega the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.200 
to overcome the success of Sega the
success<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.720> Nintendo<00:03:22.320> we<00:03:22.830> had<00:03:22.950> really<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:24.180> a

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
success of Nintendo we had really do a

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.480 
success of Nintendo we had really do a
lot<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.930> convince<00:03:25.140> developers<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:26.040> we<00:03:26.280> were

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
lot to convince developers that we were

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.240 
lot to convince developers that we were
different<00:03:27.240> in<00:03:27.420> some<00:03:27.930> way<00:03:28.110> if<00:03:28.320> we<00:03:28.980> could

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
different in some way if we could

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.290 
different in some way if we could
convince<00:03:29.550> those<00:03:30.000> people<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:31.550> our<00:03:32.550> platform

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
convince those people that our platform

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.300 
convince those people that our platform
was<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.570> best<00:03:33.780> platform<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.440> work<00:03:34.560> on<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:35.250> we

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
was the best platform to work on that we

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.130 
was the best platform to work on that we
really<00:03:35.550> did<00:03:35.820> have<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:36.060> good<00:03:36.300> idea<00:03:36.630> about<00:03:36.810> how

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
really did have a good idea about how

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.290 
really did have a good idea about how
games<00:03:37.770> would<00:03:38.280> behave<00:03:38.580> in<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.820> future<00:03:38.850> and

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
games would behave in the future and

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.300 
games would behave in the future and
that<00:03:39.950> 3d<00:03:40.950> was<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.610> way<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.760> go<00:03:42.290> then<00:03:43.310> those

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
that 3d was the way to go then those

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.130 
that 3d was the way to go then those
same<00:03:44.580> developers<00:03:45.120> would<00:03:45.270> not<00:03:45.510> be<00:03:45.690> creating

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
same developers would not be creating

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.590 
same developers would not be creating
games<00:03:46.320> for<00:03:46.770> for<00:03:47.160> Sega<00:03:47.550> would<00:03:47.910> not<00:03:48.060> be<00:03:48.240> creating

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
games for for Sega would not be creating

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.960 
games for for Sega would not be creating
games<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:48.990> nintendo<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:50.430> was<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.730> that

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
games for nintendo and that was the that

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.400 
games for nintendo and that was the that
was<00:03:51.030> really<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.540> strategy<00:03:52.080> that<00:03:52.110> succeeded

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
was really the strategy that succeeded

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.560 
was really the strategy that succeeded

twenty-twenty so I think they made a
good<00:05:12.540> bet
