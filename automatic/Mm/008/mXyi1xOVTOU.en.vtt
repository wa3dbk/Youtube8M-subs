00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.570 

what's<00:00:08.400> up<00:00:08.580> guys<00:00:08.610> snow<00:00:09.179> gears<00:00:09.480> here<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:10.580> some

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
what's up guys snow gears here so some

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.999 
what's up guys snow gears here so some
people<00:00:11.849> have<00:00:11.940> been<00:00:12.000> asking<00:00:12.240> me<00:00:12.630> about<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
people have been asking me about the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.369 
people have been asking me about the
Minecraft<00:00:14.009> plug-in<00:00:14.429> API<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.990> thought<00:00:16.320> that

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
Minecraft plug-in API and I thought that

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.870 
Minecraft plug-in API and I thought that
I<00:00:16.590> would<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:16.920> make<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> video<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.550> it

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
I would just make a video of it

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.960 
I would just make a video of it
explaining<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.960> from<00:00:19.350> more<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.250> developer's

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
explaining it from more of a developer's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.230 
explaining it from more of a developer's
point<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.480> view<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:21.960> also<00:00:22.400> some<00:00:23.400> pretty<00:00:24.119> good

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
point of view but also some pretty good

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.880 
point of view but also some pretty good
stuff<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.750> users<00:00:25.170> are<00:00:25.350> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.560> want<00:00:25.800> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
stuff that users are going to want to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.700 
stuff that users are going to want to
know<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.330> future<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.750> Minecraft<00:00:30.590> so<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
know for the future of Minecraft so the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.440 
know for the future of Minecraft so the
plug-in<00:00:32.070> API<00:00:32.189> was<00:00:32.669> originally<00:00:33.239> called

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
plug-in API was originally called

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.049 
plug-in API was originally called
workbench<00:00:34.410> but<00:00:34.829> that's<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.130> working<00:00:35.520> name<00:00:35.700> so

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
workbench but that's a working name so

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.729 
workbench but that's a working name so
it<00:00:36.180> may<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.570> called<00:00:36.989> workbench<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
it may not be called workbench in the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.020 
it may not be called workbench in the
future<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:39.260> basically<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.559> an<00:00:40.800> API<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.430> is

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
future but basically what an API is is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.580 
future but basically what an API is is
it's<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.989> set<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.530> methods<00:00:44.160> created<00:00:45.149> by<00:00:45.590> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it's a set of methods created by a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.580 
it's a set of methods created by a
program<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.670> other<00:00:48.090> developers<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.960> use<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
program for other developers to use and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.639 
program for other developers to use and
what<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.520> would<00:00:50.730> allow<00:00:50.940> us<00:00:51.780> developers<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
what this would allow us developers to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.760 
what this would allow us developers to
do<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.100> make<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.000> some<00:00:54.300> pretty<00:00:54.539> awesome<00:00:54.780> mods

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
do is make you some pretty awesome mods

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250 
do is make you some pretty awesome mods
that<00:00:56.250> essentially<00:00:57.180> would<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.539> able<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.930> be

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that essentially would be able to be

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.369 
that essentially would be able to be
installed<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:59.070> your<00:00:59.100> server<00:01:00.140> much<00:01:01.140> like

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
installed on your server much like

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.299 
installed on your server much like
texture<00:01:01.859> packs<00:01:02.129> are<00:01:02.430> currently<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
texture packs are currently so as you

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.140 
texture packs are currently so as you
can<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.610> by<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:07.159> screenshot<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.939> what

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
can see by this screenshot this is what

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.719 
can see by this screenshot this is what
the<00:01:09.360> texture<00:01:09.840> packs<00:01:10.170> look<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.369> right<00:01:11.670> now

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the texture packs look like right now

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.750 
the texture packs look like right now
when<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:13.080> enter<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> server<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.010> they<00:01:14.189> suggest

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
when you enter a server and they suggest

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270 
when you enter a server and they suggest
a<00:01:15.000> texture<00:01:15.540> pack<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:16.470> want<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.070> use

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
a texture pack that they want you to use

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.590 
a texture pack that they want you to use
but<00:01:18.350> essentially<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.470> future<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
but essentially in the future this is a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.469 
but essentially in the future this is a
little<00:01:21.900> mock-up<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> made<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:24.150> is

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
little mock-up that I made but this is

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.320 
little mock-up that I made but this is
what<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.320> come<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.920> expect<00:01:26.369> joining<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
what you can come to expect joining a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.020 
what you can come to expect joining a
server<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.960> has<00:01:28.280> custom<00:01:29.280> client-side

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
server that has custom client-side

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.020 
server that has custom client-side
plugins<00:01:30.659> installed<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:32.009> will<00:01:32.040> ask<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
plugins installed it will ask you to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.539 
plugins installed it will ask you to
install<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.810> client<00:01:34.049> side<00:01:34.439> plugins<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.189> if

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
install the client side plugins and if

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.719 
install the client side plugins and if
you<00:01:35.670> don't<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.869> may<00:01:37.290> kick<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.070> from<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you don't then it may kick you from the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
you don't then it may kick you from the
server<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.390> those<00:01:40.290> are<00:01:40.439> required<00:01:40.829> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
server because those are required to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.240 
server because those are required to
play<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.700> specific<00:01:42.270> thing<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:43.530> API<00:01:43.920> will

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
play on that specific thing the API will

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.660 
play on that specific thing the API will
also<00:01:44.610> allow<00:01:45.049> developers<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> easily<00:01:46.770> add<00:01:47.369> more

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
also allow developers to easily add more

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
also allow developers to easily add more
content<00:01:47.970> into<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> game<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:52.110> best

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
content into the game so a the best

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.929 
content into the game so a the best
example<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.310> off<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.460> top<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.790> my

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
example I can think of off the top of my

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.399 
example I can think of off the top of my
head<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:55.399> like<00:01:56.399> say<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.930> wanted<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
head is just if like say you wanted the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.499 
head is just if like say you wanted the
mo<00:01:58.590> creatures<00:01:58.950> mod<00:01:59.399> installed<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.450> your

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
mo creatures mod installed on your

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.789 
mo creatures mod installed on your
server<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:03.000> didn't<00:02:03.420> want<00:02:03.689> people<00:02:04.560> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
server but you didn't want people to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.370 
server but you didn't want people to
have<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.250> modify<00:02:05.640> their<00:02:06.030> minecraft.jar<00:02:06.719> file

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
have to modify their minecraft.jar file

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.770 
have to modify their minecraft.jar file
which<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.489> lot<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.879> people<00:02:09.000> don't<00:02:09.479> know<00:02:09.599> how<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
which a lot of people don't know how to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.559 
which a lot of people don't know how to
do<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.289> that's<00:02:10.470> how<00:02:10.970> currently<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.120> mods<00:02:12.360> are

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
do but that's how currently the mods are

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.790 
do but that's how currently the mods are
installed<00:02:12.599> which<00:02:13.200> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
installed which is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.720 
installed which is
pretty<00:02:15.050> pretty<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.680> it's<00:02:17.430> not<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.790> best<00:02:18.000> way

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
pretty pretty it's it's not the best way

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.680 
pretty pretty it's it's not the best way
essentially<00:02:20.730> they<00:02:20.970> could<00:02:21.150> make<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.480> much

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
essentially they could make it much

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.960 
essentially they could make it much
easier<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.380> API<00:02:22.710> because<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.640> users

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
easier with this API because the users

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.790 
easier with this API because the users
would<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.630> almost<00:02:24.960> no<00:02:25.200> work<00:02:25.380> on<00:02:25.560> there

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
would have to do almost no work on there

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.190 
would have to do almost no work on there
and<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.310> click<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.210> yes<00:02:27.420> button<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.930> install

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
and just click the yes button to install

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.160 
and just click the yes button to install
certain<00:02:28.800> plugins<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.810> they<00:02:30.810> would<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:30.960> be

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
certain plugins and they would just be

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.750 
certain plugins and they would just be
automatically<00:02:31.620> installed<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.610> would<00:02:32.730> be

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
automatically installed and you would be

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.970 
automatically installed and you would be
able<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.270> get<00:02:33.630> access<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:34.380> those<00:02:34.590> specific

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
able to get access to those specific

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.260 
able to get access to those specific
things<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.080> server<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:38.700> what<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.060> will

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
things on the server so what this will

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.360 
things on the server so what this will
mean<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.630> servers<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.380> future<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:41.070> that

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
mean for servers in the future is that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.630 
mean for servers in the future is that
they<00:02:42.000> will<00:02:42.210> have<00:02:44.060> incredible<00:02:45.060> content<00:02:45.630> like

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
they will have incredible content like

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.310 
they will have incredible content like
even<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.730> plugins<00:02:48.090> now<00:02:48.330> are<00:02:48.600> pretty<00:02:48.840> good<00:02:49.050> but

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
even the plugins now are pretty good but

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.590 
even the plugins now are pretty good but
those<00:02:49.680> are<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:49.950> server-side<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.450> they're

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
those are just server-side so they're

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.930 
those are just server-side so they're
using<00:02:51.740> elements<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.980> minecraft<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.850> are

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
using elements of minecraft that are

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.180 
using elements of minecraft that are
already<00:02:54.180> pre-programmed<00:02:55.140> into<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.770> game<00:02:55.920> and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
already pre-programmed into the game and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.930 
already pre-programmed into the game and
just<00:02:56.480> modifying<00:02:57.480> them<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.170> way<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.940> users

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
just modifying them in a way that users

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.560 
just modifying them in a way that users
don't<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.570> install<00:03:00.840> client<00:03:01.140> side<00:03:01.530> mods

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
don't have to install client side mods

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.360 
don't have to install client side mods
so<00:03:03.570> this<00:03:03.750> API<00:03:04.170> has<00:03:04.440> been<00:03:04.650> planned<00:03:05.160> since

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
so this API has been planned since

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.360 
so this API has been planned since
around<00:03:06.240> July<00:03:06.930> fifth<00:03:07.610> 2010<00:03:08.610> which<00:03:09.510> would<00:03:10.470> kind

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
around July fifth 2010 which would kind

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.190 
around July fifth 2010 which would kind
of<00:03:11.430> give<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.790> an<00:03:11.970> idea<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.330> how<00:03:12.540> long<00:03:12.600> they've

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
of give you an idea of how long they've

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.850 
of give you an idea of how long they've
been<00:03:13.230> working<00:03:13.740> on<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:15.440> I'm<00:03:16.440> actually

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
been working on this and I'm actually

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.100 
been working on this and I'm actually
kind<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.430> surprised<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.390> hasn't<00:03:18.690> come

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
kind of surprised that it hasn't come

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.640 
kind of surprised that it hasn't come
out<00:03:19.260> right<00:03:19.560> by<00:03:19.980> now<00:03:20.160> because<00:03:21.350> minecraft<00:03:22.350> and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
out right by now because minecraft and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.699 
out right by now because minecraft and
mojang<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.790> matter<00:03:24.000> have<00:03:24.270> made<00:03:24.560> millions<00:03:25.560> of

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
mojang that matter have made millions of

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.610 
mojang that matter have made millions of
dollars<00:03:25.770> in<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.760> last<00:03:27.000> few<00:03:27.330> years<00:03:27.390> from<00:03:27.959> just

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
dollars in the last few years from just

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.690 
dollars in the last few years from just
minecraft<00:03:29.130> alone<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:32.340> fact<00:03:32.580> that

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
minecraft alone and the fact that

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.330 
minecraft alone and the fact that
they're<00:03:32.910> not<00:03:33.030> using<00:03:33.239> more<00:03:33.600> resources<00:03:34.340> toward

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
they're not using more resources toward

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.390 
they're not using more resources toward
this<00:03:36.140> incredible<00:03:37.140> new<00:03:37.290> system<00:03:37.890> which<00:03:38.190> will

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
this incredible new system which will

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.060 
this incredible new system which will
allow<00:03:38.520> for<00:03:38.940> servers<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.050> have<00:03:40.170> amazing<00:03:40.680> new

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
allow for servers to have amazing new

this<00:03:52.170> video<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.860> just<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.870> put<00:03:54.870> more<00:03:55.050> resources

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
this video is just to put more resources

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.550 
this video is just to put more resources
into<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:56.160> because<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.940> will<00:03:57.180> definitely<00:03:57.750> amp

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
into it because this will definitely amp

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.520 
into it because this will definitely amp
up<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.580> whole<00:03:59.820> experience<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.720> servers<00:04:01.170> as<00:04:01.470> a

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
up the whole experience of servers as a

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.340 
up the whole experience of servers as a
whole<00:04:02.450> another<00:04:03.450> cool<00:04:03.780> thing<00:04:03.810> that's<00:04:04.170> going<00:04:04.320> to

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
whole another cool thing that's going to

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.320 
whole another cool thing that's going to
be<00:04:04.470> happening<00:04:04.650> with<00:04:05.010> this<00:04:05.190> API<00:04:05.580> is<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
be happening with this API is that the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.240 
be happening with this API is that the
minecraft<00:04:06.959> website<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.709> actually<00:04:07.890> going<00:04:08.190> to

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
minecraft website is actually going to

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.410 
minecraft website is actually going to
be<00:04:08.310> redone<00:04:09.230> but<00:04:10.700> mojang<00:04:11.700> is<00:04:12.000> going<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.300> be

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
be redone but mojang is going to be

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.960 
be redone but mojang is going to be
hosting<00:04:12.720> all<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.620> plugins<00:04:13.890> on<00:04:14.280> their<00:04:14.519> website

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
hosting all the plugins on their website

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.720 
hosting all the plugins on their website
to<00:04:15.209> make<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.720> more<00:04:16.140> secure<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.830> so<00:04:17.519> that

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
to make it more secure and so that

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.449 
to make it more secure and so that
people<00:04:18.030> don't<00:04:18.900> download<00:04:19.230> viruses<00:04:20.040> with<00:04:20.280> these

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
people don't download viruses with these

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.630 
people don't download viruses with these
plugins<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:21.540> they<00:04:21.720> will<00:04:21.870> essentially<00:04:22.260> be

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
plugins so they will essentially be

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.070 
plugins so they will essentially be
controlling<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.970> whole<00:04:24.210> plug-in

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
controlling the whole plug-in

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.390 
controlling the whole plug-in
distribution<00:04:25.830> unless

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
distribution unless

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.490 
distribution unless
you<00:04:26.520> get<00:04:26.790> it<00:04:27.090> from<00:04:27.360> an<00:04:27.600> external<00:04:28.199> website

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
you get it from an external website

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.879 
you get it from an external website
which<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:28.949> very<00:04:29.550> well<00:04:29.820> may<00:04:30.120> be<00:04:30.410> able<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.650> do

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
which you very well may be able to do

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.280 
which you very well may be able to do
because<00:04:32.639> it's<00:04:33.240> not<00:04:33.360> like<00:04:33.570> they<00:04:33.750> can<00:04:33.780> control

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
because it's not like they can control

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.930 
because it's not like they can control
the<00:04:34.440> internet<00:04:34.860> it's<00:04:35.340> just<00:04:35.610> they're<00:04:35.759> going<00:04:35.880> to

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
the internet it's just they're going to

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.170 
the internet it's just they're going to
be<00:04:36.030> controlling<00:04:36.509> the<00:04:36.630> flow<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:36.960> plugins<00:04:37.770> that

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
multiplayer but i'm guessing that for

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.610 
multiplayer but i'm guessing that for
the<00:05:22.110> multiplayer<00:05:22.650> there<00:05:23.430> is<00:05:23.550> going<00:05:23.789> to<00:05:24.060> be

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
the multiplayer there is going to be

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.659 
the multiplayer there is going to be
that<00:05:25.639> initial<00:05:26.639> dialog<00:05:27.060> box<00:05:27.330> with<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:28.669> with

that initial dialog box with the with

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.040 
that initial dialog box with the with
the<00:05:29.820> thing<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.180> says<00:05:30.389> plugins<00:05:30.900> are

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
the thing that says plugins are

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.330 
the thing that says plugins are
installed<00:05:31.080> on<00:05:31.530> this<00:05:31.680> server<00:05:31.919> that<00:05:32.250> are
