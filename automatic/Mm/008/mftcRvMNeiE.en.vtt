00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.020
 hermine granger is one of the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.120
 most popular characters from the harry 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.830
 potter universe and her magic wand is 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.320
 consequently also one of the most popular 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.089
 at the elbe forest and the time one 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.130
 a bit more precise and exactly in the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.840
 so-called character edition that comes 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.490
 because of its beautiful pub packaging there 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.439
 is also directly from the beautiful again 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.289
 name on it however in English with 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.300
 the additional hermine granger 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.400
 so must be pronounced and if we do that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 then we also see the directly 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.840
 magic wand is an exact replica 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.160
 from the movie and that would have been synonymous 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.809
 very good in that means if you want 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 You could put that right on the wall 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.010
 make without it from field and if 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.559
 to do that then comes an even 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.730
 the obligatory name tag benefits 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.200
 you can just because then 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.520
 off cliffs and then sees a 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.079
 little fancier and you know before 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.100
 Everything immediately belongs next to the magic wand 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.170
 even if you just now 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.719
 forgot or if visitors comodi 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.489
 I know but so to the magic wand 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.170
 view that as already said 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.660
 an exact replica of the movie 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.850
 An official replica looks like one 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.680
 it knows and that now stands out one 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.810
 Although special plastic looks like 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.520
 would be made of wood but that will not be in 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.140
 so-called cold cast procedure 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.760
 that is where it is made 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.500
 plastic can not be heated that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.330
 is shaped and that's why it looks like this 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.799
 looks like it has also a 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.970
 Metal core in the middle 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.860
 that gives the whole a bit 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.750
 But stability also ensures that he 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.460
 it can be fragile 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.900
 so you should not magic wand 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.150
 deal with fencing or big 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.710
 drop height but only loose 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.299
 But that's a lot going on in the air 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.090
 more competent if you are a magician 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.229
 but now I want to hermine why the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.250
 actually so popular 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.900
 So I can only do that now 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.189
 a little bit from my perspective 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.770
 I think they actually have it 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.020
 really cool because they are so because they are very 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.540
 early character shows yes you think back 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.950
 as the first book he takes the blame 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.420
 as the matter with the troll in 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 dungeons then train the teachers 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.350
 found and wanted Harry should be straight 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.670
 but she has the punishment 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.770
 all blame and that 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.659
 even though she still works at the time 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.520
 was not friends with Harry and Ron 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.409
 it's actually the clever one of that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.810
 trio yes so almost a bit the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.670
 sensible but she is at the same time 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.360
 also the ones the gentlemen and to the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.950
 instigate really big rule violations 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.650
 think back as a second book with the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.550
 meaningful crap that finds 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.500
 actually relaxing because she 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.870
 actually should be the one who 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.340
 I have to follow the rules and that's what I want 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.930
 even the really great I think that if 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.910
 she has something in mind 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.890
 then she stays with you more 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.720
 for example from the fourth book 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.570
 for example, they accept as an example 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.950
 elfen bund da founded this bfr 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.830
 or how to pronounce it correctly 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.750
 peffermann fans you know exactly 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.160
 and as he fights for the elves quasi 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.709
 Nobody cares like that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.570
 really but years later after 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.670
 wanted murder was defeated 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.350
 14 ministry and both 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.660
 Departments for the management and supervision of 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.760
 magical creatures and there sat down 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.900
 stop synonymous for elves right 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.900
 So one which I find really good
