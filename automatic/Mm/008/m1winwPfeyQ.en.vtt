celebrity sort of like added events that

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.189 
celebrity sort of like added events that
style<00:00:57.249> is<00:00:57.489> their<00:00:57.940> style<00:00:58.329> but<00:00:58.479> you<00:00:58.929> know<00:00:59.050> they

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
style is their style but you know they

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.809 
style is their style but you know they
probably<00:00:59.379> had<00:00:59.679> the<00:00:59.710> help<00:00:59.979> of<00:01:00.039> a<00:01:00.309> stylist

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
probably had the help of a stylist

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:03.090 
probably had the help of a stylist
whereas<00:01:01.539> looking<00:01:01.839> at<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.440> style<00:01:02.739> that<00:01:02.859> they

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
whereas looking at the style that they

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.100 
whereas looking at the style that they
wear<00:01:03.309> on<00:01:03.579> a<00:01:03.639> day-to-day<00:01:04.120> basis<00:01:04.780> it's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
wear on a day-to-day basis it's

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.810 
wear on a day-to-day basis it's
definitely<00:01:05.680> more<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:05.950> their<00:01:06.190> own<00:01:06.340> sort<00:01:06.640> of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
definitely more of their own sort of

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.580 
definitely more of their own sort of
creation<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:07.510> i<00:01:07.540> think<00:01:07.660> it's<00:01:07.960> probably<00:01:08.140> closer

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
creation so i think it's probably closer

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.160 
creation so i think it's probably closer
to<00:01:08.740> their<00:01:09.040> own<00:01:09.220> actual<00:01:10.150> style<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:10.780> we<00:01:11.050> all

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
to their own actual style and we all

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.680

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.569 

like<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.869> said<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.380> really<00:01:28.649> like<00:01:29.009> morons

laid-back style I think it's kind of

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.109 
laid-back style I think it's kind of
unique<00:01:31.590> especially<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.369> Hollywood<00:01:32.789> to<00:01:32.969> be

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
unique especially in Hollywood to be

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.450 
unique especially in Hollywood to be
sort<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.390> minimalist<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.649> in<00:01:35.039> order<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
sort of minimalist so in order to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.399 
sort of minimalist so in order to
recreate<00:01:36.119> her<00:01:36.299> look<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.689> first<00:01:36.899> thing<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.200> did

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
recreate her look the first thing I did

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
recreate her look the first thing I did
was<00:01:37.560> pull<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:37.890> hair<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.369> ponytail<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.030> it's

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
was pull my hair in a ponytail and it's

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.270 
was pull my hair in a ponytail and it's
parted<00:01:39.420> down<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> middle<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.829> put<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.130> some

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280

big<00:01:41.429> sunglasses<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:42.360> she<00:01:42.600> probably<00:01:42.780> wears

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
big sunglasses which she probably wears

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.370 
big sunglasses which she probably wears
to<00:01:43.350> avoid<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> Sun<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.220> paparazzi<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.380> I

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
to avoid the Sun and the paparazzi and I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.779 
to avoid the Sun and the paparazzi and I
matched<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.770> bag<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.220> belt<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.490> were<00:01:47.640> the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
has on a brown bag much like the other

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.070 
has on a brown bag much like the other
one<00:03:11.500> but<00:03:11.710> it<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.130> across<00:03:12.670> her<00:03:12.910> body<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.930> has

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
one but it is across her body and it has

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.450 
one but it is across her body and it has
a<00:03:14.110> little<00:03:14.290> straps<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.890> like<00:03:15.040> mine<00:03:15.220> does<00:03:15.400> too
