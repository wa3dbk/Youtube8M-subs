00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.990 
does have a multiplayer-focused so you

so<00:00:22.750> one<00:00:22.930> of<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.079> difficulties<00:00:23.500> that<00:00:23.590> we've

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
so one of the difficulties that we've

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.470 
so one of the difficulties that we've
had<00:00:23.950> in<00:00:24.009> promoting<00:00:24.430> the<00:00:24.669> game<00:00:24.849> is<00:00:25.029> that<00:00:25.180> people

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
had in promoting the game is that people

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.600 
had in promoting the game is that people
have<00:00:26.020> this<00:00:26.230> preconception<00:00:26.980> that<00:00:27.220> melee

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
have this preconception that melee

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.609 
have this preconception that melee
combat<00:00:27.910> sucks<00:00:28.300> because<00:00:28.630> in<00:00:28.899> most<00:00:29.020> games<00:00:29.230> it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
combat sucks because in most games it

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.200 
combat sucks because in most games it
does<00:00:29.800> because<00:00:30.250> it's<00:00:30.430> thrown<00:00:30.669> in<00:00:30.820> on<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:31.060> end

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
does because it's thrown in on the end

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.450 
does because it's thrown in on the end
is<00:00:31.360> something<00:00:31.599> that<00:00:31.689> they<00:00:31.809> don't<00:00:31.899> focus<00:00:32.140> on

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
is something that they don't focus on

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.650 
is something that they don't focus on
and<00:00:33.460> that's<00:00:33.610> really<00:00:33.790> unfortunate<00:00:34.090> but<00:00:34.480> with

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
and that's really unfortunate but with

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.540 
and that's really unfortunate but with
chivalry<00:00:34.960> we've<00:00:35.440> really<00:00:35.680> made<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:36.010> core

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
chivalry we've really made the core

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.369 
chivalry we've really made the core
focus<00:00:37.000> of<00:00:37.360> the<00:00:37.480> game<00:00:37.660> and<00:00:37.840> all<00:00:37.929> our<00:00:38.079> design

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
focus of the game and all our design

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.560 
focus of the game and all our design
efforts<00:00:38.769> towards<00:00:39.100> making<00:00:39.280> melee<00:00:39.910> combat<00:00:40.210> fun

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
efforts towards making melee combat fun

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.630 
efforts towards making melee combat fun
so<00:00:41.170> we've<00:00:41.320> designed<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.920> entire<00:00:42.219> combat

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
so we've designed the entire combat

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.520 
so we've designed the entire combat
system<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.179> try<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.539> capture<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.989> feel<00:00:44.379> that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
system to try and capture the feel that

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.709 
system to try and capture the feel that
you<00:00:44.620> get<00:00:44.859> from<00:00:44.890> medieval<00:00:45.579> combat<00:00:46.089> movies

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
you get from medieval combat movies

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.990 
you get from medieval combat movies
where<00:00:47.289> you<00:00:47.320> see<00:00:47.649> these<00:00:47.800> epic<00:00:48.550> fights<00:00:48.820> between

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
where you see these epic fights between

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.209 
where you see these epic fights between
guys<00:00:49.300> going<00:00:49.660> back<00:00:49.839> and<00:00:50.050> forth<00:00:50.320> with<00:00:50.559> exchanges

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
guys going back and forth with exchanges

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.369 
guys going back and forth with exchanges
of<00:00:51.249> blocks<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.910> parries<00:00:52.269> attacking<00:00:53.260> each

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
of blocks and parries attacking each

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.380 
of blocks and parries attacking each
other<00:00:53.499> ducking<00:00:53.949> under<00:00:54.160> blows<00:00:54.429> we're<00:00:55.149> trying

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
other ducking under blows we're trying

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.209 
other ducking under blows we're trying
to<00:00:55.570> bring<00:00:55.839> that<00:00:56.079> experience<00:00:56.289> those<00:00:56.829> epic

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
to bring that experience those epic

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.950 
to bring that experience those epic
moments<00:00:57.640> that<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:57.850> get<00:00:58.030> from<00:00:58.059> movies<00:00:58.629> in<00:00:58.899> the

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
moments that you get from movies in the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.619 
moments that you get from movies in the
medieval<00:00:59.289> and<00:00:59.530> pre<00:00:59.679> medieval<00:01:00.100> era<00:01:00.280> like<00:01:00.850> 300

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
medieval and pre medieval era like 300

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.170 
medieval and pre medieval era like 300
Troy<00:01:01.989> gladiator<00:01:02.649> King<00:01:03.039> Arthur<00:01:03.399> and<00:01:03.550> bring

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
Troy gladiator King Arthur and bring

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.420 
Troy gladiator King Arthur and bring
that<00:01:04.420> to<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.720> hands<00:01:05.080> of<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.230> gamer<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.980> to<00:01:06.280> do

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
that to the hands of a gamer and to do

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.520 
that to the hands of a gamer and to do
that<00:01:06.580> we<00:01:06.820> had<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.030> do<00:01:07.510> it<00:01:07.690> in<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.900> way<00:01:08.050> that<00:01:08.080> it's

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
that we had to do it in a way that it's

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.010 
that we had to do it in a way that it's
not<00:01:08.650> pure<00:01:08.950> realism<00:01:09.280> it's<00:01:09.640> not<00:01:10.090> pure<00:01:10.570> arcade

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
not pure realism it's not pure arcade

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.109 
not pure realism it's not pure arcade
it's<00:01:11.320> somewhere<00:01:11.799> in<00:01:11.860> between<00:01:12.009> and<00:01:12.579> all<00:01:12.939> the

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
it's somewhere in between and all the

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.060 
it's somewhere in between and all the
timings<00:01:13.570> are<00:01:13.689> based<00:01:13.869> on<00:01:14.079> human<00:01:14.530> reaction<00:01:15.040> time

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
timings are based on human reaction time

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.219 
timings are based on human reaction time
so<00:01:15.850> it's<00:01:16.000> something<00:01:16.240> that's<00:01:16.360> really<00:01:16.570> fast<00:01:16.930> but

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
so it's something that's really fast but

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.260 
so it's something that's really fast but
still<00:01:17.470> has<00:01:17.619> that<00:01:17.770> level<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:18.220> strategic<00:01:18.850> combat

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
still has that level of strategic combat

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.120 
still has that level of strategic combat
to<00:01:19.479> it<00:01:19.630> so<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:19.810> can<00:01:19.960> make<00:01:20.140> choices<00:01:20.500> that<00:01:20.680> mean

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
to it so you can make choices that mean

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.340 
to it so you can make choices that mean
something

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
something

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.510 
something
so<00:01:23.350> one<00:01:23.500> of<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.710> difficulties<00:01:24.220> in<00:01:24.370> other

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
so one of the difficulties in other

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.130 
so one of the difficulties in other
games<00:01:24.760> is<00:01:25.030> that<00:01:25.210> you're<00:01:25.390> not<00:01:25.570> really<00:01:25.720> attached

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
games is that you're not really attached

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.020 
games is that you're not really attached
to<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.440> objectives<00:01:26.980> you<00:01:27.100> know<00:01:27.280> you're<00:01:27.820> told

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
to the objectives you know you're told

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.340 
to the objectives you know you're told
to<00:01:28.120> go<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.270> point<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.750> you're<00:01:28.960> told<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.200> go<00:01:29.320> to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
to go to point a you're told to go to

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.920 
to go to point a you're told to go to
point<00:01:29.620> B<00:01:29.890> or<00:01:30.130> told<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.430> plan<00:01:30.670> up<00:01:30.820> on<00:01:30.970> here<00:01:31.510> but

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
point B or told a plan up on here but

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.630 
point B or told a plan up on here but
it's<00:01:32.110> really<00:01:32.410> a<00:01:32.440> very<00:01:32.650> small<00:01:33.220> part<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.580> the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
it's really a very small part of the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.830 
it's really a very small part of the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
but that's part of the levels so

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.850 
but that's part of the levels so
everyone<00:01:40.780> wants<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.140> be<00:01:41.230> doing<00:01:41.440> them<00:01:41.560> all<00:01:41.710> the

everyone wants to be doing them all the
time<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.580> way<00:01:42.700> we<00:01:42.850> do<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.150> is<00:01:43.210> we<00:01:43.330> make

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
time and the way we do that is we make

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.210 
time and the way we do that is we make
the<00:01:43.720> objectives<00:01:44.200> actually<00:01:44.740> tied<00:01:45.010> into

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
the objectives actually tied into

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.550 
the objectives actually tied into
dramatic<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.150> cinematic<00:01:46.330> events<00:01:47.050> that<00:01:47.200> truly

matter<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.340> see<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.850> scale<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.210> things

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
matter and you see the scale of things

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.140 
matter and you see the scale of things
that<00:01:49.720> are<00:01:49.810> happening<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:51.250> medieval<00:01:51.850> army

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150
