00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.120
 left welcome to one 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.550
 today's conception 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.040
 I introduce you today to the miner gtb 4 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.769
 30 clock loading car in front of a huge 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.010
 three-axle over loader wagons from the big boss 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.539
 modding team yes I'm not sure 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.220
 whether he was converted sees 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.680
 A little later the tires are on 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.690
 every case until 15 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.240
 we look the same in the shop in there 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.910
 we find 408,000 beautiful ones 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.119
 screen logo 35 euro maintenance costs 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.519
 standard fruit types and with one 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.980
 capacity of 38,500 liters 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.539
 Neat in any case, we look 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.390
 give us a quick look at the loco if that too 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:45.079
 error-free, I hope the miner 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.539
 is error free 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.309
 the super top line underneath nothing 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.989
 to find very nice view the texture 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.789
 not always perfect as you are here at the 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.929
 I can generally see them on the page 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:03.109
 on average 3 stars 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.190
 the model would be much better 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.740
 I give you four stars 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.990
 they ripen in a super green 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.500
 fits back here still have the logo 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.060
 Bergmann GT 430 mac range good here 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.829
 the logo of werthmann a little bit 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.320
 pixelated but here times of the 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.820
 page can not be what one is 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.200
 looks a little funny I think that 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.640
 the wheels are a bit too small like 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.180
 this huge part it just looks 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.479
 a little bit 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.740
 well from the un for me you can see 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.570
 also that the left side a bit 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.369
 is higher than the right that is from 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.829
 the right side will be filled with 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.390
 harvester and we have here too 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.520
 the pipe is already extended 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.049
 plus two plexiglas panes where you can 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.329
 can see through how high because of 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.530
 fill level is there when we are up here 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.630
 always look the whole 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.619
 struts the bars when we 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.539
 of course the wall is not apart 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.899
 is pressed, and I also find the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.649
 looks quite passable 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.130
 Just give it a try 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.130
 to attach 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.540
 that does not work as well 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.730
 quite simply, we generally have two 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.920
 we can do a little bit more 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.210
 we can quite normal with n the planner 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.399
 close here with n 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.110
 then have this miner above 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.700
 logo on it is of course looks easy 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.940
 like a square box but in 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.830
 okay if only slight bend 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.530
 in there with ex we can enter the pipe 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.530
 can fold you actually think 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.470
 That's where the transport works 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.989
 Together, the thing is wonderful 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.610
 zapfl is connected you can see that 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.050
 like to see the height fits again 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.940
 coupled is that's great 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.580
 and what we can do now is 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.170
 with the left mouse button down 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.170
 we can pull the flap open here 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.650
 here the flap goes up that looks real 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.320
 quite frankly you can say that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.660
 even up to four high so ever 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.450
 according to how high you want to invite 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.730
 to adjust this is really cool 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.260
 thing and when times with left mouse button 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.260
 Can it be helped 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.689
 okay we can with the right one 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.099
 mouse button here the angle of the 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.000
 so we can do that 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.840
 up and down the drawbar 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.159
 as I said everything with the right one 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.090
 mouse button of course you can see that it is so 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.670
 is too high here 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.610
 but so too low that would be in the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.860
 principle the perfect dare I have to say 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.420
 those are already some good features in the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.489
 I want four stars here 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.420
 will probably give dirty too 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.549
 this is to be assumed 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.409
 Lock free shop okay but unfortunately 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.970
 her singing textile model does not appear here 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.069
 five star level you can confidently 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.720
 to say but maybe one 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.290
 interesting alternative because it still 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.849
 not so many great overloaded because of gave 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.319
 and now if you always have the texture here 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.599
 You can stay out of this world here 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.909
 certainly look forward to a big one 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.250
 map and I hope that's something for you 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:59.170
 I'm out thank you for seeing 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.170
 make it good until soon servus
