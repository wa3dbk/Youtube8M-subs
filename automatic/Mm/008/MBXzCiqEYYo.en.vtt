00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 for us 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.130
 part of the launch line-up 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.750
 from the ps vita uncharted golden abyss is 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.820
 undoubtedly the spearhead of the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.990
 new portable console sony who will 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.849
 to prove that she really does 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.750
 belly 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.740
 a few minutes of play are enough 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.150
 by the way to understand that we 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.550
 do not deal here with a vulgar 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.590
 adaptation of an old episode but a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.210
 new opus in its own right and the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.860
 unpublished scenario allows us elsewhere 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 to discover the beginnings of nathan drake 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.269
 in the treasure hunt the history of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.170
 game takes place indeed a few years 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.420
 before the events of the first 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 uncharted and our hero is taken from a 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.780
 sudden desire to help chase a young 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 woman party looking for her father 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.500
 suddenly disappeared while he was investigating 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.530
 on the actions of a former sect 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.180
 of the seventeenth century an imprinted scenario 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.620
 of history and myths and who will we 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.070
 to travel all over the world 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.289
 world 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.329
 the uncharted recipe still works 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.160
 wonderfully well if the regulars of the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.160
 series may never be taken 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.960
 lack of a climbing sequence with his 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.000
 lot of falls precomputed riddles to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.740
 solve gunfight and some phases 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.530
 infiltration are the ingredients that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.729
 perfectly characterizes the series if the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.410
 game lack of renewal in his 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.390
 globality the photo little environment 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.770
 proposed and a game scheme a lot 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.300
 too predictable 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.979
 uncharted golden abyss stands out 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.030
 other aspects thanks to the functionalities 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.679
 touch of the machine during phases 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.209
 of escalated for example you can 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.860
 use your finger to draw the 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.509
 way to go nathan drake 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.459
 as fighting in melee 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.509
 also triggers by pressing 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.509
 contextual icons 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.729
 touch is also used during 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.530
 puzzles and in menu navigation 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.330
 while the rear touchpad 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.790
 zoom in with your weapon or 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.350
 camera sometimes it will be you even 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.890
 asked to appeal to your sense of 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.600
 the balance 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.940
 via the gyro features of 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.470
 the vita ps recalling the episode drake's 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.470
 fortune with these wooden logs 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.119
 slippery you'll have understood everything has been 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.190
 thought for that uncharted golden abyss 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.720
 is a great showcase abilities 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.880
 technical and functional of ps 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.590
 vita and the result flirts easily 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.140
 with the episodes we could play 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.610
 on playstation 3 pity that the scenes 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.600
 anthology is rare and that 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.330
 secondary characters are missing 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.890
 clearly charismatic that said for a 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.890
 first try it is very successful 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.260
 the note I reject 16 out of 20
