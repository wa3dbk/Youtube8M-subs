00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
speed which I don't know how that makes

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.660 
speed which I don't know how that makes
81<00:02:21.870> pace<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.349> somehow<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.830> does<00:02:23.040> that's

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
81 pace but somehow it does that's

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.369 
81 pace but somehow it does that's
really<00:02:23.879> solid<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.420> Ramos<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.930> again<00:02:25.230> very

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
really solid and Ramos is again very

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.880 
really solid and Ramos is again very
similar<00:02:26.150> 83<00:02:27.150> acceleration<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.019> 88<00:02:28.530> sprint

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
similar 83 acceleration and 88 sprint

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.530 
similar 83 acceleration and 88 sprint
speed<00:02:29.040> however<00:02:29.280> he<00:02:29.790> doesn't<00:02:30.120> have<00:02:30.209> tiny<00:02:30.330> bit

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
speed however he doesn't have tiny bit

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.380 
speed however he doesn't have tiny bit
less<00:02:30.720> strength<00:02:30.989> with<00:02:31.260> 76<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.190> he<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.640> 1<00:02:33.030> inch

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
less strength with 76 and he is 1 inch

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.600 
less strength with 76 and he is 1 inch
shorter<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.470> they've<00:02:34.890> got<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.250> they're<00:02:35.430> both

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
shorter so they've got that they're both

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.309 
shorter so they've got that they're both
really<00:02:35.940> really<00:02:36.209> good<00:02:36.420> physical<00:02:37.019> players

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
to be honest review that for me actually

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.920 
to be honest review that for me actually
seemed<00:02:41.849> like<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> bit<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.330> letdown<00:02:42.540> i'm<00:02:42.810> not

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
seemed like a bit of a letdown i'm not

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.570 
seemed like a bit of a letdown i'm not
sure<00:02:43.080> what<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.260> was<00:02:43.379> but<00:02:43.590> i<00:02:43.890> did<00:02:44.069> actually<00:02:44.190> find

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
sure what it was but i did actually find

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.979 
sure what it was but i did actually find
quite<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.849> few<00:02:45.030> times<00:02:45.239> I'd<00:02:45.390> get<00:02:45.540> into<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.780> books

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
quite a few times I'd get into the books

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.140 
quite a few times I'd get into the books
and<00:02:46.200> Ramos<00:02:46.620> would<00:02:46.830> miss<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.910> might

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
and Ramos would miss it but it might

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.370 
and Ramos would miss it but it might
have<00:02:48.269> just<00:02:48.299> been<00:02:48.450> because<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.900> was<00:02:49.049> having<00:02:49.170> an

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
a magnet but i had one game where I

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.819 
a magnet but i had one game where I
think<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.760> end<00:03:02.880> up<00:03:02.910> having<00:03:03.209> 25<00:03:03.840> shots<00:03:04.170> almost
