00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
now it's five on five baseball and you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.130 
now it's five on five baseball and you
really<00:01:00.300> don't<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.570> any<00:01:00.750> control<00:01:00.960> whatsoever

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
really don't have any control whatsoever

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.130 
really don't have any control whatsoever
over<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.160> fielders<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.910> once<00:01:03.660> someone<00:01:03.960> hits

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
over the fielders so once someone hits

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.890 
over the fielders so once someone hits
the<00:01:04.320> ball<00:01:04.470> whatever<00:01:04.860> happens<00:01:05.339> happens<00:01:05.900> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the ball whatever happens happens this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.300 
the ball whatever happens happens this
is<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> limitations<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> game

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
is one of the limitations with the game

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.640 
is one of the limitations with the game
of<00:01:08.460> course<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.790> probably<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.420> part<00:01:09.479> based<00:01:10.380> on

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
of course it's probably in part based on

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.080 
of course it's probably in part based on
the<00:01:10.740> fact<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.310> only<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> click

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the fact that you only have the click

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.789 
the fact that you only have the click
wheel<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.450> navigation<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.500> there's<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
wheel for navigation so there's not a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.740 
wheel for navigation so there's not a
ton<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.400> options<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.330> what<00:01:15.450> they<00:01:15.570> could

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
ton of options here for what they could

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.330 
ton of options here for what they could
do<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> game<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.830> still<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.130> feels

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
do with the game but still it feels

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
do with the game but still it feels
unpolished<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.210> feels<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.869> easy

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
unpolished and it feels like an easy

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.820 
unpolished and it feels like an easy
port<00:01:20.070> from<00:01:20.700> say<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.320> older<00:01:22.530> cell

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
port from say one of the older cell

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.380 
port from say one of the older cell
phone<00:01:23.070> games<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.490> actually<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.939> game<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
phone games and actually this game is

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.050 
phone games and actually this game is
available<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:25.229> other<00:01:25.890> cell<00:01:26.250> phone<00:01:26.280> platforms

which<00:01:27.210> might<00:01:27.450> help<00:01:27.689> explain<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.880> let's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
which might help explain it so let's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.999 
which might help explain it so let's
take<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> look<00:01:30.540> at<00:01:30.659> hitting<00:01:31.439> since<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.829> took<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
take a look at hitting since we took a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.370 
take a look at hitting since we took a
look<00:01:32.130> at<00:01:32.280> pitching<00:01:32.729> first<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:34.049> very

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
look at pitching first and it's very

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.859 
look at pitching first and it's very
similar<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> hit<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
similar in that if I want to hit the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.359 
similar in that if I want to hit the
ball<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.170> hit<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> middle<00:01:37.740> button<00:01:38.009> here

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
ball I can hit the middle button here

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.560 
ball I can hit the middle button here
just<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.729> don't<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.180> much<00:01:42.360> control

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
just like that don't have much control

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.130 
just like that don't have much control
over<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.640> choose<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.909> flick<00:01:45.840> your

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
over it or you can choose to flick your

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.920 
over it or you can choose to flick your
thumb<00:01:46.799> around<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.700> click<00:01:47.939> wheel<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
thumb around the click wheel now the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.300 
thumb around the click wheel now the
advantage<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.470> doing<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.950> supposedly

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
advantage to doing that is supposedly

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.550 
advantage to doing that is supposedly
they're<00:01:50.700> supposed<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.689> bonus<00:01:52.290> that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
they're supposed to be a bonus that

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.080 
they're supposed to be a bonus that
you'll<00:01:52.860> get<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.399> not<00:01:53.579> seen<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.820> happen

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
you'll get I have not seen that happen

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.280 
you'll get I have not seen that happen
yet<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.540> frankly<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.079> lot<00:01:55.259> more

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
yet and frankly it's a lot more

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.179 
yet and frankly it's a lot more
difficult<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.360> time<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.630> hit<00:01:58.009> although<00:01:59.009> that

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
difficult to time your hit although that

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.800 
difficult to time your hit although that
time<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> did<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.939> I'm<00:02:00.000> rewarded<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.570> some

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
time I did and I'm rewarded with some

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.950 
time I did and I'm rewarded with some
mono<00:02:01.079> sound<00:02:01.560> effects<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.540> overall<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.689> don't

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
mono sound effects so overall you don't

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.300 
mono sound effects so overall you don't
have<00:02:04.140> any<00:02:04.290> other<00:02:04.409> choice<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:05.009> far<00:02:05.219> as

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
have any other choice as far as

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.679 
have any other choice as far as
baseball's<00:02:05.790> concerned<00:02:05.939> right<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.659> a

click wheel ipod and that's a shame

click wheel ipod and that's a shame
because<00:02:09.569> there<00:02:10.200> certainly<00:02:10.410> could<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
because there certainly could be a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.730 
because there certainly could be a
better<00:02:11.489> baseball<00:02:11.730> game<00:02:12.120> then

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
better baseball game then
