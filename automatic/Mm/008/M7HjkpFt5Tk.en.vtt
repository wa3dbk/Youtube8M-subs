hey YouTube it's the Nitro RC nerds here

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.209 
hey YouTube it's the Nitro RC nerds here
for<00:00:13.299> another<00:00:13.420> edition<00:00:13.930> of<00:00:13.959> nitro<00:00:14.469> RC<00:00:15.010> for

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
for another edition of nitro RC for

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.070 
for another edition of nitro RC for
dummies<00:00:15.459> and<00:00:15.490> today<00:00:16.299> what<00:00:16.510> we're<00:00:16.630> going<00:00:16.780> to<00:00:16.900> be

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
dummies and today what we're going to be

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.339 
dummies and today what we're going to be
talking<00:00:17.350> about<00:00:17.619> is<00:00:17.980> throttle<00:00:18.820> linkage<00:00:19.349> what

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
talking about is throttle linkage what

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.349 
talking about is throttle linkage what
what<00:00:20.710> it<00:00:20.800> is<00:00:20.980> how<00:00:21.429> to<00:00:21.490> set<00:00:21.789> it<00:00:21.820> up<00:00:22.000> how<00:00:22.330> to

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
what it is how to set it up how to

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.999 
what it is how to set it up how to
troubleshoot<00:00:22.750> it<00:00:23.259> and<00:00:23.320> all<00:00:23.529> that<00:00:23.560> good<00:00:23.949> stuff

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
troubleshoot it and all that good stuff

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.700 
troubleshoot it and all that good stuff
now<00:00:24.670> for<00:00:24.849> those<00:00:24.939> unaware<00:00:25.349> throttle<00:00:26.349> linkage

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
now for those unaware throttle linkage

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.659 
now for those unaware throttle linkage
is<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:27.250> components<00:00:28.000> that<00:00:28.210> allows<00:00:28.990> the

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
is the components that allows the

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.530 
is the components that allows the
carburetor<00:00:30.669> to<00:00:31.570> open<00:00:32.100> close<00:00:33.100> and<00:00:34.090> also<00:00:34.300> to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
carburetor to open close and also to

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.840 
carburetor to open close and also to
apply<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:34.930> brakes<00:00:35.350> so<00:00:36.070> essentially<00:00:36.580> what<00:00:36.760> it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
apply the brakes so essentially what it

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.110 
apply the brakes so essentially what it
does<00:00:36.880> is<00:00:37.090> when<00:00:37.690> you<00:00:37.720> squeeze<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.410> trigger

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
does is when you squeeze the trigger

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.460 
does is when you squeeze the trigger
and<00:00:40.120> when<00:00:40.270> you<00:00:40.390> brake<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:44.230> are<00:00:44.410> the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
and when you brake these are the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.730 
and when you brake these are the
components<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:45.070> make<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.610> car<00:00:45.790> go<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:47.050> stop

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
components that make the car go and stop

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.490 
components that make the car go and stop
now<00:00:48.040> it's<00:00:48.520> important<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.090> note<00:00:49.300> is<00:00:49.540> that<00:00:49.990> there

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
now it's important to note is that there

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.160 
now it's important to note is that there
are<00:00:50.650> two<00:00:50.890> types<00:00:51.250> of<00:00:51.460> carburetors<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:52.990> have

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
are two types of carburetors you have

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.280 
are two types of carburetors you have
the<00:00:53.830> rotary<00:00:54.220> carburetor<00:00:54.850> like<00:00:55.840> this<00:00:56.080> right

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
the rotary carburetor like this right

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.180 
the rotary carburetor like this right
here<00:00:56.770> where<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:58.330> arm<00:00:58.570> on<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.740> carburetor

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
here where the arm on the carburetor

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.060 
here where the arm on the carburetor
turns<00:01:01.150> so<00:01:01.900> in<00:01:02.020> other<00:01:02.110> words<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.650> throttle

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
turns so in other words the throttle

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.140 
turns so in other words the throttle
linkage<00:01:03.220> itself<00:01:03.970> what<00:01:04.839> it<00:01:04.930> does<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:06.940> guys

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
linkage itself what it does if you guys

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.650 
linkage itself what it does if you guys
can<00:01:07.450> see<00:01:07.720> here<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.430> car<00:01:09.730> is<00:01:09.760> on<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.450> you

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
can see here when the car is on and you

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.870 
can see here when the car is on and you
squeeze<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.230> trigger<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:12.310> can<00:01:12.460> see<00:01:12.670> right

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
squeeze the trigger you can see right

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.970 
squeeze the trigger you can see right
here<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.630> turns<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.290> carburetor

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
here that it turns the carburetor

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.090 
here that it turns the carburetor
it<00:01:18.340> turns<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.820> arm<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.330> side<00:01:20.100> effectively

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
it turns the arm to the side effectively

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.130 
it turns the arm to the side effectively
opening<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:21.909> closing<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.890> carburetor<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
opening and closing the carburetor the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.260 
opening and closing the carburetor the
second<00:01:26.530> type<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.980> carburetor<00:01:27.580> you'll<00:01:27.760> find<00:01:28.030> is

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
second type of carburetor you'll find is

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.690 
second type of carburetor you'll find is
what<00:01:28.510> they<00:01:28.600> call<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.810> slide<00:01:29.440> carburetor<00:01:30.040> and<00:01:30.550> if

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
what they call a slide carburetor and if

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.890 
what they call a slide carburetor and if
you<00:01:30.820> can<00:01:30.940> see<00:01:31.180> right<00:01:31.390> here<00:01:31.600> where<00:01:31.750> my<00:01:31.870> finger

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
you can see right here where my finger

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.610 
you can see right here where my finger
is<00:01:32.320> this<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.460> type<00:01:33.670> where<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.909> carburetor

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
is this is the type where the carburetor

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.130 
is this is the type where the carburetor
goes<00:01:35.620> where<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.610> linkages<00:01:37.210> cause<00:01:37.780> the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
goes where the the linkages cause the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.100 
goes where the the linkages cause the
this<00:01:39.010> piece<00:01:39.220> right<00:01:39.370> here<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:40.240> go<00:01:40.360> in<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:41.020> out

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
this piece right here to go in and out

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.140 
this piece right here to go in and out
instead<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.620> turning<00:01:41.950> sideways<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:42.700> sideways

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
instead of turning sideways to sideways

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.520 
instead of turning sideways to sideways
it<00:01:43.360> goes<00:01:43.479> in<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:43.960> out<00:01:43.990> kind<00:01:44.229> of<00:01:44.260> like<00:01:44.380> an

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
it goes in and out kind of like an

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.090 
it goes in and out kind of like an
accordion

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
accordion

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.100 
accordion
but<00:01:45.549> it's<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.760> exact<00:01:46.060> same<00:01:46.180> concept<00:01:46.630> what

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
but it's the exact same concept what

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.590 
but it's the exact same concept what
that<00:01:47.260> does<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.650> that<00:01:47.799> opens<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.460> closes<00:01:48.760> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
that does is that opens and closes the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.770 
that does is that opens and closes the
carburetor<00:01:50.080> open<00:01:50.530> allowing<00:01:51.159> for<00:01:51.549> gas<00:01:51.790> to<00:01:52.630> get

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
carburetor open allowing for gas to get

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.899 
carburetor open allowing for gas to get
inside<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.350> key<00:01:53.770> here<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.580> different

and two millimeters and what that's

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.600 
and two millimeters and what that's
going<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.550> do<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:19.850> allow<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.480> idle<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.620> the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
going to do is allow you to idle so the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.640 
going to do is allow you to idle so the
thing<00:03:22.820> that<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.060> want<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.270> do<00:03:23.360> is<00:03:23.540> first<00:03:23.840> move

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
thing that you want to do is first move

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.040 
thing that you want to do is first move
this<00:03:24.860> all<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.100> way<00:03:25.190> back<00:03:25.400> then<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.540> put<00:03:26.750> this

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
this all the way back then you put this

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.720 
this all the way back then you put this
piece<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.770> it's<00:03:27.980> going<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.190> be<00:03:28.280> off<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.459> the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
piece and it's going to be off of the

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.620 
piece and it's going to be off of the
horn<00:03:29.060> put<00:03:29.300> this<00:03:29.450> piece<00:03:29.720> first<00:03:30.680> through<00:03:31.010> here

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
horn put this piece first through here

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.470 
horn put this piece first through here
then<00:03:32.630> take<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.410> brake<00:03:33.650> linkage<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.390> put<00:03:35.390> it

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
then take the brake linkage and put it

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.690 
then take the brake linkage and put it
through<00:03:35.600> here<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:36.050> typically<00:03:36.770> this<00:03:37.220> piece<00:03:37.520> is

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
through here so typically this piece is

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.760 
through here so typically this piece is
off<00:03:37.850> when<00:03:38.000> I'm<00:03:38.150> doing<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:39.320> next<00:03:39.620> thing

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
off when I'm doing that the next thing

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.390 
off when I'm doing that the next thing
to<00:03:39.890> do<00:03:40.070> is<00:03:40.280> again<00:03:41.180> with<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:41.750> off<00:03:42.020> and<00:03:42.410> this

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
to do is again with this off and this

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.310 
to do is again with this off and this
and<00:03:43.760> this<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:44.450> all<00:03:44.780> connect<00:03:45.200> it

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
and this and that all connect it

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.850 
and this and that all connect it
together<00:03:45.850> then<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:48.730> set<00:03:49.730> your<00:03:50.110> your<00:03:51.110> servo<00:03:51.680> so

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
together then you set your your servo so

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.850 
together then you set your your servo so
you<00:03:51.920> turn<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.280> on<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:53.140> you<00:03:54.140> set<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.830> a

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
you turn it on and you set it in to a

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.910 
you turn it on and you set it in to a
neutral<00:03:55.160> position<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:57.320> you<00:03:57.380> simply<00:03:57.590> take

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
neutral position and you simply take

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.820 
neutral position and you simply take
this<00:03:58.130> chord<00:03:58.760> right<00:03:58.910> here<00:03:58.989> once<00:03:59.989> again<00:04:00.290> making

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
this chord right here once again making

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.009
