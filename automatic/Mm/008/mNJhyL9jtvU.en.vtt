00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.750
 Today I come to tell you 5 things that 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.820
 we can do in summer to not 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.160
 get bored first thing is to choose a 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.769
 book that is as well as romantic 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.289
 summer adventures all these things I 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.170
 I have taken the read there is no sole 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.880
 It's set in summer but it's 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.920
 exciting really I love it apart 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.960
 that I love that girl the book 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.340
 it's charming and it 's in new york well 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.930
 which is great for me because when I'm 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.090
 being this is not going to be new 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 york already good but I liked it and now 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.020
 stuck in our bottom three 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.000
 castles that now I teach you the second 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.530
 is that you like to vice- channels of 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.620
 youtube play for that is the summer 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.420
 to have time and see many channels 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.520
 I recommend all of the British 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.860
 that I always say 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.960
 jacques that jobs back pearl and all 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.449

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.760
 also another side of youtube the third 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.649
 which recommends that you hook up to a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.379
 series and I will recommend you this time 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.870
 falling skies love adventure science 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.520
 fiction does not have all the boys very 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.890
 handsome also recommended team bush that 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.500
 they are also all very handsome guys 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.940
 supernatural and fly a lot 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.830
 following that you have escaped 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.470
 even if it's three days we can all 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.479
 be saving for weeks a month and 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.159
 to be able to make an escape from an end 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.800
 of the week even if you are in the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.500
 center then to the north that is near or 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.860
 down to the south do not throw a little bit of 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.020
 beach that suits us all and is not 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.000
 so difficult to organize and the fifth is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.590
 that you have the trip of the toyo 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.540
 it's something that 's played to me but I 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.820
 love doing it in summer at the end of 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.950
 August was important because there where 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.720
 very good baby, he always planned it and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.060
 he left it closed because in addition his 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.649
 prices are now better is that if what 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.330
 you take in September because to the people in 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.080
 September starts saying I love myself and 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.179
 do and what and they catch everything so that 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.289
