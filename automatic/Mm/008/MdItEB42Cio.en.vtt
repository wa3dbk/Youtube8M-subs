00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
fans as far as what it's expected from

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
fans as far as what it's expected from
people<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> locker<00:01:00.210> room<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.719> stuff<00:01:00.960> like

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
people in the locker room and stuff like

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.609 
people in the locker room and stuff like
that<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> fans<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.449> sure<00:01:03.690> are<00:01:04.409> not

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that and so the fans for sure are not

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.890 
that and so the fans for sure are not
pretty<00:01:05.430> pleased<00:01:05.760> about<00:01:05.939> his<00:01:06.390> decision<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
pretty pleased about his decision to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.190 
pretty pleased about his decision to
leave<00:01:07.049> us<00:01:08.119> especially<00:01:09.119> being<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.570> captain<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
leave us especially being a captain and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.830 
leave us especially being a captain and
and<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:11.130> mean<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> only<00:01:11.850> drawback<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.540> he<00:01:12.689> went

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and I mean the only drawback is he went

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.780 
and I mean the only drawback is he went
home<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.229> Minnesota<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> think<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.670> have

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
home to Minnesota so I think if you have

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.160 
home to Minnesota so I think if you have
people<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.119> did<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> little<00:01:15.689> sensitive

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
people that did a little sensitive

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.800 
people that did a little sensitive
they're<00:01:16.409> fans<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.610> pretty<00:01:18.150> rare<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.570> ones

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
they're fans a pretty rare these ones

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.249 
they're fans a pretty rare these ones
the<00:01:18.990> hope<00:01:19.220> they<00:01:20.220> they'll<00:01:21.030> understand<00:01:21.630> but

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the hope they they'll understand but

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.170 
the hope they they'll understand but
again<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.740> affected<00:01:23.220> our<00:01:23.310> organization<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.090> a
