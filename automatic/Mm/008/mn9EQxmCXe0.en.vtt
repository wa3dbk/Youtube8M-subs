00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the 43 percent it's not coloured but it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.670 
the 43 percent it's not coloured but it
is<00:00:37.800> chill<00:00:38.040> filtered<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.989> it's<00:00:39.989> slightly

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
is chill filtered and it's slightly

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.400 
is chill filtered and it's slightly
peated<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.430> 100%<00:00:42.360> sherry<00:00:42.780> maturation

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
peated and 100% sherry maturation

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.139 
peated and 100% sherry maturation
although<00:00:43.739> they're<00:00:44.340> using<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:44.850> they're

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
although they're using I think they're

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.090 
although they're using I think they're
using<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.570> good<00:00:45.719> bit<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.930> refill<00:00:46.379> sherry<00:00:46.680> casks

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
using a good bit of refill sherry casks

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
using a good bit of refill sherry casks
because<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> sherry<00:00:48.059> bomb<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.140> it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
because it's not a sherry bomb so it's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.330 
because it's not a sherry bomb so it's
almost<00:00:50.329> well<00:00:51.329> I'll<00:00:51.960> taste<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:53.219> I'll

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
almost well I'll taste it and then I'll

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
almost well I'll taste it and then I'll
conclude<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.760> some<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> think

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
conclude with some so some what I think

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.029 
conclude with some so some what I think
of<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:56.600> ok<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.660> color<00:00:57.989> wise<00:00:58.170> natural<00:00:58.710> color

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
of it ok so color wise natural color

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.229 
of it ok so color wise natural color
again<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.120> an<00:01:00.270> amber<00:01:00.570> +2<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.740 
kick in and the smoke just builds it
builds<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.489> then<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.090> get<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.269> nice<00:02:42.420> smoke

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
builds and then you get a nice smoke

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.340 
builds and then you get a nice smoke
burst<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.310> finish<00:02:45.019> kind<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.260> a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
burst and on a finish kind of just a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.540 
burst and on a finish kind of just a
little<00:02:46.560> bit<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.739> fading<00:02:47.070> smoke<00:02:47.370> here

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.690 

and<00:02:51.000> not<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.240> whole<00:02:51.450> lot<00:02:51.660> else<00:02:52.310> right<00:02:53.310> now<00:02:53.460> a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
and not a whole lot else right now a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.510 
and not a whole lot else right now a
Madeleine<00:02:54.540> water<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.170> think<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.190> deserves

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
Madeleine water I think this deserves

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.050 
Madeleine water I think this deserves
water<00:02:57.890> but<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> also<00:02:59.130> think<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.520> deserves<00:02:59.820> not

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
water but I also think it deserves not

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.560 
water but I also think it deserves not
water<00:03:00.590> it's<00:03:01.590> interesting<00:03:02.030> without<00:03:03.030> water<00:03:03.390> and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
water it's interesting without water and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.420 
water it's interesting without water and
interesting<00:03:04.110> with<00:03:04.260> water<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.160> recommend

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
interesting with water and I recommend

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.000 
interesting with water and I recommend
you<00:03:05.610> taste<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.000> both<00:03:06.150> ways<00:03:06.360> because<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.710> it

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
you taste it both ways because it's it

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.370 
you taste it both ways because it's it
behaves<00:03:08.400> differently<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.110> slightly

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
behaves differently so it slightly

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.920 
behaves differently so it slightly
peated<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.040> sherry<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.270> think<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.570> share<00:03:12.780> it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
peated is sherry but I think it share it

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.680 
peated is sherry but I think it share it
in<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.080> lot<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.500> refill<00:03:14.400> casts<00:03:14.820> is<00:03:15.360> hundred

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
in a lot of refill casts is hundred

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.340 
in a lot of refill casts is hundred
percent<00:03:15.720> sherry<00:03:16.170> metric<00:03:16.800> matured<00:03:17.190> whiskey<00:03:17.490> so

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
percent sherry metric matured whiskey so

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.260 
percent sherry metric matured whiskey so
it's<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:20.010> seems<00:03:20.430> kind<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.940> lightly

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
it's like it seems kind of lightly

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.670 
it's like it seems kind of lightly
sherry<00:03:21.660> compared<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.230> cherry<00:03:22.470> bomb

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
sherry compared to the cherry bomb

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.260 
sherry compared to the cherry bomb
whiskies<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:24.290> it's<00:03:25.290> light<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:25.740> heated<00:03:25.890> so

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
whiskies and it's light and if heated so

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.360 
whiskies and it's light and if heated so
the<00:03:27.270> peak<00:03:27.480> comes<00:03:27.750> through<00:03:28.050> without<00:03:28.440> water<00:03:28.740> the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
the peak comes through without water the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.620 
the peak comes through without water the
sherry<00:03:29.610> comes<00:03:29.850> through<00:03:30.090> once<00:03:30.300> you've<00:03:30.450> added

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630
