00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.330 

not<00:00:28.200> only<00:00:28.440> that

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.880 

it's<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.090> first<00:00:34.330> time<00:00:34.540> in<00:00:35.110> total<00:00:35.380> a<00:00:35.560> series

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
it's the first time in total a series

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.920 
it's the first time in total a series
that<00:00:36.070> we've<00:00:36.250> taken<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.940> back<00:00:37.450> into<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.810> high

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
that we've taken the back into the high

that we've taken the back into the high
seas<00:00:38.260> we've<00:00:38.560> added<00:00:38.740> naval<00:00:39.190> battles<00:00:39.550> on<00:00:40.150> the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
seas we've added naval battles on the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.660 
seas we've added naval battles on the
campaign<00:00:40.630> map<00:00:40.870> we've<00:00:41.140> really<00:00:42.010> extended<00:00:42.580> the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
campaign map we've really extended the

game outside of Europe cross the world

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.430 
game outside of Europe cross the world
so<00:00:45.040> it's<00:00:45.220> a<00:00:45.340> much<00:00:45.520> larger<00:00:45.940> scope<00:00:46.120> game

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.510 

we'll<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.559> doing<00:00:49.680> today<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.010> essentially

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
we'll be doing today is essentially

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.340 
we'll be doing today is essentially
capturing<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> animations<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.960> once<00:00:52.140> we

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
capturing the animations and once we

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.080 
capturing the animations and once we
have<00:00:52.530> he<00:00:52.710> will<00:00:52.949> sign<00:00:53.129> them<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> animations<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
have he will sign them the animations of

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.639 
have he will sign them the animations of
Elemental<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> start<00:00:55.140> working<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.800> these<00:01:00.649> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
Elemental to start working on these the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.869 
Elemental to start working on these the
motion<00:01:01.980> capture<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.370> we're<00:01:02.489> doing<00:01:02.579> today

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
motion capture that we're doing today

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.670 
motion capture that we're doing today
the<00:01:03.210> majority<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.170> relates<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the majority of it relates to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800 
the majority of it relates to
specifically<00:01:05.430> dueling<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.360> will<00:01:06.509> be<00:01:06.630> seen

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
specifically dueling that will be seen

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.840 
specifically dueling that will be seen
in<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.050> game<00:01:07.259> in<00:01:07.470> terms<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.460> dueling

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
in the game in terms of the the dueling

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.609 
in the game in terms of the the dueling
movies<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.450> you'll<00:01:09.600> see<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> duel<00:01:10.140> played<00:01:10.470> out

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
movies so you'll see the duel played out

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.440 
movies so you'll see the duel played out
which<00:01:10.800> is<00:01:10.830> strictly<00:01:11.130> us<00:01:11.369> at<00:01:11.490> 121<00:01:12.060> affair

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
which is strictly us at 121 affair

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.960 
which is strictly us at 121 affair
between<00:01:12.630> those<00:01:12.960> two<00:01:13.229> characters<00:01:16.759> what's<00:01:17.759> by

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
between those two characters what's by

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.460 
between those two characters what's by
focusing<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.600> now<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.930> actually<00:01:19.080> matched

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
focusing on now is actually matched

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.800 
focusing on now is actually matched
animation<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.429> take<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.789> pair<00:01:21.149> of<00:01:21.179> soldiers

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
animation so you take a pair of soldiers

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.719 
animation so you take a pair of soldiers
when<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.470> capture<00:01:22.800> those<00:01:22.920> movements<00:01:23.280> at

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
when actually capture those movements at

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.190 
when actually capture those movements at
the<00:01:23.880> same<00:01:24.060> time<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.509> creates<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.899> much<00:01:25.050> more

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the same time and it creates a much more

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.710 
the same time and it creates a much more
realistic<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:26.280> real<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.789> of<00:01:26.880> combating

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
realistic this real kind of combating

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.600 
realistic this real kind of combating
see<00:01:28.050> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.200> battlefield<00:01:28.590> he<00:01:29.100> think<00:01:29.399> with

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
see on the battlefield he think with

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.639 
see on the battlefield he think with
series<00:01:30.149> is<00:01:30.330> actually<00:01:30.720> interaction<00:01:31.229> about<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
series is actually interaction about the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.230 
series is actually interaction about the
characters<00:01:32.160> all<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.610> doing<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.060> could

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
characters all we doing that could

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.210 
characters all we doing that could
happen<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.780> people<00:01:34.050> have<00:01:34.440> never<00:01:34.649> done<00:01:34.830> really

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
happen to people have never done really

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.980 
happen to people have never done really
in<00:01:35.250> terms<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.640> war<00:01:35.789> so<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> went<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.840> that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
in terms of war so I went to one that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.300 
in terms of war so I went to one that
she<00:01:37.140> tries<00:01:37.440> stripes<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.610> other<00:01:38.759> person

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
she tries stripes the other person

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.609 
she tries stripes the other person
being<00:01:40.240> able<00:01:40.329> to<00:01:40.450> do<00:01:40.600> motion<00:01:40.930> capture<00:01:41.259> allows

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
being able to do motion capture allows

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.770 
being able to do motion capture allows
us<00:01:41.829> to<00:01:42.009> do<00:01:42.189> I<00:01:42.460> would<00:01:42.729> say<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:42.880> larger<00:01:43.270> volume<00:01:43.420> of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
us to do I would say a larger volume of

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.840 
us to do I would say a larger volume of
work<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.290> obviously<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.799> results<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.549> farm

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
work and obviously the results a farm

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.580 
work and obviously the results a farm
will<00:01:45.970> realistically<00:01:46.450> get<00:01:46.899> much<00:01:47.049> more<00:01:47.200> complex

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
will realistically get much more complex

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.380 
will realistically get much more complex
movement<00:01:48.159> in<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.369> characters<00:01:48.820> because<00:01:49.210> it's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
movement in the characters because it's

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.139 
movement in the characters because it's
real<00:01:49.750> people<00:01:50.110> creating<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.649> animation<00:01:54.149> we

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
real people creating the animation we

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.730 
real people creating the animation we
want<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.390> make<00:01:55.509> sure<00:01:55.539> that<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.200> fighting<00:01:56.649> is

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
want to make sure that the fighting is

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.919 
want to make sure that the fighting is
authentically<00:01:57.250> 18th<00:01:57.640> century<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.390> lot<00:01:58.840> of
