been talking about this too but the
custom<00:00:32.460> playbook<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.059> seem<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.300> very

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
custom playbook just seem to be very

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.500

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
captured pretty well and really like in

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.270 
captured pretty well and really like in

completely black so I go to ask a coach
here<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.380> then<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.369> plays<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.850> but

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
here and then I have plays now but

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.780 
here and then I have plays now but
there's<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.450> no<00:01:15.810> play<00:01:16.140> art<00:01:19.549> then<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
there's just no play art then I get to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.609 
there's just no play art then I get to
the<00:01:20.909> line<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> mean<00:01:21.689> everyone<00:01:22.439> just

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the line here I mean everyone just

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.230 
the line here I mean everyone just
stands<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.100> big<00:01:23.340> cluster<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.150> they're

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
stands in this big cluster and they're

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.490 
stands in this big cluster and they're
just<00:01:24.390> trying<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> move<00:01:24.930> somewhere<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.470> not

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
just trying to move somewhere but not

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.870 
just trying to move somewhere but not
moving<00:01:25.890> anywhere<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.400> eventually<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
moving anywhere and then eventually I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.219 
moving anywhere and then eventually I
think<00:01:26.909> somebody<00:01:27.330> steps<00:01:27.570> across<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.020> line

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
think somebody steps across the line

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.469 
think somebody steps across the line
bumps<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> dt<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.119> when<00:01:30.210> i<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.420> an

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
bumps the dt and when i get an

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.249 
bumps the dt and when i get an
encroachment<00:01:30.780> call<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:33.079> really<00:01:34.079> don't

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
encroachment call here I really don't

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.060 
encroachment call here I really don't
think<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.740> something<00:01:34.890> that's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
think this is something that's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.800 
think this is something that's
exploitable<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> mean<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.390> can't<00:01:36.630> run

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
exploitable because I mean you can't run

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
exploitable because I mean you can't run
an<00:01:36.900> offense<00:01:37.259> it'd<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> shame<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.729> could

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
an offense it'd be a shame if you could

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.069 
an offense it'd be a shame if you could
just<00:01:39.030> boot<00:01:39.360> someone<00:01:39.659> after<00:01:39.810> three

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
just boot someone after three

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.270 
just boot someone after three
encroachments<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.950> don't<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.250> if

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
encroachments here but I don't know if

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.590 
encroachments here but I don't know if
this<00:01:41.430> works<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.790> online<00:01:42.030> play<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.270> haven't

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
this works and online play I haven't

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.060 
this works and online play I haven't
tried<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.110> maybe<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:43.649> unique<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
tried it so maybe this is just unique to

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.649 
tried it so maybe this is just unique to
offline<00:01:44.610> playing<00:01:44.909> against<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.210> computer<00:01:45.299> I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
offline playing against the computer I

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.330 
offline playing against the computer I
don't<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.040> still<00:01:47.159> frustrating

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
don't know but it's still frustrating

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.980 
don't know but it's still frustrating
when<00:01:47.850> they<00:01:48.000> hype<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.509> feature<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.930> this

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
when they hype up a feature like this

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.620 
when they hype up a feature like this
and<00:01:49.439> then<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.860> can't<00:01:50.100> deliver<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.899 

so<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> come<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.079> same<00:01:55.560> thing<00:01:55.829> he's<00:01:56.700> pretty

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
so I come out same thing he's pretty

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.789 
so I come out same thing he's pretty
much<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.030> same<00:01:57.180> result<00:01:57.390> again<00:01:58.350> somebody's

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
much the same result again somebody's

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.249 
much the same result again somebody's
got<00:01:59.130> about<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.520> bump<00:01:59.700> dt<00:02:00.119> here<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.689> then<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> did

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
got about to bump dt here and then I did

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.530 
got about to bump dt here and then I did
another<00:02:01.290> penalty<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.909> I'm<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
another penalty so I'm a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.780 
another penalty so I'm a
much-anticipated<00:02:04.049> feature<00:02:05.040> by<00:02:05.399> many<00:02:05.610> people

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
much-anticipated feature by many people

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.359 
much-anticipated feature by many people
and<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.329> seems<00:02:06.750> too<00:02:07.069> seems<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.220> broken

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and it just seems too seems to be broken

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.070 
and it just seems too seems to be broken
they<00:02:08.879> failed<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.300> deliver<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:09.989> I'm

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
they failed to deliver on this one I'm

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.330 
they failed to deliver on this one I'm
really<00:02:10.379> hoping<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.679> fix<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.129> first

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
really hoping that fix it in the first

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.420 
really hoping that fix it in the first
