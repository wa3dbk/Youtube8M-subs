00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:07.698
 The last video about the studies of adoption of twins and single children ended with some expressions. 

00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:16.421
 I said that with these studies, psychologists could estimate the extent to which feature or trait variation 

00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:21.466
 population, the extent to which this deviation may be 

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.714
 attributed to differences in genes. 

00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:32.707
 I used these specific terms because they actually define the concept of inheritance. 

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:41.426
 Textbooks define inheritance as a ratio of deviation - that is, the percentage because the ratio is 

00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:49.435
 Percentage - among individuals we can attribute to genes. I'll write by the influence of genes. 

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:56.594
 I understand that even at this point the definition is not very clear and therefore the whole video 

00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:59.800
 we will clarify this concept. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.540
 Suppose we are talking about intelligence and say that intelligence inheritance is 50%. 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.761
 So IQ ... 

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:14.817
 We said that inheritance is 50%. But we do not say that intelligence is 

00:01:14.817 --> 00:01:18.887
 50% genetic. We're not saying that. 

00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:29.605
 What we really say is that the difference in intelligence can be explained 

00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:38.237
 or 50% attributable to genetic differences. So we are talking about differences in these features. 

00:01:38.237 --> 00:01:42.892
 Asking How Much Genome Acts Our Intelligence Unlike 

00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:50.276
 environment is totally inappropriate. We have learned this on the example of tea and hot water. 

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:59.149
 But what can be answered and what studies of twins and adoptions show us is the percentage of difference 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.131
 or deviations that can be attributed to differences in genes. 

00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:07.714
 I repeated it several times, let's move to the examples now. 

00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:15.207
 One of my favorite examples of inheritance comes from Mark Twain, a famous artist and humorist 

00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:22.499
 who said: Imagine bringing up 4 boys in barrels and say they are about 12 years old. 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:26.437
 I drew a few barrels and there were 4 boys. 

00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:33.765
 We will feed them through holes in barrels so they will eat the same food, their excrements 

00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:39.555
 we will remove the same plan and their environment will be 100% comparable 

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:47.001
 almost sadictically comparable. But at the age of 12, IQ will probably be theirs 

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.162
 very low compared to other people. 

00:02:51.162 --> 00:02:56.361
 But the catch is that the boys probably won't be the same, do they? 

00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:03.340
 Differences in their intelligence could not be attributed to the environment at all 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.615
 because the environment was exactly the same and we would say 

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:16.156
 that the differences in IQ were almost 100% inherited, because their environment was almost 100% identical. 

00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:21.893
 h2 is an acronym for inheritance and is written in lowercase as we speak 

00:03:21.893 --> 00:03:27.503
 about one particular feature, in this case intelligence as opposed to many features. 

00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:35.559
 However, inheritance will be close to 100%. It was an example of inheritance from Mark Twain. 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:43.367
 But alternatively you could say that you have 4 identical quadruples with exactly the same genome 

00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:47.104
 and you raise them in an absolutely different environment. 

00:03:47.104 --> 00:03:53.706
 One needs to be raised in the rainforest and is native, the other raised 

00:03:53.706 --> 00:04:02.564
 in the desert and is a nomad, another can be raised in a North American family and is a factory employee 

00:04:02.564 --> 00:04:09.927
 or is raised at least in a working-class family, and one could be brought up in space, 

00:04:09.927 --> 00:04:18.440
 perhaps near the moon on a space station. The inheritance of the intelligence of the four boys 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.931
 it would be quite low, because now the environment has a greater percentage in the differences in their intelligence. 

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:34.394
 I said that here inheritance actually has 0% because we have determined that children are identical quadruplets. 

00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:38.877
 Genetically, they are the same and the environment is completely different, so we would say 

00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:44.705
 that all the differences in their intelligence must be attributed to the environment. 

00:04:44.705 --> 00:04:52.330
 Perhaps the simple way to understand this is that the more the environment becomes comparable, 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.170
 as in the example of boys in barrels, the more differences in the features of behavior are bound 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:05.733
 with these traits. And probably another thing that can increase heredity is 

00:05:05.733 --> 00:05:10.005
 increased genetic variation leading to different phenotypes. 

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:15.484
 Perhaps if the boys had more genetic aberrations, if they were multivariate 

00:05:15.484 --> 00:05:22.607
 quadruples instead of identical quadruplets and had different genotypes 

00:05:22.607 --> 00:05:28.565
 and more genetic abnormalities leading to different phenotypes or traits. 

00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:37.438
 If new changes were more related to their genes. In this case, heredity would increase. 

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:43.010
 And inheritance grows either because more genes are involved in the genetic constitution 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.908
 or because non-genetic influences such as the environment are less involved. 

00:05:47.908 --> 00:05:57.409
 But the important thing is that we talk about the relative contribution of genes to behavioral variations or features. 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:05.781
 You can count on the fact that inheritance then necessarily becomes dependent on the sample of people studied. 

00:06:08.228 --> 00:06:16.275
 Think about the last sample of boys in barrels. Their inheritance is much higher or rather 

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:21.871
 their IQ's inheritance is much higher than if we had quads instead. 

00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:28.805
 So last - feature inheritance is the extent to which deviations can be attributed to genes. 

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:33.689
 And this very much depends on the studied sample and environment. 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:37.065
 Hopefully we have inherited the short term and will know 

00:06:37.065 --> 00:06:40.203
 what we mean next time we use it.
