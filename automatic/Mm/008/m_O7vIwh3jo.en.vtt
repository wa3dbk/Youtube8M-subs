all<00:00:03.840> right<00:00:04.020> here<00:00:04.230> we<00:00:04.319> have<00:00:04.350> our<00:00:04.440> test<00:00:04.799> system

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
all right here we have our test system

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.590 
all right here we have our test system
and<00:00:05.460> we're<00:00:05.549> running<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:05.910> at<00:00:06.029> stock<00:00:06.359> speed

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
and we're running it at stock speed

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.259 
and we're running it at stock speed
right<00:00:06.779> now<00:00:06.810> 35<00:00:07.649> 70<00:00:08.069> K<00:00:08.309> running<00:00:08.700> at<00:00:08.880> stock<00:00:09.059> speed

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
right now 35 70 K running at stock speed

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.799 
right now 35 70 K running at stock speed
it's<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> 3.8<00:00:10.530> G<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.300> we're<00:00:12.300> measuring<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
it's the 3.8 G and we're measuring the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.270 
it's the 3.8 G and we're measuring the
power<00:00:13.110> consumption<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.009> motherboard

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
power consumption of the motherboard

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.570 
power consumption of the motherboard
which<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.089> feeding<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.570> CPU<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.500> get<00:00:17.250> an<00:00:17.340> idea

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
which is feeding the CPU to get an idea

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.120 
which is feeding the CPU to get an idea
of<00:00:17.760> how<00:00:17.880> much<00:00:18.029> power<00:00:18.330> it's<00:00:18.890> consuming<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.039> how

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
of how much power it's consuming and how

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.980 
of how much power it's consuming and how
much<00:00:20.279> heat<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.789> producing<00:00:21.210> right<00:00:21.359> now<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.900> we

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
much heat it's producing right now so we

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.660 
much heat it's producing right now so we
want<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> see<00:00:22.410> how<00:00:22.890> good<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.279> stock<00:00:23.460> heatsink

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
want to see how good the stock heatsink

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.090 
want to see how good the stock heatsink
is<00:00:23.880> doing

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.350 

all<00:00:29.100> right<00:00:29.340> as<00:00:29.520> you<00:00:29.700> can<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:30.030> we're<00:00:30.210> using

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
all right as you can see we're using

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.630 
all right as you can see we're using
legs<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.020> push<00:00:31.290> the<00:00:31.470> CPU<00:00:31.860> to<00:00:32.130> its<00:00:32.279> limits

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
legs to push the CPU to its limits

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.590 
legs to push the CPU to its limits
getting<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.390> really<00:00:33.570> hot<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:35.100> our<00:00:35.460> 35<00:00:36.000> 70

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600

gigahertz<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.470> stock<00:00:40.710> speed<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
gigahertz so it's stock speed and you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.240 
gigahertz so it's stock speed and you
can<00:00:41.730> see<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.150> we<00:00:43.110> reach<00:00:43.350> temperatures<00:00:43.949> up<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
can see that we reach temperatures up to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.640 
can see that we reach temperatures up to
87<00:00:45.210> degrees<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> stock<00:00:46.050> heatsink<00:00:46.260> at

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
87 degrees with the stock heatsink at

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.790 
87 degrees with the stock heatsink at
stock<00:00:47.010> speed<00:00:47.280> already<00:00:51.410> alright<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.710> are

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
stock speed already alright and we are

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.340 
stock speed already alright and we are
back<00:00:53.040> we<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:53.910> rebooted<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.809> system<00:00:55.199> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
back we just rebooted the system and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
back we just rebooted the system and
overclocked<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> 4.2<00:00:56.489> G<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.090> running<00:00:57.390> at

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
overclocked it to 4.2 G it's running at

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.570 
overclocked it to 4.2 G it's running at
one<00:00:57.690> point<00:00:57.870> three<00:00:58.170> volts<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.460> can

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
one point three volts now and you can

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.340 
one point three volts now and you can
see<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.850> after<00:01:00.000> only<00:01:00.149> four<00:01:00.720> minutes<00:01:00.930> in

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
see that after only four minutes in

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.310 
see that after only four minutes in
links<00:01:01.920> we're<00:01:02.520> already<00:01:02.850> hitting<00:01:03.120> 104<00:01:03.899> degrees

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
links we're already hitting 104 degrees

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.160 
links we're already hitting 104 degrees
on<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> cores<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.580> CPU<00:01:06.509> throttled

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
on one of the cores and CPU throttled

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380 
on one of the cores and CPU throttled
so<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> CPU<00:01:07.890> reduced<00:01:08.610> its<00:01:08.850> clock<00:01:09.119> speed

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
so the CPU reduced its clock speed

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.280 
so the CPU reduced its clock speed
because<00:01:09.660> it<00:01:09.750> was<00:01:09.840> getting<00:01:10.140> too<00:01:10.170> hot

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.810 

now<00:01:17.290> we<00:01:17.350> have<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.650> same<00:01:17.920> system<00:01:18.250> overclock

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
now we have the same system overclock

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.870 
now we have the same system overclock
24.2<00:01:19.540> G<00:01:19.840> with<00:01:20.080> side<00:01:20.410> installed<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.160> you<00:01:21.760> can

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
24.2 G with side installed and you can

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.820 
24.2 G with side installed and you can
see<00:01:22.000> that<00:01:22.120> we're<00:01:22.240> getting<00:01:22.330> temperatures<00:01:22.900> that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
see that we're getting temperatures that

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.380 
see that we're getting temperatures that
are<00:01:23.980> much<00:01:24.220> lower<00:01:24.490> than<00:01:24.610> before<00:01:25.000> if<00:01:25.120> the<00:01:25.210> stock

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
are much lower than before if the stock

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.390 
are much lower than before if the stock
heatsink<00:01:25.600> we're<00:01:25.930> hitting<00:01:26.200> up<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.440> 105<00:01:27.040> now

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
heatsink we're hitting up to 105 now

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.750 
heatsink we're hitting up to 105 now
we're<00:01:27.690> 70<00:01:28.690> we've<00:01:29.350> already<00:01:29.830> round<00:01:30.160> links<00:01:30.490> three

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
we're 70 we've already round links three

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.270 
we're 70 we've already round links three
times<00:01:31.060> but<00:01:31.360> you<00:01:31.420> can't<00:01:31.600> get<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.900> to<00:01:32.050> break<00:01:32.680> 70

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
times but you can't get it to break 70

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.130 
times but you can't get it to break 70
degrees<00:01:33.670> so<00:01:33.910> it's<00:01:34.060> 70<00:01:34.750> degrees<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:35.110> the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
degrees so it's 70 degrees is the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.450 
degrees so it's 70 degrees is the
highest<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:38.290> can<00:01:38.440> see<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.710> was<00:01:38.830> sidon<00:01:39.250> we're

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
highest you can see that was sidon we're

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.120 
highest you can see that was sidon we're
struggling<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.450> break<00:01:40.660> 70<00:01:41.110> degrees<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:41.770> the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
struggling to break 70 degrees so the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.130 
struggling to break 70 degrees so the
center<00:01:42.430> cores<00:01:42.700> are<00:01:43.000> both<00:01:43.150> hitting<00:01:43.390> 70<00:01:43.840> degrees

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
center cores are both hitting 70 degrees

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.920 
center cores are both hitting 70 degrees
but<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:45.190> is<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.430> fourth<00:01:45.730> round<00:01:46.030> of<00:01:46.240> links

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
but this is the fourth round of links

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.510 
but this is the fourth round of links
and<00:01:47.110> we<00:01:47.290> haven't<00:01:47.590> managed<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.920> break<00:01:48.130> 70

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
and we haven't managed to break 70

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.400 
and we haven't managed to break 70
degrees<00:01:48.820> while<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.600> stock<00:01:49.780> heating<00:01:50.170> was

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
degrees while the stock heating was

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:59.010 
degrees while the stock heating was
hitting<00:01:50.980> 104<00:01:57.120> we<00:01:58.120> went<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.360> step<00:01:58.390> further<00:01:58.570> this

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
hitting 104 we went a step further this

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.110 
hitting 104 we went a step further this
time<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.590> went<00:01:59.830> back<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.100> BIOS<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.640> chose<00:02:00.880> the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
time and went back to BIOS and chose the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.230 
time and went back to BIOS and chose the
profile<00:02:01.780> for<00:02:01.990> 4.6<00:02:02.680> G<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.790> links<00:02:04.030> test

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
profile for 4.6 G and the links test

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.750 
profile for 4.6 G and the links test
just<00:02:04.510> finished<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.930> can<00:02:05.080> see<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.500> with<00:02:06.070> 4.6

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
just finished you can see that with 4.6

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
keep the CPU below 77 degrees or at 77

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.940 
keep the CPU below 77 degrees or at 77
degrees<00:02:13.360> which<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:13.960> pretty<00:02:14.110> good<00:02:14.290> for<00:02:14.470> for

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
degrees which is pretty good for for

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.500 
degrees which is pretty good for for
this<00:02:15.130> high<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.490> an<00:02:15.610> overclock<00:02:15.970> now<00:02:16.390> we're

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
this high of an overclock now we're

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.300 
this high of an overclock now we're
going<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.690> try<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.200> see<00:02:17.740> if<00:02:17.860> we<00:02:17.980> can<00:02:18.100> do<00:02:18.190> that

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
going to try and see if we can do that

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.120 
going to try and see if we can do that
with<00:02:18.400> 4.8<00:02:18.910> or<00:02:19.030> even<00:02:19.209> 5<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:22.860> as<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.980> can<00:02:24.070> see

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
with 4.8 or even 5 and as you can see

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.030 
with 4.8 or even 5 and as you can see
it's<00:02:24.489> working<00:02:24.640> we're<00:02:25.330> now<00:02:25.450> up<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.660> 4.8<00:02:26.590> G<00:02:26.830> and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
it's working we're now up to 4.8 G and

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.740 
it's working we're now up to 4.8 G and
there's<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.280> second<00:02:27.610> run<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.820> links<00:02:28.060> seems<00:02:28.630> to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
there's the second run of links seems to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.720 
there's the second run of links seems to
be<00:02:28.840> stable<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.350> far<00:02:29.590> we<00:02:30.100> had<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.340> increase<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
be stable so far we had to increase the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.270 
be stable so far we had to increase the
voltage<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.150> little<00:02:31.360> bit<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.570> 1.4<00:02:32.170> but<00:02:32.980> it's

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
voltage a little bit to 1.4 but it's

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.040 
voltage a little bit to 1.4 but it's
stable<00:02:33.910> 86<00:02:34.540> degrees<00:02:34.840> max<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.350> pretty<00:02:35.620> good

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
stable 86 degrees max so pretty good

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.760 
stable 86 degrees max so pretty good

then there's plenty of headroom to
reduce<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.910> fan<00:03:07.150> speed<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.480> make<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> system

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
reduce the fan speed and make the system

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
what siding can really do so we

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.680 
what siding can really do so we
installed<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.160> on<00:03:50.220> our<00:03:50.400> soccer<00:03:50.670> 2011<00:03:51.330> system
