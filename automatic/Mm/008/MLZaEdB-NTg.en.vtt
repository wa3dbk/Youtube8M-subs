difference and down see how it looks a
little<00:05:58.520> different<00:05:59.770> do<00:06:00.770> a<00:06:00.800> few<00:06:01.009> more<00:06:01.219> so<00:06:01.460> you

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
little different do a few more so you

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.689 
little different do a few more so you
can<00:06:01.759> see<00:06:01.969> the<00:06:02.120> difference<00:06:03.250> not<00:06:04.250> even<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.490> hair

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
can see the difference not even a hair

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.490 
can see the difference not even a hair
spray<00:06:04.909> this<00:06:05.060> one<00:06:05.300> because<00:06:05.900> y'all<00:06:06.139> know<00:06:06.349> it<00:06:06.379> was

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
spray this one because y'all know it was

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.800 
spray this one because y'all know it was
like<00:06:06.680> more<00:06:07.370> annoying<00:06:07.639> that's<00:06:08.599> how<00:06:08.780> I

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
like more annoying that's how I

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.230 
like more annoying that's how I
operate<00:06:10.930> I'm<00:06:11.930> gonna<00:06:12.080> clip<00:06:12.409> at<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.710> base<00:06:13.240> it's

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
operate I'm gonna clip at the base it's

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.649 
operate I'm gonna clip at the base it's
the<00:06:14.419> bait<00:06:14.629> the<00:06:14.810> base<00:06:14.960> of<00:06:15.139> your<00:06:15.199> hair<00:06:16.389> clip<00:06:17.389> and

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:24.399 
the bait the base of your hair clip and
roll<00:06:18.699> go<00:06:19.750> under<00:06:20.750> and<00:06:21.289> out<00:06:21.879> go<00:06:22.879> under<00:06:23.210> and<00:06:23.810> pull

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409 
roll go under and out go under and pull

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:30.550 
roll go under and out go under and pull
out<00:06:25.599> under<00:06:26.599> and<00:06:27.050> pull<00:06:27.469> out

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.490 

and<00:06:30.889> the<00:06:31.550> reason<00:06:31.700> I<00:06:31.970> say<00:06:32.000> clip<00:06:32.360> at<00:06:32.510> the<00:06:32.600> base<00:06:32.630> so

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
and the reason I say clip at the base so

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.290 
and the reason I say clip at the base so
that<00:06:33.530> you<00:06:33.710> can<00:06:33.860> get<00:06:33.980> a<00:06:34.010> fork<00:06:34.310> or<00:06:34.520> a<00:06:34.880> lot<00:06:35.210> of

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
that you can get a fork or a lot of

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.510 
that you can get a fork or a lot of
times<00:06:35.510> when<00:06:35.660> you<00:06:35.810> start<00:06:36.050> at<00:06:36.200> the<00:06:36.320> bottom<00:06:36.530> of

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
times when you start at the bottom of

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.550 
times when you start at the bottom of
your<00:06:37.669> hair<00:06:38.090> and<00:06:38.300> curl<00:06:38.540> up<00:06:38.750> you<00:06:39.110> don't<00:06:39.320> get<00:06:39.500> a

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
your hair and curl up you don't get a

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.800 
your hair and curl up you don't get a
full<00:06:39.889> core<00:06:40.160> you<00:06:40.370> have<00:06:40.610> end<00:06:40.850> of<00:06:40.940> curls<00:06:41.210> just<00:06:41.480> at

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
full core you have end of curls just at

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.720 
full core you have end of curls just at
the<00:06:41.930> bottom<00:06:42.290> so<00:06:42.770> that's<00:06:42.980> why<00:06:43.130> I<00:06:43.160> always<00:06:43.370> click

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
the bottom so that's why I always click

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.400 
the bottom so that's why I always click
the<00:06:43.910> base<00:06:44.500> that's<00:06:45.500> like<00:06:45.680> a<00:06:46.540> good<00:06:47.540> and<00:06:48.200> the

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
the base that's like a good and the

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.800 
the base that's like a good and the
ladders<00:06:49.040> movie<00:06:49.190> started<00:06:50.150> to<00:06:50.210> bake<00:06:50.389> so<00:06:50.570> you<00:06:50.630> can

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.730 
says how you not to look so you can hold
the<00:06:59.480> crows<00:06:59.630> this<00:06:59.900> way<00:07:00.050> you<00:07:00.290> can<00:07:00.440> hold<00:07:00.590> them

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
the crows this way you can hold them

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.150 
the crows this way you can hold them
this<00:07:00.889> way<00:07:01.070> at<00:07:01.250> an<00:07:01.370> angle<00:07:02.530> just<00:07:03.530> do<00:07:03.680> that<00:07:03.860> and

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
this way at an angle just do that and

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:12.219 
this way at an angle just do that and
then<00:07:04.479> pull<00:07:05.479> out<00:07:05.710> okay<00:07:08.080> you<00:07:09.080> see<00:07:10.990> kind<00:07:11.990> of<00:07:12.080> get

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229 
then pull out okay you see kind of get

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:16.330 
then pull out okay you see kind of get
the<00:07:12.350> same<00:07:12.650> effect<00:07:14.229> just<00:07:15.229> a<00:07:15.380> slight<00:07:15.680> difference

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
the same effect just a slight difference

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.930 
the same effect just a slight difference
so<00:07:17.240> that<00:07:17.510> way<00:07:17.810> may<00:07:18.020> be<00:07:18.080> easier<00:07:18.560> for<00:07:18.590> people<00:07:18.940> so

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
so that way may be easier for people so

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.510 
so that way may be easier for people so
that's<00:07:20.180> the<00:07:20.270> way<00:07:20.450> that<00:07:20.479> you<00:07:21.169> can<00:07:21.290> curl<00:07:21.620> your
