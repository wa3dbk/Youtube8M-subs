00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
now tempest by Julie cross this one was

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.270 
now tempest by Julie cross this one was
just<00:00:36.570> kind<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.320> middle<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> road<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.129> me

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
just kind of a middle of the road for me

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.729 
just kind of a middle of the road for me
it<00:00:38.399> wasn't<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.700> thumbs-up<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.329> thumbs-down<00:00:39.739> I

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
it wasn't a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.110 
it wasn't a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down I
thought<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> concept<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.760> really

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
thought the concept was really

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.639 
thought the concept was really
interesting<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:43.050> looking<00:00:43.290> forward<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
interesting and I was looking forward to

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.830 
interesting and I was looking forward to
reading<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.270> kept<00:00:45.660> finding

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
reading it but I just kept finding

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.229 
reading it but I just kept finding
myself<00:00:46.110> wanting<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.340> put<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> down<00:00:47.760> or<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.210> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
myself wanting to put it down or when I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.670 
myself wanting to put it down or when I
would<00:00:48.450> put<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> down<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.170> didn't<00:00:49.350> want<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.530> pick

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
would put it down I didn't want to pick

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.930 
would put it down I didn't want to pick
it<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.860> again<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.489> wasn't<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.879> was

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it up again and it wasn't that it was

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819 
it up again and it wasn't that it was
necessarily<00:00:51.360> bad<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.440> wasn't<00:00:52.590> holding

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
necessarily bad it just wasn't holding

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.610 
necessarily bad it just wasn't holding
my<00:00:52.980> attention<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.730> also<00:00:54.329> didn't<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
my attention I also didn't think that it

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.500 
my attention I also didn't think that it
quite<00:00:55.949> lived<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> concept<00:00:57.090> even

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
quite lived up to the concept even

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.459 
quite lived up to the concept even
though<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> concept<00:00:58.079> did<00:00:58.230> remain

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
though the concept did remain

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.080 
though the concept did remain
interesting<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> book<00:00:59.460> got<00:00:59.609> better<00:00:59.820> as<00:00:59.969> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
interesting in the book got better as it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.510 
interesting in the book got better as it
went<00:01:00.120> along<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.680> main<00:01:01.829> character<00:01:01.859> just

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
went along and the main character just

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.870 
went along and the main character just
didn't<00:01:02.760> seem<00:01:02.940> completely<00:01:03.449> authentic<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.229> me

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
didn't seem completely authentic to me

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.190 
didn't seem completely authentic to me
when<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> sea<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.150> rising<00:01:06.420> red<00:01:06.750> bike<00:01:06.990> at

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
when the sea is rising red bike at

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.250 
when the sea is rising red bike at
ellison<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.460> was<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.939> thumbs<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.810> kind<00:01:10.110> of

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
ellison this was a thumbs up but kind of

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
ellison this was a thumbs up but kind of
a<00:01:10.470> little<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> side<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.939> i<00:01:12.030> think<00:01:12.210> that's

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
a little to the side and i think that's

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.870 
a little to the side and i think that's
partly<00:01:12.600> my<00:01:12.689> fault<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.260> i<00:01:13.740> was<00:01:14.159> wanting<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
partly my fault because i was wanting a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.640 
partly my fault because i was wanting a
lot<00:01:15.060> from<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.049> don't<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
lot from this and I don't think that I

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.010 
lot from this and I don't think that I
necessarily<00:01:16.830> got<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.759> did<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
necessarily got it I did like it and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
necessarily got it I did like it and
thought<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.890> went<00:01:20.130> some<00:01:20.460> dark<00:01:20.820> places

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
thought that it went some dark places

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.940 
thought that it went some dark places
that<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.420> wasn't<00:01:21.720> expecting<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.680> little

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that I wasn't expecting it's a little

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.350 
that I wasn't expecting it's a little
harder<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.490> into<00:01:23.549> because<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> main

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
harder to get into because the main

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.480 
harder to get into because the main
character<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:25.170> completely<00:01:25.560> likable<00:01:26.130> for

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
character is not completely likable for

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.060

little<00:01:35.100> bit<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.369> witness<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> telling<00:01:36.630> but

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
little bit of witness in the telling but

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.390

for<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.990> most<00:01:37.110> part<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.409> did<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.130> I

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
thumbs up there were times that I was a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
little dubious about it and times that I

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.979 
little dubious about it and times that I
did<00:02:14.250> consider<00:02:14.459> putting<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:15.000> down<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:15.810> there

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
did consider putting it down but there

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.500 
did consider putting it down but there
was<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.440> fun<00:02:17.040> tongue-in-cheek<00:02:17.400> thing<00:02:18.300> that

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
was a fun tongue-in-cheek thing that

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.540 
was a fun tongue-in-cheek thing that
kept<00:02:18.720> me<00:02:18.780> reading<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.890> did<00:02:20.040> end<00:02:20.190> up<00:02:20.310> being

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
kept me reading and it did end up being

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.699 
kept me reading and it did end up being
good<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.000> do<00:02:21.330> think<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.900> could<00:02:21.989> use<00:02:22.319> some

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709
