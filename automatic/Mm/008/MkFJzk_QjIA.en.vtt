I<00:02:08.830> think<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.130> guy's<00:02:09.310> proof<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.700> evolution

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
I think this guy's proof of evolution

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.860 
I think this guy's proof of evolution
see<00:02:10.899> we've<00:02:11.350> evolved<00:02:11.920> much<00:02:12.459> further<00:02:12.760> than<00:02:13.180> this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
see we've evolved much further than this

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.979 
see we've evolved much further than this
man<00:02:14.079> he's<00:02:14.440> clearly<00:02:14.799> stuck<00:02:15.070> in<00:02:15.280> cinema<00:02:15.840> in<00:02:16.840> a

man he's clearly stuck in cinema in a
more<00:02:17.170> primitive<00:02:17.410> state<00:02:17.920> he<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.549> new

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
more primitive state he this is a new

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.910 
more primitive state he this is a new
level<00:02:18.940> though<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.420> idea<00:02:19.570> that<00:02:19.900> if<00:02:20.260> evolution

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
level though the idea that if evolution

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.849 
level though the idea that if evolution
says<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:22.209> we've<00:02:22.450> evolved<00:02:23.110> from<00:02:23.440> from

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859
