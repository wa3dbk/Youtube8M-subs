i<00:01:55.750> believe<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.380> concrete<00:01:56.830> creatine<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.429> we

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
i believe is the concrete creatine so we

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.279 
i believe is the concrete creatine so we
got<00:01:57.640> two<00:01:57.819> types<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.149> creatine<00:01:58.420> in<00:01:58.660> this<00:01:58.840> you

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
got two types of creatine in this you

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.600 
got two types of creatine in this you
got<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.590> monohydrate<00:01:59.860> which<00:02:00.340> has<00:02:00.489> been

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
got the monohydrate which has been

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.370 
got the monohydrate which has been
proven<00:02:01.119> time<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:01.360> time<00:02:01.569> again<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:02.080> give<00:02:02.259> you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
get phenomenal results it's the next you

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.300 
get phenomenal results it's the next you
know<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.140> better<00:02:14.349> than<00:02:14.560> my<00:02:14.709> hydrated<00:02:15.190> what

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
know it's better than my hydrated what

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.040 
know it's better than my hydrated what
they<00:02:15.430> say<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:15.880> nah<00:02:16.090> just<00:02:16.360> been<00:02:16.630> tested<00:02:17.020> and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
they say but nah just been tested and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.820 
they say but nah just been tested and
proven<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.470> they<00:02:17.590> know<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.129> that's

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
proven so they know that that's

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.820 
proven so they know that that's
going<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.980> work<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.340> they<00:02:19.430> put<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:19.850> here

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
going to work so they put that in here
