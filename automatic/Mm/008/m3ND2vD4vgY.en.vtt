00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.010
 do not 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 pee 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.329
 esteemed public reuben master ha 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.640
 come again with neither more nor less than 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.770
 the terror guide of the line 1000 the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.720
 called antich to be the inviolable the 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.360
 link to which the powerful catherine speaks 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.850
 He is with us live 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.219
 let us begin 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 we will take 21 points in the offensive part 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.899
 destined to pure ap and magic penetration 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.789
 We will invest the remaining points in 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.190
 utility reaching the improvement of 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.190
 books since this will not be very helpful 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.960
 at the time of having the blues in Rhodes 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.449
 will present us something very generic 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.729
 magical penetration in red the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.769
 generation of mana in yellow ap in 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.229
 blue and 15 new essences of apple 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.729
 in enchantments we can choose 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.190
 alacrity fury and distortion 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.320
 I personally like fury because 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.119
 It combines very well with our time of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.979
 talk about the order of skills here I 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.990
 allows you to suggest two options in the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.869
 first we will go up alternately quye 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.880
 leaving w for the last levels this 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.979
 will create a very global damage in team fights 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.569
 but we will have to be careful not to 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.450
 fail our e because then 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.909
 we lose enough effectiveness for another 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.039
 side we can also take wv leaving it 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.440
 in the last levels with this order 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.240
 we will have more availability for the week and 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.429
 in team fight we will become harm 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.319
 for a single objective to the mere style of 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.750
 white for which it forces us to maintain 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.299
 a more careful and strategic position 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.200
 to work properly this is the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.630
 I leave now 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 everyone's game my favorite part 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.969
 the sites here we can start with 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.740
 boots and potions although it is also useful 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.659
 start with sapphire since this way 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.579
 we will not stop throwing balls at 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.950
 our opponent at the cost of reducing 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.319
 a little mobility at once 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.299
 we will build chicero and cane boots 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.220
 of the cities the latter offers us 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.959
 a lot of stability but above all 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.390
 increases the chances of 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.190
 survival build tear is 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.200
 recommended for the mana hambra no 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.360
 However you can do without it if 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.250
 you manage the same well to finish 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.349
 we will put the hat on you and we can 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.420
 continue with beat fire depending on 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.370
 the needs of our departure are 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.799
 john lynch could be some items 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.340
 endings that will serve us very well I come back 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.200
 to repeat depending on our departure 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.130
 already with that the rest will be a children's thing 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.470
 So let's go to the game tips 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.840
 Catherine is a very dangerous champion and 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.670
 versatile its passive makes part of the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.260
 received damage becomes speed 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.570
 of attack and this works very well 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.000
 especially for the autotaxis of 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.160
 kazan 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.470
 when it comes to casarin balls 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.150
 they have the last word since their quota 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.190
 throws a ball that closes his mouth 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.220
 of enemy for up to 2 seconds and 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.350
 connects a disgustingly strong damage the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.330
 merlin the q is excellent to harass 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.280
 our opponent and punish him when he 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.260
 get too close this will create a 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.540
 feeling of fear and will facilitate the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.270
 farm since it is a weak point of house of 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.860
 import a melee champion side 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.050
 one is the skill that will allow us 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.740
 do the aforementioned since we can 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.450
 replenish the lost mana and giving autotaxi 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.250
 stability is powerful but it starts 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.320
 to use more efficiently starting 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.989
 from level 6 where we can enter and exit 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.850
 from the area of ​​the enemy lae is a 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.440
 Casarin skill area vomits his 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.330
 last meal slowing down the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.910
 enemies in a nearby cone and like 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.650
 that the q does considerable damage with 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.570
 this ability we will take back the 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.250
 enemy combining it with the q for 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.709
 mute it and disable it by 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.360
 complete if you thought you were 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.000
 skills are useful the last 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.890
 cassarino has mom this last one that 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.080
 allows you to flash enter and exit the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.090
 battle escape you reached enemy 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.920
 gun wants to steal jungle go through 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.470
 walls 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.819
 painting dribbling and scoring a basket is 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.250
 that's why this ability makes 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.010
 katherine be a sharp pain in the 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.050
 rear with stability you can fool 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.880
 your enemies use it while you walk to 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.920
 the opposite direction to them so that 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.110
 unsuspecting holds if you have 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.510
 a lot you should not hook your lines vote 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.880
 top to ensure advantage that's going to 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.100
 talk about the combo that requires years and 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.380
 years of practice to master it does 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.840
 lack of faith skill and nerves of steel 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.760
 Due to the complexity it is impossible 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.770
 describe it with words but in 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.540
 exclusive we have a fragment of his 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.540
 execution by professionals 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.430
 however , not all possess both 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.640
 level of power for this reason the how 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.860
 for mortals is rq followed by some 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.470
 auto attacks until the enemy leaves 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.960
 to breathe 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.090
 in the eardrums it must be very wise to 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.890
 use your last uses blind spots 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.290
 so the enemy does not know where you are 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.960
 and always appears behind the lane 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.360
 so that nothing does not connect any damage to 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.700
 your team and then run like a little girl 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.890
 with that we finished the catherine guide 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.050
 remember to subscribe if you liked 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.370
 Share your colleagues like the 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.650
 facebook page so they are 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.330
 always aware of the new guides and 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.430
 I like the video if you have the 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:31.280
 level of power as a home teacher 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.280
 I'm reuben master until next time 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.200
 of this and other videos are the 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.200
