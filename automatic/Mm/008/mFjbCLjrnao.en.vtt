welcome to natural stone systems TV I am
fan<00:00:04.110> Norman<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.859> today<00:00:05.160> we're<00:00:05.310> going<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.460> talk

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
fan Norman and today we're going to talk

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.960 
fan Norman and today we're going to talk
about<00:00:05.879> mounting<00:00:06.779> undermount<00:00:07.379> sinks<00:00:08.250> that

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
about mounting undermount sinks that

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.970 
about mounting undermount sinks that
seems<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.420> be<00:00:09.570> an<00:00:09.690> age-old<00:00:10.290> dilemma<00:00:10.500> how<00:00:10.920> you

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
seems to be an age-old dilemma how you

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.499 
seems to be an age-old dilemma how you
deal<00:00:11.280> with<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.820> how<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:11.969> make<00:00:12.179> sure<00:00:12.360> that

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
deal with it and how you make sure that

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.379 
deal with it and how you make sure that
your<00:00:12.599> sink<00:00:12.840> stay<00:00:13.080> up<00:00:13.170> there<00:00:13.320> forever<00:00:13.639> so<00:00:14.639> what

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
your sink stay up there forever so what

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.630 
your sink stay up there forever so what
I've<00:00:15.509> got<00:00:15.690> here<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.770> had<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> friend<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.580> mine

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
I've got here is I had a friend of mine

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.460 
I've got here is I had a friend of mine
call<00:00:18.300> me<00:00:18.420> with<00:00:18.539> an<00:00:18.690> idea<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:19.020> mounting

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
call me with an idea for mounting

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.689 
call me with an idea for mounting
undermount<00:00:19.770> sinks<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.310> thought<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.580> was<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
undermount sinks and I thought it was a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.840 
undermount sinks and I thought it was a
great<00:00:20.939> idea<00:00:21.020> so<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.199> he<00:00:22.289> did<00:00:22.439> was<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.430> after

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
great idea so what he did was so after

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.460 
great idea so what he did was so after
your<00:00:24.000> sink<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.359> already<00:00:24.689> done<00:00:24.869> your<00:00:25.140> granite

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
your sink is already done your granite

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
your sink is already done your granite
is<00:00:25.680> upside<00:00:26.039> down<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.519> your<00:00:26.820> sink<00:00:27.180> is

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
is upside down and your sink is

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.589 
is upside down and your sink is
siliconed<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.890> place<00:00:29.279> what<00:00:30.240> he<00:00:30.359> did<00:00:30.570> was

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
siliconed and in place what he did was

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.900 
siliconed and in place what he did was
he<00:00:30.840> took<00:00:31.230> thee<00:00:32.510> he<00:00:33.510> took<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.309> brackets<00:00:35.309> that

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
he took thee he took the brackets that

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.389 
he took thee he took the brackets that
come<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> undermount<00:00:36.600> sink<00:00:36.899> box<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.980> what

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
come in the undermount sink box and what

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.639 
come in the undermount sink box and what
we<00:00:38.489> did<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:38.899> we<00:00:39.899> bent<00:00:40.140> them<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.469> they

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
we did was we bent them so that they

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.700 
we did was we bent them so that they
look<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:42.450> opened<00:00:42.809> up<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
look like this now we opened up the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.729 
look like this now we opened up the
right<00:00:43.950> angle<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:45.329> put<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> little<00:00:45.989> bit<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
right angle and we put a little bit of a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.520 
right angle and we put a little bit of a
band<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.640> side<00:00:47.910> now<00:00:48.539> how<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.899> work<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
band on that side now how this work is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.340 
band on that side now how this work is
and<00:00:49.860> its<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.610> pretty<00:00:50.850> slick<00:00:51.270> i'm<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.260> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
and its really pretty slick i'm going to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.540 
and its really pretty slick i'm going to
show<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.770> groove<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> what<00:00:59.160> i<00:00:59.190> did<00:00:59.340> here

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
show you this groove so what i did here

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.090 
show you this groove so what i did here
was<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.379> cut<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> notch<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:03.030> granite

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
was I just cut a notch and the granite

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.140 
was I just cut a notch and the granite
you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.400> many<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.790> them<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:05.970> you'd<00:01:06.119> like

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you can do as many of them as you'd like

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.390 
you can do as many of them as you'd like
it<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.900> right<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.140> there's<00:01:07.470> another<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.450 

cut<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> notch<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.909> granite<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.460> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
cut the notch in the granite and the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.450 
cut the notch in the granite and the
side<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.909> was<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.479> angle<00:01:19.130> goes<00:01:20.130> into

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
side that was a right angle goes into

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.349 
side that was a right angle goes into
the<00:01:20.580> notch

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.660 

and<00:01:26.359> it<00:01:26.479> gets<00:01:26.570> tapped<00:01:26.869> in<00:01:27.109> place<00:01:27.520> we've<00:01:28.520> got

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
and it gets tapped in place we've got

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:43.169 
and it gets tapped in place we've got
another<00:01:28.880> one<00:01:29.060> that's<00:01:29.240> bad<00:01:38.200> how<00:01:39.429> that<00:01:40.429> works<00:01:40.670> is

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:49.559 

I'm<00:01:44.179> going<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.390> give<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.569> close<00:01:44.810> up<00:01:44.840> here

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.609 

you'll<00:01:50.569> see<00:01:50.659> that<00:01:50.929> just<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.289> way<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.500> the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
you'll see that just the way that the

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.410 
you'll see that just the way that the
physics<00:01:52.009> is<00:01:52.159> going<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.399> work<00:01:52.579> is<00:01:52.969> with<00:01:53.299> the

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
physics is going to work is with the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.880 
physics is going to work is with the
right<00:01:53.600> angle<00:01:53.959> that's<00:01:54.079> in<00:01:54.259> here<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.619> way<00:01:54.709> that

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
right angle that's in here the way that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.999 
right angle that's in here the way that
that's<00:01:54.979> bent<00:01:55.280> into<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:55.849> slot<00:01:56.560> if<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.770> sink

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
that's bent into that slot if the sink

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.529 
that's bent into that slot if the sink
tries<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.399> come<00:01:58.579> out<00:01:58.759> it's<00:01:59.030> going<00:01:59.209> to<00:01:59.299> bend

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
tries to come out it's going to bend

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.559 
tries to come out it's going to bend
back<00:01:59.869> on<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.319> piece<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.329> give<00:02:02.329> you<00:02:02.450> the

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
back on that piece and give you the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.120 
back on that piece and give you the
structural<00:02:03.049> integrity<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.619> keep<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.920> sink

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
structural integrity to keep the sink

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.880 
structural integrity to keep the sink
mounted<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:05.989> last<00:02:06.140> thing<00:02:06.319> that<00:02:06.469> I'm<00:02:06.709> going

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
mounted so the last thing that I'm going

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:31.309 
mounted so the last thing that I'm going
to<00:02:06.950> do<00:02:07.390> on<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.450> is

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.569 

now<00:02:32.319> there<00:02:32.469> are<00:02:32.500> several<00:02:32.920> ways<00:02:33.189> to<00:02:33.250> mount

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
now there are several ways to mount

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.339 
now there are several ways to mount
undermount<00:02:33.969> sinks<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.689> is<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.109> one<00:02:35.319> of

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
undermount sinks this is just one of

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.740 
undermount sinks this is just one of
them<00:02:35.590> there<00:02:36.189> are<00:02:36.459> some<00:02:36.819> nice<00:02:37.000> undermount<00:02:37.420> sink

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
them there are some nice undermount sink

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.119 
them there are some nice undermount sink
brackets<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.349> you<00:02:38.439> can<00:02:38.590> get<00:02:38.739> that<00:02:38.769> cost

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
brackets that you can get that cost

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:49.410 
brackets that you can get that cost
about<00:02:39.629> 20-some<00:02:40.629> dollars<00:02:41.049> apiece<00:02:48.239> these<00:02:49.239> just

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
about 20-some dollars apiece these just
