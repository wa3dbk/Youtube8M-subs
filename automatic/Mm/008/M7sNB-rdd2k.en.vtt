that is in your skill level range we're

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.320 
that is in your skill level range we're
on<00:01:06.240> some<00:01:06.990> days<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.890> play<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.030> at

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
for you know a host of reasons but on

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.940 
for you know a host of reasons but on
average<00:01:21.270> you've<00:01:21.780> kind<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.170> got<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> normal

skill<00:01:23.460> level<00:01:24.409> but<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.530> average<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.130> sort<00:01:26.369> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
skill level but on average you sort of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.460 
skill level but on average you sort of
have<00:01:26.580> an<00:01:26.729> average<00:01:27.030> sort<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> normal<00:01:27.990> skill

we<00:01:40.229> play<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> match<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.520> sort<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.790> play

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
we play a match we really sort of play

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.289 
we play a match we really sort of play
throughout<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.049> match<00:01:43.380> somewhere<00:01:44.100> from<00:01:45.090> our

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
throughout that match somewhere from our

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.139 
throughout that match somewhere from our
top<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:46.380> our<00:01:46.530> normal<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.310> our<00:01:47.460> lower<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
top to our normal to our lower and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.210 
top to our normal to our lower and
really<00:01:48.689> right<00:01:49.259> here<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> middle<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
really right here in the middle is

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
really right here in the middle is
probably<00:01:51.000> fewer<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.200> able<00:01:52.290> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
probably fewer to you know be able to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.350 
probably fewer to you know be able to
chart<00:01:52.829> each<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.430> every<00:01:53.700> point<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
chart each and every point that you

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.810 
chart each and every point that you
played<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:55.049> think<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.740> you'd<00:01:55.890> find<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
played I think what you'd find is the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.060 
played I think what you'd find is the

visualize seeing yourself playing at
your<00:06:39.659> top<00:06:39.930> level<00:06:40.439> it's<00:06:40.979> so<00:06:41.339> easy<00:06:41.639> to<00:06:41.879> kind<00:06:42.180> of

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
your top level it's so easy to kind of

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.230 
your top level it's so easy to kind of
panic<00:06:42.719> a<00:06:42.839> little<00:06:42.870> bit<00:06:43.139> and<00:06:43.469> to<00:06:44.339> kind<00:06:44.879> of<00:06:44.999> see

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
panic a little bit and to kind of see

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.749 
panic a little bit and to kind of see
yourself<00:06:45.719> not<00:06:46.050> playing<00:06:46.409> well<00:06:46.620> maybe<00:06:47.309> missing
