00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.350
 ah 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.000
 and so we continue with the whole design 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.700
 then we expect approximately 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.650
 between 3 to 6 hours so that we have it 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.170
 fully dry that effect 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.869
 frosted glass is the other 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.400
 video and so we really do not come 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.579
 merely ready 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.230
 this one I mean this one, this is not the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.210
 step that we are going to do now ok the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.070
 frosted the one on mary side we have this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.379
 product that is called emery a gabi and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.199
 an excellent product to do the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.730
 frosted feeling and because the 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.160
 frosted video is going 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.589
 It is usually done by sandblasting itself 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.120
 or with acid ok then this product is 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.190
 Water-based is easily us 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.860
 we can wash our brush in water not 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.699
 they are toxic and likewise can 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.699
 work children 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.160
 Anton products are almost endless 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.750
 in this work that is here unveiled 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.520
 is very good 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.130
 already after we have put the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.710
 frosted then here so that we 're 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.750
 get corrugated and apply our jewel 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.740
 liquid in the center 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.740
 from the flowers 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.870
 these products that do not require 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.660
 no type of fixative ie 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.480
 submit it to furnaces for heat to 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.620
 can fix them and they simply fix 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.160
 with the season with the temperature 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.440
 environment of this good product the 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.240
 products in general so that they have a 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.130
 complete drying have to pass 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.740
 approximately three days to then be 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.220
 washing ok yes but already after 24 hours 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.910
 they can not be touched without being 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.890
 take off because then we have here 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.890
 our classic metal 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.830
 to use red 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.790
 the stained glass come in 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.340
 in 29 colors we have the ones that we have 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.400
 also the 14 that are rough in this 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.110
 case we have a rugged red color and 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.850
 also here you have to be very generous in 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.170
 applying them because if we do not 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.140
 will be fully ready then 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.520
 what else apply so that it is more than not 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.520
 drink the direct corrugated 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.170
 of this material that can then 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.329
 observe that here we have applied this and 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.250
 already after being dry we are given 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.130
 these effects 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.630
 of the grinding and the smooth effects that 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.910
 they usually have stained glass windows that are 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.710
 united by strangers and here we have 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.810
 that effect that is done through 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.810
 our glass liner 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.140
 in the case of this we have 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.740
 approximately 12 hours after having 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.870
 dried and then you can touch on the no 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.520
 it takes off yes but you have to wait 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.990
 approximately 75 hours in 32 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.480
 hours exactly so that it's 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.480
 fully dry and can be washed
