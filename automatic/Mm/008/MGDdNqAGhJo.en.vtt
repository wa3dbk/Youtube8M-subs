00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.889
 yes I think that on Tuesday we will have the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.110
 last time to redo the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.080
 things well the real madrid has already lived 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 in the bernabÃ©u more than one magical night 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 especially in the european cup 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.640
 We will try to add a new one to the list 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.640
 and achieve as much as possible 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.809
 So they have to support us 100% 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.369
 from the beginning with such conviction and 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:30.509
 as they always do so in this 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.430
 I do not have the slightest sense 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.620
 concern 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.330
 I am convinced that the Madridistas 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.750
 They will also take us in awe in this 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.750
 match 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.359
 and I think it's important to try to score 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.990
 an early goal but at the same time without 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.850
 lose your head 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:52.430
 in my opinion find a term 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.080
 intermediate will be very very important good 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.190
 I think that in all the parties in the 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.620
 champions league in results 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.420
 important not to fit any goal by 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.670
 that we should try to play in attack with 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.920
 control and very concentrated but also 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.390
 keep stability behind and try 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.390
 anticipate in the divided balls 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.240
 Christian is a great professional like the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.980
 rest of the companions but 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.020
 We especially need him and his 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.130
 goals this Tuesday we all hope to be able to 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.840
 do a good performance as a team 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.600
 I think we feel even safer 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.340
 before our audience the deceased is a 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.680
 great feeling play with our 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.350
 fans behind us we play 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.760
 with great naturalness I'm sure 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.340
 that on Tuesday we will also do a great 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.200
 match 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.210
 but as I have said it will be a 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.820
 complicated task because not only is it worth it 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.990
 with winning 10 but we need a 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.990
 very high performance 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.640
 I know them very well are about 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.219
 great players and very good 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.719
 people but on Tuesday the fact that 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.770
 let's play together in the German national team 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.770
 does not count at all 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.390
 I think it's not appropriate to talk about 25 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.340
 of May but it is more appropriate to think about 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.140
 on Tuesday I think only of tracing the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.140
 result of the going and not something else
