00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.469
 Schweighöfer in the main role but also 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.080
 staged by him in the German 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.619
 Cinemas I have seen him in advance and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.820
 it's about father's happiness now 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.170
 I have no more money who will show then 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.699
 I'll tell you how to earn without money 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.699
 How to turn your hobby into a profession 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.359
 but with tender I liked that was 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.399
 but not him I would like the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.350
 did not thank her brother 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.270
 but just a little baby can 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:48.469
 I have a suitable donor for you 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.469
 find the can call their men 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.080
 The little guy down there a lot 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.610
 done can please times 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.670
 It means that they can still express 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.680
 fuck 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:11.740
 but the team has sterilized her 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:14.050
 means I can not be so great too 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.750
 not the whole time still howling 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.240
 hungry and then shit each other 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.890
 but does children still say everything? 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.090
 again good 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.810
 then he either has no kids or 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.030
 is not at home 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.790
 it must be possible my own 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.790
 used sperm to rummage 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.869
 I can rest my brought 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.009
 relax 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.009
 so warm and 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.830
 maybe how it came in comes 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.720

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.910
 to be a good mother you are going you 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.770

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:10.960
 shakira all means horst eckel shocked 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.450
 Pig and experience that has nothing 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.340
 to search 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.739
 you have 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.739
 the family is created by love 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.980
 we need the egg liqueur 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.980
 urgent 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.820
 Father's pleasures are 110 minutes away 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.920
 released and expected six years 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.680
 us starting thursday so the 6 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.480
 February 2014 in the German cinemas 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.550
 the story of felix played him 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.350
 from matthias schweighöfer he is 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.460
 bachelor he loves the bachelor 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.780
 actually does not really want that 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.610
 fathers are because some are best 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.960
 Dads are now family and fathers 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.340
 this whole family seems to live 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.620
 to be very exhausting and somehow 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.150
 repels him rather than one 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.530
 Incident with the pet of his 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.810
 Brothers played by Friedrich Mücke 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.680
 account that is being quasi sterilized and 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.150
 they do not care about it anymore 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.710
 Decide if he is a day father 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.240
 is yes, then he thinks yet again 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.340
 think about it and discover it 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.780
 he has a whole new world of children 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.730
 About artificially looking at a seed bank 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.710
 Donated due to lack of money and this 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.300
 track of this donated sat will be afterwards 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.610
 the prosecution also succeeded in doing so 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.050
 tracked by a sky moderator 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.760
 from isabell polak one knows from the 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.230
 series angry girls among others the 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.150
 I also find the cast here best 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.770
 responds from everyone and then is 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.570
 of course the question between this woman 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.190
 who hardly knows this man and felix you 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.170
 like to know if there maybe one 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.030
 his child can be born but 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.560
 even between a relationship that forces 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.090
 of course, the drama be the comedy 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.010
 piece far perfect and then I have to 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.330
 But the film is also so bad 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.710
 predictable after all alone 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.390
 trailer that he hardly any surprises 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.700
 while walking has come with the 110 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.590
 minutes too long, therefore, as a comedy 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.390
 the strip is quite funny 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.350
 especially because he matthias 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.030
 Schweighöfer be a bit like that 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.500
 usual program ran friedrich 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.120
 mosquito does not work so well 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.530
 I really do not like the movie 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.790
 was not a dam last 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.620
 not while he's in the comedy 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.600
 friendship with Schweighöfer 1 pretty 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.150
 it's cool that they are quasi 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.010
 a gag fireworks that's nothing 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.690
 Isabel paula church is the only one 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.820
 coolest in the cast is the movie 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.110
 as a comedy such a rather unpleasant 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.490
 number i am especially then he becomes 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.810
 strong when a bit more serious 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.489
 that it's always this structure 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.739
 At some point he comes so morally 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.480
 waste and the and the seriousness 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.160
 the topic children fathers themselves 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.180
 decision self-determination and there is 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.650
 the film then not bad at all 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.570
 really strong in one or the other 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.220
 but then you have dialogue on it 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.200
 not so much for a whole hour 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.240
 to wait in the cinema, however that may be 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.070
 the strip is not under the line 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.450
 badly done properly 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.130
 you can watch it especially for 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.720
 Schweighöfer fans probably exactly 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.700
 has the right on the other side 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.410
 you constantly feel this 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.330
 Fließband watching movies from Schweighöfer 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.190
 just like you became or how 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.900
 make a conclusion 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.670
 same lux is this typical too of 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.440
 til schweiger with a created warner look 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.260
 German comedies with these 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.580
 American rides with this forever 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.440
 same color filter that would have you 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.790
 Feel the whole thing hunted by instagram 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.350
 with these American songs the 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.970
 underneath and this cover and 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.170
 fill in product placement I found that 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.580
 at Schlossmacher already crass but also 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.220
 here are a lot of companies again 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.540
 like mcdonald's in mercedes like gsw and 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.640
 many others in the movie like that 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.440
 obviously placed in that me 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.850
 that's pretty annoying , it has 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.740
 torch goethe, for example, with pickup 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.330
 pretty cool not here that he made 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.590
 but it has to be done well 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.600
 budget for the strip too 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.740
 get together anyway 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.390
 Light the crowd at 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.500
 Father's delights in my opinion 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.270
 movie when you see the trailer 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.370
 one felt the films saw 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.660
 but at the end as I said as a comedy 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.250
 not really working there 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.440
 he gets from me in his job as 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.660
 Comedy only three and a half out of 10 possible 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.700
 score points and overall I have to say that 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.650
 It is exactly the right one for fans 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.080
 because he is technically okay and so 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.640
 also acceptable but nothing to me 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.750
 Surprised that I think too bad and me 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.160
 I wish that too matthias 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.720
 Schweighöfer again a bit 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.760
 more surprised than he can 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.340
 actually and not too much feeling 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.600
 at least in favor of the trade 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.760
 I know that's tempting, of course 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.740
 can be for filmmakers but for a long time 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.880
 This is not just long term and 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.340
 that gets the broad 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.540
 Eventually sometime finally with audience 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.100
 and that means the stripes of me 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.510
 altogether acceptable six out of ten 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.490
 possible points get with but 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.169
 a very big path sign for the 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.320
 future I am through with mine 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.090
 leave a review for to fatherly pleasures 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.290
 let them stay that way if not 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.760
 otherwise there are a few more 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.710
 movie reviews twitter and facebook or 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.960
 abo buttons tomorrow at 15 o'clock but 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.610
 at the latest a new video and then it 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.040
 I hope tomorrow with it 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.040
 of course on the 3rd
