okay<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.469> take<00:00:01.680> your<00:00:01.770> x-ray<00:00:02.070> film<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.490> you

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
okay so take your x-ray film and you

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.180 
okay so take your x-ray film and you
can't<00:00:02.730> peel<00:00:02.909> off<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.179> back<00:00:03.410> you<00:00:04.410> have<00:00:04.650> one

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
can't peel off the back you have one

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.590 
can't peel off the back you have one
layer<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.430> paper<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:06.029> you're<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.299> fold

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
layer of paper that you're going to fold

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.200 
layer of paper that you're going to fold
to<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.870> back<00:00:07.370> and<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.580> other<00:00:08.700> side<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
to the back and the other side of the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.430 
to the back and the other side of the
paper<00:00:09.360> comes<00:00:09.630> around<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.019> front<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.410> you

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
paper comes around to the front so you

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.080 
paper comes around to the front so you
have<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.740> layer<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.040> lead<00:00:11.250> which<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
have the layer of lead which is on the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.640 
have the layer of lead which is on the
most<00:00:12.269> superficial<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.990> then<00:00:13.080> right<00:00:13.230> deep<00:00:13.469> to

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
most superficial and then right deep to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.440 
most superficial and then right deep to
that<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.400> layer<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.759> second<00:00:15.120> layer<00:00:15.240> paper

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
that is the layer a second layer paper

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.390 
that is the layer a second layer paper
so<00:00:16.350> what's<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.680> middle<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.039> your<00:00:17.190> kind<00:00:17.340> of

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
so what's in the middle is your kind of

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.689 
so what's in the middle is your kind of
clearish<00:00:17.970> piece<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.660> film<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.830> clip<00:00:20.130> only<00:00:20.369> that

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
clearish piece of film so clip only that

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.060 
clearish piece of film so clip only that
piece<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.029> film<00:00:21.240> you're<00:00:21.539> actually<00:00:21.840> clip<00:00:22.070> I'm

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
piece of film you're actually clip I'm

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.560 
piece of film you're actually clip I'm
confirming<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.640> both<00:00:23.789> sides<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.420> it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
confirming on both sides that I have it

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.599 
confirming on both sides that I have it
I'm<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> dunk<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.189> developer

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
I'm going to dunk it in the developer

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.540 
I'm going to dunk it in the developer
for<00:00:26.640> 15<00:00:27.180> seconds<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.949> developer<00:00:29.400> will

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
for 15 seconds so the developer will

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.970 
for 15 seconds so the developer will
make<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> film<00:00:29.970> turn<00:00:30.179> black<00:00:30.590> in<00:00:31.590> areas<00:00:31.949> that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
make the film turn black in areas that

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.709 
make the film turn black in areas that
were<00:00:32.189> exposed<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> x-rays<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.630> then

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
were exposed to the x-rays and then

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.670 
were exposed to the x-rays and then
areas<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.140> work<00:00:34.320> will<00:00:34.860> stay<00:00:35.100> white<00:00:36.680> we

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
areas at work will stay white we

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.229 
areas at work will stay white we
encounter<00:00:38.070> ahead<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.309> 15<00:00:38.460> seconds<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.149> I've

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
encounter ahead to 15 seconds so I've

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.940 
encounter ahead to 15 seconds so I've
been<00:00:39.420> dunked<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.230> about<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:40.410> seven<00:00:40.860> or

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
been dunked in for about like seven or

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.150 
been dunked in for about like seven or
so<00:00:41.100> now

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.110 

take<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.220> look<00:00:50.430> make<00:00:50.700> sure<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.000> I've

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
take a look make sure that I've

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
take a look make sure that I've
developed<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:51.780> happy<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> action<00:00:52.950> I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
developed I'm happy with the action I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.590 
developed I'm happy with the action I
can<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.340> after<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.850> whole<00:00:54.090> tooth<00:00:54.330> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
can see that after the whole tooth in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.620 
can see that after the whole tooth in
the<00:00:54.690> x-ray<00:00:55.880> probably<00:00:56.880> put<00:00:57.060> in<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> couple

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
the x-ray probably put in for a couple

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.100 
the x-ray probably put in for a couple
more<00:00:58.050> seconds<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.650> make<00:00:58.770> sure<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.960> I<00:01:00.960> want

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
more seconds just to make sure so I want

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.390 
more seconds just to make sure so I want
to<00:01:01.170> make<00:01:01.290> sure<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.620> visualize<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.280> root

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
to make sure I can visualize the root

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.090 
to make sure I can visualize the root
canal<00:01:02.640> system<00:01:03.260> prints<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.320> off<00:01:04.440> in<00:01:04.590> water<00:01:04.800> for

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
canal system prints it off in water for

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.500 
canal system prints it off in water for
about<00:01:05.160> five<00:01:05.460> seconds<00:01:05.910> so<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> don't

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
about five seconds so I don't

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.450 
about five seconds so I don't
cross-contaminate<00:01:06.780> my<00:01:07.440> fixer<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> ruin<00:01:08.370> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
cross-contaminate my fixer and ruin the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.700 
cross-contaminate my fixer and ruin the
fixer<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:11.150> then<00:01:12.150> place<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.260> film<00:01:13.470> into<00:01:13.620> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
fixer and then place the film into the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.400 
fixer and then place the film into the
fixer<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.250> third<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.580> here<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.170> will

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
fixer this third one here and this will

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.310 
fixer this third one here and this will
just<00:01:16.530> let<00:01:16.740> sit<00:01:17.010> for<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.870> minute<00:01:18.870> or<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:21.320> because

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
just let sit for a minute or so because

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.600 
just let sit for a minute or so because
it<00:01:22.440> just<00:01:22.560> stops<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.920> catalyzed<00:01:23.220> interaction

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
it just stops the catalyzed interaction

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.590 
it just stops the catalyzed interaction
we<00:01:23.670> don't<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:23.880> need<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> pay<00:01:24.240> attention<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
we don't really need to pay attention to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
we don't really need to pay attention to
it<00:01:24.750> there's<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.410> line<00:01:25.590> behind<00:01:25.830> me<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.190> would<00:01:26.430> let

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
it there's a line behind me I would let

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160 
it there's a line behind me I would let
somebody<00:01:26.760> else<00:01:26.910> go<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:27.510> and<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:27.960> their

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
somebody else go now and do their

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
somebody else go now and do their
developer<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.280> once<00:01:29.460> they<00:01:29.580> were<00:01:29.610> done<00:01:29.729> with

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
developer and once they were done with

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.150 
developer and once they were done with
the<00:01:30.000> developer<00:01:30.390> my<00:01:30.570> fixing<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.890> done<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
the developer my fixing what we done and

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.380 
the developer my fixing what we done and
all<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.580> do<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.729> rinse<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.030> off<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.300> his

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
all I have to do is rinse it off and his

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.950 
all I have to do is rinse it off and his
fourth<00:01:33.630> pin<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.200> I'd<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.380> done<00:01:35.810> alright<00:01:36.810> so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
fourth pin and I'd be done alright so

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.810 
fourth pin and I'd be done alright so
we've<00:01:37.080> been<00:01:37.200> fixing<00:01:37.410> it<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.770> long<00:01:37.920> enough<00:01:38.190> in

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
we've been fixing it for long enough in

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.280 
we've been fixing it for long enough in
adequate<00:01:39.150> fixing<00:01:39.570> time<00:01:39.720> would<00:01:39.869> meet<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
adequate fixing time would meet up the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.660 
adequate fixing time would meet up the
film<00:01:40.650> will<00:01:40.800> continue<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.130> develop<00:01:41.430> over<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
film will continue to develop over a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.420 
film will continue to develop over a
long<00:01:41.820> period<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> time<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.920> maybe<00:01:44.160> by<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
long period of time so like maybe by the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.920 
long period of time so like maybe by the
time<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.729> get<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> course<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.450> whole<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
time you get to the course the whole the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.680 
time you get to the course the whole the
whole<00:01:45.960> film<00:01:46.320> would<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.530> white<00:01:47.090> but<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
whole film would be white but for now I

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.510 
whole film would be white but for now I
think<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.619> fix<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> long<00:01:50.100> enough<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.400> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
think we fix it long enough so that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.910 
think we fix it long enough so that
won't<00:01:50.670> happen<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.320> let's<00:01:52.320> here's<00:01:52.530> permits

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
