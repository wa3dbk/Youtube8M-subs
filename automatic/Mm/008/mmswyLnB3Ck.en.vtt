cracks this driveway before we seal it

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.940 
cracks this driveway before we seal it
is<00:00:06.330> we<00:00:06.600> need<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.899> clean<00:00:07.230> it<00:00:07.379> very<00:00:07.620> thoroughly

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
is we need to clean it very thoroughly

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.759 
is we need to clean it very thoroughly
so<00:00:08.340> I'm<00:00:08.460> using<00:00:08.730> just<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.630> concentrated<00:00:10.469> cleaner

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
so I'm using just a concentrated cleaner

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.650 
so I'm using just a concentrated cleaner
I<00:00:10.920> like<00:00:11.309> simple<00:00:11.639> green<00:00:11.880> but<00:00:12.179> there's<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.389> lot<00:00:12.540> of

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
I like simple green but there's a lot of

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.240 
I like simple green but there's a lot of
different<00:00:13.110> chemicals<00:00:14.009> for<00:00:14.190> cleaning

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
different chemicals for cleaning

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.359 
different chemicals for cleaning
blacktop<00:00:15.120> also<00:00:15.780> any<00:00:16.049> good<00:00:16.320> detergent<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.130> good

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
blacktop also any good detergent is good

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.160 
blacktop also any good detergent is good
so<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> first<00:00:18.180> step<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.690> want<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.900> clean

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
these crack pillars it's much better on

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.040 
these crack pillars it's much better on
a<00:00:25.560> very<00:00:25.890> hot<00:00:26.189> day<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.510> get<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> little

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
a very hot day if we get a little

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.269 
a very hot day if we get a little
moisture<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.619> here<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:28.830> don't<00:00:28.920> want<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.220> do

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
moisture in here we don't want to do

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.970 
moisture in here we don't want to do
standing<00:00:29.730> water<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.810> if<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.230> clean<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.740> first

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
standing water but if you clean it first

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.709 
standing water but if you clean it first
and<00:00:32.250> leave<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.730> damp<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and leave it a little damp it's going to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.729 
and leave it a little damp it's going to
cure<00:00:34.020> much<00:00:34.230> better

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
cure much better

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.830 
cure much better
