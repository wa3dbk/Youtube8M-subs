you<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:31.099> try<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.510> with<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.540> 350<00:00:34.230> QX<00:00:34.469> make

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
you can try this with your 350 QX make

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.389 
you can try this with your 350 QX make
sure<00:00:35.399> your<00:00:35.730> props<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.680> balanced<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:37.829> well<00:00:38.010> so

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
sure your props are balanced as well so

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.700 
sure your props are balanced as well so
before<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.820> try<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.059> okay<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.930> I'm<00:00:40.290> probably

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
before you try this okay so I'm probably

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.000 
before you try this okay so I'm probably
going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.160> doing<00:00:41.940> some<00:00:42.360> how-to<00:00:43.350> on

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to see that the three blade props do add

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.359 
to see that the three blade props do add
some<00:01:00.920> nice<00:01:01.920> stability<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.210> steadiness<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
some nice stability and steadiness to

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.520 
some nice stability and steadiness to
the<00:01:05.369> flight<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.350> regular

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the flight here this is just a regular

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.499 
the flight here this is just a regular
GoPro<00:01:09.020> hero3<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.500> mounted<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:13.740> regular<00:01:14.509> 350

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
GoPro hero3 I mounted on the regular 350

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.969 
GoPro hero3 I mounted on the regular 350
QX<00:01:15.720> mount<00:01:16.170> no<00:01:17.060> stabilization<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.979> any

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
QX mount no stabilization here or any

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
QX mount no stabilization here or any
gimbal<00:01:20.369> attached<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> nice

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
gimbal attached there so this is a nice

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.940 
gimbal attached there so this is a nice
surprise<00:01:23.090> with<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.299> three<00:01:24.750> blade<00:01:24.930> props<00:01:25.229> okay

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
surprise with the three blade props okay

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.330 
surprise with the three blade props okay
so<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.549> conclusion<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:28.290> three<00:01:28.829> blade<00:01:29.040> props

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
so in conclusion the three blade props

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.690 
so in conclusion the three blade props
from<00:01:29.939> master<00:01:30.810> air<00:01:30.960> screw<00:01:31.340> once<00:01:32.340> again<00:01:32.520> right

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
from master air screw once again right

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.260 
from master air screw once again right
now<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:32.939> using<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.299> eight<00:01:34.110> by<00:01:34.470> six<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.970> does

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
now I'm using the eight by six it does

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.859 
now I'm using the eight by six it does
adds<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.140> cool<00:01:37.500> factor<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.759> 350<00:01:39.360> QX<00:01:39.570> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
adds the cool factor on the 350 QX of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
adds the cool factor on the 350 QX of
course<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.500> looks<00:01:40.560> pretty<00:01:40.920> pretty<00:01:41.579> nice<00:01:41.820> when

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
course it looks pretty pretty nice when

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.749 
course it looks pretty pretty nice when
you<00:01:42.240> when<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.649> audio<00:01:43.979> 350<00:01:44.520> QX

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
you when you have this audio 350 QX

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
you when you have this audio 350 QX
that's<00:01:45.630> number<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.439> course<00:01:46.470> unlike

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
that's number one and of course unlike

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.899 
that's number one and of course unlike
the<00:01:47.700> added<00:01:48.320> stability<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.920> steadiness<00:01:50.430> as

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the added stability and steadiness as

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.450 
the added stability and steadiness as
far<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.329> shooting<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> GoPro<00:01:53.070> hero3

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
far as shooting with the GoPro hero3

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.300 
far as shooting with the GoPro hero3
regularly<00:01:54.450> mounted<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.020> there<00:01:55.290> that's<00:01:55.950> cool

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
regularly mounted on there that's cool

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.990 
regularly mounted on there that's cool
for<00:01:56.340> video<00:01:57.000> shooting<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:58.130> fpv<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> like

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
for video shooting and fpv so I like

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.770 
for video shooting and fpv so I like
that<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> lot

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
that a lot

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780 
that a lot
the<00:02:01.320> only<00:02:01.500> thing<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:02.159> don't<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.430> is

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the only thing I really don't like is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.740 
the only thing I really don't like is
when<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.149> comes<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.219> battery<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.479> was

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
when it comes to the battery and I was

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.109 
when it comes to the battery and I was
far<00:02:06.960> as<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.170> draining<00:02:07.619> I'm<00:02:08.550> only<00:02:08.759> getting

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
far as the draining I'm only getting

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.350 
far as the draining I'm only getting
about<00:02:09.440> five<00:02:10.440> five-and-a-half<00:02:11.400> minutes<00:02:11.849> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
about five five-and-a-half minutes of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.559 
about five five-and-a-half minutes of
light<00:02:12.780> but

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
light but

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.860 
light but
in<00:02:13.659> negative<00:02:14.469> consideration<00:02:15.189> it<00:02:15.819> is<00:02:15.879> cold<00:02:16.329> out

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
in negative consideration it is cold out

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.539 
in negative consideration it is cold out
right<00:02:16.930> now<00:02:17.409> so<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.920> battery<00:02:18.219> might<00:02:18.400> be

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
right now so the battery might be

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.940 
right now so the battery might be
draining<00:02:18.909> faster<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.079> that<00:02:20.379> means<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.799> might

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
draining faster so that means I might

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.030 
draining faster so that means I might
have<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.219> do<00:02:21.340> some<00:02:21.519> more<00:02:21.639> testing<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.859> far

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
have to do some more testing but so far

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.059 
have to do some more testing but so far
there<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.459> noticeable<00:02:24.879> drop<00:02:25.870> as<00:02:26.379> far<00:02:26.620> as<00:02:26.799> the

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
there is a noticeable drop as far as the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.679 
there is a noticeable drop as far as the
the<00:02:27.519> battery<00:02:28.859> battery<00:02:29.859> use<00:02:30.129> so<00:02:30.909> overall

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
the battery battery use so overall

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.259 
the battery battery use so overall
