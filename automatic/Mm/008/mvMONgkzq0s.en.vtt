00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.600
 over the years they have found 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.519
 these structures for all the length and 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.410
 width of the planet 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.140
 in some occasions they are 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.890
 hidden due 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.890
 you 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.720
 and in other occasions they are 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.130
 simple view like this that I'm going to 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.570
 to show 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.830
 in 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.630
 creative 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.160
 is what our pyramid has 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.710
 if I grabbed it 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.309
 here it can be seen at a glance 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.309
 it is a structure 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.680
 it is not what it seems to be 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.680
 12 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.800
 we can download 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.850
 it is not completely accessible to 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.850
 everyone 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.400
 said 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.010
 and if not 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.890
 Ticos crisis 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.690
 but I'm going to teach you 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.909
 but it's not the land it's Tuesday 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.830
 all are 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.740
 very similar structure 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.610
 the water and that there are trees a structure 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.610
 very similar 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.720
 d 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.980
 is similar to the path of the part of 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.980
 up a round structure 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
 contains 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.660
 it's a hobby 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.660
 this is not done by nature not 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.660
 it's done but 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.710
 yes 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.520
 like 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.520
 two
