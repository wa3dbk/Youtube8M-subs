00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.440
 You can go to the USA and fly a 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.310
 f-18 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.810

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.640
 you can excuse me now I'm going to 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.530
 explain a little bit of what you click on 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.020
 the red block without releasing it and avoid 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.770
 blue blocks and black edges let's go 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.710
 to try another try 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.540
 so so 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.349
 with care there we are 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.510
 and then as time goes by the 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:29.609
 game is getting harder uy almost 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.040
 14 seconds good is not wrong the first 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:36.180
 It's hard to catch him when I tried it 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.980
 the first time when the game was tested 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.930
 the game does not last anything 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.840
 right now, as you can see 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.489
 check the lasted 14 seconds is not 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.180
 nothing bad 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:52.000
 as you go, taking the trick 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.519
 hold for at least 2 minutes and that and 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.519
 you go to the air force of the you can 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:01.620
 follow the two together and say I've 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:04.200
 done the 2018 test that the pilot 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.180
 and with what put port useful and I think that 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.360
 it should be a very good idea to put 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.209
 this as a car psychotherapist and for 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.030
 motorcycle to do this is psychotechnical the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.830
 psychotherapeutic would be pretty good 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.860
 assigns guys I hope you liked it 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.520

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.340

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.630
 with work asks response to this
