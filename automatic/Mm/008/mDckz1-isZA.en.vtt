like<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> stick<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.320> use<00:00:47.040> those<00:00:47.250> because

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
like to stick to and use those because

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.460 
like to stick to and use those because
they're<00:00:47.730> comfortable<00:00:48.150> well<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.230> take

they're comfortable well you can take
those<00:00:49.710> drum<00:00:50.010> fills<00:00:50.310> and<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.910> change<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
those drum fills and just change the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.840 
those drum fills and just change the
drums<00:00:51.870> around<00:00:52.079> keep<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.890> same<00:00:53.130> pattern<00:00:53.670> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
drums around keep that same pattern and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
drums around keep that same pattern and
create<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.810> rather<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.710> know<00:00:55.829> different

and flam take a look at the drum fill
variations<00:01:23.999> number<00:01:24.389> one<00:01:24.569> takes<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.619> right

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
variations number one takes the right

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.219 
variations number one takes the right
stick<00:01:26.219> and<00:01:26.429> moves<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.969> the<00:01:27.179> low<00:01:27.389> Tom<00:01:27.659> when

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
stick and moves it to the low Tom when

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.789 
stick and moves it to the low Tom when
you're<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.499> flamming<00:01:28.979> check<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:33.799> it

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
you're not flamming check this out it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.679 
you're not flamming check this out it
can<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.039> good<00:01:35.219> to<00:01:35.280> practice<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.060> variations

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
can be good to practice these variations

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.940 
can be good to practice these variations
along<00:01:36.810> with<00:01:37.139> the<00:01:37.229> beat<00:01:37.469> so<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.829> can

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
along with the beat so that you can

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:50.300 
along with the beat so that you can
become<00:01:38.189> comfortable<00:01:38.639> with<00:01:38.700> them

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.490 

number<00:01:51.310> two<00:01:51.460> moves<00:01:51.760> that<00:01:51.880> flam<00:01:52.390> right<00:01:53.170> stick

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
number two moves that flam right stick

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.730 
number two moves that flam right stick
to<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.160> crash<00:01:54.490> cymbal<00:01:54.910> I<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:56.170> written<00:01:56.410> here

to a crash cymbal I have written here

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.040 
to a crash cymbal I have written here
the<00:01:56.890> notation<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.460> high<00:01:57.880> crash<00:01:58.180> than<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.780> low

the notation a high crash than a low
crash<00:01:59.320> you<00:01:59.530> can<00:01:59.680> use<00:01:59.800> the<00:01:59.950> same<00:02:00.160> crash<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.700> can

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
crash you can use the same crash you can

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.800 
crash you can use the same crash you can
change<00:02:01.060> up<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.240> pattern<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.750> whatever<00:02:06.810> number

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
change up the pattern to whatever number

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.960 
change up the pattern to whatever number
three<00:02:08.020> adds<00:02:08.229> in<00:02:08.470> another<00:02:08.770> crash<00:02:09.130> now<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.729> want

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
three adds in another crash now I want

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.280 
three adds in another crash now I want
you<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.149> think<00:02:10.300> about<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.630> previous<00:02:10.869> pattern

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
you to think about the previous pattern

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.860 
you to think about the previous pattern
after<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:12.280> crash<00:02:12.550> cymbal<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.150> had<00:02:13.330> two<00:02:13.600> low

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
after the crash cymbal you had two low

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.620 
after the crash cymbal you had two low

number four is kind of fun because it
has<00:02:53.390> this<00:02:53.540> ostinato<00:02:54.200> feel<00:02:54.560> around<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.099> time<00:02:55.310> I

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
has this ostinato feel around the time I

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.140 
has this ostinato feel around the time I
play<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.790> for<00:02:56.030> you<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:01.220> number<00:03:01.550> five<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.790> fun

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.030 
play that for you and number five is fun
too<00:03:02.390> because<00:03:02.569> it<00:03:02.930> switches<00:03:03.260> between<00:03:03.560> three

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
too because it switches between three

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.089 
too because it switches between three
symbols<00:03:04.310> if<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.120> don't<00:03:05.300> have<00:03:05.450> three<00:03:05.750> crashes

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
symbols if you don't have three crashes

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.589 
symbols if you don't have three crashes
you<00:03:07.099> can<00:03:07.220> use<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.519> high<00:03:07.700> hat<00:03:07.970> as<00:03:08.150> one<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.450> them

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
even if you only have two you can go

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.190 
even if you only have two you can go
back<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.519> forth<00:03:10.670> between<00:03:10.879> those<00:03:11.269> two<00:03:11.330> this

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
back and forth between those two this

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:30.940 
back and forth between those two this
just<00:03:12.530> goes<00:03:17.349> for<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.500> with<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.709> beat<00:03:29.950> and
