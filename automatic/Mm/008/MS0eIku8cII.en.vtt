00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.829
 they say that expresses personality and 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.990
 creativity the heavily populated beard returns 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:12.909
 to be fashionable it looks different 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.279
 forms and expressions or who thinks 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:17.279
 that the more dense the more modern 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.410
 well, you can hear it, the beards 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.780
 they have become fashionable they also require 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.890
 those and a lot of care so that 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.840
 it is precisely what has made 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.670
 come back a habit that you had we had 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.260
 abandoned we have gone to another 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.260
 time to the barbershop 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.210
 it is enough to go out to the street to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.210
 check that if they are trend 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.900
 my friends most of us take value in 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.150
 mostly young people and that in some 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.440
 another house is cause for discord I think 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.880
 that if he has the army he has to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.880
 yes clear blade 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.110
 Well, to be fashionable is not any 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.570
 beauty secret tell you that they require 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.079
 true care not only to leave them 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.180
 grow 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.410
 natural care such as hair 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.640
 who carries in his head the only thing 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.659
 you need is a little more than 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.789
 hydration some oil some wax 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.979
 so numerous products have returned to 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:17.509
 relaunch to pamper the 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.280
 and professionals give rein to their 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.469
 imagination to get them the biggest 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.530
 match and get that from the beard 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.630
 perfect for that we have returned 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.420
 also to the barber shop it has been noticed 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.740
 considerably in our last one a 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.899
 year I would say 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.240
 we even learn what is visagism 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.550
 that is, adapt the beard to the shape of 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.620
 the face to stylize the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.840
 with some amazement, look at the phenomenon 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.970
 angel now retired is his son who 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.160
 is in front of the hairdresser I did not think 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.370
 that I would return to another of the people to the 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.560
 hairdresser shaving was 50 years in 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.750
 the profession when it started came every 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.460
 two or three days to shave there was no 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.280
 tools to do it at home the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.620
 Sevillian did not cut short hormonal 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.910
 It cost then about two pesetas 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.130
 shaved off 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.490
 but that was when the hair was not 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.490
 beautiful
