hi<00:00:05.069> I'm<00:00:05.370> Alex<00:00:05.640> Alvarez<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.180> welcome<00:00:06.690> to

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
hi I'm Alex Alvarez and welcome to

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.650 
hi I'm Alex Alvarez and welcome to
volume<00:00:07.440> 2<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.680> creating<00:00:08.519> terrains<00:00:09.330> using

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
volume 2 of creating terrains using

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.030 
volume 2 of creating terrains using
satellite<00:00:10.050> data<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.530> Maya

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
satellite data in Maya

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.249 
satellite data in Maya
so<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.210> DVD<00:00:12.420> what<00:00:12.630> we're<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:13.049> is

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
so in this DVD what we're going to do is

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.440 
so in this DVD what we're going to do is
I'm<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.429> show<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.610> techniques<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.330> how

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
I'm going to show you techniques of how

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.210 
I'm going to show you techniques of how
to<00:00:15.480> up<00:00:15.839> res<00:00:16.139> your<00:00:16.350> terrain<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.070> this

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
to up res your terrain and so this

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.620 
to up res your terrain and so this
requires<00:00:17.400> upraised<00:00:18.060> oppressing<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
requires upraised oppressing the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.540 
requires upraised oppressing the
geometry<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.350> we're<00:00:19.470> going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.619> use<00:00:19.890> my<00:00:20.490> in

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
geometry and we're going to use my in

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.670 
geometry and we're going to use my in
conjunction<00:00:20.910> with<00:00:21.060> ZBrush<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.500> that

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
conjunction with ZBrush for that so that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.470 
conjunction with ZBrush for that so that
we<00:00:22.769> could<00:00:22.920> isolate<00:00:23.070> terrain<00:00:23.699> elements<00:00:24.210> create

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
we could isolate terrain elements create

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.929 
we could isolate terrain elements create
new<00:00:24.630> geometry<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:25.320> those<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.490> then<00:00:26.640> sculpt

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
new geometry for those and then sculpt

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.880 
new geometry for those and then sculpt
them<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.390> ZBrush<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.289> out<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.470> ZBrush

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
them in ZBrush get that out of ZBrush

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.389 
them in ZBrush get that out of ZBrush
using<00:00:29.390> normal<00:00:30.390> maps<00:00:30.570> HD<00:00:31.019> geometry<00:00:31.619> decimation

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
using normal maps HD geometry decimation

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.270 
using normal maps HD geometry decimation
master<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:34.020> once<00:00:34.260> we're<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.530> Maya<00:00:34.739> we're

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
master and then once we're in Maya we're

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.470 
master and then once we're in Maya we're
also<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> need<00:00:35.820> high<00:00:35.969> resolution

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
also going to need high resolution

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.479 
also going to need high resolution
textures<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.469> I'll<00:00:37.710> show<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.920> how<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.219> use

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
textures so I'll show you how to use

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
textures so I'll show you how to use

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.080 
very high res texture Maps 8k 16 K how
to<00:00:48.059> clean<00:00:48.570> those<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.989> using<00:00:49.230> Mari<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.820> in

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
to clean those up using Mari and then in

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.420 
to clean those up using Mari and then in
Maya<00:00:51.300> aside<00:00:51.840> from<00:00:52.079> creating<00:00:52.559> our<00:00:52.829> new<00:00:52.860> up-res

train<00:00:53.820> we'll<00:00:54.420> also<00:00:54.570> talk<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> little<00:00:55.110> bit<00:00:55.260> about

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
train we'll also talk a little bit about

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.860 
train we'll also talk a little bit about
atmospheric<00:00:56.699> effects<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.360> how<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> render

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
atmospheric effects and how to render

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.319 
atmospheric effects and how to render
things<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.559> passes<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> get<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.000> all<00:01:00.120> come

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
things out in passes and get it all come

00:01:00.329 --> 00:03:02.200 
things out in passes and get it all come
together<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> final<00:01:01.140> image<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.620> Photoshop
