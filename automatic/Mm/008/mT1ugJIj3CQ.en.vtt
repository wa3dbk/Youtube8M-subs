00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
feels feels like an aluminum cool to the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.550 
feels feels like an aluminum cool to the
touch<00:03:45.350> right<00:03:45.590> now<00:03:46.690> as<00:03:47.690> we<00:03:47.870> come<00:03:48.019> over<00:03:48.050> here<00:03:48.230> you

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
touch right now as we come over here you

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.120 
touch right now as we come over here you
can<00:03:48.709> see<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:49.730> we<00:03:49.880> have<00:03:50.230> three<00:03:51.230> distinct

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
can see that we have three distinct

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.569 
can see that we have three distinct
angles<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:53.150> flat<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:54.110> we<00:03:54.200> can<00:03:54.320> use<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:55.250> here

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
angles and flat that we can use so here

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.100 
angles and flat that we can use so here
is<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:56.209> uppermost<00:03:56.900> angle<00:03:58.630> recline<00:03:59.630> it<00:03:59.870> just<00:04:00.049> a

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
is the uppermost angle recline it just a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.289 
is the uppermost angle recline it just a
little<00:04:00.380> bit<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:01.720> then<00:04:03.400> maybe<00:04:04.400> we<00:04:04.730> prefer<00:04:05.269> a

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
little bit and then maybe we prefer a

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.940 
little bit and then maybe we prefer a
different<00:04:05.780> angle<00:04:06.049> feel<00:04:06.560> like<00:04:06.680> you're<00:04:06.799> at<00:04:06.860> the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
different angle feel like you're at the

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.460 
different angle feel like you're at the
eye<00:04:06.980> doctor<00:04:07.400> here<00:04:07.610> and<00:04:08.510> we<00:04:08.690> can<00:04:08.810> go<00:04:08.930> flat<00:04:09.230> if

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
eye doctor here and we can go flat if

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.850 
eye doctor here and we can go flat if
that's<00:04:09.650> what<00:04:09.829> we<00:04:09.920> prefer<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:11.170> really<00:04:12.170> like<00:04:12.380> it

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
that's what we prefer I really like it

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.470 
that's what we prefer I really like it
at<00:04:13.010> this<00:04:13.250> angle<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.820> I'll<00:04:14.090> show<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.269> why<00:04:14.450> here

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
at this angle and I'll show you why here

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.699 
at this angle and I'll show you why here
in<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:14.780> minute<00:04:14.870> when<00:04:15.049> we<00:04:15.079> put<00:04:15.260> some<00:04:15.410> notebooks

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
in a minute when we put some notebooks

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.969 
in a minute when we put some notebooks
on<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.269> back<00:04:17.269> here<00:04:17.600> is<00:04:17.720> where<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:18.290> port

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
on it back here is where the port

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.610 
on it back here is where the port
replicator<00:04:19.430> sits<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:21.790> right<00:04:22.790> in<00:04:22.910> here<00:04:23.240> is<00:04:23.620> the

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
replicator sits and right in here is the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.990 
replicator sits and right in here is the
connector<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.490> will<00:04:26.300> power<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.530> speaker's

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
connector that will power the speaker's

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.370 
connector that will power the speaker's
so<00:04:29.000> we'll<00:04:29.120> snap<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.600> in<00:04:29.750> our<00:04:29.900> speakers<00:04:30.260> are

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
so we'll snap that in our speakers are

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.370 
so we'll snap that in our speakers are
located<00:04:30.860> in<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.040> base<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.490> unit<00:04:31.610> here<00:04:32.380> and

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.429 
kind of angle for use for long term
periods<00:05:18.229> and<00:05:19.240> then<00:05:20.240> if<00:05:20.719> we're<00:05:21.020> using<00:05:21.199> this

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:21.439 
periods and then if we're using this

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:22.719 
periods and then if we're using this
what<00:05:21.740> we're<00:05:21.860> going<00:05:21.979> to<00:05:22.009> end<00:05:22.129> up<00:05:22.280> doing<00:05:22.430> is

we'll hook a USB cable from over here
back<00:05:27.860> here<00:05:28.189> and<00:05:28.400> this<00:05:28.699> is<00:05:28.819> where<00:05:29.000> we'll

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
back here and this is where we'll

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.339 
back here and this is where we'll
connect<00:05:30.620> everything<00:05:30.889> else<00:05:31.870> so<00:05:32.870> we'll<00:05:33.110> hook<00:05:33.199> a

idea pad from Lenovo it's a 14 inch so

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.629 
idea pad from Lenovo it's a 14 inch so
we<00:06:35.569> have<00:06:35.690> a<00:06:35.719> little<00:06:35.930> bit<00:06:36.110> of<00:06:36.199> extra<00:06:36.440> room<00:06:36.770> along

we have a little bit of extra room along

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.040 
we have a little bit of extra room along
the<00:06:37.789> sides<00:06:38.060> here<00:06:38.680> but<00:06:39.680> we<00:06:39.800> still<00:06:39.830> have<00:06:41.050> that

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
the sides here but we still have that

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.300 
the sides here but we still have that
nice<00:06:42.500> angle<00:06:43.900> and<00:06:44.900> what<00:06:45.379> is<00:06:45.500> nice<00:06:45.680> is<00:06:45.740> if<00:06:46.190> you

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
nice angle and what is nice is if you

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.820 
nice angle and what is nice is if you
prefer<00:06:46.699> it<00:06:47.479> to<00:06:47.539> be<00:06:47.690> lower

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.149 

you<00:06:51.830> can<00:06:51.979> still<00:06:52.250> lower<00:06:53.240> it<00:06:53.479> and<00:06:53.919> get<00:06:54.919> a<00:06:54.949> nice

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:55.159 
you can still lower it and get a nice

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:56.709 
you can still lower it and get a nice
angle<00:06:55.430> whether<00:06:55.699> you're<00:06:55.849> gonna<00:06:55.969> be<00:06:56.029> typing<00:06:56.569> on

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:56.719 
angle whether you're gonna be typing on

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:57.159 
angle whether you're gonna be typing on
here

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
here

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.010 
here
or<00:06:57.680> just<00:06:58.250> using<00:06:59.150> your<00:06:59.360> external<00:06:59.719> mouse<00:06:59.810> and

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
or just using your external mouse and

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.939 
or just using your external mouse and
keyboard<00:07:00.110> and<00:07:00.319> you'd<00:07:00.469> rather<00:07:00.589> have<00:07:00.800> the

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:00.949 
keyboard and you'd rather have the

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.649 
keyboard and you'd rather have the
screen<00:07:01.159> a<00:07:01.190> little<00:07:01.339> bit<00:07:01.430> lower<00:07:01.669> so<00:07:01.909> that's<00:07:02.539> with

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:02.659 
screen a little bit lower so that's with

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:07.610 
screen a little bit lower so that's with
a<00:07:02.690> 14<00:07:03.169> inch<00:07:03.379> notebook<00:07:05.050> now

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
a 14 inch notebook now

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.409 
a 14 inch notebook now
where<00:07:08.620> these<00:07:08.800> docking<00:07:09.610> stations<00:07:10.030> tend<00:07:10.300> to

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:10.419 
where these docking stations tend to

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:12.869 
where these docking stations tend to
shine<00:07:10.659> from<00:07:10.870> time<00:07:11.080> to<00:07:11.199> time<00:07:11.229> is<00:07:11.770> if<00:07:12.490> we<00:07:12.610> put<00:07:12.639> our

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879 
shine from time to time is if we put our

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:15.029 
shine from time to time is if we put our
netbook<00:07:13.240> on<00:07:13.389> here<00:07:13.659> so<00:07:13.960> netbooks<00:07:14.500> usually<00:07:14.860> have

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 
netbook on here so netbooks usually have

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:17.459 
netbook on here so netbooks usually have
not<00:07:15.550> as<00:07:15.669> many<00:07:15.849> ports<00:07:16.180> which<00:07:16.900> makes<00:07:17.110> a<00:07:17.229> port

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:17.469 
not as many ports which makes a port

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:22.950 
not as many ports which makes a port
replicator<00:07:17.560> really<00:07:18.129> great<00:07:20.009> but<00:07:21.810> what's<00:07:22.810> nice

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
replicator really great but what's nice

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.990 
replicator really great but what's nice
is<00:07:23.759> now<00:07:24.759> we've<00:07:25.030> popped<00:07:25.509> up<00:07:25.719> our<00:07:26.310> HP<00:07:27.310> Mini<00:07:27.490> 210

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
is now we've popped up our HP Mini 210

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.869 
is now we've popped up our HP Mini 210
and<00:07:29.939> the<00:07:30.939> screen<00:07:31.240> doesn't<00:07:31.419> go<00:07:31.599> back<00:07:31.840> to<00:07:32.409> nearly

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 
and the screen doesn't go back to nearly

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:36.330
