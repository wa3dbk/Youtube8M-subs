00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.680
 peeling or exfoliation 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.600
 descaler is a step 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 important in the field of 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.250
 the skin our epidermis is in some 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.529
 so our protective shell and he 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.910
 consists of dermal cells that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.449
 leave every day in the form of 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.130
 film 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.140
 in fact every day news 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.670
 cells form and that of the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.640
 top layer simply falls 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.740
 this process is called generations 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.539
 and so all these old cells 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.250
 no longer have any function to fill 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.989
 they would fall anyway from her 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.450
 even after a few days to true 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.160
 to say they have a place of proliferation 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 ideal for all kinds of bacteria 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.180
 do you imagine the next thing if we 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 look at your skin with a magnifying glass 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.079
 it would look a little like this pile of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.870
 leaves scattered without top 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.540
 it is here below that the bacteria 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.969
 can settle down and so the skin has 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.700
 more a beautiful appearance by doing a 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.700
 peeling is like piling up one's 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.660
 leaves suitably one on the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.059
 other 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.670
 skin and rosÃ©s and bacteria have 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.790
 no chance of nesting at 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.020
 whatever and that's exactly this 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.270
 step that we can perfectly 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.460
 performed with laloÃ« scrub of forever 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.500
 article number 2 138 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.540
 there are tiny balls of 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.369
 jojoba that eliminates intensively but 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.260
 gently the dead cells of 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.770
 skin preventing impurities from 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.170
 settle 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.439
 traffic is improved and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.119
 the elasticity of the skin preserve the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.430
 skin immediately takes this beautiful 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.920
 pink color she is refreshed and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.810
 embellished and the forever scrub is not 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.080
 only ideal for the face but 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.759
 also for the whole body this is it 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.040
 ralph and beyond all these benefits 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.110
 we get with this scrubbing care 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.150
 an ideal preparation of the skin for 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.369
 future care we advise 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.229
 for example especially before 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.439
 the application of the marine mask 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.390
 forever article reference 234 or else 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.649
 again before the bio forever facelift 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.939
 article reference 45 and 50 of 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.979
 the application is very simple and does not 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.409
 requires that little time for the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.669
 face take about this amount 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.409
 it will suffice to spread it massaging 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.140
 slightly like a cream on the skin 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.100
 wash 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.130
 wet retained his well we will apply 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.050
 always a peel on a wet skin 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.090
 massaged about one to two minutes 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.890
 if the poor becomes too fast a little 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.680
 wet again again slightly 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.220
 hands finally rinse thoroughly with water 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.810
 hot and if you have only few 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.030
 time in front of you then you can 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.500
 combine the cleaning and 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.050
 to uncluster agents simply putting 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.560
 your hand your cleaning product 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.330
 forever 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.020
 I show you here 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.680
 with the low and sow I already had to scrub at 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.500
 hollow of the hand 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.269
 I add a little mixing soup the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.920
 two in the palm of the hand and 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.410
 I apply everything while passing under the 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.570
 face so you get a perfect 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.670
 peeling cleanser but this will be more 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.769
 intensive if you perform these two 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.989
 steps separately by cons for a 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.670
 body peeling so it's great to 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.070
 mix the two products you take 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.590
 a soap that does not completely fill 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.600
 you add a complete tube of scrubs 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.150
 as well as a little first article 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.340
 reference 40 so that's a little 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.860
 more liquid and then shaken everything for 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.239
 get a perfect pinning cleanse me 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.780
 I use it like that every day 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.850
 in the shower for the face board 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.980
 an app from the expo linking scrubs 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.170

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.470
 with the deep clean gignac spoilers 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.590
 article number 278 of the skins series 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.820
 so you see like this phase 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.880

 deep clean 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.040
 aloe vera and the vitamins it 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.440
 contains prevents the skin from drying out 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.630
 during the application of this care of 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.610
 tiny jojoba beads eliminates in 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.620
 softness the dry cells of the skin there 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.079
