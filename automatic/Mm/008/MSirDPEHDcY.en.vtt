to do it in it was pretty ambitious for

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.620 
to do it in it was pretty ambitious for
us<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.900> take<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.799> task<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:34.189> the

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
us to take on that task but it was the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
us to take on that task but it was the
support<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> team<00:01:38.010> along<00:01:38.580> with

support of all the team along with

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.719 
support of all the team along with
actually<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.689> fact<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> producers

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
actually the fact that the producers

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.609 
actually the fact that the producers
asked<00:01:41.729> me<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> original<00:01:42.540> when<00:01:43.530> they

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
asked me and the original when they

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.410 
asked me and the original when they
originally<00:01:43.920> talked<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> me<00:01:44.549> how<00:01:45.030> long<00:01:45.270> they

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
originally talked to me how long they

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.210 
originally talked to me how long they
think<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> would<00:01:45.930> take<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.470> put<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> show

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
think it would take to put the show

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.940 
think it would take to put the show
together<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:48.020> they<00:01:49.020> made<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.380> possible<00:01:49.560> by

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
together and they made it possible by

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.550 
together and they made it possible by
actually<00:01:50.369> closing<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> show<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.560> making

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
actually closing the show and making

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.679 
actually closing the show and making
sure<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.340> had<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> time<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.210> actually

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
sure that we had the time to actually

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.690 
sure that we had the time to actually
work<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.200> show<00:01:55.380> had<00:01:55.830> we<00:01:56.009> been<00:01:56.880> given<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
work on the show had we been given the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.880 
do you use flying by Foy to fly Spidey
or<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> system<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.270> ZF

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
or a system like ZF

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.190 
or a system like ZF
actually<00:02:13.890> we<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:15.150> very<00:02:15.690> unique<00:02:15.959> system

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
actually we have a very unique system

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.410 
actually we have a very unique system
that<00:02:16.500> was<00:02:16.560> developed<00:02:16.739> by<00:02:17.040> Fisher<00:02:17.370> tech<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:18.209> was

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
that was developed by Fisher tech it was

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.899 
that was developed by Fisher tech it was
developed<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:19.409> spider-man<00:02:20.340> turn<00:02:20.640> off<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
developed for spider-man turn off the

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.649 
developed for spider-man turn off the
dark<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.330> will<00:02:21.900> not<00:02:22.230> see<00:02:22.769> flying<00:02:23.489> like<00:02:24.150> this

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
dark you will not see flying like this

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.320 
dark you will not see flying like this
anywhere<00:02:25.349> else<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:26.730> Broadway<00:02:27.120> community

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
anywhere else in the Broadway community

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.910 
anywhere else in the Broadway community
because<00:02:27.900> basically<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.280> flying<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.959> stunt

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
because basically the flying is is stunt

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.069 
because basically the flying is is stunt
flying<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.579> what<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.120> would<00:02:33.299> use<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.750> film

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
flying it's what we would use in film

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.500 
flying it's what we would use in film
work<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.579> only<00:02:35.760> place<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.239> probably

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
work and so the only place you probably

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.580 
work and so the only place you probably
would<00:02:36.690> see<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.049> would<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.769> film<00:02:38.430> set<00:02:38.489> so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
would see that would be on a film set so

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.970 
would see that would be on a film set so
that's<00:02:40.590> very<00:02:40.709> unique<00:02:41.129> to<00:02:41.579> our<00:02:41.610> show
