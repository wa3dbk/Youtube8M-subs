started<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:22.060> going<00:00:22.240> to<00:00:22.300> start<00:00:22.539> doing<00:00:22.660> a<00:00:22.840> chain

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
using red and broidery floss so it's a

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.960 
using red and broidery floss so it's a
little<00:00:28.000> easier<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.449> see<00:00:28.779> it<00:00:28.929> I've<00:00:29.109> drawn<00:00:29.920> here

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
little easier to see it I've drawn here

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.689

just<00:00:35.140> so<00:00:35.290> I<00:00:35.320> have<00:00:35.830> a<00:00:36.220> reference<00:00:36.820> if<00:00:37.660> I<00:00:37.809> want<00:00:38.050> to

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
just so I have a reference if I want to

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.400 
just so I have a reference if I want to
do<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.860> straight<00:00:39.370> line<00:00:39.670> since<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.629> chain<00:00:41.020> stitch

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
do a straight line since a chain stitch

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.369 
do a straight line since a chain stitch
is<00:00:41.770> a<00:00:41.829> decorative<00:00:42.460> stitch<00:00:42.879> it's<00:00:43.809> a<00:00:43.989> good<00:00:44.200> idea

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
is a decorative stitch it's a good idea

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.310 
is a decorative stitch it's a good idea
to<00:00:45.070> draw<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.550> design<00:00:45.850> in<00:00:46.390> which<00:00:46.870> you're<00:00:47.050> going

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
to draw the design in which you're going

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.619 
to draw the design in which you're going
to<00:00:47.559> do<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.100> chain<00:00:48.340> stitch<00:00:48.640> instead<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.480> just

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
to do the chain stitch instead of just

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.270 
to do the chain stitch instead of just
trying<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:50.020> eyeball<00:00:50.170> it<00:00:50.590> so<00:00:50.739> that<00:00:50.920> way<00:00:51.039> to<00:00:51.100> be

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
trying to eyeball it so that way to be

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.360 
trying to eyeball it so that way to be
more<00:00:51.460> accurate<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.440> in<00:00:53.590> order<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.829> start<00:00:54.160> this

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
more accurate so in order to start this

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.170 
more accurate so in order to start this
what<00:00:54.579> I'm<00:00:54.670> first<00:00:54.910> going<00:00:55.059> to<00:00:55.149> do<00:00:55.390> is<00:00:56.789> I'm<00:00:57.789> going

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
the same stitch where the thread just

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.339 
the same stitch where the thread just
came<00:01:14.890> out<00:01:15.099> and<00:01:15.369> I'm<00:01:16.209> just<00:01:16.599> going<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.869> go<00:01:17.080> up

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I'm gonna bring this thread around

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.660 
I'm gonna bring this thread around
because<00:01:26.830> I'm<00:01:27.069> not<00:01:27.190> going<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.369> pull<00:01:27.520> all<00:01:27.610> the

to come up right in the middle of this

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.830 
to come up right in the middle of this
loop<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:33.880> my<00:01:34.840> thread<00:01:35.080> creates<00:01:36.660> I'm<00:01:37.660> just

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
loop that my thread creates I'm just

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
loop that my thread creates I'm just
going<00:01:37.959> to<00:01:37.989> pull<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.410> don't<00:01:38.530> want<00:01:38.649> to<00:01:38.709> pull

going to pull it you don't want to pull
it<00:01:38.890> too<00:01:39.160> tight<00:01:39.190> but<00:01:40.000> you'll<00:01:40.239> see<00:01:41.069> that<00:01:42.069> there

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
it too tight but you'll see that there

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.050 
it too tight but you'll see that there
is<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:43.179> loop<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.349> is<00:01:44.470> created<00:01:45.039> so<00:01:45.819> now<00:01:45.970> to

middle<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.489> this<00:02:09.670> thread<00:02:10.060> loop<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.569> is

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
middle of this thread loop that is

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.230 
middle of this thread loop that is
created<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.930> forms<00:02:14.320> another<00:02:15.240> circle

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
created and it forms another circle

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.810 
created and it forms another circle
another<00:02:16.660> loop<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:18.070> I'm<00:02:18.220> just<00:02:18.370> going<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.580> do<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
another loop so I'm just going to do the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.700 
another loop so I'm just going to do the
same<00:02:19.060> thing<00:02:19.420> I'm<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.290> going<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.560> go<00:02:20.680> back

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
same thing I'm just going to go back

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.590 
same thing I'm just going to go back
down<00:02:22.050> right<00:02:23.050> where<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.790> 1/3<00:02:24.790> thread<00:02:25.150> came<00:02:25.390> up

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
down right where that 1/3 thread came up

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.570 
down right where that 1/3 thread came up
and<00:02:25.930> go<00:02:26.230> up<00:02:27.870> about<00:02:28.870> an<00:02:29.020> eighth<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.350> an<00:02:29.440> inch<00:02:29.580> put

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
and go up about an eighth of an inch put

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.240 
and go up about an eighth of an inch put
my<00:02:30.990> thread<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.050> either<00:02:32.380> side<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.130> knee

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
my thread and either side of the knee

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.740 
my thread and either side of the knee
book<00:02:33.520> needle<00:02:33.880> because<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.360> creates<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
book needle because that creates the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.170 
book needle because that creates the
loop<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:37.080> bring<00:02:38.080> it<00:02:38.260> straight<00:02:38.530> through

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
loop and then bring it straight through

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.640 
loop and then bring it straight through
and<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.270> don't<00:02:40.480> want<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.780> pull<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.350> stitch

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
and you don't want to pull this stitch

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.680 
and you don't want to pull this stitch
really<00:02:42.310> tight<00:02:42.580> because<00:02:42.820> if<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.150> do<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.450> too

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
really tight because if you do it too

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.520 
really tight because if you do it too
tight<00:02:44.040> you're<00:02:45.040> going<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.550> start<00:02:45.880> losing<00:02:46.530> these

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
tight you're going to start losing these

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.140 
tight you're going to start losing these
little<00:02:47.890> loops<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.890> let<00:02:51.010> me<00:02:51.100> do<00:02:51.190> another<00:02:51.220> one<00:02:51.640> so

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
little loops so let me do another one so

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.180 
little loops so let me do another one so
I'm<00:02:52.240> going<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.390> go<00:02:52.480> down<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.710> pull<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.130> a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
I'm going to go down and pull this a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.170 
I'm going to go down and pull this a
little<00:02:54.340> bit<00:02:56.640> where<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:57.820> thread<00:02:58.150> came<00:02:58.360> out

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
little bit where this thread came out

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.430 
little bit where this thread came out
I'm<00:03:01.180> going<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.450> go<00:03:01.570> up<00:03:03.240> through<00:03:04.240> at<00:03:04.600> eighth<00:03:05.170> of

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
I'm going to go up through at eighth of

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.700 
I'm going to go up through at eighth of
an<00:03:05.560> inch<00:03:05.650> away<00:03:05.860> from<00:03:06.010> my<00:03:06.490> last<00:03:06.700> loop<00:03:07.710> bring

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
an inch away from my last loop bring

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.170 
an inch away from my last loop bring
this<00:03:08.830> thread<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.950> either<00:03:12.460> side<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.030> needle

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
this thread on either side of the needle

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.010 
this thread on either side of the needle
and<00:03:14.100> then<00:03:15.100> pull<00:03:15.160> my<00:03:15.550> needle<00:03:15.760> through<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.860> loop

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
and then pull my needle through the loop

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.080 
and then pull my needle through the loop
and<00:03:20.460> there<00:03:21.460> you<00:03:21.640> have<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:22.180> chain<00:03:22.780> stitch
