then we're going to add our celery and
also<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> other<00:00:54.870> advantage<00:00:55.050> adding<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
also the other advantage adding the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.529 
also the other advantage adding the
ingredients<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> time<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.329> if

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
ingredients one of the time is that if

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.060 
ingredients one of the time is that if
you<00:00:57.629> add<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> bunch<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.199> cold<00:00:58.410> ingredients<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you add a bunch of cold ingredients to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.130 
you add a bunch of cold ingredients to
hot<00:00:59.219> oil<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.820> once<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.629> take<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
hot oil all at once you take all the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.510 
hot oil all at once you take all the
heat<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> pan<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.129> you're<00:01:02.340> basically

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
heat out of the pan and you're basically

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280 
heat out of the pan and you're basically
like<00:01:02.730> starting<00:01:03.090> over<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.510> kind<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.140> just

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
like starting over and it kind of just

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.780 
like starting over and it kind of just
ruins<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> whole<00:01:04.739> effect<00:01:05.189> because<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
ruins the whole effect because if you

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.020 
ruins the whole effect because if you
were<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:07.340> basically<00:01:08.340> start<00:01:08.820> everything

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
were to just basically start everything

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.640 
were to just basically start everything
from<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.299> cold<00:01:09.510> pan<00:01:09.750> you're<00:01:10.260> not<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> get

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
from a cold pan you're not going to get

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.550 
from a cold pan you're not going to get
that<00:01:10.680> same<00:01:10.979> flavor<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:13.340> all<00:01:14.340> right

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.899 

you<00:01:17.130> also<00:01:17.280> want<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> make<00:01:17.579> sure<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
you also want to make sure with the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
you also want to make sure with the
olive<00:01:18.149> oil<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.509> you're<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:19.409> top<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
olive oil that you're on top of it

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.990 
olive oil that you're on top of it
because<00:01:20.159> olive<00:01:20.430> oil<00:01:20.549> has<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:20.909> low

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
because olive oil has a really low

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.630 
because olive oil has a really low
smoking<00:01:21.600> point<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.079> will<00:01:22.680> start<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.159> burn

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
smoking point and will start to burn

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:39.190 
smoking point and will start to burn
pretty<00:01:23.970> easily<00:01:24.210> which<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.020> don't<00:01:25.259> want

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.300 

and<00:01:40.200> while<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.679> I'm<00:01:41.039> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.219> go

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and while this is going I'm going to go

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.200 
and while this is going I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.579> put<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> little<00:01:41.819> salt<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.149> pepper

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
ahead and put a little salt and pepper

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.929 
ahead and put a little salt and pepper
in<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.810> believe<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.189> seasoning<00:01:44.609> as<00:01:44.729> you

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
in there I believe in seasoning as you

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.699 
in there I believe in seasoning as you
go<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.539> just<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:45.899> at<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.140> time<00:01:48.469> like<00:01:49.469> I<00:01:49.500> said

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
go not just all at one time like I said

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:50.809 
go not just all at one time like I said
you<00:01:49.770> can't<00:01:49.950> really<00:01:50.039> go<00:01:50.189> wrong<00:01:50.219> with<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.609> whole

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
you can't really go wrong with a whole

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.330 
you can't really go wrong with a whole
lot<00:01:50.969> of<00:01:50.999> pepper<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.689> my<00:01:51.719> opinion<00:01:52.340> especially

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
