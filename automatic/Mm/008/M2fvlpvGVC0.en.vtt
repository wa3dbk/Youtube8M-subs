00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.480
 this test of 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.480
 aims to show that there is a 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.889
 even when they are burned 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:14.509
 when you system evaluation of 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.509
 brightness in the environment this camera 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.919
 I have a mark 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.730
 that shows 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.519
 that she is a model camera 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.939
 that works properly 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.249
 to our product 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.900
 this other camera 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.830
 she does not have a mark 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.830
 and is a camera here is the same or similar to that first but not that 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.160
 it works said 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
 way to fit our product 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.120
 we will do the tests with both units showing this in practice 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.740
 doing a positive missile test 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 studies are being fined 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 and now I'm not 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.760
 this first model and the reference camera we will do the test with 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.150
 the light off 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.400
 with low 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400
 in the city menu 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.700
 this camera 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.300
 the color image 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.300
 with low intensity 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.840
 with greater intensity said 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 now let's try it another model 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 of shirt 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.240
 this camera shows pictures 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.659
 initial color 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.689
 the intensity of light the camera 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.889
 the color of the image changes to black and white 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.689
 so that 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.879
 increase the intensity of light 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.629
 the return image 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.609
 to be colored 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.169
 differently 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.179
 of the first model 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.179
 of canberra we received here in brazil 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.859
 with greater intensity 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.209
 What is this problem? 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.209
 how can we solve 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:44.759
 respond 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.529
 sending a solution 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:47.039
 for that
