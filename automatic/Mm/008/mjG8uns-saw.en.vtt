like to checked I thought it was pretty
good<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:07.140> what<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:08.520> where<00:02:08.879> we

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
good for what for what for where we

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.139 
good for what for what for where we
ain't<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.509> know

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
ain't you know

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.059 
ain't you know
it's<00:02:10.239> like<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.659> can't<00:02:10.929> do<00:02:11.110> but<00:02:11.319> so<00:02:11.560> much<00:02:11.799> from

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
it's like you can't do but so much from

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.890 
it's like you can't do but so much from
the<00:02:12.519> material<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.000> would<00:02:13.180> give<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:13.810> we

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
the material that would give it but we

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.170 
the material that would give it but we
finally<00:02:14.140> get<00:02:14.349> to<00:02:14.470> 10<00:02:14.680> tails<00:02:14.950> that's<00:02:15.310> good<00:02:15.579> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
finally get to 10 tails that's good the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.170 
finally get to 10 tails that's good the
next<00:02:17.079> chapter<00:02:17.349> we<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.829> go<00:02:17.980> how<00:02:18.849> these

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
next chapter we like to go how these

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
exactly how that works what happens now

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.770 
exactly how that works what happens now
if<00:03:03.189> you<00:03:03.549> look<00:03:03.670> at<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.849> ten<00:03:04.120> tails<00:03:04.329> their<00:03:04.569> hands

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
if you look at the ten tails their hands

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.960 
if you look at the ten tails their hands
to<00:03:04.959> shower<00:03:05.260> running<00:03:05.530> on<00:03:05.799> or<00:03:06.159> that's<00:03:06.730> what<00:03:06.879> I

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
to shower running on or that's what I

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.300 
to shower running on or that's what I
call<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.389> sage<00:03:07.720> eyes<00:03:08.019> with<00:03:08.290> them<00:03:08.409> but<00:03:09.189> it's

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
call it sage eyes with them but it's

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.300 
call it sage eyes with them but it's
only<00:03:09.430> one<00:03:09.730> but<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.870> deck<00:03:11.349> that<00:03:11.709> makes<00:03:11.950> sense

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
only one but the deck that makes sense

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.819 
only one but the deck that makes sense
the<00:03:12.489> reason<00:03:12.790> why<00:03:12.879> makes<00:03:13.180> sense<00:03:13.450> because<00:03:13.829> the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
the reason why makes sense because the

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.729 
the reason why makes sense because the
ten<00:03:15.069> tell<00:03:15.340> supposedly<00:03:16.060> made<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:17.109> hold<00:03:17.410> on

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
ten tell supposedly made that hold on

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.420 
ten tell supposedly made that hold on
for<00:03:18.040> world<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:19.019> remember<00:03:20.019> this<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.889> Liz<00:03:21.129> it

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
for world and remember this but Liz it

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.490 
for world and remember this but Liz it
is<00:03:21.609> an<00:03:21.760> IV<00:03:22.090> or<00:03:22.209> something<00:03:22.599> some<00:03:23.139> kind<00:03:23.349> of

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
is an IV or something some kind of

attack or something some kind of power

attack or something some kind of power
that<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.659> can<00:03:25.870> use<00:03:26.019> once<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.919> unlock<00:03:27.220> a

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
that you can use once you unlock a

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.240 
that you can use once you unlock a
certain<00:03:27.819> I<00:03:28.239> power<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.739> can<00:03:29.889> make<00:03:30.069> things

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
certain I power and you can make things

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.800 
certain I power and you can make things
just<00:03:30.609> you<00:03:30.940> can<00:03:31.060> bring<00:03:31.180> things<00:03:31.449> into<00:03:31.629> existence

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
just you can bring things into existence

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.589 
just you can bring things into existence
I<00:03:32.230> can't<00:03:32.409> remember<00:03:32.530> which<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.889> card<00:03:33.480> let<00:03:34.480> me

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
I can't remember which the card let me

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.599 
I can't remember which the card let me
know<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.870> comments<00:03:35.319> but<00:03:35.769> then<00:03:35.949> now<00:03:36.129> that<00:03:36.159> make

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
know the comments but then now that make

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.330 
know the comments but then now that make
sense<00:03:37.000> why<00:03:37.329> it<00:03:37.599> can<00:03:37.810> create<00:03:38.169> you<00:03:38.739> know<00:03:38.769> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
sense why it can create you know the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.909 
sense why it can create you know the
world<00:03:39.609> because<00:03:40.419> it<00:03:40.540> has<00:03:40.750> those<00:03:41.109> eyes<00:03:41.409> so<00:03:41.859> I

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
world because it has those eyes so I

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.640 
world because it has those eyes so I
guess<00:03:41.979> that's<00:03:42.340> where<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.840> shower<00:03:44.109> running<00:03:44.349> on

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
guess that's where the shower running on

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.000 
guess that's where the shower running on
is<00:03:44.979> like<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.989> progenitor<00:03:46.989> everything<00:03:47.829> I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
is like the progenitor everything I

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.099 
is like the progenitor everything I
don't<00:03:48.190> know<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.359> means<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.079> can

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
don't know but that means that it can

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.860 
don't know but that means that it can
create<00:03:50.500> things<00:03:50.889> so<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.280> makes<00:03:51.549> sense<00:03:51.909> now<00:03:52.239> it

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
create things so that makes sense now it

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.789 
create things so that makes sense now it
looks<00:03:53.019> strange<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.829> looks<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.989> like<00:03:55.989> it

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
looks strange it looks like like it
