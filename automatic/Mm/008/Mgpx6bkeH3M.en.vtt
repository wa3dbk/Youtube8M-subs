00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
your finger to guide the Swiffer pad

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:23.690 
your finger to guide the Swiffer pad
thing<00:03:16.070> into<00:03:17.070> those<00:03:17.280> little<00:03:17.520> tight<00:03:18.060> places<00:03:22.700> or

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
thing into those little tight places or

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.340 
thing into those little tight places or
maybe<00:03:23.940> if<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.300> have<00:03:24.450> something<00:03:24.870> better<00:03:25.050> than

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
maybe if you have something better than

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.750 
maybe if you have something better than
a<00:03:25.530> Swiffer<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.280> can<00:03:26.430> use<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:28.370> those<00:03:29.370> places

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
a Swiffer you can use that those places

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:42.110 
a Swiffer you can use that those places
so<00:03:37.700> overall<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.880> looks<00:03:38.910> pretty<00:03:39.360> good<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:41.120> now

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
so overall it looks pretty good and now

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.490 
so overall it looks pretty good and now
we<00:03:42.180> can<00:03:42.570> go<00:03:42.750> on<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.200> next<00:03:43.710> step
