put the actual giant one next to it and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.099 
put the actual giant one next to it and
let's<00:00:22.529> find<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.570> giant<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.080> a

back<00:02:29.930> house<00:02:30.080> fine<00:02:30.319> I<00:02:31.540> think<00:02:32.540> you're<00:02:32.840> on<00:02:32.959> both

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
back house fine I think you're on both

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:46.880 
back house fine I think you're on both
side<00:02:33.349> so<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:33.800> not<00:02:33.860> really<00:02:34.129> an<00:02:34.190> issue

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.630 

but<00:02:47.430> then<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> little<00:02:47.880> muscle<00:02:48.150> back<00:02:48.420> oh<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:53.520> this

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
but then a little muscle back oh so this

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.510 
but then a little muscle back oh so this
is<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.819> convert<00:02:54.240> that's<00:02:54.810> been<00:02:54.959> done<00:02:55.170> from<00:02:55.520> right

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
is a convert that's been done from right

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.309 
is a convert that's been done from right
the<00:02:56.670> way<00:02:56.760> back<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.120> hopefully<00:02:57.720> FS<00:02:58.050> the

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
the way back to hopefully FS the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.230 
the way back to hopefully FS the
original<00:02:58.680> F<00:02:58.770> really<00:02:59.220> have<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.430> stone<00:02:59.610> 9<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.060> don't

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
original F really have a stone 9 I don't

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.449 
original F really have a stone 9 I don't
know<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:01.110> said<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:01.709> judging<00:03:02.040> by<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.220> way

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
know I just said so judging by the way

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.520 
know I just said so judging by the way
it<00:03:02.550> looks<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.390> think<00:03:03.660> no<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.140> know<00:03:04.230> potting

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
it looks and I think no you know potting

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.260 
it looks and I think no you know potting
and<00:03:04.620> no<00:03:04.740> idiots<00:03:05.010> were<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> mowers<00:03:05.580> then<00:03:05.790> in

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
and no idiots were the mowers then in

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.540 
and no idiots were the mowers then in
the<00:03:06.450> game<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.590> seem<00:03:07.800> it's<00:03:08.010> come<00:03:08.130> across<00:03:08.400> many

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
the game so I seem it's come across many

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.720 
the game so I seem it's come across many
generations<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.300> games<00:03:10.220> that's<00:03:11.220> folded<00:03:11.430> up

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
generations of games that's folded up

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.750 
generations of games that's folded up
shall<00:03:11.970> we<00:03:12.000> see<00:03:12.330> how<00:03:12.510> it's<00:03:12.720> how<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.500> works<00:03:13.760> how

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
shall we see how it's how it works how

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.930 
shall we see how it's how it works how
well<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.060> works<00:03:15.239> even

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.700 

well<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:20.660> been<00:03:20.780> done<00:03:20.930> properly<00:03:21.140> or<00:03:21.380> given

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
well it's been done properly or given

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.330 
well it's been done properly or given
that<00:03:21.890> it's<00:03:22.190> fantastic<00:03:22.400> animation<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:24.340> strive

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
that it's fantastic animation I strive

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.720 
that it's fantastic animation I strive
to<00:03:25.370> some<00:03:25.790> graphs<00:03:26.320> who<00:03:27.320> finds<00:03:27.710> them

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
to some graphs who finds them

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.580 
to some graphs who finds them
that's<00:03:30.240> big<00:03:30.390> enough<00:03:30.420> for<00:03:30.780> this

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
that's big enough for this

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.200 
that's big enough for this
kind<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.130> motion<00:03:33.370> there'll<00:03:33.520> be<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:33.640> lot<00:03:33.910> because

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
kind of motion there'll be a lot because

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.080 
kind of motion there'll be a lot because
I<00:03:34.480> didn't<00:03:34.780> exit<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.290> game<00:03:35.470> after<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:36.090> after

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
I didn't exit the game after this after

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.110 
I didn't exit the game after this after
I<00:03:37.120> mode<00:03:37.390> with<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:38.460> money<00:03:39.460> madam<00:03:40.120> our<00:03:42.000> in<00:03:43.000> the

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.130 

this<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.850> very<00:04:00.060> nice<00:04:00.180> tractor<00:04:00.570> though<00:04:00.690> this

is<00:04:01.320> very<00:04:01.380> very<00:04:01.680> cool<00:04:02.010> obviously<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.760> links<00:04:03.000> to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
is very very cool obviously the links to

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.870 
is very very cool obviously the links to
all<00:04:03.120> these<00:04:03.300> are<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.600> description<00:04:04.880> and

all these are in the description and

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:19.840 
all these are in the description and
we'll<00:04:06.060> do<00:04:06.210> here<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.600> think<00:04:07.590> all<00:04:08.780> nuts

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.730 

there's<00:04:20.390> no<00:04:20.510> small<00:04:20.840> as<00:04:20.960> an<00:04:21.080> area<00:04:21.260> seems<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.650> be

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:21.740 
there's no small as an area seems to be

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.430 
there's no small as an area seems to be
in<00:04:21.800> half<00:04:21.950> now<00:04:22.160> got<00:04:22.370> big<00:04:22.550> mowers<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:24.080> like<00:04:24.320> you

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
in half now got big mowers but like you

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.990 
in half now got big mowers but like you
used<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.710> take<00:04:24.830> forever

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.840 

there's<00:04:30.450> always<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.690> place<00:04:30.990> always<00:04:31.260> Gracia

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.790 

now<00:04:36.300> one<00:04:36.450> thing<00:04:36.570> you'll<00:04:36.720> notice<00:04:37.020> is<00:04:37.170> I've<00:04:37.410> know

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
now one thing you'll notice is I've know

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.170 
now one thing you'll notice is I've know
is<00:04:37.950> is<00:04:38.100> it's<00:04:38.280> not<00:04:38.370> actually<00:04:38.520> appearing<00:04:39.060> down

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
is is it's not actually appearing down

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.710 
is is it's not actually appearing down
there<00:04:39.650> as<00:04:40.650> it's<00:04:40.950> on<00:04:41.070> then<00:04:41.640> it's<00:04:41.760> not<00:04:42.030> there<00:04:42.390> on

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
there as it's on then it's not there on

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.130 
there as it's on then it's not there on
the<00:04:42.810> my<00:04:42.930> favorite<00:04:43.140> rational<00:04:43.590> reason<00:04:45.140> let's

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
the my favorite rational reason let's

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:53.770 
the my favorite rational reason let's
unfold<00:04:46.350> it<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.740> see<00:04:46.920> what<00:04:47.070> she'd<00:04:47.250> lie

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:01.240

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.070 

don't<00:05:01.820> go<00:05:01.880> 20k<00:05:02.510> with<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:02.870> that's<00:05:03.320> fantast

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.809 

you<00:05:07.560> can<00:05:07.680> just<00:05:07.800> look<00:05:07.889> at<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.069> area<00:05:08.370> recovering

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
you can just look at the area recovering

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.939 
you can just look at the area recovering
this<00:05:09.030> is<00:05:09.180> such<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.389> good<00:05:09.599> little<00:05:09.720> month<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.229> see

realistic and you guys probably won't

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.429 
realistic and you guys probably won't
like<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.030> very<00:05:15.360> much<00:05:15.479> but<00:05:15.840> certain<00:05:16.349> people

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
goes underground but it still works

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.290 
goes underground but it still works
still<00:05:30.750> knows<00:05:31.580> that's<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.699> most<00:05:32.849> important

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
still knows that's the most important

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.840 
still knows that's the most important
thing

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:44.490 

let's<00:05:38.420> just<00:05:38.570> look<00:05:38.690> at<00:05:38.780> the<00:05:38.900> time<00:05:39.080> we're<00:05:39.290> saving

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:54.480 

that's<00:05:44.980> very<00:05:45.160> cool

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.189 

and<00:05:55.000> it<00:05:55.120> doesn't<00:05:55.360> seem<00:05:55.479> to<00:05:55.539> eat<00:05:55.780> obviously

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
and it doesn't seem to eat obviously

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.360

there's<00:05:56.410> a<00:05:56.470> lot<00:05:56.560> of<00:05:56.710> clip<00:05:56.860> there<00:05:57.009> so<00:05:57.130> it<00:05:57.220> can

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
there's a lot of clip there so it can

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:05.019 
there's a lot of clip there so it can
actually<00:05:57.490> go<00:05:58.000> through<00:05:58.180> objects

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:06.699
