00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.799
 pretty small video showing 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.809
 perfeo tablet work 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:17.880
 97 26 with retina display i.e. 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:23.449
 us the resolution is 2048 by 1536 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:28.680
 a recent Ipad is not on video 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:31.650
 aims to go full 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.190
 I just want a review of this device. 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.730
 so that you look at it and rate it 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:43.170
 should anyone pay attention to her 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.899
 9.7 inch screen for 4 inch comparison 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.399
 smartphone that should pay attention 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.399
 pay attention certainly stands on 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.910
 quickly act let's run 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.730
 rauze 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.199
 let's say something else you all can 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.949
 you can see for yourself on my feelings no special 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.110
 speed problems 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.229
 actually some separate browsers 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.689
 programs when they are already running 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.460
 no problems with dash toys with heavy 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:22.409
 video shows well including 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.009
 Fula is one in all this will see here the same 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.189
 time some action is capable 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:33.140
 interface or which will be installed when 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.409
 we are all slow 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 very seriously can be called for a long time 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.200
 Keyboards can be displayed for a long time. 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.619
 play and letter 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.390
 that is, I honestly do not understand well in 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:53.060
 what place do the gaps arise why 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.440
 enough power the heaviest pear 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.360
 but flipping pages 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.650
 just a list of applications cause 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:09.890
 the problem here now you can see the works 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:12.560
 times by itself of course the screen is here 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.570
 great he's not very caustic but for 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.570
 home use and crash from 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.530
 more than anything and of course 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.940
 items 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.459
 letters and tsiferki icons looking at 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.530
 it is a pleasure to behold at this 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.810
 see how long it took for him 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.739
 switching to 1 gram let's 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.739
 look hard 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.310
 you yourself warmed the whole is not put 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.310
 very tide 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.470
 let's see so I want to show you 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:58.740
 the funny thing here is originally there and 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.190
 there you can see even with the file 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.190
 systems 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:14.910
 but please we see that they do not see 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:17.300
 people who do not have access start it 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.300
 maybe you need one question 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.300
 of opportunities 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.370
 yes let we can remove how 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.590
 the installed system is visible to the application 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:37.050
 as I said here you can watch 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:43.910
 any video including the fund now 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:46.910
 one second let's something 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.910
 turn on 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.349
 which is especially nice behaves well 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.930
 preset video player he calmly 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.479
 lost any files that 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.659
 any videos that I tried to him 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.500
 father and finally let's a little bit 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.500
 let's play 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:54.620
 that's all I wanted for you today 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:56.680
 show tablet left ambiguous 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.680
 impression 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:05.270
 to be honest it could have been better and 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:07.880
 more bright more about everything about it as 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.890
 You can usually read a review that you 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.530
 you can find on our website 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:17.420
 it will be published in a couple of hours 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:22.930
 after recording this video thanks for 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.930
 attention goodbye
