00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.180
 or dairy products piracanjuba 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.000
 he has to celebrate in 155 years of 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.910
 history and she is a company that comes 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.880
 growing exponentially and 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.420
 This and this growth it comes also 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.540
 a very large need of hand 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.620
 of work which was our our idea 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.290
 with this problem we look for 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.290
 alternatives to improve performance 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.020
 of the company to look for part of 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.720
 robotics part of automation arrive at 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.380
 make several various budgets have come 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.619
 several companies here and we opted for 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.729
 by bbc a company that has submitted is 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.380
 a better cost-benefit relationship, right? 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.390
 a company that we saw that in 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.220
 first moment had a facility 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.520
 very large to analyze our 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.800
 difficulties in understanding what the company 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.350
 I was needing it because every customer 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.300
 he has a specific need then 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.330
 we feel that to drink the company that 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.880
 more suited to our needs 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.649
 So we closed it with the baby. 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.190
 project and seven lines of palletizing 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.640
 and today the project is already in full 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.640
 fully functioning 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.090
 the idea of ​​automation of shutdown 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.360
 there are not two aspects to us first 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.599
 increase line productivity 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.489
 because before 5 good until making a 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.190
 analysis in other companies that already run 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.129
 with equipment the baby robot he has a 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.230
 very good efficiency the second point is 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.760
 you allocate this workforce that today is 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.220
 a very manual work that the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.040
 developer tires this a lot 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.659
 times the rate of absenteeism increases 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.629
 work is beginning to be lacking due to the 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.760
 physical wear and tear on people today are not 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.250
 these people are allocating 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.690
 these people in other areas and giving 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.940
 opportunity for these people 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.609
 grow professionally from the company 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.950
 so the idea is not a reduction of 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:13.810
 improving the qualification of the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.810
 together with the entrance of theft 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.810
 1 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.180
 Hmm
