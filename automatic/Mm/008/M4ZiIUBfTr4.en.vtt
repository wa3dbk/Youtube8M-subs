give support but once we get this bridge

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.350 
give support but once we get this bridge
on<00:01:35.899> it<00:01:36.110> actually<00:01:36.380> supports<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.250> two<00:01:37.820> sides<00:01:38.119> of

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
on it actually supports the two sides of

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.320 
on it actually supports the two sides of
there<00:01:38.630> wondering<00:01:39.020> when<00:01:39.640> okay<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:40.880> we<00:01:41.000> decided

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
there wondering when okay so we decided

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.690 
there wondering when okay so we decided
to<00:01:41.420> put<00:01:41.570> together<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:42.020> cat<00:01:42.200> enclosure<00:01:42.380> in<00:01:43.009> the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
to put together the cat enclosure in the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.900 
to put together the cat enclosure in the
middle<00:01:43.910> of<00:01:44.030> August<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.690> South<00:01:45.050> Florida<00:01:45.500> and

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
middle of August in South Florida and

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.580 
middle of August in South Florida and
basically<00:01:46.910> we're<00:01:47.180> cat<00:01:47.360> crazy<00:01:47.690> so<00:01:48.320> that's<00:01:48.500> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
basically we're cat crazy so that's the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.680 
basically we're cat crazy so that's the
only<00:01:48.680> reason<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:49.100> do<00:01:49.220> it<00:01:49.340> now<00:01:49.430> going<00:01:49.729> on<00:01:49.910> this

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
only reason to do it now going on this

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.560 
only reason to do it now going on this
is<00:01:50.840> where<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.259> litter<00:01:51.710> box<00:01:52.450> modules<00:01:53.450> are

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
is where the litter box modules are

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.210 
is where the litter box modules are
going<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.869> go<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:54.320> I'll<00:01:54.470> have<00:01:54.560> two<00:01:54.740> here<00:01:55.009> that<00:01:55.039> I

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
going to go so I'll have two here that I

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.820 
going to go so I'll have two here that I
can<00:01:55.460> access<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.149> change<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:57.050> you<00:01:57.170> stabilizer

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
can access and change to you stabilizer

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.279 
can access and change to you stabilizer
bridge<00:01:58.490> on<00:01:58.820> top<00:01:58.850> which<00:01:59.810> gives<00:01:59.840> a<00:02:00.110> lot<00:02:00.259> of

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
bridge on top which gives a lot of

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.430 
bridge on top which gives a lot of
headroom<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:01.450> well<00:02:02.450> as<00:02:02.539> eventually<00:02:03.170> ran<00:02:03.350> up

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
headroom as well as eventually ran up

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.370 
headroom as well as eventually ran up
the<00:02:03.530> loft<00:02:03.740> here<00:02:04.009> like<00:02:04.670> two<00:02:05.000> separate<00:02:05.450> litter

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
the loft here like two separate litter

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.550 
the loft here like two separate litter
modules<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:08.330> one<00:02:08.540> litter<00:02:08.750> box<00:02:09.019> is<00:02:09.229> going<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.410> go

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
modules so one litter box is going to go

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.590 
modules so one litter box is going to go
over<00:02:09.679> here<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.130> one<00:02:10.850> litter<00:02:11.060> box<00:02:11.239> is<00:02:11.420> going<00:02:11.540> to

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
over here and one litter box is going to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.530 
over here and one litter box is going to
go<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:12.049> and<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:13.310> reason<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:13.760> two<00:02:13.940> is

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
go here and the reason I have two is

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.420 
go here and the reason I have two is
because<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.440> cat<00:02:15.709> who<00:02:15.920> has<00:02:15.980> special

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
because I have a cat who has special

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.729 
because I have a cat who has special
needs<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.880> we're<00:02:17.510> going<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.660> make<00:02:17.810> her<00:02:18.140> have<00:02:18.709> a

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
needs and we're going to make her have a
