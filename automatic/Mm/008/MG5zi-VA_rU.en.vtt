a rack or when you're when you're
playing<00:01:25.840> with<00:01:25.960> racks<00:01:26.170> is<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:27.160> no<00:01:27.310> leg<00:01:27.520> route

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
playing with racks is the no leg route

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.850 
playing with racks is the no leg route
this<00:01:28.180> actually<00:01:28.630> cleans<00:01:29.020> up<00:01:29.200> your<00:01:29.350> floor<00:01:29.560> space

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.010 
hi-hat stand out for an O leg hi-hat
stand<00:01:41.260> I<00:01:41.670> connected<00:01:42.670> my<00:01:42.700> snare<00:01:43.090> stand<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.900> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
stand I connected my snare stand to the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.990 
stand I connected my snare stand to the
front<00:01:44.320> leg<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.710> rack<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.220> then<00:01:45.909> I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
front leg of the rack and then I

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.820 
front leg of the rack and then I
connected<00:01:46.360> my<00:01:46.420> hi-hat<00:01:46.750> stand<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.740> the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
connected my hi-hat stand to the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.280 
connected my hi-hat stand to the
crossbar<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.729> rack<00:01:48.970> now<00:01:49.900> for<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.170> know

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
crossbar of the rack now for the know

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.110 
crossbar of the rack now for the know
like<00:01:50.470> snare<00:01:50.770> stand<00:01:51.010> I<00:01:51.340> used<00:01:51.729> two<00:01:52.090> different

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
like snare stand I used two different

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.740 
like snare stand I used two different
components<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:53.050> use<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.860> mini<00:01:54.490> T<00:01:54.760> leg<00:01:55.000> which<00:01:55.720> is

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
components I use the mini T leg which is

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.320 
components I use the mini T leg which is
the<00:01:56.050> GSM<00:01:56.620> TL<00:01:57.040> this<00:01:57.520> comes<00:01:57.790> on<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:57.970> actual

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
the GSM TL this comes on the actual

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.260 
the GSM TL this comes on the actual
stealth<00:01:58.630> rack<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.620> use<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.070> bent<00:02:00.430> bar<00:02:00.729> that

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
stealth rack and I use the bent bar that

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.719 
stealth rack and I use the bent bar that
comes<00:02:01.390> on<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.659> stealth<00:02:01.840> rack<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.140> SC<00:02:02.729> GPRS

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
comes on the stealth rack the SC GPRS

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.110 
comes on the stealth rack the SC GPRS
bar<00:02:04.299> I<00:02:04.600> connected<00:02:05.409> that<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.700> front<00:02:06.940> leg

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
bar I connected that to the front leg

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.580 
bar I connected that to the front leg
and<00:02:07.360> it's<00:02:07.630> really<00:02:07.810> cool<00:02:08.019> with<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.229> bent<00:02:08.409> bar

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
and it's really cool with the bent bar

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.990 
and it's really cool with the bent bar
because<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.979> bent<00:02:09.190> bar<00:02:09.369> will<00:02:09.549> go<00:02:09.580> over<00:02:09.970> a

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
because the bent bar will go over a

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.180 
because the bent bar will go over a
double<00:02:10.300> pedal<00:02:10.539> arm<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.470> no<00:02:11.590> leg<00:02:11.770> hi-hat<00:02:12.069> stand

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
double pedal arm the no leg hi-hat stand

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.000 
double pedal arm the no leg hi-hat stand
was<00:02:12.910> attached<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.540> rack<00:02:13.690> using<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.170> SC

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
was attached to the rack using the SC

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.390 
was attached to the rack using the SC
a<00:02:15.040> 100<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.360> 10<00:02:16.629> to<00:02:16.750> 12<00:02:17.080> inch<00:02:17.200> extension<00:02:18.099> arm

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
a 100 it's a 10 to 12 inch extension arm

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.910 
a 100 it's a 10 to 12 inch extension arm
that<00:02:19.000> has<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.480> rotating<00:02:20.200> clamp<00:02:20.500> on<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.739> very

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
that has a rotating clamp on the very

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.979 
that has a rotating clamp on the very
end<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:21.579> it<00:02:21.700> grabs<00:02:22.030> right<00:02:22.180> on<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.599> hi-hat

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
end so it grabs right on to the hi-hat

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.660 
end so it grabs right on to the hi-hat
and<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.560> will<00:02:23.650> attach<00:02:23.769> directly<00:02:24.129> to<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.519> rack

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
and it will attach directly to the rack

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.380 
and it will attach directly to the rack
using<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.090> multi<00:02:25.329> clamp

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
using a multi clamp

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.310 
using a multi clamp
so<00:02:28.390> now<00:02:28.510> we're<00:02:28.720> moving<00:02:28.930> on<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.050> option<00:02:29.260> G<00:02:30.130> one

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
so now we're moving on to option G one

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.660 
so now we're moving on to option G one
wait<00:02:32.320> that<00:02:32.350> was<00:02:32.560> backwards<00:02:32.950> for<00:02:33.070> you<00:02:33.130> guys<00:02:33.310> you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
wait that was backwards for you guys you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.580 
wait that was backwards for you guys you
guys<00:02:33.820> need<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.030> be<00:02:34.150> like<00:02:34.300> this<00:02:35.940> better<00:02:37.590> what

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
guys need to be like this better what

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.400 
guys need to be like this better what
this<00:02:38.710> is<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.360> stealth<00:02:40.720> side<00:02:41.170> rack

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
this is this is the stealth side rack

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.670 
this is this is the stealth side rack
option<00:02:42.070> only<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.330> offset<00:02:43.900> configuration

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
option only in the offset configuration

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.800 
option only in the offset configuration
so<00:02:45.280> what<00:02:45.430> I'm<00:02:45.520> doing<00:02:45.550> is<00:02:45.790> I'm<00:02:45.910> using<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.270> GSS

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
so what I'm doing is I'm using the GSS

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.790 
so what I'm doing is I'm using the GSS
m/s<00:02:47.200> on<00:02:47.440> both<00:02:47.830> sides<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:49.110> all<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.440> hi-hat

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
m/s on both sides and all the hi-hat

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.430 
m/s on both sides and all the hi-hat
side<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.370> just<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.670> modification<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.630> option

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
side is is just a modification of option

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.410 
side is is just a modification of option
G<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:55.000> floor<00:02:55.240> toms<00:02:55.450> side<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:57.000> option<00:02:58.000> D<00:02:58.180> one

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
G the floor toms side is option D one

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.050 
G the floor toms side is option D one
that<00:02:58.600> we<00:02:58.690> know<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.110> love<00:02:59.280> now<00:03:00.280> by<00:03:00.550> doing<00:03:00.610> this
