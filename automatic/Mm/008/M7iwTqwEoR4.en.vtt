didn't<00:01:42.630> really<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.200> talk<00:01:43.560> over<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
didn't really think to talk over it so

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.219 
didn't really think to talk over it so
it's<00:01:44.340> kind<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.579> funny<00:01:44.820> how<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.659> wasn't

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
it's kind of funny how that wasn't

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.830 
it's kind of funny how that wasn't
really<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.439> norm<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.520> anyway<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:47.880> videos<00:01:48.630> like

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
really a norm but anyway so videos like

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.830 
really a norm but anyway so videos like
this<00:01:49.100> back<00:01:50.100> when<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> would<00:01:50.579> put<00:01:50.820> him<00:01:50.939> out<00:01:51.090> would

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.870 
this back when I would put him out would
just<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.500> lot<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.920> use<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> mean<00:01:53.759> not

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
just get a lot of use and I mean not

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.480 
just get a lot of use and I mean not
necessary<00:01:54.540> i<00:01:54.659> canna<00:01:55.049> Norma's<00:01:55.740> amount<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.280> but

some of my battlefield bad company
videos<00:01:58.079> they<00:01:58.890> were<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.310> simple<00:01:59.850> gameplay

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
videos they were just simple gameplay

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.120 
videos they were just simple gameplay
nothing<00:02:00.630> extraordinary<00:02:01.020> nothing<00:02:01.710> kind<00:02:02.040> of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
nothing extraordinary nothing kind of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
nothing extraordinary nothing kind of
just<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.610> same<00:02:02.790> little<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.479> average

just the same little this just average

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.600 
just the same little this just average
gameplay<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> I'd<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.409> I'd<00:02:08.039> make<00:02:08.459> those

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
gameplay and so I'd have I'd make those

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.339 
gameplay and so I'd have I'd make those
videos<00:02:08.940> get<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.360> gameplay<00:02:09.780> edit<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.170> put

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
videos get that gameplay edit it put

videos get that gameplay edit it put
some<00:02:10.379> music<00:02:10.560> together<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.129> they<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.370> tens<00:02:11.640> of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
some music together and they get tens of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.680 
some music together and they get tens of
thousands<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.180> views

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
thousands of views

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.810 
thousands of views
and<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.560> same<00:02:13.890> thing<00:02:14.190> was<00:02:14.340> put<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.580> today

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
and if that same thing was put out today

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.350 
and if that same thing was put out today
first<00:02:15.270> we<00:02:15.540> match<00:02:15.720> for<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:15.990> third<00:02:16.620> party<00:02:16.920> content

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
first we match for a third party content

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.240 
first we match for a third party content
second<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.410> wouldn't<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:19.800> any<00:02:19.920> views

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
second it just wouldn't get any views

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.650 
second it just wouldn't get any views
because<00:02:20.430> there's<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.970> many<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.210> those<00:02:21.390> types

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
because there's so many of those types

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.120 
because there's so many of those types
of<00:02:21.810> videos<00:02:22.080> out<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:22.320> where<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.980> just

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
of videos out there where it just

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.560 
of videos out there where it just
wouldn't<00:02:23.460> be<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.730> doesn't<00:02:23.880> stick<00:02:24.000> out<00:02:24.330> and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
wouldn't be it doesn't stick out and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.850 
wouldn't be it doesn't stick out and
that's<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.780> crazy<00:02:25.080> thing<00:02:25.170> about<00:02:25.320> today<00:02:25.590> is

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that's the crazy thing about today is

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.130 
that's the crazy thing about today is
that<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:27.000> many<00:02:27.090> people<00:02:27.210> have<00:02:27.450> access<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.050> this

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
that so many people have access to this

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.290 
that so many people have access to this
technology<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:30.030> have<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.270> be

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
technology that you really have to be

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.610 
technology that you really have to be
different<00:02:30.690> if<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.840> want<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.080> stick<00:02:31.260> out<00:02:31.440> and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
different if you want to stick out and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.710 
different if you want to stick out and
it's<00:02:31.710> not<00:02:31.920> as<00:02:32.100> easy<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.430> break<00:02:32.670> through<00:02:33.000> as<00:02:33.210> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
it's not as easy to break through as it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.310 
it's not as easy to break through as it
was<00:02:33.930> five<00:02:34.770> years<00:02:34.950> ago<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:37.140> an
