see this is one of the main parts of the
Midway<00:00:26.000> right<00:00:26.270> here<00:00:27.280> pretty<00:00:28.280> much<00:00:28.430> right<00:00:28.670> by

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
Midway right here pretty much right by

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.139 
Midway right here pretty much right by
the<00:00:28.940> tomb<00:00:30.460> previously<00:00:31.460> known<00:00:31.640> as<00:00:31.670> Tomb<00:00:32.119> Raider

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
the tomb previously known as Tomb Raider

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.410 
the tomb previously known as Tomb Raider
Lara<00:00:32.780> Croft<00:00:32.960> Tomb<00:00:33.230> Raider<00:00:33.699> this<00:00:34.699> is<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:35.210> guess

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
Lara Croft Tomb Raider this is I guess

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.389 
Lara Croft Tomb Raider this is I guess
the<00:00:35.469> where<00:00:36.469> the<00:00:36.589> lift<00:00:36.769> is<00:00:36.920> going<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:37.129> go<00:00:37.249> up

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
the where the lift is going to go up

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.160 
the where the lift is going to go up
here<00:00:37.429> and<00:00:37.699> this<00:00:37.879> is<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.179> splashdown<00:00:38.480> pool<00:00:38.929> you

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
here and this is the splashdown pool you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.049 
here and this is the splashdown pool you
can<00:00:39.320> see<00:00:39.530> I'll<00:00:40.339> zoom<00:00:40.550> in<00:00:40.730> a<00:00:40.760> little<00:00:40.940> bit

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
can see I'll zoom in a little bit

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.450 
can see I'll zoom in a little bit
showing<00:00:41.480> this<00:00:42.039> I'm<00:00:43.039> going<00:00:43.190> to<00:00:43.249> pan<00:00:43.429> around

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
showing this I'm going to pan around

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.740 
showing this I'm going to pan around
we're<00:00:43.999> right<00:00:44.149> by<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.329> Beast

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.860 

and<00:00:50.020> I<00:00:50.290> think<00:00:50.350> it's<00:00:50.650> going<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:51.240> span<00:00:52.240> out<00:00:52.480> maybe

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
and I think it's going to span out maybe

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.800 
and I think it's going to span out maybe
not<00:00:53.140> right<00:00:53.380> here<00:00:53.770> but<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:54.010> can<00:00:54.130> see<00:00:54.160> that

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
not right here but you can see that

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.610 
not right here but you can see that
eventually<00:00:55.810> it's<00:00:55.960> going<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.110> come<00:00:56.290> out<00:00:56.440> over

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
eventually it's going to come out over

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.830 
eventually it's going to come out over
the<00:00:56.800> Midway<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.970> we<00:00:58.150> believe<00:00:58.450> it's<00:00:58.660> going<00:00:58.780> to

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
the Midway and we believe it's going to

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.160 
the Midway and we believe it's going to
come<00:00:59.020> out<00:00:59.140> over<00:01:00.060> this<00:01:01.060> play<00:01:01.330> so<00:01:01.930> what<00:01:02.050> we'll

is<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.280> little<00:04:04.459> bit<00:04:04.640> more<00:04:04.819> obvious

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.800 

this<00:04:35.449> indeed

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.520

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.440 

covered<00:04:46.690> up<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:47.050> look<00:04:47.200> like<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.440> planting<00:04:48.450> right

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.870 

so<00:04:57.780> once<00:04:57.960> again<00:04:58.220> it's<00:04:59.220> coming<00:04:59.520> around<00:04:59.670> this

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
so once again it's coming around this

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:12.820 
so once again it's coming around this
way

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.510 

this<00:05:13.400> is<00:05:13.550> where<00:05:13.760> it's<00:05:13.880> going<00:05:13.970> to<00:05:14.030> come<00:05:14.090> through

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.180
