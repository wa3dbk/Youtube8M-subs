00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
all right that is my timer so I'm gonna

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.980 
all right that is my timer so I'm gonna
turn<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.259> heat<00:01:52.289> off<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.420> I'm<00:01:54.539> gonna<00:01:54.719> move

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
turn the heat off and I'm gonna move

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.080 
turn the heat off and I'm gonna move
this<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.469> a<00:01:55.500> back<00:01:55.799> burner<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> out

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
this to a back burner just to get it out

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.810 
this to a back burner just to get it out
of<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> way<00:01:57.539> and<00:01:57.810> free<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.259> some<00:01:58.469> room<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> I'm

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
ice bath let me show you how to make an

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.009 
ice bath let me show you how to make an
ice<00:02:13.530> bath<00:02:13.860> it's<00:02:14.670> made<00:02:14.879> an<00:02:14.970> ice<00:02:15.090> bath<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.840> need

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
ice bath it's made an ice bath you need

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.740 
ice bath it's made an ice bath you need
a<00:02:16.410> decent<00:02:16.980> sized<00:02:17.400> bowl<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.060> will<00:02:18.269> hold<00:02:18.480> at

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
a decent sized bowl this will hold at

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.750 
a decent sized bowl this will hold at
least<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:19.140> bunch<00:02:19.349> of<00:02:19.470> ice<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.950> water<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.400> all

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
six eggs and a bunch of ice so I just go

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.750 
six eggs and a bunch of ice so I just go
to<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.360> ice<00:02:24.540> maker<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:26.010> fill<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.430> up<00:02:28.760> dump

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
to the ice maker and I fill this up dump

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.580 
to the ice maker and I fill this up dump
it<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.000> there<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.450> then<00:02:30.900> I'm<00:02:31.019> just<00:02:31.170> gonna<00:02:31.290> run

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
it in there and then I'm just gonna run

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.500 
it in there and then I'm just gonna run
water<00:02:31.829> over<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.549> that's<00:02:32.849> an<00:02:33.030> ice<00:02:33.150> bath

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
water over this and that's an ice bath

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.920 
water over this and that's an ice bath
not<00:02:34.500> hard<00:02:34.920> um<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.940> don't<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.569> an<00:02:36.780> ice

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
not hard um if you don't have an ice

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.750 
not hard um if you don't have an ice
machine<00:02:37.140> probably<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.890> tray<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.220> ice<00:02:38.489> cubes

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
machine probably a tray of ice cubes

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.259 
machine probably a tray of ice cubes
will<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.090> good<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:39.599> plan<00:02:40.200> ahead<00:02:40.670> otherwise<00:02:41.670> you

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
will be good so plan ahead otherwise you

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.300 
will be good so plan ahead otherwise you
can<00:02:42.480> just<00:02:42.510> run<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.989> eggs<00:02:43.140> under<00:02:43.560> cool<00:02:43.829> water

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
can just run the eggs under cool water

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.250 
can just run the eggs under cool water
if<00:02:44.579> you<00:02:44.730> put<00:02:44.940> them<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.209> bowl<00:02:45.360> like<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.989> and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
if you put them in a bowl like that and

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.370 
if you put them in a bowl like that and
run<00:02:46.410> cool<00:02:46.709> water<00:02:47.010> kind<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.940> continuously<00:02:48.569> um<00:02:49.319> I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
run cool water kind of continuously um I

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.319 
run cool water kind of continuously um I
live<00:02:50.069> in<00:02:50.190> California<00:02:50.700> there's<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:50.970> massive

instead of turning a kind of gross green
oh<00:03:09.410> right<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.709> has<00:03:10.829> been<00:03:10.859> exactly<00:03:11.370> 13<00:03:12.060> minutes

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
oh right it has been exactly 13 minutes

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.830 
oh right it has been exactly 13 minutes
I'm<00:03:13.109> going<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.440> take<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.859> lid<00:03:14.100> off<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.880> I'm

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
I'm going to take the lid off and I'm

I'm going to take the lid off and I'm
gonna<00:03:15.989> use<00:03:16.170> my<00:03:16.200> little<00:03:16.590> handy<00:03:16.920> little<00:03:17.069> spider

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
gonna use my little handy little spider

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.930 
gonna use my little handy little spider
guy<00:03:18.139> to<00:03:19.139> transfer<00:03:19.739> these<00:03:19.859> eggs<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.609> couple<00:03:20.880> of

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
guy to transfer these eggs a couple of

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.970 
guy to transfer these eggs a couple of
the<00:03:21.000> time<00:03:21.239> carefully<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.920> my<00:03:23.100> ice<00:03:23.310> water<00:03:23.639> bath

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
the time carefully to my ice water bath

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.479 
the time carefully to my ice water bath
or<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:26.970> bowl<00:03:27.299> or<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.930> will<00:03:28.049> run<00:03:28.230> over<00:03:29.220> them

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
or to a bowl or you will run over them

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.000 
or to a bowl or you will run over them
so<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.269> process<00:03:30.810> like<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.170> said<00:03:31.200> will<00:03:31.709> stop

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
so this process like I said will stop

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.849 
so this process like I said will stop
the<00:03:32.280> cooking<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.840> it'll<00:03:34.500> give<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.769> really

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
the cooking and it'll give you a really

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.140 
the cooking and it'll give you a really
nice<00:03:35.489> texture<00:03:36.470> overall<00:03:37.670> so<00:03:38.670> I'm<00:03:38.790> gonna<00:03:38.910> let

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
nice texture overall so I'm gonna let

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.069 
nice texture overall so I'm gonna let
these<00:03:40.010> cool<00:03:41.010> down<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.730> would<00:03:42.389> say<00:03:42.569> about<00:03:42.750> five

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
these cool down I would say about five

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.569 
these cool down I would say about five
minutes<00:03:43.319> in<00:03:43.560> here<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:43.950> they<00:03:44.040> should<00:03:44.069> be<00:03:44.400> good

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
minutes in here and they should be good

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.009 
minutes in here and they should be good
you'll<00:03:44.819> be<00:03:44.849> able<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.150> feel<00:03:45.359> if<00:03:45.569> you<00:03:45.720> pick<00:03:45.930> them

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019
