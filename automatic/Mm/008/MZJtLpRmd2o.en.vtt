00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
with other books I think one of the most

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.700 
with other books I think one of the most
exciting<00:00:35.910> books<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.600> city<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.350> bones<00:00:37.530> by

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710

exciting books is city of bones by
Cassandra<00:00:38.219> Clare<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.360> new<00:00:39.600> edition

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
Cassandra Clare this is the new edition

Cassandra Clare this is the new edition
of<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> book<00:00:40.469> most<00:00:40.829> people<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.250> having<00:00:41.370> very

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
of the book most people are having very

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490 
of the book most people are having very
mixed<00:00:42.090> reactions<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.050> think<00:00:43.320> they

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
mixed reactions to it I think they

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
mixed reactions to it I think they
targeted<00:00:44.129> mia<00:00:44.250> at<00:00:44.520> any<00:00:44.879> adult<00:00:45.450> marketing

the<00:06:17.919> premise<00:06:18.280> of<00:06:18.400> it<00:06:18.580> and<00:06:18.849> it<00:06:19.000> is<00:06:19.180> killer<00:06:19.570> game

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
the premise of it and it is killer game

then walk around lame but suddenly it

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.020 
then walk around lame but suddenly it
turns<00:06:31.659> a<00:06:32.020> bit<00:06:32.199> serious<00:06:32.440> and<00:06:32.949> someone<00:06:33.849> actually
