00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
which like I said before I don't really

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.560 
which like I said before I don't really
care<00:03:30.440> about<00:03:31.030> probably<00:03:32.030> not<00:03:32.180> even<00:03:32.420> going<00:03:32.510> to

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
care about probably not even going to

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.600 
care about probably not even going to
use<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:32.900> anyway<00:03:33.200> some<00:03:33.830> of<00:03:33.980> them<00:03:34.130> are<00:03:34.250> supposed

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
use it anyway some of them are supposed

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.100 
use it anyway some of them are supposed
to<00:03:34.670> be<00:03:34.820> faulty<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.180> don't<00:03:35.390> think<00:03:35.540> it's<00:03:35.690> all<00:03:35.870> over

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
to be faulty I don't think it's all over

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.630 
to be faulty I don't think it's all over
them<00:03:36.230> are<00:03:36.350> faulty<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.709> just<00:03:37.190> think<00:03:37.400> some<00:03:37.610> of

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
them are faulty I just think some of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.930 
them are faulty I just think some of
them<00:03:37.910> but<00:03:38.810> i<00:03:38.989> guess<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.380> fits<00:03:39.620> into

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
them but i guess this fits into

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.910 
them but i guess this fits into
