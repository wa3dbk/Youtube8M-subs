00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 in this project you will learn how 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.180
 painless and most importantly fast 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:20.270
 print any logo right on your 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:21.810
 skin for this project we need 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.400
 jet printer 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.080
 paper and scotch 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:35.309
 put a ribbon on the sheet of paper in the center 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:37.400
 skoch and set the paper in the printer so 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.989
 to scotch was addressed to you 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.200
 most printers print for this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.200
 to the side 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.000
 Photoshop or any other program for 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.269
 images open the logo which you 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.830
 want to print 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.629
 make a mirror image so that when 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:00.239
 transferring the tattoo on the skin turned out 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.339
 correct and readable logo reduce 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.420
 image sizes up to width and scotch and 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.420
 send to print 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.370
 select the skin you are on 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.110
 planning to translate the tattoo 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.590
 place your hand over the printout and lightly 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.590
 hold it down 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.530
 it turned out pretty realistic 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.890
 after 5-10 minutes the paint is completely 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.230
 it will even dry here 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.910
 touch your finger for optimal 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.890
 it is better not to use results 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.600
 large images and no fine details 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.150
 depending on the print quality of your 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.200
 Printer 1 printout is enough for two three 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:02.540
 imprint if she was tired then 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.980
 removed with soap and water other than 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.650
 addition can make the transfer of the image 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.660
 not only on the skin but also on any paper 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.959
 a surface that is difficult to cram into 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.959
 Printer 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.560
 by the way the same piece of paper with 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.300
 scotch can be used several times 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.190
 the paint doesn't stick to the client so its 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.800
 can be easily removed with a paper napkin 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:39.990
 or a piece of cloth and print already new 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.990
 images thanks for watching
