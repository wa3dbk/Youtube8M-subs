00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
two and a half that sounded that was

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.190 
two and a half that sounded that was
like<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.950> revolution<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.850> both<00:03:13.660> Carter<00:03:14.019> and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
like a revolution and both Carter and

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.160 
like a revolution and both Carter and
myself<00:03:14.350> we<00:03:14.980> were<00:03:15.010> very<00:03:15.850> reluctant<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.900> even

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
myself we were very reluctant to to even

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.789 
myself we were very reluctant to to even
to<00:03:17.260> consider<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:19.269> then<00:03:19.630> we<00:03:20.230> were<00:03:20.410> moving

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
to consider that and then we were moving

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.320 
to consider that and then we were moving
to<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.370> oversee<00:03:22.019> towards<00:03:23.019> the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
to to oversee towards the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.510 
to to oversee towards the
cancellation<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.230> their<00:03:25.380> German<00:03:25.740> games<00:03:25.980> it

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
cancellation of their German games it

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.510 
cancellation of their German games it
was<00:03:26.790> very<00:03:27.060> natural<00:03:27.270> because<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.960> computers

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
was very natural because the computers

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.980 
was very natural because the computers
but<00:03:29.520> still<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:30.210> was<00:03:30.240> very<00:03:30.720> revolutionary

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
but still that was very revolutionary

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.090 
but still that was very revolutionary
shift<00:03:31.740> from<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.970> pathetic<00:03:33.650> type<00:03:34.650> wall

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
shift from the of a pathetic type wall

shift from the of a pathetic type wall
jumpers<00:03:35.520> magic<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:38.310> think<00:03:38.610> that's<00:03:38.810> certain

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
jumpers magic and I think that's certain

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.080 
jumpers magic and I think that's certain
regulations<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:43.350> are<00:03:43.710> being<00:03:44.250> imposed<00:03:44.670> in

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
regulations that are being imposed in

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.950 
regulations that are being imposed in
some<00:03:45.390> events<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.440> know<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.860> cefiro

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
some events like you know the cefiro

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.320 
some events like you know the cefiro
they<00:03:48.960> again<00:03:49.380> there<00:03:49.590> they<00:03:49.860> also<00:03:50.160> part<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.210> this

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
they again there they also part of this

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.260 
they again there they also part of this
natural<00:03:51.570> process<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.380> keeping<00:03:53.190> keeping<00:03:54.000> up

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
natural process of keeping keeping up

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.690 
natural process of keeping keeping up
with<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.570> tension<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.140> game<00:03:55.320> or<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.580> the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
with the tension of the game or in the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.670 
with the tension of the game or in the
tournaments<00:03:57.240> we<00:03:57.480> may<00:03:57.600> talk<00:03:57.810> about<00:03:57.870> three<00:03:58.380> you

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
tournaments we may talk about three you

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.740 
tournaments we may talk about three you
know<00:03:58.800> sweet<00:03:59.070> points<00:03:59.340> for<00:03:59.490> win<00:03:59.670> which<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.510> think

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
know sweet points for win which I think

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.870 
know sweet points for win which I think
it's<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.930> bit<00:04:01.050> excessive<00:04:01.490> because<00:04:02.490> then<00:04:02.700> the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
it's a bit excessive because then the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.060 
it's a bit excessive because then the
results<00:04:03.240> might<00:04:03.420> be<00:04:03.570> on<00:04:03.720> top<00:04:03.930> unbalanced<00:04:04.590> but

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
results might be on top unbalanced but

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.220 
results might be on top unbalanced but
still<00:04:05.460> you<00:04:05.670> know<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.060> idea<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.690> gaining

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
still you know the idea is gaining

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.770 
still you know the idea is gaining
ground<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.940> course<00:04:09.180> there<00:04:09.420> are<00:04:09.540> most

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
ground and of course there are most

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.730 
ground and of course there are most
radical<00:04:10.320> solutions<00:04:10.890> do<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:11.940> introduce<00:04:12.740> some

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
radical solutions do you introduce some

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.840 
radical solutions do you introduce some
form<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.130> facial<00:04:14.490> chest

mister random chest to kill the open eye
I<00:04:19.470> come<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.100> surprised<00:04:20.489> if<00:04:20.700> eventually<00:04:21.740> some

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
I come to surprised if eventually some

at<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.460> highest<00:05:05.669> level<00:05:06.090> can<00:05:06.300> be<00:05:06.419> very<00:05:06.570> direct

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
at the highest level can be very direct
