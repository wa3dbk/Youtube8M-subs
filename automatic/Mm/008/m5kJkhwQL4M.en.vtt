00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.480
 x.com enemy unknown one of the best 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.010
 videogame reboots to always do access 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.750
 games had indeed managed to propose 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.580
 an exciting turn-based strategy 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.440
 challenging strong of a beautiful 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.660
 atmosphere and game mechanics 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.220
 practically unassailable is not a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.470
 perfect game but from that fall of 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.059
 2012 to date, fans of the genre 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.350
 they couldn't wait to have it in their hands 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.570
 a real sequel 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.370
 well x.com two is not only expected to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.320
 November on PC but the three recently 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.030
 concluded it will do xvi showed one 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.160
 ten minute demo he sent in 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.510
 ecstasy more than a fan you can't 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.430
 judge a similar game by a short one 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.079
 summary of gameplay but what was seen in los 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.120
 angeles did jump to anyway 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.680
 a thousand lives towards this sequel and not 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.329
 could be otherwise when talking 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.670
 of x.com in the demo version 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.530
 introduced by jake solomon to make axis 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.450
 let's check some members of what is 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.560
 left of the x.com team that mental 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.030
 after the failure of the first episode 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.950
 with the aliens who took the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.899
 control of our planet is reduced 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.790
 a small group of armed resistance e 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.140
 avenger in this mission the purpose is 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.910
 destroy a statue during a 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.680
 celebratory day to remember the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.330
 victory of aliens over humans e 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.130
 compared to the predecessor three years ago 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.420
 as early as the knicks com2 the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.670
 narrative cut is much more 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.069
 In fact, the film casine 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.179
 they often break into gameplay 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.800
 emphasizing some crucial moments 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.720
 or more simply to break up a little 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.850
 rhythm also the introduction to 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.860
 fighting appears to be more careful and to 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.929
 axis has promised that every mission will have 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 his precise narrative background in 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.289
 so as to create a more game mode 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.149
 intriguing detailed on the slope 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.920
 graph with fair access that has opted 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.840
 once again for the real engine 3 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.729
 no particular details are found 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.590
 news if not the most attention 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.360
 the destructibility of the environment and rag 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.830
 more cured doll must also be said that from 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.959
 we did not expect this view 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.670
 who knows what it is definitely not going to be 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.440
 the graphic one the gaming sector that 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.270
 will give the greatest satisfaction 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.860
 the gameplay with the classic shifts and the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.020
 shift indicators looks like instead 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.920
 even more solid than in the past 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.780
 notice more attention 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.520
 to the stealth element and a more rhythm 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.740
 maybe tightened even for small ones 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.270
 size of the new one should be proposed 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.280
 ranger class personified by one 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.140
 katana contact fighter will be 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.880
 perfect for close quarters and 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.740
 it is not a coincidence that it is the ranger a 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.660
 make out in a viper head-on collision 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.060
 the fearsome alien those marked 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.800
 of a very fast and lethal snake in 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.930
 able to kill with one attack 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.700
 viper represents the other novelty of the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.340
 play and immediately make it clear how 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.660
 things will stay x2 will continue indeed 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.540
 be a difficult and demanding title 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.800
 as traditionally, enemies like these 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.840
 they clearly demonstrate it 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.580
 to tell the truth about the end of the demo 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.020
 a mac and another one also appeared 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.270
 particularly ugly and bad alien 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.230
 but it all ended before seeing it in 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.610
 action 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.260
 we also welcomed the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.970
 graham hill drone able to hack 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.590
 an enemy turret and to turn the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.240
 fire on the advent of the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.410
 Mixed attacks with rifles and grenades are 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.780
 then always a pretty sight 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.430
 and also here as in the previous chapter 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.980
 our team members can be 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.450
 seriously injured or killed in both 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.130
 cases we can collect from the ground and 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.410
 organize a draw to bring 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.970
 safe or if they died to recover them 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.380
 weapons and equipment that otherwise 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.450
 they would be lost forever 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.280
 other good news is the presence of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.410
 randomly generated maps instead of 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.880
 the fixed ones of x.com enemy unknown ma 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.800
 among the other details that emerged during the course 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.080
 e3 let axis also announced one 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.460
 one-on-one multiplayer mode 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.320
 official support for fashion from 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.760
 share on steam workshop e 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.380
 of course the possibility of 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.300
 modify potential armor weapons 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.010
 in the avenger base 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.900
 to be honest the things to discover are 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.209
 still many but if as you have 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.520
 adored x.com is neither my grandmother you can not 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.760
 do not wait with anxiety and trepidation 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.760
 x.com 2
