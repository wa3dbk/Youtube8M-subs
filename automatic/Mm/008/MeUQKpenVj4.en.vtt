I'm going to be showing you the proper
way<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.609> do<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:28.130> our<00:00:29.130> materials<00:00:29.519> are

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
way to do it so our materials are

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.150 
way to do it so our materials are
elastic<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:34.620> petite<00:00:35.070> paper<00:00:35.340> beads<00:00:37.160> silver

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
elastic the petite paper beads silver

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.819 
elastic the petite paper beads silver
spacers<00:00:39.050> glue<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.469> bead<00:00:41.430> stopper<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.829> your

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
spacers glue a bead stopper and your

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.910 
spacers glue a bead stopper and your
flush<00:00:44.160> cutter<00:00:44.520> or<00:00:44.789> scissors<00:00:45.750> will<00:00:46.260> work<00:00:46.530> for

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
flush cutter or scissors will work for

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.229 
flush cutter or scissors will work for
this<00:00:47.010> project<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:49.280> first<00:00:50.280> thing<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.700> need<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> do

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
this project so first thing I need to do

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.069 
this project so first thing I need to do
is<00:00:51.690> put<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.739> bead<00:00:53.640> stopper<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> make

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
is put in your bead stopper just to make

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.010 
is put in your bead stopper just to make
sure<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:56.280> your<00:00:56.579> beads<00:00:56.969> does<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.629> fall<00:00:57.989> off

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
sure that your beads does not fall off

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.880 
sure that your beads does not fall off
from<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.890> elastic<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.739> start

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
from your elastic so now we can start

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.649 
from your elastic so now we can start
stringing<00:01:02.780> my<00:01:03.780> pattern<00:01:04.350> will<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.790> paper

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
stringing my pattern will be one paper

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:17.779 
stringing my pattern will be one paper
bead<00:01:08.030> one<00:01:09.710> spacer<00:01:12.860> paper<00:01:13.860> bead

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.960 

spacer

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.240 

a<00:01:24.060> paper<00:01:24.780> bead<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:27.780> spacer<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.070> will

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
a paper bead and a spacer and you will

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.750 
a paper bead and a spacer and you will
continue<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.120> do<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.630> until<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:32.040> your

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
continue to do that until you have your

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.830 
continue to do that until you have your
desired<00:01:32.930> length<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.290> bracelet<00:01:34.980> I<00:01:35.480> figure<00:01:36.480> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
desired length of bracelet I figure that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.330 
desired length of bracelet I figure that
you<00:01:37.020> would<00:01:37.170> need<00:01:37.380> about<00:01:38.180> 17<00:01:39.200> feet<00:01:40.200> paper<00:01:40.860> beads

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
you would need about 17 feet paper beads

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.800 
you would need about 17 feet paper beads
to<00:01:42.060> make<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.630> seven<00:01:43.020> inch<00:01:43.400> elastic<00:01:44.400> bracelet<00:01:45.060> so

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
to make a seven inch elastic bracelet so

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.400 
to make a seven inch elastic bracelet so
then<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.260> just<00:01:46.470> continue<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:50.930> now<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.380> have

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
then you just continue on now we have

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.080 
then you just continue on now we have
strung<00:01:53.270> sixteen<00:01:54.270> beads<00:01:55.200> paper<00:01:55.860> beads<00:01:56.250> I'm

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
to take out this topper and you would

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.120 
to take out this topper and you would
simply<00:02:18.060> want<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.750> tie<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:20.420> double<00:02:21.420> knot<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.560> to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.710 
not our first right over left and then
left<00:02:29.190> over<00:02:29.880> right<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:31.190> then<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.519> would<00:02:32.820> tie

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
left over right and then you would tie

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.520

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.830 
tight
now<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:46.110> finish<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.739> project<00:02:47.329> you<00:02:48.329> will<00:02:48.510> take

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
now to finish the project you will take

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.720 
now to finish the project you will take
your<00:02:49.200> juiced<00:02:49.530> hypo<00:02:50.040> cement<00:02:50.220> glue<00:02:52.430> what's<00:02:53.430> nice

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
your juiced hypo cement glue what's nice

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.339 
your juiced hypo cement glue what's nice
about<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:54.480> glue<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.290> has<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:56.930> needle<00:02:57.930> point

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
about this glue it has a needle point

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.460 
about this glue it has a needle point
tip<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.549> would<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.909> so<00:03:00.150> perfect<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:00.870> getting

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
tip that would be so perfect for getting

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.289 
tip that would be so perfect for getting
into<00:03:01.650> tight<00:03:02.010> places<00:03:02.400> like<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:04.939> I'll<00:03:05.939> make

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
into tight places like this so I'll make

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.380 
into tight places like this so I'll make
sure<00:03:06.629> that<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:08.549> elastic<00:03:09.329> knot<00:03:09.629> gets<00:03:10.409> the<00:03:10.709> glue

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
sure that the elastic knot gets the glue

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.289 
sure that the elastic knot gets the glue
and<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:12.659> you<00:03:13.470> would<00:03:13.650> leave<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.159> there<00:03:14.760> for

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
and then you would leave it there for

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.420 
and then you would leave it there for
about<00:03:16.310> five<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:18.090> ten<00:03:18.359> minutes<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:19.049> dry<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
about five to ten minutes to dry and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.020 
about five to ten minutes to dry and
make<00:03:20.639> sure<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.540> glue<00:03:21.780> has<00:03:22.079> set<00:03:22.109> in<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.790> will

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
make sure the glue has set in you will

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:34.680 
make sure the glue has set in you will
then<00:03:24.389> cut<00:03:24.780> your<00:03:24.810> elastic<00:03:30.230> size

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.860 

and<00:03:35.500> then<00:03:37.020> the<00:03:38.070> whole<00:03:39.070> of<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.820> paper<00:03:40.120> bead<00:03:40.540> is

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
and then the whole of the paper bead is

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.070 
and then the whole of the paper bead is
big<00:03:41.230> enough<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.950> accommodate<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.840> knot

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
big enough to accommodate the knot

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
big enough to accommodate the knot
