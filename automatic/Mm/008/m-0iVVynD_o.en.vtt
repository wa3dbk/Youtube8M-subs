but<00:00:36.480> after<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.960> try<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.320> make<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> novels

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
but after that I try to make the novels

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.970 
but after that I try to make the novels
as<00:00:38.219> different<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.969> possibly<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
as different as I possibly can and it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.799 
as different as I possibly can and it
had<00:00:41.100> been<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> long<00:00:41.520> time<00:00:41.850> since<00:00:41.879> I'd<00:00:42.329> added<00:00:42.719> an

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
had been a long time since I'd added an

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
had been a long time since I'd added an
element<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.350> danger<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.250> novels<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.730> hadn't

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
element of danger to my novels I hadn't

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.180 
element of danger to my novels I hadn't
done<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.210> since<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.289> Guardian<00:00:46.800> which<00:00:46.950> came

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
done that since the Guardian which came

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.459 
done that since the Guardian which came
out<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:47.640> 10<00:00:47.910> years<00:00:48.149> ago<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> thought<00:00:49.320> it

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
out about 10 years ago so I thought it

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.439 
out about 10 years ago so I thought it
was<00:00:49.559> time<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> add<00:00:50.100> an<00:00:50.250> element<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.730> danger<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
was time to add an element of danger and

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.529 
was time to add an element of danger and
it<00:00:52.320> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> makes<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.399> want<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it kind of makes what you want to do and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.470 
it kind of makes what you want to do and
start<00:00:55.110> throwing<00:00:55.379> ideas<00:00:55.710> together<00:00:56.340> pull<00:00:57.180> from

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
start throwing ideas together pull from

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090
