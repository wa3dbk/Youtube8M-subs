00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.760
 To write a script setting 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.740
 Contact need to understand the main thing - the goal. 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.050
 The purpose of your visit and making contact. 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.409
 And the script for writing any stage begins with 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.119
 that we are formulating a goal. 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.080
 Before you write a script you need to formulate a goal. 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.400
 your visit and why you should contact. 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.100
 It should be in smart format. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.750
 Our goal is not just to talk and make contact. 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.650
 A specific result. and this result is not that 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.780

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.829
 actions. 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.840
 But you need to understand what actions he should take. 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.259
 To achieve this goal you need to make contact. 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.909
 and solve a number of problems. 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:31.009
 You need to understand what is smart. 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.189
 And we have achieved the goal or not. 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:47.850
 There is a criterion for the completion of the stage. 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:03:14.400
 What is the criterion for the completion of the establishment 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:42.510
 contact. 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:04:03.230
 Getting commitments from the client.
