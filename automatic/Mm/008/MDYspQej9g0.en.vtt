00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.339 

the<00:00:06.000> original<00:00:06.419> idea<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:06.750> these<00:00:06.990> paintings

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:07.349 
the original idea for these paintings

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:09.200 
the original idea for these paintings
was<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.529> thought<00:00:07.769> I<00:00:07.830> would<00:00:08.040> make<00:00:08.219> them<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.639> would

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
was I thought I would make them I would

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.369 
was I thought I would make them I would
make<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> painting<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.959> parting<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.350> the

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.379 
make a painting of the parting of the

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.259 
make a painting of the parting of the
Red<00:00:10.590> Sea

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
Red Sea

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.140 
Red Sea
you<00:00:12.840> know<00:00:12.930> when<00:00:13.260> Moses<00:00:13.830> well<00:00:14.219> when<00:00:14.369> God<00:00:14.549> parts

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
you know when Moses well when God parts

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.750 
you know when Moses well when God parts
the<00:00:15.299> Red<00:00:15.449> Sea<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.130> I've<00:00:17.130> made<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> couple<00:00:17.580> of

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the Red Sea and I've made a couple of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.820 
the Red Sea and I've made a couple of
things<00:00:18.090> since<00:00:18.300> then<00:00:18.480> there<00:00:18.660> was<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:18.869> there

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
things since then there was this there

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.189 
things since then there was this there
was<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.039> big<00:00:20.609> flood<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.119> New<00:00:21.240> Orleans<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.900> in

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
was this big flood in New Orleans and in

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.829 
was this big flood in New Orleans and in
the<00:00:22.349> United<00:00:22.679> States<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.509> happened<00:00:24.509> actually

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:24.839 
the United States that happened actually

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.649 
the United States that happened actually
after<00:00:25.169> the<00:00:25.259> first<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.999> but<00:00:26.999> I<00:00:27.060> began<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.419> start

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:27.659 
after the first one but I began to start

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.349 
after the first one but I began to start
thinking<00:00:27.989> of<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.320> idea<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.609> flood<00:00:29.909> or<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
thinking of this idea of a flood or the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.850 
thinking of this idea of a flood or the
the<00:00:31.259> end<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.619> everything<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:33.440> how<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.500> end<00:00:34.739> of

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the end of everything and how the end of

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.340 
the end of everything and how the end of
everything<00:00:35.280> would<00:00:35.460> probably<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:36.290> you<00:00:37.290> know

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
everything would probably be you know

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
everything would probably be you know
quite<00:00:37.590> beautiful<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.400> some<00:00:38.640> ways<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.690> this

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
quite beautiful in some ways it's this

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.420 
quite beautiful in some ways it's this
idea<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.290> making<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:40.830> you're<00:00:40.980> most

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
idea of like making what you're most

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.940 
idea of like making what you're most
afraid<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.510> beautiful<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.290> possible

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
afraid of as beautiful as possible

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.850 
afraid of as beautiful as possible
and<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:45.720> here<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.080> like<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.260> make<00:00:46.530> these

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and it here we like to make these

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.060 
and it here we like to make these
paintings<00:00:47.160> on-site<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.800> for<00:00:49.800> them<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
paintings on-site because for them to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.620 
paintings on-site because for them to
really<00:00:50.250> work<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.700> need<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.880> see<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.420> space

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
really work you need to see the space

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.090 
really work you need to see the space
that<00:00:51.900> they're<00:00:52.050> gonna<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.380> in<00:00:52.560> and<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> things

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
that they're gonna be in and the things

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.440 
that they're gonna be in and the things
around<00:00:53.220> them<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:53.970> like<00:00:54.150> they're<00:00:54.330> not

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
around them you know like they're not

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.470 
around them you know like they're not
they're<00:00:55.230> not<00:00:55.410> meant<00:00:56.310> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.550> context-free

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
they're not meant to be context-free

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.320 
they're not meant to be context-free
they're<00:00:57.990> meant<00:00:58.200> to<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:59.190> specific<00:01:00.060> places

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
they're meant to be in specific places

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.960 
they're meant to be in specific places
because<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:01.590> angles<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.130> things<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
because the the angles and things you

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.340 
because the the angles and things you
have<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.210> play<00:01:03.360> off<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> architecture<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
have to play off the architecture and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.929 
have to play off the architecture and
what's<00:01:04.500> around<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.509> and<00:01:06.509> so<00:01:07.020> today<00:01:07.350> we'll<00:01:07.560> be

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
what's around you and so today we'll be

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.430 
what's around you and so today we'll be
doing<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.150> second<00:01:09.540> pour<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.140> painting

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
doing the second pour on this painting

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.790 
doing the second pour on this painting
so<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:12.270> idea<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.140> being<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.530> flood

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
so the idea of like this being a flood

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.590 
so the idea of like this being a flood
like<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.490> might<00:01:14.760> look<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:14.940> an<00:01:15.180> abstraction

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
like it might look like an abstraction

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.570 
like it might look like an abstraction
but<00:01:15.870> in<00:01:16.020> my<00:01:16.140> opinion<00:01:16.260> it<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.159> pretty<00:01:17.340> good

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
but in my opinion it it's a pretty good

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.180 
but in my opinion it it's a pretty good
attempt<00:01:18.120> at<00:01:18.390> making<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.380> painting<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> end

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
attempt at making a painting of the end

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.760 
attempt at making a painting of the end
of<00:01:20.510> everything<00:01:21.510> you<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.740> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
of everything you know it's like so I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.940 
of everything you know it's like so I
see<00:01:23.340> these<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.360> pictures<00:01:24.780> not<00:01:25.590> not

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
see these as more like pictures not not

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.440 
see these as more like pictures not not
so<00:01:26.190> much<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.520> abstractions

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
so much as abstractions

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.660 
so much as abstractions
we're<00:01:28.320> actually<00:01:28.440> flooding<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.100> canvas<00:01:29.520> you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
we're actually flooding the canvas you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.640 
we're actually flooding the canvas you
know<00:01:29.729> there's<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.000> sort<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.330> realism<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.320> I

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
know there's a sort of realism to it I

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.730 
know there's a sort of realism to it I
think<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:32.550> that's<00:01:33.479> why<00:01:33.870> I<00:01:33.900> used<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.380> much<00:01:34.500> red

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
think and that's why I used so much red

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.550 
think and that's why I used so much red
paint<00:01:35.040> too<00:01:35.190> because<00:01:35.430> red<00:01:36.140> red<00:01:37.140> paint<00:01:37.409> it's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
paint too because red red paint it's

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.289 
paint too because red red paint it's
hard<00:01:37.799> not<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.280> red<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:38.760> blood

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
hard not to see red as blood

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300 
hard not to see red as blood
you<00:01:39.540> know<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:40.020> red<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.440> almost<00:01:40.650> always<00:01:40.950> bad

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you know like red is almost always bad

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.740 
you know like red is almost always bad
and<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.950> what's<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.520> great<00:01:44.700> about<00:01:44.760> red<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.450> it's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
and so what's so great about red is it's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.070 
and so what's so great about red is it's
like<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.740> color<00:01:47.010> but<00:01:47.370> it's<00:01:47.520> also<00:01:48.080> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
like it's a color but it's also the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.190 
like it's a color but it's also the
contents<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.710> our<00:01:49.920> bodies<00:01:50.670> too<00:01:51.270> at<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> same

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
contents of our bodies too at the same

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.580 
contents of our bodies too at the same
time<00:01:52.440> so<00:01:53.340> blood<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.240> paint<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.170> idea<00:01:55.500> is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
time so blood and paint that the idea is

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.870 
time so blood and paint that the idea is
to<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.860> rid<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.190> distinction<00:01:56.700> between

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
to get rid of the distinction between

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.580 
to get rid of the distinction between
those<00:01:57.210> two<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.750> well<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.760> then<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.080> mean<00:02:01.350> and

those two as well and then I mean and

those two as well and then I mean and
then<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.159> know<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> other<00:02:02.670> sort<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
then you know the other sort of

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.230 
then you know the other sort of

I I just when I saw that painting I all
of<00:02:20.579> a<00:02:20.640> sudden<00:02:20.909> realize<00:02:21.030> that's<00:02:21.329> like<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
of a sudden realize that's like the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.289 
of a sudden realize that's like the
experience<00:02:22.469> of<00:02:22.769> seeing<00:02:23.040> red<00:02:23.340> it's<00:02:23.609> a<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:24.209> a

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
experience of seeing red it's a it's a

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.910 
experience of seeing red it's a it's a
visceral<00:02:24.599> thing<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.469> know<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.709> doesn't

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
visceral thing you know it doesn't

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.129 
visceral thing you know it doesn't
matter<00:02:26.099> if<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.579> red<00:02:26.819> stop<00:02:27.299> sign<00:02:27.329> or<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.870> red

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.139 
matter if it's a red stop sign or a red

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.709

bird or it always means like look at me

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.589 
bird or it always means like look at me
and<00:02:31.790> usually<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:32.939> natural<00:02:33.299> world<00:02:33.389> it

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
and usually in the natural world it

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.080 
and usually in the natural world it
means<00:02:33.749> something<00:02:34.230> dangerous<00:02:34.790> was<00:02:35.790> just<00:02:35.939> kind

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
means something dangerous was just kind

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.459 
means something dangerous was just kind
of<00:02:36.120> interesting<00:02:36.299> because<00:02:36.930> everybody's

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
of interesting because everybody's

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.610 
of interesting because everybody's
filled<00:02:37.709> with<00:02:37.859> red<00:02:38.099> somehow<00:02:39.409> it's<00:02:40.409> interesting

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
filled with red somehow it's interesting

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.289 
filled with red somehow it's interesting
we<00:02:40.859> should<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.099> have<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.430> same<00:02:41.609> color<00:02:42.000> blood

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
we should all have the same color blood

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.250 
we should all have the same color blood
you<00:02:42.629> know<00:02:43.819> but<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:45.060> began<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.810> start<00:02:45.930> thinking

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
you know but I began to start thinking

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110 
you know but I began to start thinking
of<00:02:46.379> these<00:02:46.469> paintings<00:02:46.769> is<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.219> reverse

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
of these paintings is like reverse

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.149 
of these paintings is like reverse
Barnett<00:02:48.629> Newman's<00:02:49.019> like<00:02:49.260> Barnett<00:02:49.680> Newman<00:02:50.010> and

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
Barnett Newman's like Barnett Newman and

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.309 
Barnett Newman's like Barnett Newman and
backwards<00:02:50.669> so<00:02:51.389> I<00:02:51.419> called<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.019> painting<00:02:52.260> in

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
backwards so I called this painting in

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.839 
backwards so I called this painting in
the<00:02:52.379> other<00:02:52.530> way<00:02:52.739> he<00:02:53.069> has<00:02:53.189> all<00:02:53.400> these<00:02:53.549> paintings

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
the other way he has all these paintings

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.300 
the other way he has all these paintings
with<00:02:54.150> these<00:02:54.930> stripes<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.469> he<00:02:55.530> calls<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.040> way

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
with these stripes that he calls the way

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.569 
with these stripes that he calls the way
and<00:02:56.959> this<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.139> other<00:02:58.379> it's<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.159> other<00:02:59.280> way

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
and this is the other it's the other way

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:06.259 
and this is the other it's the other way
it's<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.939> reverse<00:03:00.299> of<00:03:00.919> Barnett<00:03:01.919> Newman<00:03:05.269> I'm

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
it's the reverse of Barnett Newman I'm

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.409 
it's the reverse of Barnett Newman I'm
not<00:03:06.599> as<00:03:06.810> pessimistic<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:08.340> think<00:03:08.760> as<00:03:08.909> many

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
not as pessimistic I think as many

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:15.649 
not as pessimistic I think as many
people<00:03:09.840> are<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:12.409> just<00:03:13.409> think<00:03:14.569> we're<00:03:15.569> gonna

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
people are I just think we're gonna

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.509 
people are I just think we're gonna
happen<00:03:16.019> there's<00:03:16.349> gonna<00:03:16.739> be<00:03:16.919> some<00:03:17.129> bad<00:03:17.250> things

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
happen there's gonna be some bad things

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.189 
happen there's gonna be some bad things
before<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.030> get<00:03:18.209> back<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.449> some<00:03:18.780> good<00:03:18.959> things

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
before we get back to some good things

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.039 
before we get back to some good things
again<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.739> mean<00:03:20.639> we<00:03:20.730> we've<00:03:21.480> got<00:03:21.629> these<00:03:21.810> rising

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
again I mean we we've got these rising

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.679 
again I mean we we've got these rising
oceans<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.739> we<00:03:22.829> just<00:03:23.310> lost<00:03:23.519> an<00:03:23.759> entire<00:03:24.060> city

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:24.689 
oceans and we just lost an entire city

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.360 
oceans and we just lost an entire city
and<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.169> the<00:03:25.379> United<00:03:25.650> States<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:26.129> know<00:03:26.159> it's

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
and in the United States you know it's

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.830 
and in the United States you know it's
like<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.579> could<00:03:26.790> that's<00:03:27.060> real<00:03:27.389> like<00:03:27.629> I<00:03:27.720> could

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
like I could that's real like I could

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.869 
like I could that's real like I could
see<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.229> happening<00:03:28.739> but<00:03:29.340> there's<00:03:29.549> like<00:03:29.729> you

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
see that happening but there's like you

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.939 
see that happening but there's like you
know<00:03:29.909> there's<00:03:30.180> more<00:03:30.359> room<00:03:30.629> inside<00:03:31.169> you<00:03:31.829> know

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
know there's more room inside you know

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.129 
know there's more room inside you know
and<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.459> lot<00:03:33.299> of<00:03:33.329> my<00:03:33.479> colleagues<00:03:33.689> like<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.049> think

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
and a lot of my colleagues like I think

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.249 
and a lot of my colleagues like I think
the<00:03:34.349> reason<00:03:34.620> they're<00:03:34.739> making<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.159> work<00:03:35.400> is

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:36.259 
the reason they're making that work is

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:39.020 
the reason they're making that work is
to<00:03:37.259> draw<00:03:37.409> attention<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.919> it<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.549> we<00:03:38.669> can<00:03:38.819> change

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
to draw attention to it so we can change

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.640 
to draw attention to it so we can change
it<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.419> mean<00:03:39.629> that's<00:03:39.780> already<00:03:40.139> a<00:03:40.290> sort<00:03:40.560> of

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
it I mean that's already a sort of

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.249 
it I mean that's already a sort of
optimism<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.849> know<00:03:42.000> they're<00:03:42.720> making<00:03:43.109> work

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:43.259 
optimism you know they're making work

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:44.749 
optimism you know they're making work
about<00:03:43.379> it<00:03:43.709> if<00:03:43.799> they<00:03:43.889> were<00:03:43.979> really<00:03:44.220> pessimistic

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:44.759 
about it if they were really pessimistic

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.360 
about it if they were really pessimistic
they<00:03:45.359> would<00:03:45.509> they<00:03:46.229> would<00:03:46.379> just<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:47.250> know<00:03:47.340> I

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
they would they would just you know I

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.569 
they would they would just you know I
don't<00:03:47.549> know<00:03:48.829> they<00:03:49.829> wouldn't<00:03:50.099> do<00:03:50.189> anything

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
don't know they wouldn't do anything

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.449 
don't know they wouldn't do anything
they<00:03:50.849> would<00:03:50.939> just<00:03:51.150> sit<00:03:51.329> down<00:03:51.359> right<00:03:53.000> so

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
they would just sit down right so

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.770 
they would just sit down right so
there's<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.819> just<00:03:57.060> think<00:03:57.239> we're<00:03:57.389> at<00:03:57.449> a<00:03:57.509> a

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
there's just I just think we're at a a

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.689 
there's just I just think we're at a a
place<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.439> tipping<00:03:58.769> point<00:03:59.009> as<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.370> would<00:03:59.519> say

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
place the tipping point as I would say

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.939 
place the tipping point as I would say
you<00:03:59.759> know<00:04:00.000> where<00:04:00.209> like<00:04:00.590> there<00:04:01.590> needs<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.859> be

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
you know where like there needs to be

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.969 
you know where like there needs to be
some<00:04:02.219> honest<00:04:02.579> evaluation<00:04:03.259> going<00:04:04.259> on<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.769> a

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
some honest evaluation going on and a

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.089 
some honest evaluation going on and a
lot<00:04:05.759> of<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.000> forces<00:04:06.479> that<00:04:06.509> are<00:04:06.870> at<00:04:07.019> at<00:04:07.620> work<00:04:07.919> in

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
lot of the forces that are at at work in

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.759 
lot of the forces that are at at work in
our<00:04:08.189> lives<00:04:09.019> are<00:04:10.019> interested<00:04:10.500> in<00:04:10.590> having

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
our lives are interested in having

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.770 
our lives are interested in having
things<00:04:11.069> stay<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.310> same<00:04:11.509> well<00:04:12.509> I<00:04:12.540> mean<00:04:12.659> I've

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
things stay the same well I mean I've

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.420 
things stay the same well I mean I've
always<00:04:13.169> sort<00:04:13.379> of<00:04:13.439> saw<00:04:13.739> these<00:04:13.949> as<00:04:14.099> almost<00:04:14.340> like

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
always sort of saw these as almost like

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.870 
always sort of saw these as almost like
men<00:04:14.759> menstruation<00:04:15.539> paintings<00:04:16.169> in<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.380> way<00:04:16.530> like

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
men menstruation paintings in a way like

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.939 
men menstruation paintings in a way like
it's<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.030> washing<00:04:18.419> away<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.659> you<00:04:19.469> know<00:04:19.590> it's<00:04:19.829> a

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
it's the washing away of you know it's a

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.450 
it's the washing away of you know it's a
sort<00:04:20.159> of<00:04:20.750> it's<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:22.049> know<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.680> sort<00:04:22.919> of<00:04:22.979> end<00:04:23.250> of

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
sort of it's you know the sort of end of

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.310 
sort of it's you know the sort of end of
we<00:04:23.940> need<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.180> have<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.479> end<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.750> one<00:04:24.960> thing<00:04:25.139> so

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
we need to have the end of one thing so

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.120 
we need to have the end of one thing so
we<00:04:25.409> can<00:04:25.560> have<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.159> new<00:04:26.310> thing<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:27.690> know<00:04:28.130> which

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
we can have the new thing you know which

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.460 
we can have the new thing you know which
is<00:04:29.250> sort<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.840> radical<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.020> I'm<00:04:31.080> probably

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
is sort of radical and I'm probably

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.380 
is sort of radical and I'm probably
some<00:04:31.800> lists<00:04:32.040> in<00:04:32.280> America<00:04:32.760> for<00:04:32.970> saying<00:04:33.180> that

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
some lists in America for saying that

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.000 
some lists in America for saying that
but<00:04:35.330> but<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.900> tends<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.350> be<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.650> way<00:04:37.740> things

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
but but it tends to be the way things

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.640 
but but it tends to be the way things
work<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.310> know
