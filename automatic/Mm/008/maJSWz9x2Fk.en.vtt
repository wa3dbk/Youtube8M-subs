00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.540

 ringo be in luck a little more subdued because it is lesbian the finishing of 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.710

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 Street 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.170
 after the success of music games in recent years 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.520
 the monographic episodes dedicated to a single group have become one 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.850
 more or less frequent custom 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.460
 the concept but you've always been to develop the mechanics to the extreme 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.119
 typically the genre accords by approaching the careful large-caliber looking 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.420
 to convince the many fans to buy these titles out of love and passion 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.370
 coming the possibility to manage the rights of the catalog of 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.960
 beatles however the mission of harmonix could not be only that of 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.820
 produce yet another single-fired title but could be the first step to 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.039
 mark a path that other games will probably follow 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.040
 leave the solos impossible at full speed 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.230
 to put on track enjoyable songs aunt singing that playing by 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.230

 get everything you need to enjoy the beatles rock at home 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.249
 band and requires both a bit of space given that between bass guitar and drums 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.810
 microphone space occupied the remarkable that some money those needed for 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.809
 buy one of the two bandols available on the market 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.029
 what is held in return is a collection of some of the most famous songs 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:21.270
 of the history of the beatles 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.380
 organized chronologically with a painstaking work that starts from 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.710
 impeccable graphics of the 4 spare musicians are different 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.880
 fashion crossings in career years 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.900
 up to a series of images and films with a bed of collected collections 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.980
 by the surviving protagonists 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.690
 2 Unlock all the photos and movies you need to get the most out of the stars 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.400
 5 in the execution of each song of the story mode singing while playing 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.159
 any tool even at the lowest difficulty level while yes 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.959
 retrace the steps of Bergamo, unfortunately there are the challenges that other things 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.180
 are not that the seven of songs already present in the career but that it dances 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.159
 alone you all out of breath 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.129
 the songs certainly don't require a commitment to Roman to be 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.569
 domesticated and those who are able to finish any rocco bento 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.019
 tiberino at the expert level will be able to finish the beatles at a more level 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.550
 difficult on the first pass 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.700
 with the maximum of the stars without too much difficulty and save then to devote to the 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.700
 achievement of all objectives and trophies 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.110
 obviously not all that glitters is gold 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.720
 and the beatles rock band is no exception since it is not possible to access the 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.270
 vast repertoire of tracks from the rock band circuit 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.550
 and that therefore you can only buy pieces from the liverpool band 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.720
 moreover the 45 songs available are less than those that usually are 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.810
 they get by buying such games besides the lack of all those chioni 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.479
 concerning the creation of the character and this of guitars objects 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.430
 to balance everything in terms of longevity 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.060
 there are the usual online modes and above all the possibility of 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.150
 connect up to three tray microphones to allow singing windows of 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.190
 engage with the main harmonies of the voice rather than with the choirs ei 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.190
 controcanti 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.439
 hahaha 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.439
 there 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:52.350
 while the series' secretarial hours remain anchored 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.930
 the beatles rock band manages to be perfect from an artistic point of view 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.999
 the fab four is not surprised by the detail of the public 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:05.480
 but it stuns the incredible. you have to create the physical features of the quartet 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.480
 perfectly in line with their historic stylistic evolution 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:13.339
 and the same can be said for all the scenarios created by art 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.989
 from the second half of the game but from psychedelic e-dictionary references 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.360
 applauding piously bal audio audio perfect quality level with all 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.689
 the songs that are tiscali bikes 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.150
 certainly many will vote for sensational absences but on the other hand 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.150
 how to entice otherwise the purchase of future downloadable content 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.500
 elms 

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:56.639
 Hello 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.460
 email 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.639
 gazzetta the beatles rock band is the first of the musical games to assign the 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.479
 natural evolution of the entertainment theme that will have the 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.919
 possibility of finally supplanting carrots from ipad and well 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.419
 living rooms of half the world 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:16.259
 of course we must love this music but it always whistles the melodies of the 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:19.439
 liverpool quartet you will find a small encyclopedia in your hands 

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.620
 interactive full of curiosity 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.649
 as well as a game packaged almost perfectly 

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:28.649
 if we exclude the trophies, the most complicated goals are the virtuosos of 

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:32.109
 plastic guitar to the avant-garde drummers indian the game becomes 

00:07:32.109 --> 00:07:35.359
 expert in the blink of an eye but probably not for them 

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:38.359
 the beatles rock band was created cost 

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:43.020
 the
