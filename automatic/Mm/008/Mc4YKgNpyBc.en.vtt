00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:13.209 
fighting division I just felt in my own

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:16.649

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the point where I felt confident in

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.870

Taiji<00:01:19.930> most<00:01:20.409> people<00:01:20.740> think<00:01:20.950> oh<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.490> can't<00:01:21.700> be<00:01:21.790> a

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
Taiji most people think oh it can't be a

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.100 
Taiji most people think oh it can't be a
fighting<00:01:22.270> art<00:01:22.450> because<00:01:22.600> it's<00:01:22.750> not<00:01:22.900> very

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
fighting art because it's not very

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.149 
fighting art because it's not very
vigorous<00:01:23.619> training<00:01:23.920> forms<00:01:24.880> but<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.900> idea<00:01:26.860> is

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
vigorous training forms but the idea is

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.370 
vigorous training forms but the idea is
that<00:01:27.460> we're<00:01:27.610> training<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.180> presence<00:01:28.930> of<00:01:29.110> mind

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
that we're training a presence of mind

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.440 
that we're training a presence of mind
just<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.860> be<00:01:30.070> there<00:01:30.369> not<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.970> overextend

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
just to be there not to overextend

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.420 
just to be there not to overextend
ourselves<00:01:31.960> into<00:01:32.560> what<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.830> opponent<00:01:33.340> is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
ourselves into what the opponent is

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.499 
ourselves into what the opponent is
doing<00:01:33.610> or<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:35.590> run<00:01:36.039> away<00:01:36.220> but<00:01:37.030> rather<00:01:37.240> just

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
doing or to to run away but rather just

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.700 
doing or to to run away but rather just
to<00:01:37.659> be<00:01:37.960> where<00:01:38.799> you're<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.210> it's<00:01:41.110> quite<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.380> a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
to be where you're and it's quite a a

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.609

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
something like that because no matter

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.379 
something like that because no matter
how<00:03:18.799> long<00:03:19.069> you've<00:03:19.310> done<00:03:19.549> it<00:03:19.730> there's<00:03:20.000> more<00:03:20.239> to

interesting<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:25.389> makes<00:03:26.620> very<00:03:27.620> good

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
interesting it makes very good

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.559 
interesting it makes very good
circulation<00:03:28.939> so<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.139> increases<00:03:30.730> health<00:03:31.730> for

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
circulation so it increases health for

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.050 
circulation so it increases health for
that<00:03:32.750> reason<00:03:33.409> and<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:35.510> fun<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.169> do<00:03:36.319> also

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
that reason and it's fun to do also

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.270 
that reason and it's fun to do also
there<00:03:38.060> are<00:03:38.299> many<00:03:38.720> many<00:03:39.200> different<00:03:39.319> styles<00:03:40.129> of

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
teachers and so there are three two

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.430 
teachers and so there are three two
basic<00:03:49.669> groups<00:03:49.849> that<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.299> see<00:03:50.540> right<00:03:50.900> now<00:03:51.109> and

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
basic groups that you see right now and

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.580 
basic groups that you see right now and
one<00:03:51.680> is<00:03:51.829> young<00:03:52.040> style<00:03:52.459> which<00:03:53.180> is<00:03:53.359> more<00:03:53.829> smooth

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
one is young style which is more smooth

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.640 
one is young style which is more smooth
more<00:03:57.590> expansive<00:03:58.579> motions<00:03:59.510> and<00:03:59.750> then<00:04:00.409> there's

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
more expansive motions and then there's

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.860 
more expansive motions and then there's
a<00:04:00.709> Chen<00:04:01.099> style<00:04:01.340> which<00:04:01.849> is<00:04:02.060> more<00:04:02.799> looks<00:04:03.799> more

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
a Chen style which is more looks more

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.420 
a Chen style which is more looks more
hard<00:04:05.870> more<00:04:07.090> fast<00:04:08.090> explosive<00:04:08.599> movements<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.680> lot

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
hard more fast explosive movements a lot

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.180 
hard more fast explosive movements a lot
of<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.639> time

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.259 

everyone<00:04:14.190> out<00:04:14.370> there<00:04:16.430> may<00:04:17.430> have<00:04:17.700> been<00:04:17.970> doing

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
everyone out there may have been doing

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.750 
everyone out there may have been doing
only<00:04:18.600> those<00:04:18.989> two<00:04:19.260> styles<00:04:19.859> but<00:04:20.100> depending<00:04:20.640> on

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
only those two styles but depending on

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.060 
only those two styles but depending on
how<00:04:21.090> their<00:04:21.420> teacher<00:04:21.810> interpreted<00:04:22.650> them<00:04:22.830> they

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
how their teacher interpreted them they

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.520 
how their teacher interpreted them they
could<00:04:23.340> have<00:04:23.460> looked<00:04:23.670> very<00:04:23.880> different<00:04:24.140> even<00:04:25.140> to

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
could have looked very different even to

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.560 
could have looked very different even to
people<00:04:25.770> doing<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.310> young<00:04:26.460> style<00:04:26.880> could<00:04:27.420> look

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
people doing a young style could look

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.180 
people doing a young style could look
very<00:04:27.630> different<00:04:28.820> every<00:04:29.990> movement<00:04:30.990> in<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.830> Tai

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
very different every movement in the Tai

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.780 
very different every movement in the Tai
Chi<00:04:32.430> form<00:04:33.140> has<00:04:34.140> an<00:04:34.380> application<00:04:35.310> for

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
Chi form has an application for

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.510 
Chi form has an application for
self-defence<00:04:36.660> or<00:04:37.190> for<00:04:38.190> fighting<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
self-defence or for fighting and the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.700 
self-defence or for fighting and the
longer<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.090> person<00:04:42.360> studies<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.230> form<00:04:43.530> and

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
longer a person studies the form and

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.590 
longer a person studies the form and
understands<00:04:44.400> those<00:04:44.520> movements<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:45.330> more

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
understands those movements the more

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.480 
understands those movements the more
they<00:04:46.110> can<00:04:46.350> be<00:04:46.500> applied<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.860> push<00:04:47.250> hands

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
they can be applied to push hands

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.370 
they can be applied to push hands
basically<00:04:50.490> push<00:04:51.450> hands<00:04:51.810> is<00:04:53.270> using<00:04:54.270> your<00:04:55.080> body

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
basically push hands is using your body

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.890 
basically push hands is using your body
with<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.130> least<00:04:56.340> amount<00:04:56.520> of<00:04:56.790> effort<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.690> get

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
with the least amount of effort to get

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.280 
with the least amount of effort to get
the<00:04:58.080> most<00:05:00.650> push<00:05:01.650> out<00:05:01.950> of<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.280> so<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:04.080> learn

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
the most push out of it so you learn

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.100 
the most push out of it so you learn
techniques<00:05:04.980> and<00:05:05.340> learn<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.450> be<00:05:06.570> sensitive<00:05:07.050> to

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
techniques and learn to be sensitive to

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.100 
techniques and learn to be sensitive to
the<00:05:07.590> other<00:05:07.770> person<00:05:08.280> who<00:05:08.430> is<00:05:08.460> your<00:05:08.760> opponent<00:05:09.270> to

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
the other person who is your opponent to

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.340 
the other person who is your opponent to
know<00:05:10.320> when<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:11.520> use<00:05:11.550> those<00:05:12.030> techniques<00:05:12.510> of

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
know when to use those techniques of

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.230 
know when to use those techniques of
learning<00:05:13.860> how<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.190> concentrate<00:05:14.700> your<00:05:15.030> weight

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
learning how to concentrate your weight

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.600 
learning how to concentrate your weight
down<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:16.140> I<00:05:16.680> think<00:05:16.890> has<00:05:17.040> something<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.370> do

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
down and I think has something to do

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.090 
down and I think has something to do
with<00:05:17.790> your<00:05:18.120> with<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:19.020> air<00:05:19.560> that<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:19.919> take

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
with your with the air that you take

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.520 
with your with the air that you take
into<00:05:20.340> your<00:05:20.370> body<00:05:20.669> that<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:21.450> cannot<00:05:21.720> mentally

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
into your body that you cannot mentally

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.650 
into your body that you cannot mentally
direct<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.729> energy<00:05:24.090> because<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.390> believe<00:05:24.630> that

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
direct the energy because I believe that

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.290 
direct the energy because I believe that
air<00:05:24.990> itself<00:05:25.770> is<00:05:25.950> like<00:05:26.160> energy<00:05:26.640> without<00:05:27.180> the

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
air itself is like energy without the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.060 
air itself is like energy without the
air<00:05:27.510> we<00:05:27.630> couldn't<00:05:27.930> live<00:05:28.080> so<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:28.770> could<00:05:28.950> take

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
air we couldn't live so you could take

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.310 
air we couldn't live so you could take
the<00:05:29.130> energy<00:05:29.430> and<00:05:29.820> direct<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.330> low<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:30.900> keep

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
the energy and direct it low and keep

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.440 
the energy and direct it low and keep
your<00:05:31.500> weight<00:05:31.650> down<00:05:31.890> low<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:33.150> build<00:05:33.360> a

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
your weight down low and to build a

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.969 
your weight down low and to build a
route<00:05:33.600> yourself<00:05:33.960> with<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.200> earth<00:05:34.350> because

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
route yourself with the earth because

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.219 
route yourself with the earth because
then<00:05:35.370> in<00:05:35.520> turn<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:35.910> earth<00:05:36.060> works<00:05:36.870> with<00:05:37.080> you

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
then in turn the earth works with you

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.780 
then in turn the earth works with you
and<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.710> energy<00:05:38.070> from<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.340> earth<00:05:38.370> comes

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
and the energy from the earth comes

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.980 
and the energy from the earth comes
throughout<00:05:39.090> your<00:05:39.270> feet<00:05:39.510> throughout<00:05:39.750> your

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
throughout your feet throughout your

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.230 
throughout your feet throughout your
hands<00:05:40.290> you<00:05:41.040> know<00:05:41.070> so<00:05:41.430> it's<00:05:41.580> made<00:05:41.729> to<00:05:41.760> become

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
hands you know so it's made to become

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.230 
hands you know so it's made to become
really<00:05:42.570> rooted<00:05:43.500> and<00:05:43.710> grounded<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.370> the

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
really rooted and grounded to the the

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.000 
really rooted and grounded to the the
earth<00:05:45.360> is<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:45.630> most<00:05:45.750> important<00:05:46.290> thing<00:05:46.440> by

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
earth is the most important thing by

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.780 
earth is the most important thing by
mentally<00:05:47.760> thinking<00:05:48.180> root<00:05:49.280> so<00:05:50.280> it's<00:05:50.400> mostly<00:05:50.640> of

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
mentally thinking root so it's mostly of

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.730 
mentally thinking root so it's mostly of
a<00:05:50.850> mind<00:05:51.150> more<00:05:51.570> concentration<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.290> the<00:05:52.380> mind

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
a mind more concentration of the mind

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.830 
a mind more concentration of the mind
more<00:05:53.340> so<00:05:53.550> than<00:05:53.700> trying<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.240> physically<00:05:54.570> butch

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
more so than trying to physically butch

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.200 
more so than trying to physically butch
yourself
