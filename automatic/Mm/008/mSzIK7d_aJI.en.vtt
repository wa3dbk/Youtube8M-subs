settings<00:04:33.440> as<00:04:33.770> they<00:04:34.010> are<00:04:34.190> it's<00:04:34.850> basically

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
settings as they are it's basically

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.090 
settings as they are it's basically
going<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:35.630> record<00:04:37.060> 192<00:04:38.060> kbps<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:39.020> stereo<00:04:39.770> so

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
going to record 192 kbps and stereo so

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.220 
going to record 192 kbps and stereo so
probably<00:04:40.550> what<00:04:40.730> it's<00:04:40.910> going<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.120> do<00:04:41.270> is<00:04:41.450> 96

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
probably what it's going to do is 96

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.550 
probably what it's going to do is 96
kbps<00:04:42.770> on<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:44.000> right<00:04:44.240> channel<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.020> on<00:04:45.350> the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
kbps on the right channel and on the

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.640 
kbps on the right channel and on the
left<00:04:45.800> channel<00:04:46.130> okay<00:04:47.380> we'll<00:04:48.380> choose<00:04:48.620> ok

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
left channel okay we'll choose ok

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.440 
left channel okay we'll choose ok
another<00:04:51.650> thing<00:04:51.919> here<00:04:52.250> is<00:04:52.460> when<00:04:52.970> we<00:04:53.090> put<00:04:53.300> the

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
another thing here is when we put the

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.040 
another thing here is when we put the
disc<00:04:53.750> in<00:04:54.020> if<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.850> itunes<00:04:55.900> recognizes<00:04:56.900> the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
disc in if the itunes recognizes the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.670 
disc in if the itunes recognizes the
disc<00:04:57.290> it'll<00:04:57.830> automatically<00:04:58.870> set<00:04:59.870> the<00:05:00.020> name<00:05:00.380> of

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
disc it'll automatically set the name of

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.240 
disc it'll automatically set the name of
the<00:05:00.830> file<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:02.180> artist<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.110> album<00:05:03.680> and

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
but if it didn't know what it was it

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.430 
but if it didn't know what it was it
would<00:05:13.729> give<00:05:13.760> us<00:05:13.970> all<00:05:14.330> one<00:05:14.690> two<00:05:14.930> three<00:05:15.200> four

i had a book on tape that I wanted to

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.880 
i had a book on tape that I wanted to
rip<00:05:40.010> I<00:05:40.280> usually<00:05:40.970> join<00:05:41.720> all<00:05:42.110> of<00:05:42.140> the<00:05:42.470> tracks

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
rip I usually join all of the tracks

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.279 
rip I usually join all of the tracks
into<00:05:43.400> one<00:05:45.520> disk<00:05:46.520> so<00:05:46.880> if<00:05:47.030> I<00:05:47.180> click<00:05:47.240> on<00:05:47.660> that<00:05:47.720> to

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
into one disk so if I click on that to

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.700 
into one disk so if I click on that to
join<00:05:48.710> that<00:05:49.520> it<00:05:49.729> basically<00:05:50.000> give<00:05:50.630> me<00:05:50.870> one<00:05:51.260> file

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
join that it basically give me one file

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.820 
join that it basically give me one file
that<00:05:52.580> has<00:05:52.880> all<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.510> different<00:05:53.810> tracks<00:05:54.110> man<00:05:54.410> I

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
that has all the different tracks man I

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.700 
that has all the different tracks man I
want<00:05:55.700> to<00:05:55.789> go<00:05:55.940> back<00:05:55.970> and<00:05:56.210> unjoin<00:05:56.990> those<00:05:57.320> tracks

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
want to go back and unjoin those tracks

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.540 
want to go back and unjoin those tracks
because<00:05:57.979> this

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
because this

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.320 
because this
to<00:05:58.790> be<00:05:58.940> music<00:05:59.420> and<00:06:00.250> click<00:06:01.250> on<00:06:01.400> advanced<00:06:02.120> and

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
to be music and click on advanced and

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.800 
to be music and click on advanced and
say<00:06:02.690> create<00:06:03.140> an<00:06:03.500> mp3<00:06:04.040> version<00:06:04.820> so<00:06:05.630> this<00:06:05.780> is

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
say create an mp3 version so this is

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.330 
say create an mp3 version so this is
going<00:06:06.140> to<00:06:06.200> take<00:06:06.350> a<00:06:06.410> while<00:06:06.530> I'm<00:06:06.920> going<00:06:07.010> to<00:06:07.130> pause

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
going to take a while I'm going to pause

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.610 
going to take a while I'm going to pause
the<00:06:07.640> video<00:06:07.760> or<00:06:08.270> will<00:06:08.450> stop<00:06:08.780> the<00:06:09.020> video<00:06:09.140> and

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
the video or will stop the video and

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.710 
the video or will stop the video and
then<00:06:09.710> we'll<00:06:09.890> show<00:06:10.100> you<00:06:10.130> how<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.550> once<00:06:11.270> we<00:06:11.480> rip

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
then we'll show you how to once we rip

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.350 
then we'll show you how to once we rip
these<00:06:11.900> notice<00:06:12.350> right<00:06:12.530> here<00:06:13.210> faster<00:06:14.210> the

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
these notice right here faster the

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.180 
these notice right here faster the
computer<00:06:14.810> you<00:06:14.990> have<00:06:15.020> the<00:06:15.410> faster<00:06:15.920> it's<00:06:16.100> going

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
computer you have the faster it's going

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.600 
computer you have the faster it's going
to<00:06:16.370> be<00:06:16.490> converting<00:06:17.060> these<00:06:17.240> two<00:06:17.510> mp3's<00:06:18.610> so

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
to be converting these two mp3's so

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.200 
to be converting these two mp3's so
right<00:06:19.880> now<00:06:19.910> it's<00:06:20.420> going<00:06:20.930> at<00:06:21.290> four<00:06:21.880> point<00:06:22.880> six

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
right now it's going at four point six

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.990 
right now it's going at four point six
times<00:06:23.720> that's<00:06:24.200> how<00:06:24.350> fast<00:06:24.710> this<00:06:25.010> cd-rom<00:06:25.460> drive

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
times that's how fast this cd-rom drive

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.020 
times that's how fast this cd-rom drive
is<00:06:26.210> on<00:06:26.420> this<00:06:26.570> notebook<00:06:26.930> computer<00:06:27.790> if<00:06:28.790> you<00:06:28.880> have

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
is on this notebook computer if you have

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.000 
is on this notebook computer if you have
a<00:06:29.060> real<00:06:29.390> fatter<00:06:29.720> might<00:06:30.050> be<00:06:30.200> going<00:06:30.560> in<00:06:30.650> at<00:06:30.800> maybe

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
a real fatter might be going in at maybe

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.450 
a real fatter might be going in at maybe
22<00:06:31.640> times<00:06:32.560> so<00:06:33.560> that's<00:06:33.770> going<00:06:33.980> to<00:06:34.040> take<00:06:34.220> maybe

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
22 times so that's going to take maybe

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.440 
22 times so that's going to take maybe
about<00:06:34.580> 45<00:06:35.510> minutes<00:06:35.800> it<00:06:36.800> will<00:06:36.950> copy<00:06:37.280> these<00:06:37.640> into

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
about 45 minutes it will copy these into

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.510 
about 45 minutes it will copy these into
my<00:06:38.720> library<00:06:39.020> and<00:06:39.680> then<00:06:39.950> we're<00:06:40.040> going<00:06:40.130> to<00:06:40.220> find

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
my library and then we're going to find

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.370 
my library and then we're going to find
them<00:06:40.700> in<00:06:40.820> the<00:06:40.850> library<00:06:41.450> and<00:06:41.690> we're<00:06:42.230> going<00:06:42.350> to

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
them in the library and we're going to

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.100 
them in the library and we're going to
drag<00:06:42.710> and<00:06:42.920> drop<00:06:43.010> the<00:06:43.340> NCI<00:06:43.730> pond<00:06:44.150> ok<00:06:44.690> we'll<00:06:44.930> show

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
drag and drop the NCI pond ok we'll show
