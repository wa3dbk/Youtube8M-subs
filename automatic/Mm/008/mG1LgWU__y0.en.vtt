generally<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.719> must<00:00:49.230> say<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> thing<00:00:49.920> does

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
generally I must say that the thing does

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.830 
generally I must say that the thing does
look<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:50.700> better<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.629> real<00:00:51.809> life

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
look a little bit better in real life

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600 
look a little bit better in real life
than<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.289> does<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> camera<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> camera

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
than it does of on the camera the camera

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.700 
than it does of on the camera the camera
is<00:00:53.789> not<00:00:53.820> doing<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.360> quite<00:00:54.629> hair<00:00:55.020> justice<00:00:55.500> but

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is not doing this quite hair justice but

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.040 
is not doing this quite hair justice but
really<00:00:56.039> nice<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.430> metallic<00:00:57.329> shiny<00:00:57.629> sort<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
really nice of metallic shiny sort of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.380 
really nice of metallic shiny sort of
feel<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.609> go<00:00:59.730> ahead<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.940> open<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
feel to it if we go ahead and open a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.880 
feel to it if we go ahead and open a
couple<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> apps<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.050> believe<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.410> matching

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
couple of apps I believe these matching

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.889 
couple of apps I believe these matching
sort<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.190> no<00:01:02.309> skinning<00:01:02.699> involved<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.300> this

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
sort of no skinning involved in this

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.929 
sort of no skinning involved in this
this<00:01:04.439> theme<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.369> sure<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.700> quite

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this theme I'm not sure if you can quite

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.700 
this theme I'm not sure if you can quite
see<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.479> well<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> status<00:01:07.200> bar<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
see this as well on the status bar you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.070 
see this as well on the status bar you
actually<00:01:08.040> had<00:01:08.220> sort<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.909> carbon<00:01:09.750> fiber

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
actually had sort of this carbon fiber

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.010 
actually had sort of this carbon fiber
solve<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.390> pattern<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:12.600> well<00:01:12.810> which<00:01:12.990> is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
solve and pattern as well which is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.200 
solve and pattern as well which is
they're<00:01:13.350> quite<00:01:13.619> sort<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.490> noticeable<00:01:15.000> but

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
they're quite sort of not noticeable but

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.999
