everything<00:00:12.629> that<00:00:12.660> I've<00:00:12.870> done<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.379> in<00:00:14.010> between

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
everything that I've done it in between

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.430 
everything that I've done it in between

each record definitely I want to take
all<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> time<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.310> takes<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.820> make<00:00:18.090> something

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
all the time it takes to make something

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.620 
all the time it takes to make something
really<00:00:18.720> great<00:00:19.080> that's<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.770> main<00:00:19.949> point<00:00:20.630> if

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
really great that's the main point if

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.290 
really great that's the main point if
you<00:00:21.780> have<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> great<00:00:22.230> idea<00:00:22.820> it<00:00:23.820> comes<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.270> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
you have a great idea it comes to you a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.350 
you have a great idea it comes to you a
natural<00:00:24.710> inspired<00:00:25.710> way<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.460> think<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.150> going

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
natural inspired way I think it's going

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.020 
natural inspired way I think it's going
to<00:00:27.510> come<00:00:28.110> off<00:00:28.320> as<00:00:28.650> something<00:00:29.100> that<00:00:29.280> feels<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
to come off as something that feels that

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.700 
to come off as something that feels that
way<00:00:30.240> instead<00:00:30.450> of<00:00:30.630> something<00:00:30.960> that's<00:00:31.050> force<00:00:31.440> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
way instead of something that's force I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.060 
way instead of something that's force I
think<00:00:32.360> too<00:00:33.360> often<00:00:33.600> music<00:00:34.289> industry<00:00:34.500> people

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
think too often music industry people

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.190 
think too often music industry people
are<00:00:35.190> rushing<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.150> something<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.660> people

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
are rushing to get something out people

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.400 
are rushing to get something out people
still<00:00:37.380> remember<00:00:37.440> who<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:37.980> are<00:00:38.130> or<00:00:38.160> whatever

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
still remember who they are or whatever

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.990 
still remember who they are or whatever
and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.560> get<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> logic<00:00:41.250> behind<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.670> but<00:00:41.910> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
and I get the logic behind that but I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.550 
and I get the logic behind that but I
just<00:00:42.180> don't<00:00:42.329> think<00:00:42.630> it's<00:00:42.930> anywhere<00:00:43.230> near<00:00:43.290> as

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
just don't think it's anywhere near as

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.890 
just don't think it's anywhere near as
important<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.130> making<00:00:44.310> great<00:00:44.850> music<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.750> we

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
important as making great music so we

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.780 
important as making great music so we
always<00:00:46.050> think<00:00:46.290> all<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.620> time<00:00:46.650> that<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.640> need

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
always think all the time that we need

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.760 
always think all the time that we need
to<00:00:47.820> make<00:00:48.090> another<00:00:48.329> record<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:49.380> time<00:00:49.590> wasn't

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
to make another record this time wasn't

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.050 
to make another record this time wasn't
especially<00:00:50.010> long<00:00:50.399> time<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.910> got

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
especially long time because I got

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.880 
especially long time because I got
married<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> end<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.260> last<00:00:52.320> year<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> we

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
do for a whole lot that's another part

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
do for a whole lot that's another part
of<00:00:54.540> it<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:55.020> always<00:00:55.140> sort<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.530> her<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:55.890> least

without<00:03:45.250> without<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.239> man<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.380> think<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.100> for

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
without without a man I I think that for

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.030 
without without a man I I think that for
me<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.239> works<00:03:49.420> best<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.840> way<00:03:49.959> not<00:03:50.350> not<00:03:50.799> to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
me it works best that way not not to

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.130 
me it works best that way not not to
make<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.220> big<00:03:51.340> plan<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:52.330> in<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.540> beginning<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.930> I

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
make a big plan so in the beginning I I

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.600 
make a big plan so in the beginning I I
thought<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.500> might<00:03:53.530> be<00:03:53.769> either<00:03:54.070> one<00:03:54.280> because<00:03:54.580> I

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
thought it might be either one because I

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.699 
thought it might be either one because I
was<00:03:54.700> doing<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.060> lot<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.239> ready<00:03:55.720> by<00:03:55.930> myself<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.650> I

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
was doing a lot of ready by myself and I

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:57.780 
was doing a lot of ready by myself and I
wasn't<00:03:56.980> really<00:03:57.069> sure<00:03:57.190> what<00:03:57.340> was<00:03:57.580> going<00:03:57.730> to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
wasn't really sure what was going to

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.270 
wasn't really sure what was going to
happen<00:03:57.850> with<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.390> um<00:03:58.740> eventually<00:03:59.740> the<00:04:00.100> more

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
happen with it um eventually the more

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.920 
happen with it um eventually the more
music<00:04:00.550> I<00:04:00.640> started<00:04:00.970> writing<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.690> more<00:04:01.900> I

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
music I started writing the more I

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.290 
music I started writing the more I
started<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.560> crave<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.640> elements<00:04:04.090> about

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
started to crave the elements about

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.090 
started to crave the elements about
Madison's<00:04:04.750> miss<00:04:05.260> riding<00:04:05.560> with<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:05.890> band

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
Madison's miss riding with the band

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.949 
Madison's miss riding with the band
working<00:04:06.700> with<00:04:06.819> a<00:04:06.850> band<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.300> that<00:04:07.420> power<00:04:07.630> in

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
working with a band and that power in

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.870 
working with a band and that power in
that<00:04:07.990> aggression<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.490> became<00:04:09.670> in<00:04:09.819> a

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
that aggression so it became in a

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.040 
that aggression so it became in a
message<00:04:10.209> starter<00:04:10.480> but<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.690> think<00:04:10.959> it<00:04:11.020> could

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
message starter but I think it could

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.440 
message starter but I think it could
have<00:04:11.260> gone<00:04:11.290> either<00:04:11.410> way<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:12.010> definitely<00:04:12.850> have<00:04:13.150> a

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
have gone either way I definitely have a

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.750 
have gone either way I definitely have a
lot<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.720> music<00:04:14.709> written<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.280> some<00:04:15.490> of<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.730> is

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
lot of music written and some of it is

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.490 
lot of music written and some of it is
evanescent<00:04:16.209> music<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.750> some<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.080> isn't<00:04:17.200> so

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
evanescent music and some of it isn't so

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.490 
evanescent music and some of it isn't so
I<00:04:17.530> think<00:04:17.799> it's<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.310> very<00:04:18.880> possible<00:04:19.390> that

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
I think it's a very possible that

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.839 
I think it's a very possible that
somewhere<00:04:20.500> just<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.799> little<00:04:21.070> something<00:04:21.580> else

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
somewhere just a little something else

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.510 
somewhere just a little something else
we're<00:04:22.060> looking<00:04:22.419> at<00:04:22.510> my<00:04:22.570> future<00:04:22.750> at<00:04:22.990> some<00:04:23.110> point
