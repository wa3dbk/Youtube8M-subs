00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.920 
couple of times so really good and I
think<00:01:37.560> he<00:01:38.040> his<00:01:38.640> best<00:01:38.909> position<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> scent

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
think he his best position is a scent

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.020 
think he his best position is a scent
attack<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.380> mid<00:01:40.590> rather<00:01:41.189> than<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.520> strike<00:01:41.880> he

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
attack in mid rather than a strike he

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.969 
attack in mid rather than a strike he
doesn't<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.450> perfect<00:01:42.899> work<00:01:43.110> rates<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
doesn't have perfect work rates so you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.590 
doesn't have perfect work rates so you
could<00:01:44.220> always<00:01:44.430> expect<00:01:44.939> him<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
could always expect him to be in the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.560 
could always expect him to be in the
right<00:01:45.689> position<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.380> right<00:01:46.560> time<00:01:46.950> even<00:01:47.280> in

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
right position at the right time even in

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
right position at the right time even in
counter-attacks<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.340> say<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
counter-attacks but I have to say the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.609 
counter-attacks but I have to say the
biggest<00:01:51.119> improvement<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.780> its<00:01:51.990> finesse<00:01:52.259> also

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
biggest improvement is its finesse also

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.429 
biggest improvement is its finesse also
you'll<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.220> against<00:01:53.899> check<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.110> one

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
you'll see one against check and one

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.100 
you'll see one against check and one

game<00:01:58.350> gets<00:01:59.159> finesse<00:02:00.090> roids

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
game gets finesse roids

but heading wise you're not gonna get

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.140 
but heading wise you're not gonna get
any<00:02:16.290> headers<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.760> want<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.000> get

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
any headers you if you want to get

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.789 
any headers you if you want to get
headers<00:02:18.450> he<00:02:18.629> has<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.959> be<00:02:19.080> open<00:02:19.470> with<00:02:19.620> no

defender<00:02:20.340> mocking<00:02:20.730> him<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.900> said

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
defender mocking him and like I said

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.050 
defender mocking him and like I said
shooting<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.799> expected<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.400> be<00:02:23.519> more<00:02:23.730> powerful

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
shooting I expected to be more powerful

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.710 
shooting I expected to be more powerful
and<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:25.110> biggest<00:02:25.560> negative<00:02:26.250> for<00:02:26.849> me<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.180> he<00:02:27.569> is

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and the biggest negative for me is he is

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.350 
and the biggest negative for me is he is
just<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.379> weak<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.400> as<00:02:29.580> soon<00:02:29.790> as<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:29.970> defender

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
just so weak so as soon as the defender

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.300 
just so weak so as soon as the defender
comes<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.319> tries<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.620> put<00:02:32.040> buddy

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
comes up to you and tries to put buddy

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.050 
comes up to you and tries to put buddy
off<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.640> boil

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
off the boil

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.059 
off the boil
he<00:02:33.330> gets<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:33.750> straight<00:02:34.049> away<00:02:34.349> Dennett<00:02:34.860> are

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
he gets it straight away Dennett are

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.880 
he gets it straight away Dennett are
they<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.549> so<00:02:35.760> weak<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.410> there<00:02:37.410> was<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> player

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
they just so weak and there was a player

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.589 
they just so weak and there was a player
that<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.190> reviewed<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.760> before<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.269> Natale

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
that I reviewed just before the Natale

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.960 
that I reviewed just before the Natale
and<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.989> was<00:02:40.140> Dafoe<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.220> think<00:02:41.489> they<00:02:41.670> have

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and that was Dafoe and I think they have

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.390 
and that was Dafoe and I think they have
similar<00:02:42.599> shooting<00:02:43.170> stats<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.220> say

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
similar shooting stats and I have to say

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.720 
similar shooting stats and I have to say
the<00:02:44.640> foes<00:02:45.019> shooting<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.230> lot<00:02:46.920> better<00:02:47.370> it's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
the foes shooting is a lot better it's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.940 
the foes shooting is a lot better it's
like<00:02:47.970> double<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.930> shot<00:02:49.410> power<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.829> would

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
like double the shot power you would

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.930 
like double the shot power you would
feel<00:02:50.129> that<00:02:50.160> they're<00:02:50.519> not<00:02:50.579> how<00:02:50.760> they<00:02:50.879> should

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
feel that they're not how they should

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.569 
feel that they're not how they should
have<00:02:51.299> but<00:02:51.840> that's<00:02:52.680> all<00:02:52.950> there<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.459> guys
