00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.689
 make a new one where you have a certain one and you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.640
 You have to go there and do more points than 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.009
 that place then we will do our 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.110
 heating, remembering that the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.989

 comment that claims to be your youngster had 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.079
 this is very important for the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.910
 continuity of the series nÃ© 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.950
 This is kind of a thermometer or ours. 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.469
 Mrs. team in our church is kind of a 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.050
 thermometer to know if we should 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.239
 continue with skateboards must take skateboard 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.079
 anyway this is how it works for everyone 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.230
 the games are not 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.030
 the feedback is not the slips in the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.210
 hot nobody knows really dislike 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.520
 short of reiter then but what matters 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.250
 even the links are the comments 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.540
 this is the feedback on youtube talk about 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.229
 Feedback is what you 're talking about. 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.630
 huh 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.119
 Only you're engaged. You 're enjoying it. 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 continue what matters to us is a 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.189
 people who only like the channel and who 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.780
 support this kind of thing so it's very 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.009
 It's good to see that a series that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.720
 different channel is a game that is well 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.880
 different from what we were 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.820
 accustomed to do and who ended up winning 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.540
 there is a very nice audience the public 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.759
 likes the public who even skate or 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.600
 You think to skate but please? 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:50.399
 do not stay, it's based on what we do 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.619
 pay mainly the top mit is this 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.219
 Crazy madness, I'll try to do that. 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.409
 ball that tax will do very well 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.479
 henrique enrolled in the total to me provides 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.820
 not for God's love is God's love to 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.219
 I hurt you but here in the game it's out of 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.239
 play the practical money because it is not 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.240
 shorter and lower years and years of 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.190
 training 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.530
 when you are going to row two-legged 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.220
 as well 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.260
 a week ago with only one defeat 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.720
 I spoke to your son on his lap pro ended 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.730

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.890
 time to hi carney 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.020
 Look, it's cool, this is the skill of the crisis. 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.880
 new age is just a civilian too 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.880
 shark has in the middle of urban asphalt 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.500
 who went up adopted up a ladder and 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.870
 symptoms every book climb on it 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.270
 except that this mode will be the mini 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.930
 that mode where you have the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.820
 the specific places and there the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.560
 another has to go there and overcome the maneuver 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.760
 the other in that place to dominate and 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:07.510
 who dominates most winning places 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:16.060
 advance of the wrong clothes here what is 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:18.580
 wrong and they will see our ice beats the 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.030
 The shark in which you did there grows to be 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:34.180
 hit the shark his stay there from here 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:36.190
 new again and wrong not only right 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:44.290
 professional hbo our government listen 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:46.060
 here he made grow your shape 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.989
 half rose 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.150
 the u1 there I came to ours is 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.040
 perfect if it fell on the other ramp, right? 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.920
 now I'm a firefighter a kiss people go 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.700
 open map here just for this challenge 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:05.860
 we walked baron jumping sharks 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.599
 very crazy shark this here 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.360
 So, okay, let's start the challenge. 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:18.329
 although not disclosed here is that the 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:22.769
 one shark in shark one in shark 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.769
 since they are not aware of the right 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:46.810
 come on come on we can not continue on 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.850
 forward there we play now with 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:58.120
 wit 600 points 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:05:14.110
 the guarantee is 12 points what I want 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:17.200
 It's so head catch that nobody 30 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.490
 past it does not lose its maneuvers 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:37.270
 terrible distribution do if 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:41.139
 do nothing just past catch the hill 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:45.470
 even if you do not get 600 ready for it 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:47.810
 got mine there until 17 on top 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:52.490
 I feel like there's a long way to go, it seems 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:54.320
 nor to raise your ascent the nerd 0 to revoke the 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.120
 background at once will also car pick up 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:04.190
 back 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:10.150
 and the club is also looking to do business 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:12.680
 took my case is mine is mine is yours 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.930
 that's why I'm getting past in a thousand 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.120
 times here in the group takes here day 10 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:24.980
 for those who increase already in red 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:28.430
 Yes I think they increase even in this 300 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:41.919
 I did not get a team of 800 going behind 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:41.919
 of this 4681 existed here you can leave here 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:54.560
 happens that that was because the drug 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:59.260
 even when you increase the 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.260
 appears there written that increased in the hour 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:10.600
 it's impossible to do anything much 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.600
 crazy 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:22.580
 the skateboard did not give was 800 point like you 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.940
 do for 800 points, I know, I do not know 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.210
 guiÃ£o was the biggest point I think 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.210
 I made
