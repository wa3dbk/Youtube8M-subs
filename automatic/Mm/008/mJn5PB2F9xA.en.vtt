Italy has awakened,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.240
of the helmet of Scipio

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.930

Let her bow down,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.290
as it does a slave to Rome

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.300
God has her (victory) created.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.910

trampled, derided,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.360
because we are not one people,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.200
because we are divided.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.840

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.610
swords sold (mercenaries):

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.380
already the eagle of Austria

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.260
has lost the feathers

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.360
The blood of Italy,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.520
the Polish blood

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.180
drank with the Cossack (Russian)

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.650
But it burned her heart.
