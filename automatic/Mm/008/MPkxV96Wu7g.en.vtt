00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:05.410
 but percent of all I should just now as a small 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.569
 Quince peas that means you have 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:12.709
 for a movie with drones and a smoking room for what I did there 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:13.429
 have 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.060
 what I'm going to do now I take one or two songs from John Mellencamp and 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.099
 Stored these on a usb-stick the same could have Stu make with 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.929
 after and easy and DVD or cd-rom 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.800
 Trick here is in the pockets of actually that you have nothing at all 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.819
 has to do with it 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.239
 that Apple has a copy protection or the duo on John CDs or something 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.050
 Do you give him the name? 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.890
 and the album names and Pixar information all over only at Erdogan 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.440
 the audio cd formats applies 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.450
 So I want to have any song I want to transfer 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.360
 preferably 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.270
 one 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.830
 and kink the right mouse button respectively 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.530
 around 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.570
 I take the control TRUSTe and left mouse button that about the same as 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.220
 the right mouse button 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.600
 and looking for an option which means in the enemy ad text corpse you can too 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.820
 with victims r 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.080
 come Arndt r 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.650
 the enemies display panel hires a window 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.900
 and 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.070
 that's a normal fine window and then I see there's okay 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.910
 put an animal and that jump 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.760
 there I am for the believers in the whole album inside that is Schumm 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.210
 this logo, according to Bluth 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.120
 The album only dumb has admitted 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.160
 and now I plug in the new USB connector 1 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.729
 Marein USB the Rhine you have to appear somewhere 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 for example memory 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.550
 lasts 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.880
 Of course, the idea of ​​narrowing every window is thoroughly wrong 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.880
 Clusters correspond to talk 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.750
 do not save 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.949
 exciting 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.909
 there isses 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.909
 Daniel Richter's goal 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.949
 or several games I do not matter and wait until it works 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.949
 among the various folders XX Eintracht Rheine 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.639
 thanks to this memory 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.229
 now somewhere else 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.769
 elsewhere in the computer Kretschmann said that again 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.269
 HH 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.059
 Everything stays the quality that does not start something bad 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:47.499
 so you can make by where more starting places I do not turn
