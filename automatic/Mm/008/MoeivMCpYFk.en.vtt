00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.240
 Professor Thomas speaks to Antonio Perez 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.890
 Let's talk about the biometric properties of the membrane 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.239
 on this occasion the action potential 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.990
 momentum 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.439
 already in a previous program 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.779
 we had talked about the resting potential opot itself the membrane 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.999
 what is a theme 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.460
 to eliminate 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.050
 to be able to understand in a good way 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.440
 what the action potential means for the sisters 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.740
 before it is also good to mention 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.970
 regarding ion channels 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.890
 of protein nature found in the membranes 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.560
 Historical channels are of two main types 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.840
 the summaries that are the channels without a door 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.380
 and the gate channels 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.150
 the plasma membrane of a neuron p according to Jular 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.700
 has many channels that summarizing for potassium 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.680
 many more that paralyzed today 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.240
 to it is that the ap 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.960
 membrane permeability is much higher 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.150
 for potassium 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.939
 over the ion channels gate 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.939
 there are four categories of stimuli 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.560
 the voltage 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.530
 the chemical substances 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.220
 mechanical pressure 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.680
 and the light 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.990
 the presence in the membrane of ion channels of chemical gate door 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.410
 d pol kg 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.070
 shop onica mini onu k 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.009
 allows the right stimulus to produce 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.510
 a graduate potential 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.359
 these electrical responses 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.650
 they are of variable size and of greater magnitude homero gold 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.330
 depending on how much ion channels gates have been opened 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.770
 how many have been kept open and also how long have they been kept 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.900
 open 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.900
 each one of them 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.349
 let's talk specifically now about the potential for action 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.629
 for the action potential act the hit channels of door before score 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.549
 specifically 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.359
 the voltage gate channels 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.799
 for sodium and for potassium 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.799
 during an action potential 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.409
 is part of the general premise 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.419
 that the membrane 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.329
 this one at rest 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.659
 is worth to say 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.890
 that there is a clinic was charged or negative charge tendency 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.719
 towards the inner side 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.349
 while the outer face of the membrane is left 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.529
 so the cytoplasm 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:54.999
 it's more positive 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.219
 then during the action potential 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.999
 open 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.689
 and then they close 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.689
 Two types of ion channels voltage gate 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.599
 first the channels for sodium 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.599
 and then the channels for potassium 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.169
 let's see more details 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.169
 what is the action potential 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:24.929
 the fast opening of the channels the sodium gate voltage 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:28.619
 causes a depolarization 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:31.259
 of the membrane 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.259
 the loss and subsequent investment 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.349
 that the polarity of the membrane 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.649
 this is called this patent is polarization 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.989
 of the action potential 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.989
 the slower opening of the channels the potassium voltage gate 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.129
 and the closing of the channels 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.210
 of sodium 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.859
 previously opened 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.429
 of the place now combines rec polarization of the membrane 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.609
 as recovery 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.679
 of the resting potential of the membrane 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.109
 on the whole 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.129
 that no debt a typical the depolarization phase guilad of 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.569
 repolarization 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.189
 an action potential that lasts around humble and second 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.669
 this in the case of the example that we have been mentioning 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.389
 for a nerve cell a neuron 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.389
 or for muscle fiber 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:36.419
 let's stop between the contessa and then cell phones 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.889
 that triggers on the action potential 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.219
 let's see in the stages 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.090
 potential for repos 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.099
 after 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.529
 depolarization 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.599
 we reach a stage of fact over shooting 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.919
 followed by a polarization ree 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.020
 and finally a 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.800
 inter polarization 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.949
 let's see now the events 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.069
 cell phones that trigger an action potential 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.759
 with the stages 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.259
 that I already mentioned 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.969
 as far as the potential 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:18.689
 of rest 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:22.819
 Interposed mounting channels for sodium and for potassium 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.889
 they are closed 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:29.169
 surviving 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.960
 a stimulus 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.300
 in this case for example 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.300
 a mechanical stimulus 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.610
 they say that a series of changes are coming 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.020
 changes in vila structure 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.669
 that come 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.009
 for that virus 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.009
 for a potential and graduated in some cases 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.379
 begins when a series of channels open at the port of scoring 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:58.419
 for yours 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.569
 that were in potential 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.569
 at rest or in rest position 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:04.469
 and now 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:07.249
 begin to openings 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:11.249
 while still in the depolarization stage 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.580
 Voltage channels and ports for potassium 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.919
 they are closed 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.409
 if the stimulus can be strong enough 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.139
 and exceeds the threshold 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.689
 it triggers 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:26.889
 the action potential 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.610
 that is, depolarization of the membrane occurs 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.610
 next 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.800
 mans and more voltage port channels are opened 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.419
 for the study 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.729
 to a point that is called ethical zoover 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.909
 although more and more channels are opened 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:47.680
 is not exceeded 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.020
 the positive potential of and more 30 thousand volts 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.419

 Voltage port for potassium

 and the channels are inactivated 

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:04.289
 for him it is hate 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:06.529
 and then it happens

 r and polarization of the membrane 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:12.520

 by the action of sodium potassium pump 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:37.849
 we have talked about 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:40.009
