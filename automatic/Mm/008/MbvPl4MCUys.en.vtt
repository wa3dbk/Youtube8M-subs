into<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> clinch<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.930> basically<00:00:37.350> work<00:00:37.530> them

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
into the clinch and basically work them

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.440 
into the clinch and basically work them
there<00:00:37.860> there<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.250> three<00:00:38.460> basic<00:00:38.730> throws<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
there there are three basic throws that

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.530 
there there are three basic throws that
I<00:00:39.570> think<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.530> work<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.430> most<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
I think they do a work with and most of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.240 
I think they do a work with and most of
the<00:00:42.600> judo<00:00:42.960> purist<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> how<00:00:43.950> they're<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the judo purist of how they're going to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.450 
the judo purist of how they're going to
say<00:00:44.399> that's<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.960> throw<00:00:46.460> accessible

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
say that's not that throw accessible

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.729 
say that's not that throw accessible
that's<00:00:47.640> great<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:48.629> he's<00:00:49.170> not<00:00:49.350> wearing<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that's great because he's not wearing a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.930 
that's great because he's not wearing a
key<00:00:50.010> okay

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
key okay

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.090 
key okay
so<00:00:51.239> we're<00:00:51.480> we're<00:00:51.930> we're<00:00:52.230> classifying<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:53.039> as

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
so we're we're we're classifying this as

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.229 
so we're we're we're classifying this as
closely<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:54.090> possible<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:57.000> a
