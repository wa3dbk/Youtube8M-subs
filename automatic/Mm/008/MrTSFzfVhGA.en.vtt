their<00:02:11.630> storage<00:02:11.930> technology<00:02:12.620> if<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:13.190> write<00:02:13.489> on

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
their storage technology if you write on

this rock with a pen or a marker
eventually<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.330> course<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:18.080> will<00:02:18.349> wear<00:02:18.620> off

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
eventually of course it will wear off

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.740 
eventually of course it will wear off
