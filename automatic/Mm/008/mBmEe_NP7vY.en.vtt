00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.500
 eduardo we are in the good in all 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.010
 problems that happened here in the league 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.500
 to samsung regarding the final room d 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.820
 the league of legends when I was a 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.220
 little bit how much more here 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.340
 tell a little bit what is your version of 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.029
 what happened to the final that what 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.029
 what happened to you 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.289
 we 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.480
 play well and if he won very well if 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.050
 we lost police 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.050
 the truth 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.540
 but yesterday with the audio of the games 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:52.360
 where the players are being located 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:52.360
 to participate in the problem 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.760
 we go to the computer 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.579
 it's a seed problem 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.579
 We said that we could not be told that 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.659
 yes 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 3 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.180
 but 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 i 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.030
 with humor 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.110
 has many technical stoppages and not 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.110
 we're just going to the topic 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.110
 but 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.690
 and water 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.150
 and possible corruption 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.660
 you think will somehow give 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.910
 some kind of statement to the best more 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.700
 formal or take the steps maybe 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.700
 legal with the organization 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.360
 I do not think they're afraid of something 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.070
 mandia legal and against organization 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.070
 let's give a statement 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.150
 about what happened of the mentions 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.349
 in a nun 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.349
 in this case 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:00.520
 we do not know if it is calculated 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.580
 and if we do not go disqualified for the 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.050
 future competences 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.090
 but the truth is that we already 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.480
 we had talked the week with a 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.480
 threat 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.040
 and we say let's not say 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.920
 national 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.980
 Now, although in Chile it is very 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.499
 little advanced the theme of the gamers how 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.269
 do you think that this type of 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:30.269
 situations like the one that happened day 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.830
 a return to national unity 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.510
 maybe 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.810
 and you think that while this could be 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.600
 the end the best of the league samsung 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.949
 they managed to fulfill it with this kind of 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.039
 mistakes they made when I 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.039
 k 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.319
 the truth is that we do not have 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.699
 problem in returning to participate in some 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.699
 national event while 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:59.200
 at least we with the current one of 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:02.800
 working we will not participate in 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.450
 any kind of check anything 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.700
 that is related between nothing else 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.700
 because we found 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.150
 too much irregularity along the 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.880
 time that we have not had the 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.310
 immense amandio 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.790
 the relationship happens 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.740
 one last question member of chilia 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.960

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.980

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:34.510
 gamer at best average to support 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.510
 good initiatives as per plate 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:44.540
 well first what 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:47.600
 I hope there is a shelf 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.139
 We also hope that thinking about what 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.530
 happened today 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:55.620

00:05:52.530 --> 00:06:00.630

 national public level 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.130
