another<00:00:41.670> thing<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.600> way<00:00:42.719> that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
another thing I like about the way that

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.260 
another thing I like about the way that
they<00:00:43.020> design<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:44.250> particular<00:00:44.850> unit<00:00:45.149> which

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
they design this particular unit which

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.779 
they design this particular unit which
is<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> hearth<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:47.300> it's<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.570> an<00:00:48.870> insert

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
is the hearth here is it's not an insert

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.520 
is the hearth here is it's not an insert
technically<00:00:50.789> listed<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.079> does

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
technically listed as one but it does

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.330 
technically listed as one but it does
not<00:00:52.969> rely<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.270> depth<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.949> existing

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
not rely on depth of a existing

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.150 
not rely on depth of a existing
fireplace<00:00:57.590> or<00:00:58.590> width<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.430> that

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
fireplace or width for that

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.140 
fireplace or width for that
which<00:01:00.730> we<00:01:00.910> typically<00:01:01.270> run<00:01:01.510> into<00:01:01.840> issues<00:01:03.150> it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
which we typically run into issues it

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.520 
which we typically run into issues it
comes<00:01:04.360> out<00:01:04.510> of<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.690> back<00:01:04.900> of<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.170> insert

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
comes out of the back of the insert

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.880 
comes out of the back of the insert
which<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.920> like<00:01:06.160> because<00:01:06.550> now<00:01:07.540> I<00:01:07.570> have<00:01:07.990> very

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
which I like because now I have very

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.570 
which I like because now I have very
easy<00:01:09.180> connections<00:01:10.180> with<00:01:11.080> going<00:01:11.320> through<00:01:11.710> the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
easy connections with going through the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.960 
easy connections with going through the
existing<00:01:12.850> damper<00:01:13.330> area<00:01:13.630> enough<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.960> chimney

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
existing damper area enough to chimney

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.210 
existing damper area enough to chimney
it<00:01:15.970> gives<00:01:16.180> me<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.390> hundred<00:01:16.750> percent<00:01:16.870> of<00:01:17.440> my

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
it gives me a hundred percent of my

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.350 
it gives me a hundred percent of my
stove<00:01:18.520> in<00:01:18.790> my<00:01:18.940> room<00:01:20.070> which<00:01:21.070> some<00:01:21.910> people<00:01:22.030> don't

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
stove in my room which some people don't

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.540 
stove in my room which some people don't
want<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.600> blower<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.350> gives<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:24.010> option<00:01:24.430> of

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
want a blower so it gives that option of

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.400 
want a blower so it gives that option of
being<00:01:24.790> able<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.090> have<00:01:25.330> that<00:01:25.510> insert<00:01:26.050> on<00:01:26.350> the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
being able to have that insert on the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.980 
being able to have that insert on the
earth<00:01:26.800> without<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.520> blower<00:01:27.910> still<00:01:28.420> getting<00:01:28.780> a

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
earth without the blower still getting a

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.640 
earth without the blower still getting a
lot<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.620> radiant<00:01:30.070> heat<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:32.170> benefit<00:01:32.619> of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
lot of radiant heat but the benefit of

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.219 
lot of radiant heat but the benefit of
also<00:01:33.100> putting<00:01:33.400> a<00:01:33.550> blower<00:01:33.760> on<00:01:33.880> this<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.900> the

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
also putting a blower on this is the

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.740 
also putting a blower on this is the
built-in<00:01:35.650> air<00:01:35.890> mate<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.280> they<00:01:36.400> do<00:01:36.460> this<00:01:37.450> air

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
built-in air mate that they do this air

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.580 
built-in air mate that they do this air
mate<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.800> designed<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:40.300> concentrate<00:01:41.050> all<00:01:41.410> the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
mate is designed to concentrate all the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.880 
mate is designed to concentrate all the
heat<00:01:41.800> coming<00:01:42.220> off<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.580> top<00:01:42.729> side<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.180> this<00:01:43.300> lid

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
heat coming off the top side of this lid

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.109 
heat coming off the top side of this lid
when<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:44.979> blower<00:01:45.190> kicks<00:01:45.520> on<00:01:45.759> it<00:01:45.910> blows

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
when the blower kicks on it blows

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.180 
when the blower kicks on it blows
through<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.360> bottom<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.320> back<00:01:47.530> and

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
through the bottom of the back and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.690 
through the bottom of the back and
across<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.729> top<00:01:48.960> which<00:01:49.960> with<00:01:50.410> this<00:01:50.700> trapping

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
across the top which with this trapping

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.249 
across the top which with this trapping
and<00:01:51.910> holding<00:01:52.210> that<00:01:52.360> heat<00:01:52.600> in<00:01:52.780> there<00:01:52.990> when<00:01:53.170> the

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
and holding that heat in there when the

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.630 
and holding that heat in there when the
blower<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.650> going<00:01:53.950> through<00:01:54.190> there<00:01:54.400> I'm<00:01:54.520> going

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
blower is going through there I'm going

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.350 
blower is going through there I'm going
to<00:01:54.729> get<00:01:54.910> maximized<00:01:55.509> heat<00:01:56.940> another<00:01:57.940> thing<00:01:58.240> I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
to get maximized heat another thing I

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.249 
to get maximized heat another thing I
like<00:01:58.540> about<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:58.990> is<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.369> air<00:02:00.700> wash<00:02:01.080> that<00:02:02.080> they

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
like about it is the air wash that they

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.169 
like about it is the air wash that they
incorporate<00:02:02.770> also<00:02:03.190> it's<00:02:03.490> not<00:02:03.640> just<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:03.970> little

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
incorporate also it's not just a little

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.790 
incorporate also it's not just a little
deflector<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:04.960> comes<00:02:05.170> through<00:02:05.410> here<00:02:05.649> it's

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
deflector that comes through here it's

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.460 
deflector that comes through here it's
actual<00:02:06.190> air<00:02:06.369> wash<00:02:06.610> holes<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:07.750> come<00:02:07.899> across<00:02:08.259> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
actual air wash holes to come across the
