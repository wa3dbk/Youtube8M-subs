00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.119 
now challenging Dungey for the number
two<00:02:27.269> spot<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:28.290> also<00:02:28.440> want<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.830> mention<00:02:28.920> that

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
two spot we also want to mention that

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.130 
two spot we also want to mention that
clock<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> top<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.269> screen<00:02:30.450> these

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
clock on the top of the screen these

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.890 
clock on the top of the screen these
races<00:02:31.620> last<00:02:31.799> 30<00:02:32.160> minutes<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.700> two<00:02:33.450> laps<00:02:33.660> so

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
races last 30 minutes and two laps so

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.539 
races last 30 minutes and two laps so
we'll<00:02:34.019> count<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.319> clock<00:02:34.620> down<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.860> zero<00:02:35.280> and

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
we'll count that clock down to zero and

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.600 
we'll count that clock down to zero and
then<00:02:36.000> put<00:02:36.209> out<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.450> two<00:02:36.599> laps<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.930> go<00:02:37.079> board

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
then put out the two laps to go board

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.979 
then put out the two laps to go board
yeah<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:38.849> basically<00:02:39.030> if<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.510> leader<00:02:39.720> comes

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
yeah so basically if the leader comes

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.110 
yeah so basically if the leader comes
around<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.709> hasn't<00:02:41.280> hit<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.459> 30-minute

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
around and it hasn't hit the 30-minute

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.360 
around and it hasn't hit the 30-minute
mark<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:42.660> close<00:02:42.930> he<00:02:43.560> goes<00:02:43.739> another<00:02:44.040> lap

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
mark and it's close he goes another lap

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.180 
mark and it's close he goes another lap
so<00:02:44.700> once<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.239> hit<00:02:45.390> 30<00:02:45.630> minutes<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.470> next<00:02:46.980> time

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
so once you hit 30 minutes the next time

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.740 
so once you hit 30 minutes the next time
the<00:02:47.340> leader<00:02:47.519> comes<00:02:47.730> around<00:02:48.060> that's<00:02:48.390> when<00:02:48.660> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
the leader comes around that's when the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.539 
the leader comes around that's when the
two<00:02:48.930> lap<00:02:49.110> board<00:02:49.290> comes<00:02:49.590> out<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.400> case

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
two lap board comes out and in a case

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.759 
two lap board comes out and in a case
like<00:02:50.670> today<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.209> moto<00:02:51.390> one<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:52.410> leader<00:02:52.590> was

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
like today in moto one the leader was

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.190 
like today in moto one the leader was
about<00:02:52.980> 30<00:02:53.250> seconds<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:54.329> was<00:02:54.450> about<00:02:54.630> 20<00:02:55.019> minutes

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
about 30 seconds it was about 20 minutes

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.050 
about 30 seconds it was about 20 minutes
30<00:02:55.650> seconds<00:02:56.099> he<00:02:56.220> was<00:02:56.370> closed<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:56.760> they<00:02:56.940> went

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
30 seconds he was closed so they went

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.850 
30 seconds he was closed so they went
another<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.079> end<00:02:58.200> up<00:02:58.260> going<00:02:58.410> three<00:02:58.650> more
