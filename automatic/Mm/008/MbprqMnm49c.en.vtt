he never really won so that's the point

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.650 
he never really won so that's the point
of<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.260> video<00:00:22.560> will<00:00:22.769> he<00:00:22.859> ever<00:00:23.010> went<00:00:23.220> um<00:00:23.660> he's

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
of this video will he ever went um he's

of this video will he ever went um he's
gotten<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> top<00:00:25.529> 16<00:00:26.189> once<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.269> top<00:00:27.539> eight

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
gotten to the top 16 once the top eight

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.630 
gotten to the top 16 once the top eight
I<00:00:28.349> believe<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:29.340> least<00:00:29.400> twice<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:31.250> he<00:00:32.250> made<00:00:32.610> it

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
I believe at least twice and he made it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.080 
I believe at least twice and he made it
to<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.210> top<00:00:33.450> four<00:00:33.840> um<00:00:34.489> once<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:37.520> he<00:00:38.520> will<00:00:38.790> have

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to the top four um once so he will have

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.900 
to the top four um once so he will have
to<00:00:39.750> eventually<00:00:40.469> win<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.190> pokémon<00:00:41.370> league<00:00:41.730> at

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
about 20 years old now it's coming up to

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
the next year or so and I think that

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.919 
the next year or so and I think that
would<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.680> perfect<00:02:08.220> time<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.459> Ash<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.390> win

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
would be a perfect time for Ash to win

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.350 
would be a perfect time for Ash to win
the<00:02:10.349> pokémon<00:02:10.860> league<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.580> after<00:02:11.819> 20<00:02:12.120> years<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the pokémon league so after 20 years of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.000 
the pokémon league so after 20 years of
Pokemon

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
Pokemon

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.910 
Pokemon
i ash<00:02:13.430> finally<00:02:13.970> wins<00:02:14.659> and<00:02:15.049> achieves<00:02:15.500> his<00:02:15.680> goal

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
i ash finally wins and achieves his goal

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.899 
i ash finally wins and achieves his goal
of<00:02:16.159> becoming<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.909> pokémon<00:02:17.540> master<00:02:18.370> now<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
of becoming a pokémon master now the

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.259 
of becoming a pokémon master now the
ending<00:02:20.780> with<00:02:21.230> ash<00:02:21.640> being<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:23.030> know<00:02:23.120> the

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
ending with ash being you know the

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.420 
ending with ash being you know the
champion<00:02:23.750> has<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.470> be<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> pretty<00:02:24.890> cool<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.280> I

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
champion has to be a pretty cool and I

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.899 
champion has to be a pretty cool and I
mean<00:02:25.870> ash<00:02:26.870> has<00:02:27.379> you<00:02:27.709> know<00:02:27.799> if<00:02:28.099> ash<00:02:28.280> wins<00:02:28.610> has<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
mean ash has you know if ash wins has to

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.670 
mean ash has you know if ash wins has to
be<00:02:28.970> really<00:02:29.269> cool<00:02:29.450> battle<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.019> can't<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.409> like

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
be really cool battle it can't be like

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.770 
be really cool battle it can't be like
some<00:02:30.980> just<00:02:31.250> thrown<00:02:31.940> off<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.390> mean<00:02:32.540> obviously

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
some just thrown off I mean obviously

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.170 
some just thrown off I mean obviously
they<00:02:33.590> would<00:02:33.769> work<00:02:34.129> really<00:02:34.400> really<00:02:34.519> hard<00:02:34.700> to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
they would work really really hard to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.099 
they would work really really hard to
make<00:02:35.329> it<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.720> best<00:02:36.940> battle<00:02:37.940> ash<00:02:38.299> has<00:02:38.629> ever<00:02:38.810> had

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
make it the best battle ash has ever had

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.149 
make it the best battle ash has ever had
now<00:02:39.859> you<00:02:40.730> probably<00:02:41.000> end<00:02:41.299> with<00:02:41.480> Pikachu

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
now you probably end with Pikachu

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.649 
now you probably end with Pikachu
matches<00:02:43.159> first<00:02:43.400> Pokemon<00:02:43.970> will<00:02:44.120> probably<00:02:44.569> be

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
matches first Pokemon will probably be

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.140 
matches first Pokemon will probably be
his<00:02:44.780> last<00:02:45.079> Pokemon<00:02:45.650> you'll<00:02:45.829> fight<00:02:46.099> with<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.519> in

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
his last Pokemon you'll fight with in in

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.780 
his last Pokemon you'll fight with in in
the<00:02:47.569> Pokemon<00:02:48.230> League<00:02:48.260> as<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:49.129> that<00:02:49.640> has

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
the Pokemon League as it that has

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.890 
the Pokemon League as it that has
happened<00:02:50.239> several<00:02:50.900> times<00:02:51.139> before<00:02:52.629> so<00:02:53.629> that's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
happened several times before so that's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.000 
happened several times before so that's
probably<00:02:54.379> most<00:02:54.739> likely<00:02:55.159> going<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.060> happen<00:02:57.010> now

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
probably most likely going to happen now

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.089 
probably most likely going to happen now
if<00:02:58.340> ash<00:02:58.579> wins<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.389> Pokemon<00:02:59.870> League<00:03:00.099> that

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
if ash wins the Pokemon League that

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.300 
if ash wins the Pokemon League that
basically<00:03:01.700> could<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.359> mean<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.780> end<00:03:02.959> of

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
basically could that mean the end of

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.099 
basically could that mean the end of
Pokemon<00:03:04.310> anime<00:03:04.549> there's<00:03:05.329> a<00:03:05.569> lot<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.840> people

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
Pokemon anime there's a lot of people

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.440 
Pokemon anime there's a lot of people
think<00:03:06.349> that<00:03:06.470> Josh<00:03:06.739> finally<00:03:07.280> wins<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:08.030> will

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
think that Josh finally wins that will

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.949 
think that Josh finally wins that will
delete<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.440> whole<00:03:09.620> purpose<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.459> like<00:03:11.239> him

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
delete the whole purpose of like him

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.629 
delete the whole purpose of like him
keep<00:03:12.440> going<00:03:12.470> for<00:03:12.980> his<00:03:13.069> goal<00:03:13.250> because<00:03:13.459> now<00:03:13.579> you

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
keep going for his goal because now you

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.759 
keep going for his goal because now you
got<00:03:14.000> his<00:03:14.150> goal<00:03:14.359> and<00:03:14.629> so<00:03:14.900> he's<00:03:15.049> done<00:03:15.260> right

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
got his goal and so he's done right

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.250 
got his goal and so he's done right
well<00:03:16.400> not<00:03:16.700> exactly<00:03:16.819> he<00:03:17.480> could<00:03:17.629> probably<00:03:17.900> still

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
well not exactly he could probably still

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.680 
well not exactly he could probably still
try<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.680> be<00:03:18.919> the<00:03:19.099> you<00:03:19.370> know<00:03:19.489> champion<00:03:20.060> of<00:03:20.150> Kanto

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
try to be the you know champion of Kanto

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.750 
try to be the you know champion of Kanto
or<00:03:20.900> something<00:03:21.319> he<00:03:21.739> could<00:03:21.889> still<00:03:22.160> try<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.549> be

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
or something he could still try to be

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.240 
or something he could still try to be
better<00:03:22.970> in<00:03:23.329> his<00:03:23.780> own<00:03:23.989> way<00:03:24.230> probably<00:03:24.709> still<00:03:25.010> go

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
better in his own way probably still go

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.849 
better in his own way probably still go
through<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.639> whole<00:03:25.940> lot<00:03:26.060> more<00:03:26.239> journeys<00:03:26.859> in

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
through a whole lot more journeys in

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.629 
through a whole lot more journeys in
order<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.280> achieve<00:03:29.109> new<00:03:30.109> and<00:03:30.530> new<00:03:31.010> things<00:03:31.340> but

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
order to achieve new and new things but

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.479 
order to achieve new and new things but
maybe<00:03:31.879> not<00:03:32.150> just<00:03:32.209> directly<00:03:33.109> being<00:03:33.799> coming<00:03:34.220> a

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
maybe not just directly being coming a

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.539 
maybe not just directly being coming a
Pokemon<00:03:35.030> master<00:03:35.319> like<00:03:36.319> he<00:03:36.590> has<00:03:36.919> been<00:03:37.190> trying

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
to do for the past like 16 17 seasons so

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.409 
to do for the past like 16 17 seasons so
something<00:03:43.430> like<00:03:43.489> that<00:03:43.609> happening<00:03:44.209> really

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
something like that happening really

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:51.759 
something like that happening really
soon<00:03:44.660> would<00:03:45.049> be<00:03:45.349> great<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:49.449> or<00:03:50.449> perhaps<00:03:51.319> there

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
soon would be great so or perhaps there

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.619 
soon would be great so or perhaps there
could<00:03:51.919> be<00:03:51.949> a<00:03:52.040> brand<00:03:52.459> new<00:03:52.639> character<00:03:52.879> brand<00:03:53.449> new

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.290 
with him or they could you know try a
different<00:05:00.919> Pokemon<00:05:01.580> approach<00:05:01.880> maybe<00:05:02.150> they

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
different Pokemon approach maybe they

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.020 
different Pokemon approach maybe they
should<00:05:02.479> go<00:05:03.110> with<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.590> different<00:05:03.800> trainer<00:05:04.310> maybe

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030

they should get a new character maybe
maybe<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.639> next<00:05:07.759> characters<00:05:08.210> focus<00:05:08.840> will<00:05:09.050> be

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
maybe the next characters focus will be

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.080 
maybe the next characters focus will be
like<00:05:09.380> contests<00:05:10.160> or<00:05:10.280> something<00:05:10.699> or<00:05:10.910> maybe
