frame<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> newer<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.700> one<00:01:41.939> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
frame this is a newer one this one is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.450 
frame this is a newer one this one is
like<00:01:42.899> from<00:01:43.560> last<00:01:43.770> year<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> year<00:01:44.310> before

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
like from last year or the year before

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.039 
like from last year or the year before
but<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:46.380> brand<00:01:46.860> new<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:48.240> it's

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
but this one is out brand new and it's

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.740 
but this one is out brand new and it's
really<00:01:49.590> thick<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.640> whole<00:01:50.820> lot<00:01:51.030> bigger<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
really thick it's a whole lot bigger and

heavier and I think these are like 249
and<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:54.930> these<00:01:55.049> were<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.590> 99<00:01:56.130> cents<00:01:56.430> but

and I think these were like 99 cents but

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.639 
and I think these were like 99 cents but
this<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.840> went<00:01:57.990> ahead<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.320> glued<00:01:58.500> on
