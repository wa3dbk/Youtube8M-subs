00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.190
 The graphic settings are like this

 The version of the sky EVER is using 34 points 16 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.440
 I am not an old storage driver 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:06.720
 It is a driver about last September, though 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.270
 Depending on the driver, fps may or may not come out often 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.590
 Because there is 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.590
 Here is fine Thailand 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.650
 9 Once you know how to download the driver 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.390

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.090
 nb I will go 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.950
 Because it comes out first 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.680
 The 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.790
 Not at home 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 From the tab of this driver 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.380
 When I click a driver in the data driver box 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.940
 It will be this wall 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.030
 Here 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.230
 If you choose the type of product 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.650
 Also it's certain of by Kyura 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.000
 with os 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.440
 Select a dog and search 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.770
 As 9 drivers come out like this, 9 and Tenchi 6 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.750
 This 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:02.070
 If you click this, it will start loading 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.400
 The lowland rock's pride comes from a driver who says " This is a fish by 3" 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.240
 Because fps seems to call 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.240
 It is full of energy here 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:21.250
 I think some people have 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:26.970
 I can display fps in the upper right in hot water like this 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.970
 But I think that some people say In this way the stalls is increasing roughly 1 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.220
 Oh sorry 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.220
 this is 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.220
 Yes 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.670
 Yes 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:01.030
 This is horror bf 4 is installed now but individual files of this 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:06.069
 Say user cfg 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.850
 The file is a file that was not originally installed 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:14.030
 Selling this with notepad 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.030
 It'd only be saved by Dame from this raw 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.540
 The 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.800
 Is this and say what is written here 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.940
 The face came out in the upper right corner a while ago 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.850
 This causes fps to be displayed. 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.090
 It is 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.450
 And the guy below 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.140
 In what ps control wears 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.350
 b 4 changes fps limit by default 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.220
 200 people 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.380
 It is set so that f piece will not come out more than medicine 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.540
 The 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:50.440
 At first we heard this with rumor of the wind, but beef 4 enforcement fps 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.440
 When applied to like this 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:58.000
 Most because I heard a rumor that say no out piece takes too fa extra load 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.650
 I'm cutting 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.370
 If this number is 0, the fps limit will not apply. 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.050
 Here are three other than zero, for example, 50 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.980
 140 and tips 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.940
 There are more fps than the input number 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.940
 We have from the temple 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.050
 This is sweet fx 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.520

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:44.260
 Do what the suite fx do and just do it for people 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:47.190
 The chair tex which is now vacant is the screen which became effective 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.190
 It is in a state 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.280
 Turn off 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.040
 It was to Yes off 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.020
 More overall blurry and color taste changes 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.870
