00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
does tend to be a little bit more

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.590

sluggish<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.909> jailbreaking<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
sluggish when you jailbreaking you

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.450 
sluggish when you jailbreaking you
install<00:01:39.869> these<00:01:40.020> applications<00:01:40.710> they<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.250> does

I'm<00:01:41.909> not<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> debate<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.320> very<00:01:43.560> long

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
I'm not going to debate that very long

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.980 
I'm not going to debate that very long
but<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.670> iphone<00:01:45.030> did<00:01:45.630> many<00:01:45.930> times

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
but you know my iphone did many times

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.749 
but you know my iphone did many times
I've<00:01:46.350> jailbroken<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:46.979> iphone<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.490> little

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
I've jailbroken my iphone is a little

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.460 
I've jailbroken my iphone is a little
bit<00:01:47.880> more<00:01:48.000> sluggish<00:01:48.329> than<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.229> when<00:01:49.409> I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
bit more sluggish than it is when I

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.010 
bit more sluggish than it is when I
don't<00:01:49.710> jailbreak<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.759> all<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.060> aside<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
don't jailbreak so all that aside I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.389 
don't jailbreak so all that aside I
think<00:01:52.049> Apple<00:01:52.649> should<00:01:52.770> include<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.250> by

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
think Apple should include this by

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
think Apple should include this by
default<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.240> think<00:01:54.479> if<00:01:54.600> Apple<00:01:54.990> does<00:01:55.259> it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
default and I think if Apple does it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380 
default and I think if Apple does it
they'll<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.159> right<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.909> know<00:01:57.030> you'll<00:01:57.210> have

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
they'll do it right you know you'll have

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.179 
they'll do it right you know you'll have
hooks<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.869> YouTube<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:58.979> hooks

the subject to even say that but that's
some<00:03:43.669> reasons<00:03:44.030> why<00:03:44.060> people<00:03:44.419> will<00:03:44.720> do<00:03:44.870> that

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
some reasons why people will do that
