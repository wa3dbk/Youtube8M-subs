00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
ghost gets shot in sort of like the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.680 
ghost gets shot in sort of like the
lower<00:02:05.119> abdomen<00:02:06.049> area<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.970> it's<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.420> clean

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
lower abdomen area and and it's a clean

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.410 
lower abdomen area and and it's a clean
shot<00:02:09.110> too<00:02:09.440> because<00:02:09.739> when<00:02:09.920> he<00:02:10.429> gets<00:02:10.850> thrown<00:02:11.150> on

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
shot too because when he gets thrown on

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.780 
shot too because when he gets thrown on
and<00:02:12.050> when<00:02:12.260> he<00:02:12.350> seemed<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.739> thrown<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.550> shot

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
and when he seemed that thrown the shot

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.520 
and when he seemed that thrown the shot
has<00:02:13.910> gone<00:02:14.090> all<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.330> way<00:02:14.420> through<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.260> can't

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
has gone all the way through so it can't

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.120 
has gone all the way through so it can't
really<00:02:16.810> rupture<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.959> arteries<00:02:18.530> anymore

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
really rupture in the arteries anymore

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.729 
really rupture in the arteries anymore
so<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:20.150> think<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.870> then<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.080> think<00:02:21.380> he<00:02:21.470> passed

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
so I think and then I think he passed

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.160 
so I think and then I think he passed
out<00:02:21.950> because<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.280> paint<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.819> they<00:02:23.569> took<00:02:23.900> out

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
out because the paint and they took out

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.699 
out because the paint and they took out
ghosts<00:02:25.360> they<00:02:26.360> said<00:02:26.720> when<00:02:27.080> they<00:02:27.170> made<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.530> game

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
ghosts they said when they made the game

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.460 
ghosts they said when they made the game
that<00:02:27.950> ghost<00:02:28.220> said<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:29.209> part<00:02:29.569> in<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.750> game<00:02:29.989> he

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
that ghost said in a part in the game he

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.500 
that ghost said in a part in the game he
said<00:02:30.680> why<00:02:30.830> do<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.069> either<00:02:31.130> wear<00:02:31.400> these<00:02:31.580> fire

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
said why do we either wear these fire

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.759 
said why do we either wear these fire
proof<00:02:32.900> vests<00:02:33.620> or<00:02:34.190> something<00:02:34.819> to<00:02:35.569> Roach<00:02:35.870> and

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.710 

that's<00:02:39.769> why<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.040> think<00:02:40.220> he<00:02:40.459> survives<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.239> and

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
that's why I think he survives and and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.000 
that's why I think he survives and and
they<00:02:42.290> only<00:02:42.530> pour<00:02:42.769> gasoline<00:02:43.040> on<00:02:43.400> Roach<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.769> the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
they only pour gasoline on Roach and the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.430 
they only pour gasoline on Roach and the
fire<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.400> only<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:46.880> Roach<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.720> when<00:02:48.319> the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
fire is only on Roach and when the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.300 
fire is only on Roach and when the
mission<00:02:48.769> ends<00:02:49.340> as<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.970> can<00:02:50.180> see<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.720> says

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
mission ends as you can see it says

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.020 
mission ends as you can see it says
ka-ki<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.690> roach<00:02:53.690> does<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.830> say<00:02:55.069> killed<00:02:55.819> in
