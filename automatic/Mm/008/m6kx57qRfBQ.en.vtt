2009 by mirror I made another video
because<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.309> basically<00:00:08.460> decided<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:09.240> other<00:00:09.389> one

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
because I basically decided my other one

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.950 
because I basically decided my other one
was<00:00:09.660> bad<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:11.090> I'll<00:00:12.090> start<00:00:12.389> with<00:00:12.450> all<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.630> parts

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
was bad so I'll start with all the parts

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you got elects see if 3 or 3 x rims the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.460 
you got elects see if 3 or 3 x rims the
spokes<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.490> really<00:00:17.789> durable<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:19.199> rim<00:00:19.380> is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
spokes are really durable and the rim is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.650 
spokes are really durable and the rim is
really<00:00:19.650> nice<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.609> saw<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.090> black<00:00:21.420> finish

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
on the tires you can probably get new

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.419 
on the tires you can probably get new
ones<00:00:24.900> because<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.519> go<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.699> trail<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> lot<00:00:27.449> um
