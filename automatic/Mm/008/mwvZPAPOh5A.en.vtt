where there wouldn't be like a bump in
the<00:00:19.380> middle<00:00:19.650> because<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:20.010> hate<00:00:20.310> how<00:00:20.490> those<00:00:20.850> look

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the way here and then you also have to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.240 
the way here and then you also have to
make<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.379> slit<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.039> group

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
make a little slit here so it can group

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.160

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and it's the same way you'd make a tube

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
and it's the same way you'd make a tube
top<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.570> didn't<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.260> you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
top if you didn't have like if you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.410 
aren't good at selling which I'm not and
what<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.680> use<00:01:13.950> cut<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.820> sleeves<00:01:15.090> down

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
what you do is use cut the sleeves down

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.710 
what you do is use cut the sleeves down
and<00:01:15.840> also<00:01:16.619> cut<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> hemline<00:01:17.570> then<00:01:18.570> also

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and also cut off the hemline then also

and also cut off the hemline then also
you<00:01:19.229> cut<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.220> slips<00:01:20.640> onto<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> sides

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
you cut little slips onto the sides

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.749 
you cut little slips onto the sides
after<00:01:22.439> you'd<00:01:22.590> cut<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> whether<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.610> was

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
after you'd cut it to whether it was

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.580 
after you'd cut it to whether it was
pretty<00:01:23.939> much<00:01:24.030> two<00:01:24.479> sheets<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.960> fabric<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
pretty much two sheets of fabric and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.560 
pretty much two sheets of fabric and
then<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> cut<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:26.790> slip<00:01:27.030> slips<00:01:27.390> into

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
then you cut a little slip slips into

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
then you cut a little slip slips into
the<00:01:27.720> sides<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.229> time<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.860> when<00:01:29.610> you

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the sides and one time and when you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670 
the sides and one time and when you
actually<00:01:29.909> wear<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.570> stretches<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> little<00:01:31.500> bit

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
actually wear it stretches a little bit

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
actually wear it stretches a little bit
so<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.670> some<00:01:33.030> skin<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:34.140> doesn't<00:01:34.350> look

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
so you can see some skin it doesn't look

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.749 
so you can see some skin it doesn't look
like<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.009> once<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.340> wear<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
like that now but once you wear it you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.700 
like that now but once you wear it you
can<00:01:35.970> see<00:01:36.180> some<00:01:36.390> skin<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.470> put<00:01:37.590> this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
can see some skin so you can put this

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.859 
can see some skin so you can put this
over<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> bathing<00:01:38.250> suit<00:01:38.700> well<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> guess<00:01:39.689> if

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
over a bathing suit well I guess if

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.179 
over a bathing suit well I guess if
you're<00:01:39.990> wearing<00:01:40.200> small<00:01:40.439> enough<00:01:40.680> panties<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you're wearing small enough panties you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.149 
you're wearing small enough panties you
could<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.770> put<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.009> over

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
could do that but or you can put it over

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.160 
could do that but or you can put it over
some<00:01:44.490> jeans<00:01:44.729> which<00:01:44.909> also<00:01:45.090> also<00:01:45.509> looks<00:01:45.869> really

and<00:02:13.090> some<00:02:13.780> there's<00:02:14.170> also<00:02:14.350> things<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.160> can<00:02:15.310> do

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
and some there's also things you can do

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.820 
and some there's also things you can do
to<00:02:15.760> where<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> fray<00:02:16.450> won't<00:02:16.750> come<00:02:16.900> out<00:02:17.020> but<00:02:17.770> I

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
to where the fray won't come out but I

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.230 
to where the fray won't come out but I
actually<00:02:17.920> kind<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.370> liked<00:02:18.550> how<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.760> fray<00:02:19.030> look

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.610 
actually kind of liked how the fray look
so<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.510> kept<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.840> on<00:02:19.930> there<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.290> only<00:02:20.440> have<00:02:20.590> to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
so I kept it on there you only have to

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.080 
so I kept it on there you only have to
cut<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.860> every<00:02:21.130> once<00:02:21.310> it'll<00:02:21.520> also<00:02:21.640> doesn't<00:02:22.000> get

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
cut it every once it'll also doesn't get

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.450 
cut it every once it'll also doesn't get
like<00:02:22.240> really<00:02:23.050> long<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.590> annoying<00:02:23.860> like<00:02:24.190> that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
like really long and annoying like that

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.870 
like really long and annoying like that
and<00:02:25.210> then<00:02:26.200> that's<00:02:26.440> what<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:27.340> same<00:02:27.550> thing<00:02:27.790> I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
and then that's what I the same thing I

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.360 
and then that's what I the same thing I
did<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:28.240> these<00:02:28.600> three<00:02:29.560> ones<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.220> was

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
did with these three ones this was

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.120 
did with these three ones this was
actually<00:02:30.550> pretty<00:02:30.880> ugly<00:02:31.270> but<00:02:31.770> guess<00:02:32.770> if<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.010> ever

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
actually pretty ugly but guess if I ever

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.800 
actually pretty ugly but guess if I ever
need<00:02:33.430> khaki<00:02:33.880> shorts<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.450> then<00:02:35.170> also<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:39.310> one

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
need khaki shorts and then also this one

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.880 
need khaki shorts and then also this one
which<00:02:40.810> actually<00:02:40.990> looks<00:02:41.320> better<00:02:41.410> when<00:02:41.740> you

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
which actually looks better when you

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.510 
which actually looks better when you
like<00:02:42.360> actually<00:02:43.360> make<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.600> pretty<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:45.250> I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520
