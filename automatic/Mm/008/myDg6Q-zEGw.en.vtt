00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.540
 a sleeping hands on longer 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.390
 biking 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.040
 who does not know 80 percent of all 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.890
 Cyclists complain about it 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.690
 but why sleep hands one the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.760
 Hand gets annoyed by two central 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.730
 crossed the ulmer and the kapperl 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.220
 more if colloquially from the capone 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.949
 spoken syndrome is meant a 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.290
 sleeping, or sore hands at 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.989
 Pressure in the bale area reacts to the una 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.390
 Nervous negative therefore this pressure leads 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.440
 to numbness and weakening in 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.520
 the hand musculature 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.290
 the second cause is the cup at the nerve 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.119
 the angled hand in connection with 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.250
 pressure on the handlebar leads to 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.710
 numbness and weakness on thumb 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.149
 middle and index fingers 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.640
 in severe cases it can happen 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.009
 that numbness persists long after 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.200
 the tour stops or even overnight 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.840
 Worse is the fabric at night 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.060
 easy to do 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.970
 this is exactly where shifter uses the bio 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.149
 excelsis topic and thus prevents it 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.880
 problem in front of ng poster in the palm of your hand 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.100
 area relieves the nerve in this 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.610
 area runs and absorbs it 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.069
 the pressure and vibrations of the handlebar 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.190
 the bio excelsis team consists of one 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.679
 two-stage construction that is above the 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.110
 Gel pad on the outside band is still one 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.410
 second padding with which the pillow 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.209
 total is 8 mm thick and therefore for 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.250
 sufficient relief in the medium range 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.930
 the hand on the cape provides a tunnel 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.630
 It also makes the hand gesture 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.610
 stabilized as nerves and longing for 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.680
 pressure released 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.350
 the organic excelle glove from china 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.630

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.270
 color variety as well as a good one 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.920
 price-performance ratio 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.380
 the processed materials are 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.180
 very high quality the upholstery 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.830
 sit in the right places and 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.200
 The hand nestle well 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.930
 the double seams guarantee one 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.850
 long shelf life with a gentle one 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.700
 Sensitive fabrics specially developed 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.470
 Velcro was careful that rats 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.840
 Clothing when washing not on the net 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.820
 Keeps hanging 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.260
 through specially fitted sleep leaves 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.570
 he undress easily 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.489
 a good fourth use for sweat 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.500
 wiping makes for a dry nose 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.300
 and forehead 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.160
 The glove has a good fit and 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.520
 is of course washable 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.560
 Conclusion of the bio excelle probably can not 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.450
 all problems with 1 sleeping hands 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.890
 and eliminate pain but in 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.810
 connection with ergonomic 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.360
 handlebar grips and a good attitude 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.860
 the sitting position should be the complaints 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.220
 for the most part the past 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.830
 Choose totally forgives with good 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.830
 certain the predicate top favorite
