00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
all right got a very interesting

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.020 
all right got a very interesting
comparison<00:00:13.420> for<00:00:13.630> you<00:00:13.690> here<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:15.250> this<00:00:15.460> clip<00:00:15.820> we

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.030 
comparison for you here in this clip we

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.019 
comparison for you here in this clip we
are<00:00:16.150> taking<00:00:16.540> a<00:00:16.630> peek<00:00:16.900> at<00:00:17.170> two<00:00:17.560> diamonds<00:00:18.190> now

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
are taking a peek at two diamonds now

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.820 
are taking a peek at two diamonds now
listen<00:00:19.390> carefully<00:00:19.570> because<00:00:20.080> both<00:00:20.500> of<00:00:20.529> these

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
listen carefully because both of these

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.359 
listen carefully because both of these
diamonds<00:00:21.640> have<00:00:22.290> optical<00:00:23.290> properties<00:00:24.010> that

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
diamonds have optical properties that

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.679 
diamonds have optical properties that
meet<00:00:24.759> both<00:00:25.560> GI<00:00:26.560> a<00:00:26.740> excellent<00:00:27.669> and<00:00:27.820> a<00:00:28.390> GS<00:00:28.900> ideal

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
meet both GI a excellent and a GS ideal

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.380 
meet both GI a excellent and a GS ideal
and<00:00:31.689> so<00:00:31.960> far<00:00:32.259> as<00:00:32.410> your<00:00:32.560> brightness/contrast

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and so far as your brightness/contrast

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.069 
and so far as your brightness/contrast
fire<00:00:34.390> and<00:00:34.660> sparkle<00:00:35.190> okay<00:00:36.480> now<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:38.050> only

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
fire and sparkle okay now the only

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.189 
fire and sparkle okay now the only
difference<00:00:38.980> between<00:00:39.489> these<00:00:40.000> two<00:00:40.390> diamonds<00:00:40.899> is

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
difference between these two diamonds is

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.069 
difference between these two diamonds is
one<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.680> them<00:00:41.859> is<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.840> beautiful<00:00:43.840> picture

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
one of them is a beautiful picture

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.889 
one of them is a beautiful picture
perfect<00:00:44.649> toughts<00:00:44.859> and<00:00:45.100> arrows<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.719> one<00:00:46.719> of

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
perfect toughts and arrows and one of

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.319 
perfect toughts and arrows and one of
them<00:00:47.050> has<00:00:47.289> optical<00:00:47.829> symmetry<00:00:48.550> that's<00:00:48.910> more

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
them has optical symmetry that's more

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.590 
them has optical symmetry that's more
chaotic<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:51.309> know<00:00:51.460> like<00:00:51.760> so<00:00:52.000> it<00:00:52.149> is<00:00:52.269> one<00:00:52.480> of

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
chaotic you know like so it is one of

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.270 
chaotic you know like so it is one of
them<00:00:52.719> isn't<00:00:53.170> cut<00:00:53.440> as<00:00:53.649> precisely<00:00:54.340> as<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.660> other

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
them isn't cut as precisely as the other

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.389 
them isn't cut as precisely as the other
can<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:57.399> take<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:57.699> guess<00:00:57.820> which<00:00:58.539> one<00:00:58.929> isn't<00:00:59.829> cut

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
can you take a guess which one isn't cut

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.189 
can you take a guess which one isn't cut
as<00:01:00.640> precisely<00:01:02.609> okay<00:01:03.609> which<00:01:04.030> one<00:01:04.300> is<00:01:04.900> if

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
as precisely okay which one is if

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.780 
as precisely okay which one is if
there's<00:01:05.440> one<00:01:05.500> diamond<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.190> looks<00:01:06.370> like<00:01:06.520> it<00:01:06.640> has

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
there's one diamond it looks like it has

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.020 
there's one diamond it looks like it has
a<00:01:06.820> more<00:01:07.150> symmetrical<00:01:08.190> pattern<00:01:09.190> of<00:01:09.460> bright<00:01:09.760> and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
a more symmetrical pattern of bright and

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.790 
a more symmetrical pattern of bright and
dark<00:01:10.270> reflections<00:01:11.110> which<00:01:11.350> one<00:01:11.590> would<00:01:11.740> you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
dark reflections which one would you

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.130 
dark reflections which one would you
have<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.189> say<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.520> was<00:01:12.729> just<00:01:13.540> as<00:01:13.689> you<00:01:13.810> look<00:01:14.020> at

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
have to say it was just as you look at

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.050 
have to say it was just as you look at
these<00:01:14.290> two<00:01:14.560> diamonds<00:01:14.979> in<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.340> face-up<00:01:15.610> view

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
these two diamonds in the face-up view

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.429 
these two diamonds in the face-up view
we're<00:01:16.299> looking<00:01:16.509> at<00:01:16.600> them<00:01:16.720> from<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:16.960> angles

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
we're looking at them from the angles

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.010 
we're looking at them from the angles
too<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.850> in<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.090> face<00:01:19.360> of<00:01:19.390> view<00:01:19.810> for

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
too but in the face of view for

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.319 
too but in the face of view for
brightness<00:01:20.439> and<00:01:20.619> contrast<00:01:21.060> okay<00:01:22.060> if<00:01:22.180> you

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
brightness and contrast okay if you

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.749 
brightness and contrast okay if you
guess<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.900> diamond<00:01:23.380> on<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.770> right<00:01:24.070> is<00:01:24.310> having

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
guess the diamond on the right is having

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.450 
guess the diamond on the right is having
the<00:01:24.850> more<00:01:25.030> perfect<00:01:25.570> optical<00:01:26.200> symmetry<00:01:26.799> you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
the more perfect optical symmetry you

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.520 
the more perfect optical symmetry you
would<00:01:27.610> be<00:01:27.759> correct<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.659> is<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:28.899> hearts<00:01:29.350> and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
would be correct this is a hearts and

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.520 
would be correct this is a hearts and
arrows<00:01:29.649> diamond<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:31.509> one<00:01:31.810> isn't

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
arrows diamond this one isn't

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.690 
arrows diamond this one isn't
okay<00:01:33.430> in<00:01:33.640> fact<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:34.149> one<00:01:34.590> came<00:01:35.590> in<00:01:35.829> is<00:01:36.640> a

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
okay in fact this one came in is a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.670 
okay in fact this one came in is a
diamond<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.360> we<00:01:37.479> have<00:01:37.719> we<00:01:38.290> took<00:01:38.469> on

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
down to it on from a mathematical and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.770 
down to it on from a mathematical and
precision<00:02:27.550> perspective<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.300> hots<00:02:29.540> and

precision perspective the hots and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.680 
precision perspective the hots and
arrows<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.350> cut<00:02:30.650> more<00:02:30.920> precisely<00:02:31.490> but<00:02:32.180> they

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
arrows is cut more precisely but they

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.140 
arrows is cut more precisely but they
are<00:02:32.930> both<00:02:33.380> beautiful<00:02:33.860> diamonds<00:02:34.550> in<00:02:34.670> fact<00:02:34.910> I

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
are both beautiful diamonds in fact I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.390 
are both beautiful diamonds in fact I
would<00:02:35.630> back<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:36.080> diamond<00:02:36.560> like<00:02:36.710> this<00:02:36.740> with

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
would back a diamond like this with

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.010 
would back a diamond like this with
lifetime<00:02:37.640> policies<00:02:38.740> okay<00:02:40.660> because<00:02:41.660> it's

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
lifetime policies okay because it's

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.920 
lifetime policies okay because it's
optics<00:02:42.620> fall<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.280> rare<00:02:43.760> zenith<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.660> g
