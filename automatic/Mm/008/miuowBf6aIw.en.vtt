about the differences as far as
incorporating<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.859> power<00:00:08.099> clean<00:00:08.519> or<00:00:08.880> any

incorporating the power clean or any
kind<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.360> clean<00:00:09.690> movement<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.260> your<00:00:10.380> system

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
kind of clean movement in your system

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.079 
kind of clean movement in your system
and<00:00:11.750> high<00:00:12.750> pools<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.349> my<00:00:14.070> opinion<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.790> very

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
and high pools and my opinion it's very

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.700 
and high pools and my opinion it's very
difficult<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.719> try<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.020> incorporate<00:00:16.260> them

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
difficult to try to incorporate them

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.920 
difficult to try to incorporate them
both<00:00:16.920> not<00:00:17.250> sure<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.150> high<00:00:18.359> pool<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
both not sure that the high pool is a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.710 
both not sure that the high pool is a
good<00:00:19.439> exercise<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.670> enhance<00:00:21.000> technique<00:00:21.510> on

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
good exercise to enhance technique on

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.400 
good exercise to enhance technique on
the<00:00:21.960> clean<00:00:22.430> invited<00:00:23.430> versa<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.050> issue

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the clean invited versa so the one issue

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.700 
the clean invited versa so the one issue
with<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.640> clean<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.750> positive<00:00:28.349> end<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.619> it

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
with the clean is the positive end of it

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.160 
with the clean is the positive end of it
is<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.189> there<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.970> finality<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.599> lift<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.019> to

in the performance of the movement based

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.299 
in the performance of the movement based
on<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> height<00:00:39.480> again<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.410> lot<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.829> times<00:00:41.040> once

on the height again a lot of times once

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.590 
on the height again a lot of times once
you<00:00:41.430> get<00:00:41.610> pretty<00:00:41.820> heavy<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> high<00:00:42.360> put

those hips through once a week gets

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.400 
those hips through once a week gets
heavier<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> half<00:00:48.930> things<00:00:49.170> pulling

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
heavier you have a half things pulling

really getting full full extension in
the<00:00:53.489> benefit<00:00:53.940> with<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> clean<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.750> high<00:00:54.899> pole

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the benefit with the clean and high pole

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.389 
the benefit with the clean and high pole
they<00:00:55.320> both<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> triple<00:00:56.190> extension

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
component with a high pool it's really

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.670 
component with a high pool it's really
easy<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.390> cheat<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.469> thing

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
easy to kind of cheat that so one thing

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.250 
easy to kind of cheat that so one thing
that<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.129> got<00:01:02.489> probably<00:01:02.940> bought<00:01:03.149> over<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> decade

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that I got probably bought over a decade

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.649 
that I got probably bought over a decade
ago<00:01:04.379> from<00:01:05.250> an<00:01:05.400> article<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:06.240> far<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
ago from an article as far as the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.710 
ago from an article as far as the
targeted<00:01:07.080> high<00:01:07.170> pool<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.590> using<00:01:07.950> bands<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
targeted high pool and using bands to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.490 
targeted high pool and using bands to
create<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:11.390> objectivity<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.750> the

create some kind of objectivity in the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.840 
create some kind of objectivity in the
movement<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.460> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
movement so you have kind of a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090 
movement so you have kind of a
quantitative<00:01:15.450> measure<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.869> far<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.170> how<00:01:16.380> how

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
quantitative measure as far as how how

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.399 
quantitative measure as far as how how
high<00:01:17.400> you're<00:01:17.909> pulling<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.420> bar<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.200> again

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
high you're pulling that bar so again

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.100 
high you're pulling that bar so again
with<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.890> setup<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.000> Iraq<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.720> way<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.960> did

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
with this setup in Iraq the way we did

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.719 
with this setup in Iraq the way we did
it<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.619> minivan<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.189> carabiner

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it was just a minivan in the carabiner

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.760 
it was just a minivan in the carabiner
and<00:01:24.000> again<00:01:24.450> now<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.290> your<00:01:25.439> doing<00:01:25.619> from

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and again now you with your doing from

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.010 
and again now you with your doing from
the<00:01:25.860> floor<00:01:26.130> from<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> hand<00:01:26.729> regardless<00:01:27.030> if

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the floor from the hand regardless if

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.330 
the floor from the hand regardless if
I'm<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:28.530> ahead<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.860> execute<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
I'm going to go ahead and execute the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.160 
I'm going to go ahead and execute the
hypos<00:01:29.909> all<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.479> doin<00:01:30.780> technique-wise

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
hypos all of you doin technique-wise

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.719 
hypos all of you doin technique-wise
doesn't<00:01:31.860> matter<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.390> standard

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
doesn't matter but now I have a standard

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.980 
doesn't matter but now I have a standard
area<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.909> pull<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> away<00:01:36.270> from<00:01:36.890> hook<00:01:37.890> way<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
area to pull it away from hook way to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.240 
area to pull it away from hook way to
now<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.220> adjust<00:01:41.659> these<00:01:42.659> bands<00:01:43.409> based<00:01:43.950> on

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
now you can adjust these bands based on

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.249 
now you can adjust these bands based on
height<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> athlete<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.990> if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> have

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
height of the athlete so if you have

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.630 
height of the athlete so if you have
different<00:01:46.619> height<00:01:46.740> athletes<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.460> come

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
intensity you want for that pole so you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.929 
intensity you want for that pole so you
might<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.159> week<00:01:56.369> where<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> want<00:01:56.820> your

might have one week where you want your
athletes<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> pull<00:01:57.540> heavy<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.170> might<00:01:58.350> set

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
athletes to pull heavy you might set

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.080 
athletes to pull heavy you might set
these<00:01:58.770> bands<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.250> belly<00:01:59.520> button<00:01:59.820> level

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
these bands up belly button level

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090 
these bands up belly button level
understanding<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:01.170> might<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.860> again

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
understanding you might have it so again

you're<00:02:05.950> going<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.160> do<00:02:06.280> but<00:02:06.430> again<00:02:06.670> that's

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
you're going to do but again that's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.359 
you're going to do but again that's
another<00:02:07.000> way<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.900> can<00:02:08.110> adjust<00:02:08.410> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
another way that you can adjust the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
intensity of the movement based on the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.380 
intensity of the movement based on the
height<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.130> pull<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.640> again<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.270> gives

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
height of the pull and again it gives

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.930 
height of the pull and again it gives
you<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.600> little<00:02:13.750> bit<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.070> objectivity<00:02:15.070> when<00:02:15.850> you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
you a little bit of objectivity when you

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.880 
you a little bit of objectivity when you
perform<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:16.750> again<00:02:17.020> if<00:02:17.170> you're<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.650> person

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
perform that so again if you're a person

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.860 
perform that so again if you're a person
it's<00:02:18.250> not<00:02:18.460> comfortable<00:02:18.760> cleans<00:02:19.210> you<00:02:19.570> want<00:02:19.780> to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.570 
it's not comfortable cleans you want to
do<00:02:20.260> some<00:02:20.470> high<00:02:20.650> post<00:02:20.920> but<00:02:21.160> you're<00:02:21.310> afraid<00:02:21.400> of

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
do some high post but you're afraid of

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.030 
do some high post but you're afraid of

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
just not being able to standardize them

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.870 
just not being able to standardize them
this<00:02:24.460> may<00:02:24.670> be<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.880> good<00:02:25.150> tool<00:02:25.330> for<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.750> use
