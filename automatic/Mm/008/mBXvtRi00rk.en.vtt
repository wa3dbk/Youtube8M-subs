 Hello everyone today, I want you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.830
 tell why it does not work 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.170
 microphone 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.090
 for example, I ran into such a problem 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.910
 to on lenovo b590 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.510
 then there was a problem like that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.539
 read the sites and found this hint and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.500
 problems why look at we go start 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.500
 then to the control panel 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.290
 looking for a label sound click sound 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 This panel opens 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.030
 playback and recording click on 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.450
 record know when you say should 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 be and and here this scale is fighting that is 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.660
 fill in click push properties 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.210
 in order to check which tee 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.640
 standing on your laptop or computer 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 push properties 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.020
 further on vitim controller but this one is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.540
 this driver on that laptops was so 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.930
 the problem is that there was no 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.470
 realtek and microsoft that is some 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.880
 grass 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.700
 that is, the speakers worked and the microphone did not 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.750
 to know to solve the problem can be 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.549
 download from the site 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:33.680
 so now where is the reference 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:37.340
 this site is its name then 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.689
 displayed here is a shortcut appears 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.780
 audio realtek lenovo 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.430
 well, it is for everyone 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.860
 and for windows 7 that is, then after 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.580
 unpacking she quickly unpacked in 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.580
 the same folder of the sofa is located 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.110
 there is such a daddy click on 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.380
 her and then set 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.290
 that is, it is not an installation shortcut 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.170
 which installs it is still unpacking 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.420
 This set without problems or anything 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.170
 do not need to do anything delete any 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.600
 driver all automatically replaced but 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.570
 in principle, then sort out the same 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.680
 the most it is possible even easier for us 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:28.910
 click on the speaker recording 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:33.550
 device and after that still need 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.550
 configure ie push properties 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:42.050
 There were candles and it was highlighted 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:44.810
 new panel to the improvement here is nothing 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:50.290
 no threesome on but everything automatically 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:55.940
 distributes that you can then push 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:03:00.290
 in addition here everything should be the same 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.840
 be then to level means desirable 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.799
 if you have a weak microphone set 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.360
 microphone gain to full because 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.560
 microphone quality 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.340
 different true but the mass of the microphone on a hundred 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.780
 percent of buildings well, basically everything 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.780
 such a problem was
