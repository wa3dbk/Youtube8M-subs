00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.950
 if we analyze the game in its entirety 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:16.379
 we can not say that a draw can not be 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.359
 does not reflect the physiognomy of the match I 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.840
 think that in the first half paris 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.000
 saint germain was superior to monaco 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.680
 we first scored this goal and we 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 created some opportunities 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.119
 a few situations to mark this 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.859
 second goal we did not do it I think 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.230
 that monaco came back with others 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.630
 other ambitions 2nd and another scheme 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.820
 tactical too but I believe that with 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.140
 a lot more motivation and try 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.840
 to annoy us much more than he 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.420
 had done in the first half they have 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.129
 managed to do led I think 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.739
 it was a little too rested on that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.649
 score there we notably rolled back 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.539
 our team block that allowed monaco 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.449
 to have some situation too 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.649
 dangerous and to equalize by me among 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.190
 an opportunity that are provided in 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.789
 second half time 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.710
 so here after after this equalization 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.210
 the team wanted to leave a little bit of 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.760
 forward since we had come for 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.530
 win that game and we could have 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330
 do on the last opportunity that we 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.549
 got procured 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 but here's a draw in Monaco it's 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.590
 not a bad result even if we 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.590
 was hoping better 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.500
 I 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.970
 abela nothing is changed on the plane 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:37.410
 accountant as you know and that 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.820
 bothered -who yeah we had the opportunity 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.410
 to put 8 points but it's done 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.500
 came we came to make them 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.100
 that they had come looking for I 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.930
 think I think about the second half 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.440
 time it's not unimportant that monaco 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.910
 even if I think the goalkeeper 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.820
 de Monaco made more than one decisive stop 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.340
 that the guardian of paris saint germain 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.200
 so here we go 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.579
 I think in the first half it's 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.409
 maybe where we missed the check mark because 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.670
 we master and still really 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:19.430
 very well our subject in first mi 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:22.280
 time we have a little too far back 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.110
 my taste even though it was not dangerous 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.940
 very dangerous but it happened to those 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.379
 they were getting closer to our 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.819
 goal so it's still dangerous 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:34.160
 and then on a shift on a 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.989
 center-shot that was deflected by one of our 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.470
 players in our own nets they are 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.440
 got to score that goal so what's that 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.310
 I think on this match if we have 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.450
 regret to have 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.450
 it's mostly in first half yes 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.340
 yes I will find 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.829
 I found a legs I found in 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.690
 the good state of mind I found 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.670
 confident I found enterprising he has 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.349
 been rewarded with one more goal as 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.260
 you know it in stadiums that's 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.260
 important so encouraging 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.319
 problem is that when you take 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.780
 such risks if it works you say 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.760
 how great it is that you are amazed 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.250
 in front of this type of player but when that 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.150
 breakage failed this is the kind of 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.129
 question you ask me I lean 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.780
 for efficiency 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:42.150
 so if you try that kind of thing there 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:49.739
 better to succeed it's his game 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:51.299
 that's why we like no no no 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.400
 it's hard to erase it 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.120
 it will have to increase by the way 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.190
 good training 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.959
 believe me the players see you you 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.400
 see one they are they are still 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.400
 pretty tired enough 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.849
 do not forget that before the match of 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.349
 leverkusen even though the champions league 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.480
 is very important for the club for 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.530
 French football do not forget that 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.260
 we have match Friday against 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.090
 valenciennes who you three points too 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.980
 so that's important 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.209
 I think you saw at the end of 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.190
 training at the end of the match forgiveness 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.080
 there were players who made a 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.100
 extra work at the level at 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.650
 physical level 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.940
 because yes we did we made it 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.729
 hope to have made a good preparation 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.680
 fingers and during the month of january 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.600
 for to be in shape this word on this 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.580
 match on this february forgiveness 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.740
 because we know that we have maturities 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.010
 not important who will have to answer 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.010
 present 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.270
 yes I think it's a little bit 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.180
 still due largely because of 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.410
 of that and then I think we are a 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.419
 little less good we are a little bit 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.280
 less well physically but it's not 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.350
 illogical after the work that we have 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.120
 done after the number do not forget 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.260
 let's not forget also the number 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.210
 matches that we have done since 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.830
 early in the season I know that good 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.389
 in a big club there are a lot of 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.720
 matches but at least given it weighs 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.620
 matches in organizations from above 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.449
 psychological level 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.880
 so that's the month of January was a 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.160
 been complicated it is not too bad 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.539
 left the month of February but dice must 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.000
 to go back to this competition 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.590
 all the more as you know that 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.560
 players can do a lot more 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.750
 this champions league anyway 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.750
 important and saliva 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.070
 we salivate the fact of going back into 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.010
 this competition and I think that 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.910
 physically by then we will be better than 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:48.870
 what we are currently hopefully 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.880
 yes yes it's scheduled for May after 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.550
 you can not know if you will play on 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.810
 a greasy land and it's a hectare of which 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.700
 we can pass that you can programmed 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.560
 also all this to the minute close to the day 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.560
 same real curve is taken again 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.770
 trial 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.090
 yes it's a number one competitor yes 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:17.080
 there's only to see the championship which 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.860
 the players that they have the ambition that they 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:28.620
 so also that's not a surprise 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:28.620
 it's not a surprise gentlemen 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.730
 sorry 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:39.760
 it's better but hey he played he played 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.800
 with gene genes tonight but as 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.150
 you know it is very important for 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.979
 the paris saint germain for the team of the 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.550
 paris saint germain 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:51.460
 it's a decisive player there is to see 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:54.310
 tonight he almost got to be in the 90th 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:57.130
 minute so it's a player we have 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.020
 bad to rest 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.919
 even when there are back problems 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:05.949
 but he did not train himself he was 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.600
 trained before yesterday but he could 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:09.490
 playing today could play without me 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.720
 take insane risks for them 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.729
 matches that arrive 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.960
 so we made a decision to do 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:19.800
 play hockey 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.800
 thank you goodbye good evening
