00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:17.920
 Yes very much this xperia to this time baby-sitter is Utamaru wham in the arc so 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:20.109
 I introduced the overseas version of android 4.0 to 01 c and yeah 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:26.120
 I will try to tell you a little more 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:31.250
 This s 01 and in Japan android os 2.3 point 4 only 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:36.950
 It has not been updated, and it is 4.0 by the usual update of android 4.02. 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.760
 I can not do it, but overseas android 4.0 is officially released 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.070
 It looks like 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:46.110
 Download the log of the overseas board this time 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.910
 Docomo version s to 01 c 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:55.350
 I tried a gun and downloaded the necessary files to install it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.460
 I have to operate a little on a PC etc. I'm a little bothersome 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.820
 For now 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.290
 I introduced it so I will try to show you a little 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.100
 This is the initial screen started this time, but it looks like this 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.259
 It feels like this when you open the drawer 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:15.940
 With docomo's rom, all the docomo related apps that are originally included are not included 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:20.979
 Emmer sp mode mail or something like that is not in that everything is gone 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.950
 In those who use shims of DoCoMo to update to the 4.0 might be a little inconvenient 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.630
 How to use sp mode mail or something virt yourself 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.159
 It seems like you have to install 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.570
 Somehow I just installed Tara as it is when something like a can not be used in decent countryside 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.079
 There was also information 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.610
 That one can not receive automatically or something like that 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:44.079
 Well in also got a can not be used Well well was like a flame or a problem that edge a little 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.620
 I want you to be careful, but in the case of me, I'm thinking of using it for pre-mobile living 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:50.300
 There is no problem in particular 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:54.800
 Oh, it is setting, but when we look at the terminal information of setting 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:58.970
 Model number is lt 18i so it is android version 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.240
 It becomes 4 points 0.3, hey base version like this 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.640
 Mother sister has become something like it looks like 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.649
 In that this time baked ROHM this lt 18 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:14.790
 It is a guy who comes in . I introduced this, so I still burned this log of that string 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:19.920
 Have not been put apps and Kyle anything yet I'm not putting Toka app to do with just 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:25.630
 It seems like the capacity of the app that has been included from that source in the initial state still 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:32.080
 It is capacity that app is included from 99.3 1 mega yuan so it is autumn in initial condition 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:37.630
 The capacity is 323 eyes I feel like this Docomo's genuine rom If it is in the initial state 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:41.580
 The app had information that 180 people were in the ply 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:45.000
 Nde capacity of app that contains from but it is about half the original is a much half 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:50.190
 The amount say I ah from the original has become quite a lot 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.040
 Well in Well Nde built it from the original memory is low I think this place quite happy 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.230
 I feel a little bit messed up 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.569
 It's smooth, especially, I don't feel that it 's heavy or anything, even if I touch it like this 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.519
 It moves smoothly and opens the menu or 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:11.379
 The setting screen on the 4th also works quite smoothly, and I do not feel stress in particular 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:14.560
 Once Kaiserslautern no longer can enter only alphabet that it is why initial state overseas rom 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:20.500
 But once I got an app with Japanese input source 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.560
 For example, on the screen of launching an application to input some characters and inputting high characters in the upper part of this 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.970
 Eco in state 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:31.550
 Teeny something keyboard like a at the part see this status bar of the above 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:35.030
 I've got an icon, but I'm going to lower this and choose an input method. 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:40.010
 What one rectangular line from here Well not press the Poti 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.580
 A value of Tteyuu this po box if you want to Japanese input we have that entered from the original 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.360
 5 people I is written I brackets in Japanese 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:50.400
 If you select it, you will be able to input in Japanese. 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:54.720
 It is not necessary to correspond to flick input anywhere, but the keyboard comes out like this 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.630
 It looks like a decent PC, and it feels like you're typing like this. 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.550
 Come out 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.590
 But the picture favorite Japanese input application on their own Nde does not correspond to the flick input 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:08.410
 I think you should install 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:11.980
 I would recommend installing on that free Open Udo face so this overseas 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:15.620
 If what er introduced a version of the rope say I wanted to wanted to do 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:21.590
 But I do not just say Tatte wanted to use the 06 android 4 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:27.740
 Even before it's sometimes a little it important to come it say something that it is where No. 5 this 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:33.380
 I talked about it, but if it is a fan's job now , it's a genuine log, and this Tamazu DoCoMo is the official sim 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.639
 It does not correspond to unlocking, so even if you plug in another company's shim and start it up 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:41.370
 You can not put out the screen to enter the code 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:46.080
 As we needed it, we wanted to bring out the screen and introduced labor of overseas version 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:50.729
 Just as sump does Unlocked code is put out to say Karato introduced a log of overseas plate 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.819
 It information is as put out maybe I'd not found the net above such Tteyuu made 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.630
 I thought it might be and I introduced it this time 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:05:01.900
 So in the next video 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:07.120
 Shim lock to try actually put Softbank's pre-mobile sim into this 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.900
 I would like to verify whether the screen to enter the release code is out 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.820
 So 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.210
 If the bell tower company code new second shot comes out, it will be next time and the next animation etc. 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.500
 Oh dear 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:22.810
 But I do not know whether become fairly's not a that it purchased a does Unlocked code 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.410
 I really want to try out the fact that I can actually input and unlock. 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.830
 I will 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:33.230
 In this case , this xperia arc so 01 c is an overseas version of 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:38.330
 The story of introducing android 4.0 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:42.440
 If it was 4 and used with docomo's sim, then some of docomo's official various apps already available 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.920
 It's all gone and it's a little like using sp mode mail 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.270
 that 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.780
 I 'm going to have to check out a lot and I think that side is a touch 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.860
 Though 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.220
 If I use it like Softbank's cm like me , it may be pretty good 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:58.710
 Are Well after that do you think 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:01.260
 also recommended people Tteyuu Toka used only data communication using the cesium mvno system 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.500
 I think I can do it, so I see 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.500
