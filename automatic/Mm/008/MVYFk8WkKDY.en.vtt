555 and runes and getting in there but I
feel<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.070> extremely<00:00:29.640> important

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
feel like this is extremely important

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.900 
feel like this is extremely important
and<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.689> will<00:00:30.810> cover<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.500> first<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.579> not<00:00:32.730> gonna

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910

take long

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.790 
take long
because<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.760> fog<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.239> war<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:37.260> something<00:00:37.680> that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
because the fog of war is something that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.270 
because the fog of war is something that
constantly<00:00:38.399> makes<00:00:38.670> us<00:00:38.850> make<00:00:39.030> wrong<00:00:40.020> decisions

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
constantly makes us make wrong decisions

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.420 
constantly makes us make wrong decisions
and<00:00:41.280> still<00:00:42.210> he<00:00:42.390> waters<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.710> most

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and still he waters for it so most

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.790 
and still he waters for it so most
people<00:00:44.579> will<00:00:45.030> never<00:00:45.329> learn<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.440> make

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
people will never learn not to make

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.709 
people will never learn not to make
these<00:00:47.039> decisions

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
these decisions

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.939 
these decisions
I<00:00:48.719> will<00:00:49.050> explain<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.770> right<00:00:50.070> now<00:00:51.800> we<00:00:52.800> are

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
under this fog of war he is deciding

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.960 
under this fog of war he is deciding
this<00:02:20.370> because<00:02:20.880> it's<00:02:21.150> extremely<00:02:21.990> likely<00:02:22.970> and

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
this because it's extremely likely and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.750 
this because it's extremely likely and
he<00:02:24.870> has<00:02:24.990> been<00:02:25.260> deciding<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:25.860> probably<00:02:26.370> for<00:02:26.580> a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
he has been deciding this probably for a

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.180 
he has been deciding this probably for a
couple<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:27.240> times<00:02:27.510> now<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.020> he<00:02:28.710> was<00:02:28.830> right

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
couple of times now and he was right

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.370 
couple of times now and he was right
every<00:02:29.520> time<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.240> like<00:02:30.390> yeah<00:02:30.570> she's<00:02:31.110> there

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380

of<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.560> that's<00:03:55.739> why<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.580> is<00:03:56.640> hard<00:03:57.090> to

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
of it and that's why this is hard to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.199 
of it and that's why this is hard to
master<00:03:58.350> because<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.459> are<00:03:59.580> actually<00:03:59.970> still

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209

being rewarded buts

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.050

you<00:04:03.150> are<00:04:03.360> making<00:04:03.709> 60<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:04.950> these<00:04:05.489> decisions

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
you are making 60 of these decisions

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.170 
you are making 60 of these decisions
every<00:04:06.959> game<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.830> means<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.580> die<00:04:08.820> maybe

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
every game so that means you die maybe

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.370 
every game so that means you die maybe
three<00:04:09.840> or<00:04:10.049> four<00:04:10.530> times<00:04:10.910> just<00:04:11.910> because<00:04:12.450> you

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
three or four times just because you

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.870 
three or four times just because you
were<00:04:14.090> deciding<00:04:15.090> something<00:04:15.330> wasn't

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
were deciding something wasn't

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.260 
were deciding something wasn't
going<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.209> happen<00:04:16.570> which<00:04:17.230> did<00:04:18.660> what<00:04:19.660> yeah<00:04:20.320> and

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
going to happen which did what yeah and

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.600 
going to happen which did what yeah and
this<00:04:22.270> losses<00:04:22.750> you<00:04:23.050> your<00:04:23.290> game<00:04:23.560> if<00:04:23.800> everyone

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
this losses you your game if everyone

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.710 
this losses you your game if everyone
does<00:04:25.360> this<00:04:25.570> more<00:04:25.870> than<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.440> enemy<00:04:26.830> does<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.720> go

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
does this more than the enemy does it go

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.510 
does this more than the enemy does it go
it's<00:04:28.900> never<00:04:29.110> make<00:04:29.380> this<00:04:29.560> mistake<00:04:29.620> boys<00:04:30.250> will

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
it's never make this mistake boys will

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.060 
it's never make this mistake boys will
be<00:04:30.700> like<00:04:30.910> there<00:04:31.870> is<00:04:31.960> a<00:04:31.990> one<00:04:32.230> in<00:04:32.260> fifteen<00:04:32.770> chance

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
be like there is a one in fifteen chance

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.490 
be like there is a one in fifteen chance
there's<00:04:33.460> an<00:04:33.610> enemy<00:04:33.910> there<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:34.900> cannot

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
there's an enemy there so I cannot

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.870 
there's an enemy there so I cannot
afford<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:36.340> take<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:37.000> farm<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:38.880> is

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
exactly why we buy wards we buy wards so

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.350 
exactly why we buy wards we buy wards so
we<00:04:43.630> know<00:04:43.840> for<00:04:44.140> sure<00:04:44.200> that<00:04:44.950> we<00:04:45.580> are<00:04:45.730> safe<00:04:46.030> that

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
we know for sure that we are safe that

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.890 
we know for sure that we are safe that
we<00:04:46.630> are<00:04:46.840> not<00:04:47.050> going<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.440> get<00:04:47.620> ganked<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.900> most

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.740 
we are not going to get ganked and most
of<00:04:50.170> my<00:04:50.320> viewers<00:04:50.680> will<00:04:51.520> probably<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.390> most<00:04:52.510> of

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
of my viewers will probably and most of

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.140 
of my viewers will probably and most of
their<00:04:52.930> games<00:04:53.170> think<00:04:53.590> I'm<00:04:53.830> not<00:04:54.490> gonna<00:04:54.640> buy<00:04:54.940> this
