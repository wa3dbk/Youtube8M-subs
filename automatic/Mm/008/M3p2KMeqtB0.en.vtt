00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.620
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:19.890
 my youtube channel to another 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:22.750
 movie about the ex aircraft x650 pro 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.870
 Now that we have the steweller here 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 I would like to have you fastened to the head 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.040
 next time that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.520
 show configuration program 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.040
 the front has a usb port and 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.000
 if we use the included USB cable 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.579
 connect with it and the other 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.910
 page then stuck here in the pc 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.460
 then opens a pc on a drive 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.410
 usb drive and there we can then 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.450
 on the configuration program of the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.989
 Gambles access relatively easy and 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.810
 simple 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.710
 before I give you this now 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.250
 show configuration program once 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.399
 but my thanks to the company 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.020
 mainpost.de 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.269
 for now, kindly, here 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.110
 the stella gamble for this series 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.110
 provided 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.120
 First and foremost, he wires up 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.730
 the usb cable with the gimbel and the pc 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.440
 and then only provides the head with it 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.620
 electricity and of course not forgotten 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.360
 before here the remote control also 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.920
 if you did that then turn it on 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.980
 then someday will appear 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.580
 window and if you click on it then 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.520
 you have here this usb drive 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.590
 on the files of the now 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.080
 grills are included we have one 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.700
 subdirectory config here are 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.590
 the configuration files in it 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.570
 saved there but we leave the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.240
 finger of but we use here 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.130
 this program plate exe i start 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.560
 that moves with a double-click 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.530
 this is the program over here 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.970
 with everything on the gable 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.920
 configure can start quickly 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.120
 times the individual points as 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.070
 First of all we have the soles 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.229
 installation mode here we can 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.679
 decide in which in which 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.700
 montageart the gimbel is attached 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.160
 By default mode 1 is here 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.650
 selected this is an assembly under 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.570
 the kopftor that's right as well 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.200
 could, however, the gimbel so 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.540
 mount that almost on his head 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.770
 that is with mutti kopp then rather 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.390
 rarely but for example at m airplanes at 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.790
 model airplanes you can do this 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.680
 configuration then use this o2 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.550
 next there is this one 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.440
 Indian length that is the 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.600
 basic orientation of the summit after the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.700
 turn on the head so if you 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.470
 should realize that we give 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.650
 not exactly one hundred percent straight 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.610
 after turning on then you can here 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.640
 from one to ten or to 90 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.560
 the basic orientation is zero 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.910
 out of the way, so to speak 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.930
 correct 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.540
 then we come to the default operating 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.630
 Fashion the sky can basically be in 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.880
 Two different modes are operated 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.420
 they are both equal in principle 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.390
 Both stabilized the gimpl 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.270
 fully automatic and we need us in 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.650
 nothing to worry about the difference 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.680
 here is between these two modes 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.410
 however the new function in the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.450
 so called speed mode as soon as we get there 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.330
 kotti turn up the protein bit 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.709
 turn down then turns the sky 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:39.310
 down and that until he on 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.840
 arrived at the end position 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.250
 I'll show you that right here 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.500
 down in there and only then increases to 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.510
 turn when we turn those three 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.400
 Reset attribute to zero 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.080
 and if we reset that to 0 then 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.390
 remains so precisely that they, as we him 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.360
 had last set that can also 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.380
 be oriented downward 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.209
 usually and that's why I switch 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.390
 Here you also operate a gimbel 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.720
 but in cosmo tim position mode that 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.920
 means that the walkway here inclined 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.470
 can be with the rotary poti and the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.109
 the degree of inclination corresponds to the same 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.150
 then the angle of the sky and 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.640
 as soon as we get back to zero 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.940
 Turning back, so does the sky 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.190
 back to this position in 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.080
 this area here in the length of what we 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.790
 just set here so here 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.419
 we will make this position mode 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.640
 so that's just the script 20 position too 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.180
 the gimbel right after the front 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.930
 align next we have 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.360
 here's the remote control angel limit 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.940
 These are the limitations of the sky 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.220
 You can see we can do this here 10 degrees 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.900
 tilt to the right or left if we 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.760
 just corresponding servo cable and in 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.630
 corresponding channel connected here 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.430
 to have 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.620
 I do not have that here now because of that 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.780
 is that meaningless what is here 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.630
 but we have the pitch values ​​here 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.460
 the mermaid so to speak here we can 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.090
 adjust how far the gm wants to go 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.120
 he should be able to look up here so he can 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.010
 tilted upwards to 20 degrees 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.039
 Look up if I want to 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.770
 and here's that tilt down that's then 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:31.990
 the slopes down maximum 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:33.910
 here 110 degrees tilted down so that 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.599
 you even look a little bit behind 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.210
 behind 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.610
 Personally, I leave that here now 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.479
 First of all, but it would be useful 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.819
 enter a 90 degree angle here 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.949
 so if the protein is down 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.979
 the opponent is also just right 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.330
 pointing down to last but not least 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.530
 we stick the dot here 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.050
 control game 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.780
 Here we can change the speed 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.900
 set the rotation speed with the 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.419
 the gümbel on these pivoting movements 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.970
 the rotary puhdys should react 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.849
 the smaller the value the slower 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.919
 turns the gene and the higher the 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.400
 the faster the value turns 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.620
 sky 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.470
 I'll put this on here now and 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.870
 defends it around the 80 that it a bit 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.810
 Turns faster than the case now 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.789
 otherwise that's all 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.270
 configuration settings on the 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:30.960
 page 2, there are only the 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:34.479
 info about the firmware and the hardware 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.900
 version installed or installed here 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.699
 is there you can on the aircraft side 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.000
 then here by means of this upgrade button 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:45.069
 Check if there is an upgrade for the 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.590
 firmware of the summit gives that we do 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.270
 maybe in another movie yes 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.509
 to save the whole thing now 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.740
 just closed the software and 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:58.810
 then the gamble is fully configured 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.909
 So as you have seen - this one 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.639
 configuration program is one can the 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:05.860
 important things here traffic light fast 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:08.470
 and I just love to adjust 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.230
 here that as well as the 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.780
 aircraft super ex controller too 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.490
 just connected to the pc 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.960
 must be and you have the access 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.720
 just on the configuration program 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.160
 by means of the usb drive one must 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.790
 nothing has to be installed for nothing 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.520
 To take care of 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:27.430
 everything wonderful and super super easy 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.810
 yes that was me again 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.800
 I hope you liked my movie and 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.390
 could help you a bit 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.370
 if yes, then of course I am pleased 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.280
 Have a nice comment below 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.470
 a positive rating does not recommend 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.420
 continue and subscribe me here 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.740
 youtube and also on facebook then 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.350
 you will always automatically over the 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:47.140
 latest movies here on my channel 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.360
 inform if you have any further questions 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.700
 Do you have the configuration program for 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.680
 stella gimbel in general or too 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.240
 then courageous comes to others 

00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:00.870
 then you look every case in my 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.870
 forum over under www.topjob.de
