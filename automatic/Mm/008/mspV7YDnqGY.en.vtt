cash register first of all if you want
receipts<00:00:12.690> printer<00:00:13.139> now<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.860> need<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
receipts printer now you need the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.880 
receipts printer now you need the
machine<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.940> receipt<00:00:15.420> mode<00:00:15.809> if<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.680> in

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
machine in receipt mode if it's in

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.790 
machine in receipt mode if it's in
journal<00:00:17.369> mode<00:00:17.720> you<00:00:18.720> won't<00:00:18.990> get<00:00:19.170> any<00:00:19.320> receipts

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
journal mode you won't get any receipts

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.040 
journal mode you won't get any receipts
and<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.340> paper<00:00:20.550> will<00:00:20.789> print<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.330> journal<00:00:21.840> mode

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
and the paper will print in journal mode

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.080 
and the paper will print in journal mode
designed<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.130> go<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> back<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> spool

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
designed to go on the back of the spool

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.259 
designed to go on the back of the spool
so<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.510> have<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> copy<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.260> every<00:00:25.529> transaction

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
so you have a copy of every transaction

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
so you have a copy of every transaction
so<00:00:27.269> what's<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.539> an<00:00:27.689> audit<00:00:28.019> roll<00:00:28.400> oK<00:00:29.400> we've

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
so what's like an audit roll oK we've

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.550 
so what's like an audit roll oK we've
got<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.029> separate<00:00:30.420> video<00:00:30.689> showing<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
got a separate video showing you how to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
got a separate video showing you how to
switch<00:00:32.099> from<00:00:32.309> journal<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.180> receipt<00:00:33.510> printing

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
switch from journal to receipt printing

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.400 
switch from journal to receipt printing
mode<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.770> that's<00:00:34.890> step<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.809> step<00:00:36.809> two<00:00:36.870> if

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
mode so that's step one step two if

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.959 
mode so that's step one step two if
you've<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> machine<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.399> receipt<00:00:38.730> mode

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
you've got the machine in receipt mode

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.790 
you've got the machine in receipt mode
and<00:00:39.270> you're<00:00:39.570> put<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.840> sales<00:00:40.140> through<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and you're put in sales through and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.680 
and you're put in sales through and
you're<00:00:41.190> not<00:00:41.430> getting<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.820> receipt<00:00:42.149> print<00:00:42.450> out

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
you're not getting a receipt print out

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.760 
you're not getting a receipt print out
correctly

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
correctly

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.920 
correctly
then<00:00:44.550> there's<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> couple<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.270> explanations

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
then there's a couple of explanations

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.069 
then there's a couple of explanations
for<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.460> just<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.579> quick<00:00:47.789> note<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.420> SE<00:00:48.660> g1

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
for that just a quick note on the SE g1

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.770 
for that just a quick note on the SE g1
if<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.129> receipt<00:00:50.489> mode<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.030> can't<00:00:51.360> switch

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
if it's in receipt mode you can't switch

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.510 
if it's in receipt mode you can't switch
the<00:00:51.989> receipt<00:00:52.320> off<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:52.890> issue<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.190> copy

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
the receipt off and then issue a copy

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.060 
the receipt off and then issue a copy
receipt<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.539> every<00:00:54.989> transaction<00:00:55.440> will<00:00:55.800> print

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
receipt so every transaction will print

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.420 
receipt so every transaction will print
out<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> receipt<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:57.620> possible<00:00:58.620> cause<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.399> why

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
out a receipt a possible cause as to why

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.069 
out a receipt a possible cause as to why
the<00:00:59.609> receipts<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.210> printing<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.660> correctly

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the receipts not printing out correctly

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.399 
the receipts not printing out correctly
could<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.620> wrong<00:01:01.859> paper<00:01:02.219> loaded<00:01:03.199> look<00:01:04.199> at<00:01:04.320> this

could be wrong paper loaded look at this

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.850 
could be wrong paper loaded look at this
transactional<00:01:05.189> point<00:01:05.430> room<00:01:06.200> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.619> the

thermal paper on the machine

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.640 
thermal paper on the machine
you<00:01:20.909> must<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.630> thermal<00:01:22.229> paper<00:01:22.470> loaded<00:01:24.650> on

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you must have thermal paper loaded on

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.570 
you must have thermal paper loaded on
this<00:01:26.159> machine

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
this machine

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.789 
this machine
I've<00:01:26.759> got<00:01:27.090> fifty<00:01:27.450> seven<00:01:27.750> millimeter<00:01:28.170> grade-a

paper till rolls loaded these will fit
in<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> machine<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.210> they're<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
in the machine because they're the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.319 
in the machine because they're the
correct<00:01:33.600> size<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.799> won't<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.189> printed<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.820> you

can tell the papers grade-a because it's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.109 
can tell the papers grade-a because it's
done<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.240> both<00:01:39.840> sides<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.759> feels

thermal paper to load the paper

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.580 
thermal paper to load the paper
correctly<00:01:50.479> pop<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:51.810> thermal<00:01:52.200> roll<00:01:52.380> with

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
a shiny side facing down and then you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.060 
a shiny side facing down and then you
won't<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.140> any<00:01:58.320> problems<00:02:00.530> it's<00:02:01.530> possible

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
won't have any problems it's possible

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
won't have any problems it's possible
and<00:02:02.310> we've<00:02:02.490> been<00:02:02.640> asked<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:02.939> before<00:02:03.119> that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
and we've been asked this before that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.389 
and we've been asked this before that
people<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.350> saying<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> receipts<00:02:05.189> not

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
people are saying that the receipts not

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.500 
people are saying that the receipts not
working

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
working

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.600
