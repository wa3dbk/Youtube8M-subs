00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.870
 welcome to a new video here for 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.639
 the world yesterday push up you know 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.670
 which is chest triceps shoulders all that 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.400
 him out of your torso and now I'm 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.750
 going up what is back says the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.510
 time with the trapeze that is to him 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.100
 remember that I even shared my 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.560
 verdict about the best schedules 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.640
 and tool plans obviously here 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.550
 is upper body as inferior 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.620
 push the leg positively what 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 same soccer and full body to 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.460
 novices in the end the plans with a 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.320
 exact frequency for your growth in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.670
 this case I'm uploaded more videos of 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.199
 push because I am very much your body 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.120
 superior and corbould prior now and 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.949
 I wrote pushed you are already exercises 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.030
 completely extraordinary new ones 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.489
 I'm going to like it, I want the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.809
 try to gain strength little by little 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.100
 see us adapt that are exercises that 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.620
 maybe they are new to you but they are 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.019
 really innovative and very very safe 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.789
 and very good so take advantage of those 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.230
 you know you can build your push routine to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.909
 clean it down here I leave the manual 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.640
 how to create your own routine is that you do not 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.170
 like these exercises or also for 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.059
 What are the frequencies? 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.620
 of training the best plans for 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.720
 that you see what is being talked about so 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.670
 I enjoyed boys and girls in the morning 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.580
 so I just recorded the whole plan 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.350
 life the video and I'm just here in the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.550
 study to share the video and not 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.280
 going to sleep hard ravaged part of 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.979
 you and stay in shape 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.229
 we are here in the first exercise this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.600
 it's called dominated with support in banking 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.190
 English are pull up they chase their 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.390
 spectacular validity for those who 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.280
 who entered intensity is much more 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.440
 great to put more weight on their to their 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.810
 dominated in a much safer way 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.550
 as you can see with a disc or you can 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.770
 put a bar like the one I have in the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.060
 gazette but it's much harder or 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.710
 I also put so that the people who 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.540
 they can not do any dominated they want 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.970
 to start with the pull-ups is very good 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.369
 exercise is counted as a success of 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.100
 vertical thrust forgiveness apologize for ale 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.450
 vertical ale now we go from another 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.640
 angle so that you jan cober took 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.950
 the disc the bar a little inclined ones 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.860
 30 degrees to these subjects seeing me 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.140
 analyzing me and let's start can 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.170
 see feeling movement stretches not all 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.819
 the backs explosive the exercise is 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.950
 person with a 20 kilos more disc or 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.780
 less then it's hard it's very hard 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.810
 guys is an incredible exercise that what 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.819
 I put on my dial that at al moderate 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.519
 about 8 to 10 repetitions I advise you 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.110
 do in this exercise so everything remains 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.080
 in each repetition 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.270
 very very good exercise immediately 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.270
 let's have an infusion, father is the 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.460
 mind but is a to the horizontal can 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.580
 see now I'm a horizontal position 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.140
 that is an inverted paddle this is no longer 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.090
 dome said we dominated is a 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.310
 converted can see that it is more 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.350
 down you have to place the bar that you 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.660
 allows to be in that way manarak this 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.630
 video a little bit now bar decline 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.040
 so you can stay straight and do 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.380
 as an inverted prisoner as you can see 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.110
 same explosive way the second 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.330
 8 repetitions exercise can be what 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.700
 looked at another angle I put the price in 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.010
 the chest I put my hands well 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.709
 shoulder break I put my feet in 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.380
 banking and I'm completely straight and 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.720
 ready and start doing the exercise 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.510
 explosive from 8 to 10 repetitions very 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.940
 good exercise of horizontal and 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.500
 second indirectly with the terms 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.180
 of this break of delivery of 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.300
 exercises of each being equal way ones 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.670
 160 or 90 seconds maximum and we passed 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.890
 the next oar that is the last oar 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.470
 which is horizontal in the same way but in 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.400
 cable do not worry it's like in 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.680
 horns others 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.239
 with dumbbell rowing with bars in a 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.180
 machine attached to the chest 3 an oar 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.700
 horizontal explained why it 's so 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.409
 horizontal that bid the straits and 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.099
 torso from top to bottom as 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:46.859
 illuminated salons or that is an ale 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.500
 vertical then this chosen one is very 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.079
 good individually as well 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.310
 say it without in the indra pulley there is no 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.439
 many ways to make this 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.220
 exercise but I chose this one that medicine 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:00.359
 be innovative with the exercises 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.159
 you immediately do this 8 and of 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.780
 repeat likewise even 8 to 2 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.599
 and repetitions can be without any 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.030
 problem without having the exercise to a 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.129
 normal moderate speed we pass now 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.930
 auxiliaries let's do two currencies and 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.819
 we are here with scott bank in 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.949
 machine and I do preacher better said 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.600
 as many call it the same mental form 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.030
 of this machination of this machine is 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.370
 with preacher for the recipe or with 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.080
 Concentrated single dumbbell or board 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.330
 they have a lot of things to do 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.400
 this exercise many ways can see 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.590
 what do I do 12 to 15 repetitions for 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.840
 lubricate the joints a weight not 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.620
 is so crazy not so drastic for 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.440
 control the form 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.360
 answer from the keys in the repetition 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.669
 I was interested this is going to be much more 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.880
 terminal complex but to this the struggle 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.979
 without are auxiliary exercises one or two 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.110
 more than enough one can even be 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.620
 only this one however I add another 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.410
 more than is another angle of the biceps that 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.780
 is the hammer that works too 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.630
 very well in the other heads of the 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.940
 biceps next intense here we are going to 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.800
 do the last exercise that is for 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.410
 trapeze of posterior coughs better 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.780
 said then is the oar of the face 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.919
 facebook can also stand still 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.110
 be seated as he has done in others 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.880
 videos but it's very easy to exercise 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.340
 12 to 15 repetitions 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.990
 similarly concentrated feeling 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.570
 contraction throughout the body in all 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.669
 the numbers in all the deltoids is 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.280
 a good exercise reminds of 2x 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.710
 repetitions it is very easy to write down this 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.350
 routine from now on so you start 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.180
 try subscribe to the channel give like 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.289
 comment we will go in the next video a 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.289
 nice weekend for all
