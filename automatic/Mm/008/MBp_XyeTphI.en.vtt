00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.039
 ca 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.039
 the percentage order 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.710
 on 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.130
 I live in the Yamaha Music Europe 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.080
 from sales manager I would like to explain to them today in abbreviated form 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.310
 why these leads are so popular 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.710
 what makes the Amacher the leading wing manufacturer 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.940
 Yamaha front in the construction and its construction 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.720
 and for unclear during a game the principle 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.360
 produce the best conceivable instrument 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.610
 and then find ways 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.530
 to offer this high a cheap price 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.660
 this means 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.530
 that we get to know each other 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.660
 We give our full attention to that component 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.920
 in the material 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.760
 from the network community 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.000
 the way it fits with other components 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.640
 until the 3 one 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.980
 with the two wooden parts to be joined together 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.470
 that the sound 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.190
 and the resonance is booming at any time 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.720
 warp 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.730
 this principle which leads from the concert to the 1 day models the 1 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.720
 that's why I'm sure the ESI of each player is a core and 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.930
 let me explain them 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.580
 why Yamaha 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.010
 should be the first choice for good 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.080
 the mechanics are of the utmost importance 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.290
 that it is the connection between instrument and music 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.010
 the Yamaha is not the one of the highest precision 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.289
 Below is by many famous artists 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.479
 Austen best I can praise me 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.290
 the demanding production process 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.340
 guaranteed 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.430
 an extraordinary height is right stability 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.510
 and a far like rings maintenance 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.159
 from May at the manufacturer 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.330
 Yamaha is proud of it 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.859
 most components 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.109
 flown himself 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.109
 Hirst to put underneath the Blues Blatter 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:35.389
 the mechanic 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.079
 because these mans floor 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.449
 which allows us comprehensive quality control 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:46.089
 Therefore, not only do they like to get a wonderful blade through 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.699
 instrument 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:51.969
 Special is also one that has a very long life 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:56.999
 neither the best college 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.609
 and education states of the world 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.650
 most often Yamaha instrument in front of their students 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.079
 the first three birds are 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:13.179
 the GB 1 of the GC 1 and the GC 2 all three have a beautiful planned 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.179
 under a special character like our larger rivers 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.149
 they are exchanged showed new elections 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:21.639
 before boarding 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.249
 and smaller space 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:24.969

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:47.049
 and set prices 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.049
 which are really our favorite lead 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.719
 and those who have more space for PET 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.689
 and a fuller powerful sound

 The wings of the CIS will be here for a long time

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.479
 an elegant prized 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.250
 As mentioned, Yamaha builds 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.490
 the best conceivable instrument 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.580
 and find opportunities 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.610
 the most important quality features in the under 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.059
 and middle segment

 he yearns for everything handmade 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.900
 Instruments that are put together by our best piano farmers 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.830
 the tests fell 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.110
 it is 6 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.800
 the new goals many and very sets

 the production has just started 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.409
 and our Bitzen model of the concert grand piano 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.350
 this one has trouble 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.080
 he is a recent board member 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.379
 revised 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.939

 mm I pointed out that William h 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.490
 the traditional art of piano building with excellent modern technology 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.490
 healed 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.930
 Lines are the actions of wings and glaze 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.599
 which they can play with headphones as well as the SGs like models 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.479
 that means in Strem Duck recording the games 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.330
