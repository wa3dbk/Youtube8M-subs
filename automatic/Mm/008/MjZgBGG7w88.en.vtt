00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:38.629 
can see that some of the computer here

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:39.999 
can see that some of the computer here
in<00:04:38.719> front<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:38.990> us<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.349> they're<00:04:39.680> obviously

and then it's all set into various
software<00:04:47.270> programs<00:04:47.569> and<00:04:48.080> then<00:04:48.169> the<00:04:48.289> engineers

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
software programs and then the engineers

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.320 
software programs and then the engineers
sit<00:04:48.889> here<00:04:49.039> and<00:04:49.280> monitor<00:04:49.669> it<00:04:49.729> and<00:04:49.969> they<00:04:50.150> can

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
sit here and monitor it and they can

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.990 
sit here and monitor it and they can
switch<00:04:50.870> sites<00:04:51.139> on<00:04:51.379> off<00:04:51.770> services<00:04:52.370> up<00:04:52.490> down<00:04:52.729> and
