00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.260
 jade way with wargaming 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.320
 which gave us a world of tanks 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.630
 holds a special promotion the action will be 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.180
 faces during the final which passes 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.820
 right now on world of tanks can credit 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.710
 in the description come in, I think you will 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.720
 it is interesting to everyone friends my name is 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.369
 Bender and today I will show you a small 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.070
 enough mod so the review will be 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.769
 adds a short mod to minekravt 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.469
 physics objects that you throw 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.390
 if before they just soared in the air 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.520
 and waited while you collect them 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.739
 now they will wallow in kind 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.489
 on the ground or under water no matter let's 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.980
 try 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.590
 throw a couple of sticks take shelves throwing 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.870
 them and as we see they just fall here 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.730
 it is direct here roll about here from yes and it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.110
 works with all items even with 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.870
 block blocks now really 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.640
 throws you out of inventory flies 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.890
 twist rolls around and lands 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.930
 of course they also stack as before 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.940
 together in one block does not look 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.739
 pretty cool really much 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.200
 better than before it seems to me now 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.390
 you can throw blocks by date 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.549
 the enemy though of course the damage is 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.260
 It does not cause any emissions can be 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.210
 absolutely everything is like this 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.280
 throw out a bucket of glory and she will 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.110
 look like a bucket of glory on earth you 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.270
 you will see quite a cool screenshot 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.070
 I'll do it now and let's see what 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.170
 you can still throw here rails for example 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.600
 lying on the ground carrots a little on 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.790
 the ground lying eggs lying on the ground i 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.280
 these creeper appeals will also be all 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.920
 drown all items in minecraft drown 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.290
 and will give an hour and show the idea 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.119
 description of the mod said that now 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.100
 wooden things will not sink all 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.079
 will be like to take in life but no friends 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.420
 wooden things tone let them show 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.159
 it is even for example and for example 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.220

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.490

 here and actually yes everything is now 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.299
 You can throw a mod under the water like this 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.729
 really pure decorative rather 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.560

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.229

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.270
