00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.180
 probably best selling luminous 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.180

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.789
 which is colored exactly colorless, 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.710
 liquefied at 240 degrees from it 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.100
 we then create the legendary

 made of recycled plastic 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.530
 That's just one of the reasons why 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.490
 our stable boss sells so well each 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.490

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.770
 the next machine gives the shaft 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.570

 plagiarists 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.700
 After that he gets an ink 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.560

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.120
 various components of this 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.750
 we produce a range of new ones 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.910
 to dye 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.220
 every color goes through sophisticated 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.380
 exams and then goes to an almost 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.660
 400 meters long marathon writes 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.760

 Barcodes in our database 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.600
 but that's not enough the pen 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.090
 of course, lace must be exactly sitting and 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.110
 the vaart quantities and tightness test must 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.060
