before doing it on camera as you can see

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.640 
before doing it on camera as you can see
I<00:02:28.270> forgot<00:02:28.630> one<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.870> little<00:02:29.080> steps<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.560> have

it<00:02:29.800> pulled<00:02:30.010> out<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.220> little<00:02:30.370> bit<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:31.080> once<00:02:32.080> it's

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
it pulled out a little bit so once it's

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.310 
it pulled out a little bit so once it's
clamped<00:02:32.470> on<00:02:32.680> though<00:02:32.890> then<00:02:33.100> you<00:02:33.190> got<00:02:33.340> this

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
clamped on though then you got this

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.290 
clamped on though then you got this
short<00:02:35.320> little<00:02:36.750> kind<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.810> like<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.990> pistol<00:02:39.300> maybe

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300

short little kind of like a pistol maybe
I<00:02:40.720> kind<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.830> looks<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.070> if<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.400> didn't<00:02:42.700> have

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
I kind of looks like if it didn't have

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.190 
I kind of looks like if it didn't have
the<00:02:42.970> long<00:02:43.150> barreled<00:02:43.540> kind<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.810> look<00:02:43.900> like<00:02:44.050> an

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
believe that pressure on a magazine can

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.740 
believe that pressure on a magazine can
cause<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> malfunction<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:09.120> I've<00:03:10.120> had<00:03:10.300> weapons

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
cause a malfunction and I've had weapons

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.360 
cause a malfunction and I've had weapons
that<00:03:10.960> that<00:03:11.140> was<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.470> case<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.950> weapons<00:03:12.280> that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
that that was the case and weapons that

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.630 
that that was the case and weapons that
weren't<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:13.090> it's<00:03:13.810> better<00:03:14.110> just<00:03:14.470> not<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.460> have

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
weren't so it's better just not to have

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.490 
weren't so it's better just not to have

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.200 

I'm<00:06:29.860> sure<00:06:30.070> there's<00:06:30.310> probably<00:06:30.460> easier<00:06:30.970> ways<00:06:31.180> to

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
I'm sure there's probably easier ways to

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.490 
I'm sure there's probably easier ways to

I<00:06:32.760> just<00:06:33.760> haven't<00:06:33.970> messed<00:06:34.240> with<00:06:34.389> it<00:06:34.600> enough<00:06:34.840> I

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
I just haven't messed with it enough I

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.879 
I just haven't messed with it enough I
know<00:06:37.150> I'm<00:06:37.479> probably<00:06:37.690> using<00:06:38.110> the<00:06:38.199> shoulder<00:06:39.690> to

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
know I'm probably using the shoulder to

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.500 
know I'm probably using the shoulder to
to<00:06:41.889> take<00:06:42.430> it<00:06:42.550> down<00:06:42.729> might<00:06:43.060> be<00:06:43.180> a<00:06:43.210> little<00:06:43.419> bit

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
to take it down might be a little bit

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.780 
to take it down might be a little bit
easier<00:06:43.780> but<00:06:44.280> haven't<00:06:45.280> given<00:06:45.430> it<00:06:45.520> that<00:06:45.669> much

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
easier but haven't given it that much

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.370 
easier but haven't given it that much
practice<00:06:47.070> it's<00:06:48.070> going<00:06:48.250> to<00:06:48.310> be<00:06:48.490> a<00:06:49.110> quick<00:06:50.110> shoot

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380
