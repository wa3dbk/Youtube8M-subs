there's a lot of substrate if you look
how<00:00:49.590> course<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.430> sand<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.960> let

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
how course the sand is here what we let

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.549 
how course the sand is here what we let
