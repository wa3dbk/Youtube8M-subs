but I doubt it Glover this is a game
that<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.820> lot<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.119> people<00:01:54.270> hate<00:01:54.600> mostly<00:01:55.110> due<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that a lot of people hate mostly due to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.310 
that a lot of people hate mostly due to
the<00:01:55.439> inverted<00:01:55.829> control<00:01:56.159> scheme<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:57.140> like<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the inverted control scheme I like it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.709 
the inverted control scheme I like it
though<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.850> kind<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.180> ripped<00:02:00.329> off<00:02:00.479> on

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
but i'm not going to very fun i guess

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.160 
but i'm not going to very fun i guess
the<00:02:25.130> whole<00:02:25.340> collectathon<00:02:26.120> at<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.750> second

half<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.530> game<00:02:27.680> can<00:02:27.920> be<00:02:27.950> tedious<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:28.700> i

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300

people kind of don't like the most but i

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.479 
people kind of don't like the most but i
thought<00:03:29.989> they<00:03:30.140> were<00:03:30.260> both<00:03:30.440> really<00:03:30.709> good<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:31.250> I

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
thought they were both really good and I

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.360 
thought they were both really good and I
had<00:03:31.519> a<00:03:31.730> fun<00:03:31.940> time<00:03:32.000> with<00:03:32.330> this<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:34.040> whole<00:03:34.190> going

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
had a fun time with this the whole going

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.800 
had a fun time with this the whole going
back<00:03:34.640> in<00:03:34.790> time<00:03:34.940> then<00:03:35.209> can<00:03:35.450> be<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.630> little

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
back in time then can be a little

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.130 
back in time then can be a little
aggravating<00:03:36.709> but<00:03:36.830> I<00:03:36.890> thought<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:37.250> was<00:03:37.370> fun

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
aggravating but I thought it was fun

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.640
