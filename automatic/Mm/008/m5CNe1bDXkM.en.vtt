 we have gonza and edu who came today 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.510
 so let's do some 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.290
 demonstrations of how you can do 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.290
 several pipes 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.400

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.280
 i 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.210
 today I'll teach you the secret to 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.950
 make pipes and that is not simply 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.540
 know that a lot of tricks but 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.020
 try that the opponent now 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.640
 legs 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.990
 there are a lot of tricks that you can 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.300
 help the opponent 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.670
 unconsciously open the legs and in 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.560
 followed by inserting the pipe depending on the 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.880
 opponent with whom you are playing you go to 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.710
 have to do the slowest tricks or 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.060
 faster if the person is very fast 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.680
 and then insert the leg you have to 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.180
 perform the quick trick so that in 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.460
 As I bring you hook the leg 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.870
 pipe if you are a slow person if you do the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.280
 fast trick will not give you time to 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.629
 react and you will not be able to do the 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.239
 pipe then is a person rather 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.620
 slow it 's better to do the slow trick 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.670
 and as soon as you see that he opens his leg 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.680
 you hook the spout 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.090
 for example how is playing soccer 11 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.530
 one of the easiest pipes for 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:18.149
 perform is the following simply 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.830
 let's go down to one side and as soon as 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.299
 the opponent puts the leg to get you out 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.070
 the ball is going to put a pipe with the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.070
 external part the following way 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.479
 for example you are playing street soccer or 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.429
 the court of your neighborhood can be a 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.990
 trick that is more related to the 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:46.950
 football is almost a very good combination 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:48.209
 that usually works ok to explain 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.920
 this trick a little bit just what 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.229
 we do is hit a little roll 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.969
 ball backwards as is there the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.619
 we let go a little bit and at this moment 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.030
 the opponent thinks that the ball is 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.250
 He's running away and that's when he throws his foot 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.659
 to want to take out cloth then when 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.280
 you quickly have to drag the tail 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.680
 alone and put the cannon 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.210
 these were some examples of two 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.160
 tricks that you can use to make a 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.450
 cannon as they saw in the two tricks and 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.430
 we try to make the opponent now the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.560
 leg as for the open we put the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.959
 cannon to perfect your technique 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.400
 making pipes, I recommend you 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.080
 learn many of the tricks that 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.670
 we have in the channel and when the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.130
 it is simply tried to use them from 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.300
 some way for the opponent to fall 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.300
 in the trap and open the legs 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.070
 ok people I hope you liked the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.540
 video the truth that this technique 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.950
 fabulous that we're going to pass it on 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.750
 wonder trying to make the pipe to the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.910
 people can use it in any 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.280
 football type soccer 11 football street 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.450
 futsal what you want and truth 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.830
 what are you going to have a great time try 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.150
 implement it and tell me if they came out 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:58.249
 some pipes 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:58.249
