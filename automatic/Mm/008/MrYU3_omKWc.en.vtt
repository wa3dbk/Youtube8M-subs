today the ribeye most consumers don't
get<00:00:12.760> to<00:00:12.879> see<00:00:13.059> a<00:00:13.090> whole<00:00:13.510> row<00:00:13.809> by<00:00:13.990> the<00:00:14.289> way<00:00:14.410> it<00:00:14.529> is

get to see a whole row by the way it is
here<00:00:15.039> this<00:00:15.580> is<00:00:15.760> what<00:00:15.969> we<00:00:16.299> know<00:00:16.510> is<00:00:16.990> a<00:00:17.050> 107<00:00:17.980> which

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
here this is what we know is a 107 which

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.370 
here this is what we know is a 107 which
is<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.490> larger<00:00:19.119> cut<00:00:19.510> of<00:00:19.630> meat<00:00:19.810> and<00:00:20.050> we're<00:00:20.289> gonna

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
is a larger cut of meat and we're gonna

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.170 
is a larger cut of meat and we're gonna
fabricate<00:00:20.650> this<00:00:21.070> down<00:00:21.250> into<00:00:21.490> ribeye<00:00:21.850> steaks

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
fabricate this down into ribeye steaks

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.180 
fabricate this down into ribeye steaks
this<00:00:22.810> end<00:00:23.050> of<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.230> ribeye<00:00:23.500> here<00:00:23.770> we<00:00:23.890> call<00:00:24.070> the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
this end of the ribeye here we call the

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.560 
this end of the ribeye here we call the
chuck<00:00:24.430> end<00:00:24.640> and<00:00:24.820> you<00:00:24.880> can<00:00:25.000> see<00:00:25.180> all<00:00:25.330> these

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
chuck end and you can see all these

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.570 
chuck end and you can see all these
different<00:00:25.630> muscles<00:00:26.350> coming<00:00:26.680> together<00:00:26.800> that's

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
different muscles coming together that's

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.130 
different muscles coming together that's
because<00:00:27.820> this<00:00:27.940> is<00:00:28.119> where<00:00:28.270> it<00:00:28.330> blends<00:00:28.600> into<00:00:28.930> the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
because this is where it blends into the

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.010 
because this is where it blends into the
shoulder<00:00:29.699> where<00:00:30.699> this<00:00:30.940> end<00:00:31.240> of<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:31.449> ribeye<00:00:31.750> is

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
shoulder where this end of the ribeye is

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.439 
shoulder where this end of the ribeye is
the<00:00:32.529> loin<00:00:32.800> end<00:00:33.250> and<00:00:33.579> this<00:00:33.969> is<00:00:34.120> where<00:00:34.329> it's

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
the loin end and this is where it's

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.029 
the loin end and this is where it's
blending<00:00:34.809> into<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.140> strip<00:00:35.410> loin<00:00:35.590> so<00:00:35.829> you<00:00:35.890> can

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
blending into the strip loin so you can

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.180 
blending into the strip loin so you can
see<00:00:36.190> it's<00:00:36.309> very<00:00:36.550> different<00:00:38.010> first<00:00:39.010> thing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
see it's very different first thing

off<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.930> rib<00:00:41.110> it's<00:00:41.320> a<00:00:41.380> natural<00:00:41.770> seam<00:00:41.980> that

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
off the rib it's a natural seam that

off the rib it's a natural seam that
falls<00:00:42.970> in<00:00:43.149> here<00:00:43.329> and<00:00:43.690> we<00:00:43.780> remove<00:00:43.899> this<00:00:44.170> cap

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
falls in here and we remove this cap

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.560 
falls in here and we remove this cap

will allow us to trim the ribeye bone in

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.479 
will allow us to trim the ribeye bone in
down<00:00:46.840> to<00:00:47.110> both<00:00:47.559> pay<00:00:47.770> attention
