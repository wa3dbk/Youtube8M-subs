 So today I'll show you around this time you and then was old 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.829
 So kind of search engines at times 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.379
 and he can just go into anything that wants to do it 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.380
 Doubt 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.239
 dpa-AFX 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.399
 one of these page «If not soon something welds all good» or put 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.930
 currently are currently no larger 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.930
 then her population 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.120
 even the languages ​​and the ethnic Mixa talked so deeply about 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.440
 Fiddlers speak 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.240
 Religions anything you can help 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.310
 but now you can also do 11th time, for example the Tre 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.230
 9 2 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.690
 then the water comes out 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.240
 with also displayed 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.640
 there numbers 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.390
 or 30 thousand 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.390
 around 900 74 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.460
 Yes 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.690
 I can now also make complex things new, "said Bierhoff Wiechmann 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.910
 what copied from our tasks 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.660
 sometimes 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.180
 I thought it was 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.960
 and the whole team now graphically represented the whole count here 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.799
 the count down around the rounds, we are 2x equal to 21 years 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.930
 that is, Dix simultaneously 21 times or 10 4 5 in the case 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.100
 the whole thing I would be displayed here also come up with other things 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.030
 let for example 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.030
 shares have 4 million a year 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.710
 I do not know Buchholz shares 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 yes it just came in 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220

 the rental price is nice 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.280
 Zurich announces everything back what you are right now 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.609
 then of course things can do the things 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.029
 I him Pieper 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:20.340
 Tina has to go out so call on the domain numbers which numbers can 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.339
 even complex numbers are such a good example 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.869
 out 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.869
 456 doubt 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.849
 that gives 2 give Albus goals 14 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.539

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:43.899
 the whole forest is in normal times with me not selectable 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.779
 at least here only in complex numbers 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.259
 and off again 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.229

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.639

 everyone something 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.300
 to which the whole actually agrees is a very hard unanimous 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.300
