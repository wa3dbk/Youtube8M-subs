00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
suppose for me the future is how do we

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.120 
suppose for me the future is how do we
help<00:00:59.120> those<00:00:59.300> patients<00:00:59.900> where<00:01:00.500> there's<00:01:00.800> really

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
help those patients where there's really

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.490 
help those patients where there's really
a<00:01:01.280> uncertainty<00:01:02.150> about<00:01:02.240> what's<00:01:02.510> going<00:01:02.780> on<00:01:02.930> we

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
a uncertainty about what's going on we

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.140 
a uncertainty about what's going on we
can't<00:01:03.770> serve<00:01:04.070> would<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.430> sit<00:01:04.640> down

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
can't serve would you sit down

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.600 
can't serve would you sit down
we<00:01:05.540> can't<00:01:05.810> sort<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.369> manufacturer<00:01:07.369> health

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
we can't sort of manufacturer health

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.490 
we can't sort of manufacturer health
like<00:01:08.180> you're<00:01:08.509> a<00:01:08.540> quick<00:01:08.840> fix

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
like you're a quick fix

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.469 
like you're a quick fix
we<00:01:09.979> have<00:01:10.219> to<00:01:10.399> engage<00:01:10.549> with<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.939> patient<00:01:11.329> in<00:01:11.359> a

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
we have to engage with the patient in a

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.870 
we have to engage with the patient in a
different<00:01:11.810> way<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:13.130> seems<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:13.520> me<00:01:13.670> that

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
different way and it seems to me that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.489 
different way and it seems to me that
medicine<00:01:14.090> is<00:01:14.299> fractioning<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.049> maybe<00:01:15.409> a

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
medicine is fractioning and maybe a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.499 
medicine is fractioning and maybe a
society's<00:01:16.069> fraction<00:01:16.579> a<00:01:16.819> little<00:01:17.149> bit<00:01:17.270> about

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
society's fraction a little bit about

society's fraction a little bit about
which<00:01:18.049> way<00:01:18.229> do<00:01:18.289> we<00:01:18.380> go

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
which way do we go

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.770 
which way do we go

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
machines and we have to I think pay

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
it's not you know it's very practical as

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.550 
it's not you know it's very practical as
a<00:03:08.790> process<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.450> follow<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:10.230> know<00:03:10.379> where

a process to follow you know where

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.410 
a process to follow you know where
you're<00:03:10.709> at<00:03:10.739> as<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.190> series<00:03:11.549> of<00:03:11.579> consultations

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
you're at as a series of consultations

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.030 
you're at as a series of consultations
you<00:03:13.049> know<00:03:13.139> it<00:03:13.319> isn't<00:03:13.440> for<00:03:13.650> everyone<00:03:13.950> it

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
you know it isn't for everyone it

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.170 
you know it isn't for everyone it
doesn't<00:03:14.069> work<00:03:14.370> for<00:03:14.400> everyone<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.120> a

doesn't work for everyone it's not a

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.910 
doesn't work for everyone it's not a
magic<00:03:15.600> cure<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.380> not<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.709> they're<00:03:16.829> gonna

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
magic cure it's not that they're gonna

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.559 
magic cure it's not that they're gonna
walk<00:03:17.100> out<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.430> door<00:03:17.609> after<00:03:17.760> one<00:03:18.060> pill<00:03:18.359> and

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
walk out the door after one pill and

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.520 
walk out the door after one pill and
that's<00:03:18.720> very<00:03:18.930> everything's<00:03:19.290> going<00:03:19.470> to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
that's very everything's going to

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.170 
that's very everything's going to
disappear<00:03:19.920> although<00:03:20.250> sometimes<00:03:20.760> that

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
disappear although sometimes that

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.910 
disappear although sometimes that
happens<00:03:21.359> but<00:03:22.170> it's<00:03:22.319> actually<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.829> they

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
happens but it's actually that they

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.710 
happens but it's actually that they
actually<00:03:23.069> you<00:03:23.700> can<00:03:23.880> see<00:03:24.060> them<00:03:24.239> going<00:03:24.510> through

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
actually you can see them going through

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.330 
actually you can see them going through
a<00:03:24.750> journey<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.260> know<00:03:25.380> all<00:03:25.560> symptoms<00:03:25.950> come

a journey you know all symptoms come
back<00:03:26.549> from<00:03:26.790> before<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.540> know<00:03:27.630> symptoms<00:03:28.139> get

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
you know asthma comes out and so eczema

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.839 
you know asthma comes out and so eczema

Qatar comes out and that goes and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.140 
Qatar comes out and that goes and
gradually<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> patient<00:03:38.639> gets<00:03:38.790> better<00:03:38.849> and

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
gradually the patient gets better and

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.190 
gradually the patient gets better and
all<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.419> time<00:03:39.630> they're<00:03:39.840> going<00:03:39.989> through<00:03:40.079> this

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
all the time they're going through this

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.620 
all the time they're going through this
process<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.829> see<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.190> energy<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.299> vital

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
process you see that energy that vital

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.180 
process you see that energy that vital
force<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:43.019> coming<00:03:43.230> up<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> bit

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
force is coming up in a bit

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.860 
force is coming up in a bit
as<00:03:44.700> opposed<00:03:44.849> that's<00:03:45.060> why<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.299> still<00:03:45.690> consider

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
as opposed that's why I still consider

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.199 
as opposed that's why I still consider
myself<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.470> holistic<00:03:46.950> physician<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.669> that's

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
myself a holistic physician and that's

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.270 
myself a holistic physician and that's
why<00:03:48.389> any<00:03:48.599> of<00:03:48.720> these<00:03:48.870> helped<00:03:49.230> me<00:03:49.410> be<00:03:49.799> holistic

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
why any of these helped me be holistic

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.979 
why any of these helped me be holistic
because<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.639> allows<00:03:50.880> me<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.269> sell<00:03:51.450> work<00:03:51.720> with

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989
