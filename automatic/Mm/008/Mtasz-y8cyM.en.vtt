i'm<00:00:14.910> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.420> show<00:00:15.630> your<00:00:15.870> method<00:00:16.289> know<00:00:16.500> of

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
i'm going to show your method know of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.170 
i'm going to show your method know of
what<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.270> do<00:00:18.420> before<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.859> hit<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.180> button

what to do before you hit the button

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.550 
what to do before you hit the button
make<00:00:21.840> polymesh<00:00:22.350> 3d<00:00:23.330> because<00:00:24.330> they're<00:00:25.050> zbrush

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
make polymesh 3d because they're zbrush

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.859 
make polymesh 3d because they're zbrush
has<00:00:25.769> settings<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.519> at<00:00:26.640> which<00:00:26.820> allows<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.660> to

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
has settings and at which allows you to

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.620 
has settings and at which allows you to
manipulate<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:29.279> pram<00:00:30.859> beforehand<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.219> then

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
manipulate the pram beforehand and then

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.880 
manipulate the pram beforehand and then
after<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.780> chicken<00:00:34.140> mess<00:00:34.350> about<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:34.710> that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
after all chicken mess about with that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.920 
after all chicken mess about with that
till<00:00:35.250> your<00:00:35.399> heart's<00:00:35.640> content<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.660> create

till your heart's content but to create

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.250 
till your heart's content but to create
the<00:00:37.050> basic<00:00:37.500> model<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> how<00:00:39.809> do<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.230> that

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the basic model so how do we do that

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.910 
the basic model so how do we do that
well<00:00:41.360> see<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.600> wanted<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> create<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.500> Greek

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
well see we wanted to create a Greek

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.869 
well see we wanted to create a Greek
column<00:00:44.460> well<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.800> go<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> up

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
column well what we do is we go to up

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.549 
column well what we do is we go to up
here<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:49.559> click<00:00:50.280> cell<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.120> our<00:00:51.329> 3d<00:00:52.140> right

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
here and we click cell and our 3d right

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.680 
here and we click cell and our 3d right
we<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.070> cylinder<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.820> our<00:00:53.940> Greek<00:00:54.239> columns

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
we want a cylinder for our Greek columns

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.029 
we want a cylinder for our Greek columns
now<00:00:55.730> all<00:00:56.730> these<00:00:57.149> different<00:00:57.870> premise<00:00:58.649> that

now all these different premise that

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.950 
now all these different premise that
there<00:00:59.609> is<00:01:00.500> zbrush<00:01:01.500> has<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:03.149> know<00:01:03.270> before

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
there is zbrush has and you know before

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.170 
there is zbrush has and you know before
you<00:01:03.989> hit<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> make<00:01:04.559> polymesh<00:01:04.830> 3d<00:01:05.070> button<00:01:05.760> can

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
you hit the make polymesh 3d button can

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.770 
you hit the make polymesh 3d button can
be<00:01:06.210> manipulated<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.560> they<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.400> be

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
be manipulated you know they can be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.899 
be manipulated you know they can be
squished<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.710> made<00:01:10.920> beggar<00:01:11.220> they

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
squished they can be made beggar they

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
squished they can be made beggar they
can<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.240> made<00:01:12.420> sign<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.350> flatter<00:01:14.220> or

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
can be made sign up you know flatter or

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.920 
can be made sign up you know flatter or
whatever<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.080> want<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.930> but

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
whatever we you want to do it and but

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.960 
whatever we you want to do it and but
you<00:01:19.259> know<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.619> always<00:01:19.740> start<00:01:20.189> pitched<00:01:20.400> evade

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
you know you always start pitched evade

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.730 
you know you always start pitched evade
say<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.659> two<00:01:21.840> feet<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.890> 83<00:01:23.880> right<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.080> there<00:01:25.619> we

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
say it two feet of 83 right so there we

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.149 
say it two feet of 83 right so there we
go<00:01:25.770> now<00:01:26.670> see<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.150> wanted<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.600> create<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.680> Greek

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
go now see we wanted to create the Greek

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.370 
go now see we wanted to create the Greek
call<00:01:29.430> well<00:01:29.759> how<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.360> well<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:31.200> need

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
call well how do we do that well we need

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.359 
call well how do we do that well we need
an<00:01:31.530> inner<00:01:31.680> radius<00:01:32.250> well<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.950> hollows<00:01:34.950> are<00:01:34.979> out

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
an inner radius well the hollows are out

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.810 
an inner radius well the hollows are out
so<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.810> move<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.439> slider<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> radius<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
so we move the slider and the radius I

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.300 
so we move the slider and the radius I
tend<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> move<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.810> 92<00:01:40.170> take

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
tend to move up to 92 take

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
tend to move up to 92 take
that<00:01:41.520> sin<00:01:42.180> are<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.509> possible<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:43.979> use

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
that sin are as possible you can use

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.190 
that sin are as possible you can use
second<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> want<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.899> all

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
second if you want to you know it's all

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.880 
second if you want to you know it's all
depends<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.790> methods<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.079> know<00:01:49.229> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
depends on what methods you know you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.899 
depends on what methods you know you
prefer<00:01:50.130> yourself<00:01:51.289> but<00:01:52.289> and<00:01:52.759> there<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.880> go

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
prefer yourself but and there we go

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.690 
prefer yourself but and there we go
we've<00:01:54.270> got<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.600> whole<00:01:54.810> dough<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.430> need<00:01:56.579> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
we've got the whole dough now we need to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.410 
we've got the whole dough now we need to
make<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.539> thinner<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.770> what<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.880> we

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
make it more thinner so what we do is we

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.910 
make it more thinner so what we do is we
go<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:01.080> 20<00:02:02.840> by<00:02:03.840> 20<00:02:04.789> so<00:02:05.789> it's<00:02:06.179> 24<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.079> x<00:02:07.229> 24

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
go to see 20 by 20 so it's 24 the x 24

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.580 
go to see 20 by 20 so it's 24 the x 24
the<00:02:08.009> why<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.789> will<00:02:08.910> leave<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:10.019> know<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the why we will leave the you know the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.860 
the why we will leave the you know the
length<00:02:10.890> alone<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.980> next<00:02:13.980> we<00:02:14.519> go<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.870> I'll

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
length alone and next we go to I'll

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.970 
length alone and next we go to I'll
scale<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.530> up<00:02:16.680> well<00:02:17.610> go<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.530> masking<00:02:19.530> now

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
scale that up well go to masking now

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.430 
scale that up well go to masking now
these<00:02:20.610> settings<00:02:21.180> will<00:02:21.299> only<00:02:21.569> appear<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
these settings will only appear and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.900 
these settings will only appear and
masking<00:02:23.330> before<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:24.840> make<00:02:25.080> polymesh<00:02:25.380> 3d

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
masking before you have make polymesh 3d

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.370 
masking before you have make polymesh 3d
so<00:02:27.440> how<00:02:28.440> do<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.709> make<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.040> column<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:31.260> do

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
so how do we make the column so what do

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.900 
so how do we make the column so what do
we<00:02:31.440> do<00:02:31.709> we<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.190> mass<00:02:32.519> goal<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.420> turns<00:02:33.660> dark

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
we do we have mass goal so it turns dark

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.509 
we do we have mass goal so it turns dark
now<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.900> have<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.230> turn<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.530> dark<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.069> then

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
now you have to turn the dark and then

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.780 
now you have to turn the dark and then
move<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.360> slider<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:40.080> select<00:02:40.890> count<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.700> know

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
move the slider on select count you know

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.210 
move the slider on select count you know
you<00:02:41.849> can<00:02:42.090> use<00:02:42.299> skip<00:02:42.690> or<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.319> profile<00:02:43.860> select

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
you can use skip or a profile select

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.180 
you can use skip or a profile select
code<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.940> I'll<00:02:45.090> move<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.510> down<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:46.640> there<00:02:47.640> too

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
code and I'll move it down to there too

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.090 
code and I'll move it down to there too
right<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.640> then<00:02:51.269> we<00:02:51.450> have<00:02:51.630> column<00:02:52.410> now<00:02:52.920> it's

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
right and then we have column now it's

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.690 
right and then we have column now it's
created<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.790> stripe<00:02:54.390> now<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.739> can<00:02:55.920> hat<00:02:56.160> mask

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
created the stripe now you can hat mask

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.849 
created the stripe now you can hat mask
all<00:02:56.940> again<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.510> grid<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.350> will<00:02:58.470> create<00:02:58.739> a

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
all again and grid and it will create a

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.809 
all again and grid and it will create a
grid<00:02:59.190> or<00:02:59.489> are<00:03:00.150> my<00:03:00.870> skull<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.590> raw<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.549> it<00:03:02.700> will

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
grid or are my skull and raw and it will

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.849 
grid or are my skull and raw and it will
do<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.359> way<00:03:03.569> all<00:03:03.840> depends<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.530> what<00:03:04.680> you

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
do it that way all depends on what you

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.360 
do it that way all depends on what you
need<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.940> know<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:07.370> manipulating

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
need it for you know and manipulating

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.759 
need it for you know and manipulating
the<00:03:08.430> numbers<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.329> mesna<00:03:10.079> boat<00:03:10.260> will<00:03:10.470> give<00:03:10.650> you

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
the numbers and mesna boat will give you

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.559 
the numbers and mesna boat will give you
all<00:03:10.829> different<00:03:11.310> effects<00:03:11.609> but<00:03:11.880> for<00:03:12.060> our<00:03:12.180> sake

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
all different effects but for our sake

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.400 
all different effects but for our sake
we<00:03:12.780> need<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.959> column<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:13.680> mass<00:03:14.370> goal<00:03:14.840> column<00:03:15.840> and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
we need a column so mass goal column and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.910 
we need a column so mass goal column and
that<00:03:16.560> gives<00:03:16.769> us<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.209> next<00:03:18.209> we<00:03:19.019> need<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.560> go

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
that gives us that next we need it to go

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.120 
that gives us that next we need it to go
bumpy<00:03:20.819> like<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.510> see<00:03:21.720> on<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.900> column<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.709> what

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
bumpy like you see on a column so what

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.390 
bumpy like you see on a column so what
do<00:03:23.280> we<00:03:23.340> do<00:03:23.579> we<00:03:24.180> go<00:03:24.329> into<00:03:24.680> deformation<00:03:25.680> now<00:03:26.340> we

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
do we do we go into deformation now we

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.220 
do we do we go into deformation now we
can<00:03:26.760> use<00:03:27.120> inflate<00:03:28.079> or<00:03:28.410> size<00:03:29.150> right<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.900> what

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
can use inflate or size right so what

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.009 
can use inflate or size right so what
ton<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.590> says<00:03:32.010> Z<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.790> we'll<00:03:33.060> move<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.630> slider

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
ton of says Z and we'll move the slider

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:34.930 
ton of says Z and we'll move the slider
up

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
up

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.650 
up
and<00:03:35.450> there<00:03:36.200> we<00:03:36.380> go<00:03:36.410> we've<00:03:37.250> got<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.670> slight<00:03:38.330> bomb

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
and there we go we've got a slight bomb

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.420 
and there we go we've got a slight bomb
now<00:03:38.960> you<00:03:39.020> can<00:03:39.260> make<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.560> more<00:03:39.740> pronounced<00:03:40.160> the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
now you can make it more pronounced the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.930 
now you can make it more pronounced the
more<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:43.370> know<00:03:43.490> do<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.770> like<00:03:45.770> that<00:03:46.720> or<00:03:47.720> em

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
more you you know do it like that or em

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.880 
more you you know do it like that or em
you<00:03:49.940> can<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.390> then<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.990> can<00:03:51.170> inflate<00:03:51.620> it

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
you can and then you can inflate it

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.200 
you can and then you can inflate it
afterwards<00:03:52.520> so<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:53.290> pushes<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.650> out<00:03:55.210> now

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
afterwards so it pushes it out now

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.570 
afterwards so it pushes it out now
whether<00:03:56.600> or<00:03:56.870> not<00:03:56.990> it<00:03:57.170> turns<00:03:57.440> out<00:03:57.650> perfect<00:03:58.160> and

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
whether or not it turns out perfect and

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.570 
whether or not it turns out perfect and
modeled<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.450> have<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.900> test<00:04:00.680> I'd<00:04:01.010> rather<00:04:01.280> you

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
modeled you have to test I'd rather you

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.450 
modeled you have to test I'd rather you
go<00:04:01.760> into<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.120> beta<00:04:02.300> gredin<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.500> know<00:04:03.590> go<00:04:04.400> away

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
go into the beta gredin you know go away

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.640 
go into the beta gredin you know go away
all<00:04:04.730> day<00:04:04.760> other<00:04:05.150> than<00:04:05.500> waste<00:04:06.500> your<00:04:06.860> your

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
all day other than waste your your

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.950 
all day other than waste your your
credits<00:04:09.650> or<00:04:09.920> London's<00:04:10.490> or<00:04:10.790> whatever<00:04:11.720> money

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.240 
credits or London's or whatever money
too<00:04:12.140> amazed<00:04:12.380> that<00:04:12.410> you're<00:04:12.650> using<00:04:12.890> or<00:04:13.100> whatever

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
too amazed that you're using or whatever

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.340 
too amazed that you're using or whatever
good<00:04:13.730> but<00:04:14.570> that's<00:04:15.200> basically<00:04:15.530> how<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.100> create

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
good but that's basically how you create

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.870 
good but that's basically how you create
your<00:04:18.350> column<00:04:19.100> no<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:20.359> can<00:04:20.630> save<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.709> so<00:04:22.700> it's

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
your column no you can save that so it's

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.940 
your column no you can save that so it's
saved<00:04:23.180> that<00:04:23.450> like<00:04:23.630> that<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:24.170> then<00:04:24.410> what<00:04:24.920> you

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
saved that like that and then what you

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.990 
saved that like that and then what you
can<00:04:25.070> do<00:04:25.430> is<00:04:25.840> bend<00:04:26.840> up<00:04:27.140> you<00:04:27.950> know<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.100> create<00:04:28.580> the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
can do is bend up you know to create the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.630 
can do is bend up you know to create the
call<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.810> let<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.140> top<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.820> can<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:32.540> prefer

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
call and let the top so you can I prefer

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.560 
call and let the top so you can I prefer
s-bend<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:35.380> which<00:04:36.380> method<00:04:37.280> is<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.640> no<00:04:38.330> that's

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
s-bend and which method is it no that's

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.800 
s-bend and which method is it no that's
a<00:04:38.750> bit<00:04:38.930> too<00:04:39.110> much

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
a bit too much

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.770 
a bit too much
s<00:04:41.260> band

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.370 

oh<00:04:45.840> that<00:04:46.800> was<00:04:46.920> a<00:04:46.950> way<00:04:47.430> too<00:04:47.490> much<00:04:48.150> been<00:04:49.050> there

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
oh that was a way too much been there

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.580 
oh that was a way too much been there
for<00:04:49.620> me<00:04:49.920> and<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:51.750> more<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:51.990> do<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.440> more

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
for me and the more you do it the more

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.760 
for me and the more you do it the more
you<00:04:52.920> can<00:04:53.100> bend<00:04:53.639> that<00:04:53.850> now<00:04:54.330> this<00:04:54.510> is<00:04:54.570> pre<00:04:55.350> hat

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
you can bend that now this is pre hat

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.700 
you can bend that now this is pre hat
and<00:04:55.919> make<00:04:56.100> polymesh<00:04:56.430> 3d<00:04:56.990> now<00:04:57.990> as<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.530> can<00:04:58.650> see

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
and make polymesh 3d now as you can see

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.879 
and make polymesh 3d now as you can see
I<00:04:58.980> can't<00:04:59.280> draw<00:04:59.580> on<00:04:59.639> it<00:04:59.850> yet<00:05:00.200> but<00:05:01.200> what<00:05:01.470> I<00:05:01.500> do<00:05:01.740> is

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
I can't draw on it yet but what I do is

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.379 
I can't draw on it yet but what I do is
I<00:05:02.070> had<00:05:02.430> make<00:05:02.940> polymesh<00:05:03.210> 3d<00:05:03.480> and<00:05:04.910> bingo<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:06.150> can

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
I had make polymesh 3d and bingo I can

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.540 
I had make polymesh 3d and bingo I can
draw<00:05:06.600> on<00:05:06.630> it<00:05:06.870> now<00:05:08.210> most<00:05:09.210> of<00:05:09.419> these<00:05:09.510> air<00:05:10.020> prams

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
draw on it now most of these air prams

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.820 
draw on it now most of these air prams
have<00:05:11.550> different<00:05:12.450> types<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.990> settings<00:05:13.320> and

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
have different types of settings and

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.500 
have different types of settings and
you'll<00:05:14.310> learn<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.790> use<00:05:15.030> them<00:05:15.360> to<00:05:16.139> create<00:05:16.950> a

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
you'll learn to use them to create a

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.830 
you'll learn to use them to create a
different<00:05:18.510> shapes<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.410> you<00:05:19.590> need<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.840> unwad

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
different shapes that you need and unwad

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.650 
different shapes that you need and unwad
'old<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.169> I<00:05:22.890> would<00:05:23.250> advise<00:05:24.050> using<00:05:25.050> say<00:05:25.800> the

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
'old a I would advise using say the

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.030 
'old a I would advise using say the
torus<00:05:27.660> to<00:05:28.500> create<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.460> hole<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:31.500> know

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
torus to create that hole and you know

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.080 
torus to create that hole and you know
so<00:05:32.370> it<00:05:32.610> looks<00:05:33.330> perfect<00:05:33.600> hollow<00:05:34.169> can<00:05:35.090> technol

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
so it looks perfect hollow can technol

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.909 
so it looks perfect hollow can technol
the<00:05:36.270> torus<00:05:36.630> hole<00:05:36.810> out<00:05:37.020> there<00:05:37.229> tends<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.740> walk

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
the torus hole out there tends to walk

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.070 
the torus hole out there tends to walk
but<00:05:39.530> that's<00:05:40.530> really<00:05:40.950> that<00:05:41.760> for<00:05:42.270> this<00:05:42.810> tutorial

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
but that's really that for this tutorial

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.870 
but that's really that for this tutorial
and<00:05:43.820> I<00:05:44.820> hope<00:05:45.450> you<00:05:45.840> enjoy<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.710> hope<00:05:47.580> you<00:05:47.729> have

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
fun you know manipulating problems and I

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.940 
fun you know manipulating problems and I
will<00:05:51.600> see<00:05:51.900> you<00:05:51.930> in<00:05:52.200> the<00:05:52.229> next<00:05:52.470> one<00:05:52.940> bye
