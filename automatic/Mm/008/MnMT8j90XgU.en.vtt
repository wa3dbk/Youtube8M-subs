painted them

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.650 
painted them
and<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:13.680> just<00:02:14.070> put<00:02:14.250> them<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.300> here

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and then just put them up to like here

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.190 
and then just put them up to like here
because<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.560> lens<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.220> want<00:02:17.490> and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
because this is the lens that I want and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.910 
because this is the lens that I want and
cross<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.350> over<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.000> actually<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.740> the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
cross it over and actually this is the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.340 
cross it over and actually this is the
fastest<00:02:23.520> way<00:02:23.820> for<00:02:24.410> me<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.560> cut<00:02:25.770> my<00:02:25.980> yarn<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:27.350> keep

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
fastest way for me to cut my yarn I keep

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.720 
fastest way for me to cut my yarn I keep
on<00:02:28.470> doing<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.860> until<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.190> have<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> big<00:02:29.610> of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
on doing it until you have a big of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.130 
on doing it until you have a big of
enough<00:02:30.000> thing<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.390> then<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.600> cut<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.080> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
enough thing and then you cut and you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.270 
enough thing and then you cut and you
carry<00:02:31.860> on

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
carry on

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.240 
carry on
so<00:02:32.970> as<00:02:33.240> someone<00:02:33.600> closer<00:02:34.020> look<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.710> he<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.040> my

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
so as someone closer look is he as my

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.910 
so as someone closer look is he as my
tool<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.990> let<00:02:36.990> me<00:02:37.050> just<00:02:37.200> make<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.470> closer<00:02:37.680> and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
tool and let me just make it closer and

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.970 
tool and let me just make it closer and
basically<00:02:38.520> what<00:02:38.700> you're<00:02:38.820> doing<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.980> just

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
basically what you're doing is this just

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.220 
basically what you're doing is this just
discontinuously<00:02:41.910> what's<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.510> course<00:02:42.780> for<00:02:43.080> me

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
discontinuously what's of course for me

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.490 
discontinuously what's of course for me
at<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:44.250> longer<00:02:44.490> lens<00:02:44.880> my<00:02:45.510> toes<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.840> clean<00:02:46.140> leave

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
at a longer lens my toes I clean leave

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.420 
at a longer lens my toes I clean leave
me<00:02:46.650> alone

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
me alone

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.210 
me alone
and<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.050> what<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.350> looks<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.740> halfway

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and this is what it looks like halfway

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.380 
and this is what it looks like halfway
of<00:02:50.310> course<00:02:50.520> I'm<00:02:50.610> not<00:02:50.760> going<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.000> show<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.210> how
