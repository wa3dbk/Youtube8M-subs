00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.750 

so<00:00:08.910> here's<00:00:09.179> my<00:00:09.330> current<00:00:09.389> lamination<00:00:10.760> there

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
so here's my current lamination there

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.820 
so here's my current lamination there
was<00:00:11.849> very<00:00:12.030> little<00:00:12.179> spring<00:00:12.510> back<00:00:12.719> but<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.379> is<00:00:13.590> a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
was very little spring back but it is a

was very little spring back but it is a
little<00:00:14.160> bit<00:00:14.369> springing<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.170> might<00:00:16.680> just

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
little bit springing so I might just

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.859 
little bit springing so I might just
want<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.130> try<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.310> stiff<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.820> up<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.090> bit<00:00:18.119> with

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
want to try and stiff that up a bit with

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.990 
want to try and stiff that up a bit with
a<00:00:18.930> brace<00:00:19.310> underneath<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:20.550> maybe<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
a brace underneath here maybe in the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.179 
a brace underneath here maybe in the
middle<00:00:21.270> where<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.710> not<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.130> show<00:00:25.189> next

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
middle where it's not going to show next

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:55.040 
middle where it's not going to show next
thing<00:00:26.309> is<00:00:26.340> just<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.669> clean<00:00:26.880> up<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.149> edges<00:00:54.050> it's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
thing is just to clean up the edges it's

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.689 
thing is just to clean up the edges it's
actually<00:00:55.170> pretty<00:00:55.499> smooth<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.339> it<00:00:56.460> could

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
actually pretty smooth but it could

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.450 
actually pretty smooth but it could
still<00:00:57.179> do<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.350> over<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> card

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460

feet on this I want to make them as

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.510 
feet on this I want to make them as
ineffective<00:01:26.579> as<00:01:26.939> possible<00:01:27.979> just<00:01:28.979> set<00:01:29.250> the

ends of the laminations into a little
block<00:01:32.189> at<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> end<00:01:34.219> one<00:01:35.219> in<00:01:35.369> each<00:01:35.460> corner<00:01:35.810> I'll

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
block at the end one in each corner I'll

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.810 
block at the end one in each corner I'll
give<00:01:37.079> them<00:01:37.320> good<00:01:37.770> surface<00:01:38.189> area<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.609> it<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
give them good surface area for it to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.910 
give them good surface area for it to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.160 

just<00:02:41.130> flashing<00:02:41.520> off<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.300> feet<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.810> I've<00:02:42.960> put

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
just flashing off the feet that I've put

just flashing off the feet that I've put
on<00:02:43.230> my<00:02:43.500> face<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:45.320> decided<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.530> go<00:02:46.680> with

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
on my face I decided to go with

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.730 
on my face I decided to go with
something<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.400> little<00:02:47.850> bit<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.570> little<00:02:48.740> bit

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
something a little bit a little bit

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.710 
something a little bit a little bit
bigger<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.580> might<00:02:50.700> really<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.510> when

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
bigger you might really see it when

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.940 
bigger you might really see it when
you're<00:02:51.840> looking<00:02:51.990> at<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.260> object<00:02:52.590> from<00:02:52.710> a<00:02:52.800> long

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
you're looking at the object from a long

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.840 
you're looking at the object from a long
way<00:02:53.100> away<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:54.050> figured<00:02:55.050> out<00:02:55.140> close<00:02:55.850> it's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
way away but figured out close it's

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.380 
way away but figured out close it's
simply<00:02:57.210> for<00:02:57.630> little<00:02:57.930> cats<00:02:58.230> feet<00:02:59.180> that<00:03:00.180> you

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
simply for little cats feet that you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.060 
simply for little cats feet that you
won't<00:03:00.570> really<00:03:00.720> see<00:03:00.990> from<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.260> distance<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:01.950> if

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
won't really see from a distance but if

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.370 
won't really see from a distance but if
you<00:03:02.160> get<00:03:02.280> up<00:03:02.400> close<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.970> think<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.810> just<00:03:03.840> makes<00:03:04.170> a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
you get up close I think it just makes a

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.300 
you get up close I think it just makes a
nice<00:03:04.620> little<00:03:04.890> feature<00:03:09.650> just<00:03:10.650> perfecting<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
nice little feature just perfecting the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.220 
nice little feature just perfecting the
transition<00:03:11.910> here<00:03:12.120> between<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.690> curve<00:03:12.959> and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
transition here between the curve and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.850 
transition here between the curve and
the<00:03:14.010> foot<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:18.570> little<00:03:18.810> card<00:03:19.050> scraper<00:03:19.260> does<00:03:19.830> a

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
the foot the little card scraper does a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.270 
the foot the little card scraper does a
great<00:03:20.220> job<00:03:22.910> my<00:03:23.910> central<00:03:24.390> column<00:03:24.780> has<00:03:25.280> settled

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
great job my central column has settled

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.160 
great job my central column has settled
a<00:03:26.370> bit<00:03:26.490> indoors<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.450> been<00:03:27.690> in<00:03:27.840> there<00:03:27.930> now<00:03:28.110> for

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
a bit indoors it's been in there now for

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.290 
a bit indoors it's been in there now for
a<00:03:28.380> few<00:03:28.530> months<00:03:28.740> so<00:03:29.520> nothing's<00:03:29.970> going<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.180> move

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
a few months so nothing's going to move

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.259 
a few months so nothing's going to move
much<00:03:30.510> more<00:03:30.750> but<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:31.620> slightly<00:03:32.550> out<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.000> flat

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
much more but it's slightly out to flat

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.900 
much more but it's slightly out to flat
slightly<00:03:33.989> out<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.140> square<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.100> my<00:03:35.250> next<00:03:35.459> job<00:03:35.700> is

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
slightly out of square so my next job is

that out get it flat and then i can use

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.340 
that out get it flat and then i can use
that<00:03:56.700> as<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.850> reference<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.510> work<00:03:57.720> round<00:03:57.990> all

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
that as a reference to work round all

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:14.740 
that as a reference to work round all
the<00:03:58.410> other<00:03:58.680> four<00:03:58.920> faces<00:04:12.560> did<00:04:13.560> all<00:04:13.710> this<00:04:13.860> work
