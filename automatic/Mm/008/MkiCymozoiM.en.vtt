00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.699
 hello my loves videos of nothing my channel 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.529
 I am a spy and today I have this 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.290
 tutorial that is something quite dramatic that 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.120
 is a cut of the fold I wanted to use the 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.770
 new surface palette that these three 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.290
 Ney pavilions 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.970
 and I really loved the colors 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.640
 I wanted to do something very dramatic because 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.860
 is what then later how lola I open it is 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.449
 what I look at many dramatic colors and 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.940
 very striking so I wanted to do 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.680
 something like that but if you would like 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.540
 learn how to make this make this 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.220
 keep watching it the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.690
 to do is start with a pre-base for 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.489
 the eyes and this is the one of nothing that 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.780
 flame painting time and I'll be 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.780
 applying on my entire eyelid 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.760
 with our tiger nut palette stories 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.830
 that from babies we will not win in the 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.360
 first shadow that is of melanio and what 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.570
 we are applying in the fold of our 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.570
 eye 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.649
 the next color that we are going to use 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.719
 is this one called autobots and with a 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.539
 small brush as you can see this 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.399
 we are going to be using this brush to 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.780
 can create a line in the fold 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.929
 our eye and the first thing you're going to do 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.350
 is to start with a very thin line and 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.899
 let's start this load you can 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.670
 say this our fold and we're going to 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.250
 be doing this little by little until 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.369
 that is until we make the color more 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.369
 intense 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.900
 Now taking a smaller brush 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.210
 this is like the same as on 25 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.560
 week nothing more smaller as they can 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.120
 see what I'm going to be doing is 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.340
 taking the same color and let's start 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.110
 to blur this line a bit more to 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.170
 that you do not look like that since intense and 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.940
 look more better this one if you go over the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.180
 line down does not matter because then 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.920
 we are going to clean this already afterwards but 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.840
 nothing else what you want to do is start 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.320
 to blur that line and it's the only thing 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.320
 you have to do 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.609
 so that it becomes easier to blur 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.129
 everything I'm going to take the first shadow that 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:43.010
 we use at the beginning and I will be using 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.519
 it is to blur over my color 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.519
 That I have here 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.590
 the next thing I'm going to use my tests 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.050
 again and what I'm going to be doing 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.310
 taking a very small brush and what 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.020
 I 'm going to do, I 'm going to grab a little bit of 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.240
 this product and I will be cleaning 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.500
 around this line so that you look 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.500
 more this will be seen 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.010
 now with the next color that 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.940
