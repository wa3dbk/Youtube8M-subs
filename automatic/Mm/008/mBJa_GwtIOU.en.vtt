00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.010 

so<00:00:05.050> we<00:00:05.470> just<00:00:06.340> arrived<00:00:06.640> in<00:00:06.760> Paris<00:00:07.180> we<00:00:07.690> had<00:00:07.810> some

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.020 
so we just arrived in Paris we had some

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.440 
so we just arrived in Paris we had some
problems<00:00:08.410> at<00:00:08.559> the<00:00:08.710> airport<00:00:09.100> with<00:00:09.309> they<00:00:10.210> took

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
problems at the airport with they took

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.640 
problems at the airport with they took
some<00:00:10.720> materials<00:00:11.290> so<00:00:12.100> we<00:00:12.340> were<00:00:13.180> just<00:00:13.510> a<00:00:14.020> part<00:00:14.500> of

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
some materials so we were just a part of

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.840 
some materials so we were just a part of
it<00:00:14.860> but<00:00:16.620> in<00:00:17.620> a<00:00:17.710> few<00:00:17.920> minutes<00:00:18.130> we're<00:00:18.490> gonna<00:00:18.640> meet

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
it but in a few minutes we're gonna meet

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:31.920 
it but in a few minutes we're gonna meet
our<00:00:19.090> contact<00:00:20.400> starting<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.520> interview<00:00:30.270> so<00:00:31.270> in

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
our contact starting the interview so in

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.579 
our contact starting the interview so in
my<00:00:32.140> project<00:00:33.070> I<00:00:33.190> try<00:00:34.120> to<00:00:34.149> yes<00:00:35.050> to<00:00:35.429> to<00:00:36.429> do<00:00:36.760> have<00:00:36.910> to

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
my project I try to yes to to do have to

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:41.369 
my project I try to yes to to do have to
level<00:00:38.589> last<00:00:38.949> walk<00:00:39.760> one<00:00:40.570> it<00:00:40.690> is<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:40.899> kind<00:00:41.230> of

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
level last walk one it is a kind of

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.849 
level last walk one it is a kind of
atmosphere<00:00:41.879> level<00:00:42.879> or<00:00:43.030> a<00:00:43.260> level<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.289> climatic

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
atmosphere level or a level of climatic

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.259 
atmosphere level or a level of climatic
or<00:00:45.420> meteorological<00:00:46.420> level<00:00:46.839> and<00:00:47.940> related<00:00:48.940> here

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
or meteorological level and related here

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.759 
or meteorological level and related here
with<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:49.719> question<00:00:50.140> of<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.409> substrate

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
with the question of the substrate

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.569 
with the question of the substrate
between<00:00:51.129> birth<00:00:51.429> technique<00:00:51.789> and<00:00:52.510> after<00:00:53.579> there

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
between birth technique and after there

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.910 
between birth technique and after there
is<00:00:54.609> this<00:00:54.850> physiological<00:00:55.329> level<00:00:55.929> decided<00:00:56.739> that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
is this physiological level decided that

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.139 
is this physiological level decided that
we<00:00:57.760> are<00:00:57.909> not<00:00:58.120> natural<00:00:59.019> inside<00:00:59.499> we<00:00:59.739> breath

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
we are not natural inside we breath

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.350 
we are not natural inside we breath
Sierra<00:01:01.149> we<00:01:01.539> are<00:01:01.659> you<00:01:02.649> are<00:01:02.800> inside<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.429> space

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
Sierra we are you are inside the space

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.980 
Sierra we are you are inside the space
and<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.400> so<00:01:06.640> it's<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:07.360> means<00:01:07.840> that<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:09.130> have<00:01:09.159> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and and so it's it means that we have a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.660 
and and so it's it means that we have a
geology<00:01:10.990> correlation<00:01:11.710> with<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.100> Aussie

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
geology correlation with the Aussie

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.109 
geology correlation with the Aussie
architecture<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:13.659> I<00:01:13.689> will<00:01:14.170> produce<00:01:14.409> a<00:01:15.119> natural

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
architecture so I will produce a natural

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.600 
architecture so I will produce a natural
climate<00:01:16.360> but<00:01:16.840> in<00:01:17.020> an<00:01:17.200> artificial<00:01:17.710> way<00:01:18.100> so<00:01:18.520> it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
climate but in an artificial way so it

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.490 
climate but in an artificial way so it
means<00:01:18.790> if<00:01:18.969> you<00:01:19.149> want<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.570> feel<00:01:19.840> what<00:01:20.320> it<00:01:20.469> is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
means if you want to feel what it is

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.920 
means if you want to feel what it is
natural<00:01:21.100> you<00:01:21.340> have<00:01:21.549> to<00:01:21.700> artificially<00:01:22.270> to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
natural you have to artificially to

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.029 
natural you have to artificially to
produce<00:01:23.170> equally<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:24.430> after<00:01:25.060> natural<00:01:26.039> don't

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
produce equally so after natural don't

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.450 
produce equally so after natural don't
doesn't<00:01:27.729> exist<00:01:28.090> anymore<00:01:28.360> faster<00:01:29.140> so<00:01:29.829> so<00:01:30.280> it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
doesn't exist anymore faster so so it

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.520 
doesn't exist anymore faster so so it
was<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:30.670> only<00:01:30.820> way<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.270> feel<00:01:31.990> fun<00:01:32.409> to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
was the only way to feel fun to

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.340 
was the only way to feel fun to
experiment<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:33.670> natural<00:01:34.119> situation<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:35.229> is

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
experiment so natural situation it is

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.149 
experiment so natural situation it is
you're<00:01:35.680> producing<00:01:36.039> artificial<00:01:36.820> maybe<00:01:37.659> if

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
you're producing artificial maybe if

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.069 
you're producing artificial maybe if
outside<00:01:39.270> become<00:01:40.270> something<00:01:40.570> artificial

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
outside become something artificial

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.160 
outside become something artificial
maybe<00:01:41.500> inside<00:01:42.189> we<00:01:42.520> could<00:01:42.840> create<00:01:43.840> something

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
maybe inside we could create something

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.740 
maybe inside we could create something
natural<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.159> we<00:01:45.310> could<00:01:45.490> inverse<00:01:46.000> the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
natural and so we could inverse the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.789 
natural and so we could inverse the
position<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:48.060> architecture<00:01:49.469> between<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:50.590> two

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
position of architecture between the two

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.040 
position of architecture between the two
and<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:52.509> this

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
and for this

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.130 
and for this
I<00:01:54.140> begin<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.160> walk<00:01:55.550> on<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.210> on<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:56.900> project

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
I begin to walk on the on this project

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.870 
I begin to walk on the on this project
for<00:01:57.350> Packie<00:01:57.620> for<00:01:58.460> elder<00:01:59.150> pie<00:01:59.330> and<00:02:00.640> in<00:02:01.640> this

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
for Packie for elder pie and in this

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.920 
for Packie for elder pie and in this
project<00:02:02.420> I<00:02:02.810> begin<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:04.000> interest<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.480> myself

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
project I begin to interest to myself

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.740 
project I begin to interest to myself
about<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.740> question<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:08.410> water<00:02:10.750> because

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
about the question of the water because

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.810 
about the question of the water because
it<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.170> same<00:02:12.380> situation<00:02:13.070> than<00:02:13.280> there<00:02:13.520> is<00:02:13.550> a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
it is the same situation than there is a

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.170 
it is the same situation than there is a
question<00:02:14.210> of<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.930> climb<00:02:15.140> up<00:02:15.820> yes<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:16.940> think

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
question of to the climb up yes I think

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.220 
question of to the climb up yes I think
it's<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.980> we<00:02:18.980> are<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:19.910> are<00:02:20.030> already<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.690> an

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
it's a we are we are already in an

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.440 
it's a we are we are already in an
artificial<00:02:21.850> climate<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.480> think<00:02:23.630> it's<00:02:23.990> a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
artificial climate and so I think it's a

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.080 
artificial climate and so I think it's a
either<00:02:26.450> as<00:02:27.170> an<00:02:27.470> archetype<00:02:27.860> we<00:02:28.070> have<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.400> mean

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
either as an archetype we have to mean

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.750 
either as an archetype we have to mean
to<00:02:29.450> be<00:02:29.570> critical<00:02:29.870> with<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.710> and<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.250> take

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
to be critical with this and to take

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.380 
to be critical with this and to take
over<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.210> elemental<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:33.050> walk<00:02:33.230> with<00:02:34.390> with

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
over this elemental to walk with with

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.550 
over this elemental to walk with with
them<00:02:35.600> we<00:02:36.970> don't<00:02:37.970> have<00:02:38.210> to<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:39.170> say<00:02:39.350> that

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
them we don't have to to say that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.730 
them we don't have to to say that
doesn't<00:02:40.400> exist<00:02:40.760> power<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:41.630> exist<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.320> we

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
doesn't exist power so it's exist and we

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.670 
doesn't exist power so it's exist and we
could<00:02:42.920> rock<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.750> for<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.900> project<00:02:45.170> for<00:02:45.530> this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
could rock it for this project for this

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.850 
could rock it for this project for this
position<00:02:45.890> Paris<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.820> will<00:02:47.090> not<00:02:47.600> be<00:02:47.930> built<00:02:48.200> then

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
position Paris it will not be built then

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.310
