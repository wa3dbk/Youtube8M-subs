00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
is this unique locking mechanism in the

is this unique locking mechanism in the
top<00:00:36.899> corner<00:00:37.530> which<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.070> probably<00:00:38.670> remind

top corner which will probably remind

videos but this one is so different that
I<00:00:55.079> thought<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.590> would<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.949> useful<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I thought it would be useful and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.250 
I thought it would be useful and
potentially<00:00:57.420> valuable<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.020> especially

which I opted for for this particular

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
which I opted for for this particular
video<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.920> don't<00:01:29.070> need<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.759> if

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
video but you don't need to get that if

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.580 
video but you don't need to get that if

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.550 
process is incredibly simple you just
slide<00:01:36.030> your<00:01:36.060> phone<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.290> lock<00:01:37.530> down

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
slide your phone in and then lock down

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.280 
slide your phone in and then lock down
the<00:01:37.979> clasp<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.549> you're<00:01:39.030> ready<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.390> go<00:01:39.600> now<00:01:40.170> in

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the clasp and you're ready to go now in

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.719 
the clasp and you're ready to go now in
this<00:01:40.380> case<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.490> sake<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
this case just for the sake of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.520 
this case just for the sake of
instruction<00:01:42.509> I'm<00:01:42.689> showing<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> how<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
instruction I'm showing you how to do it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.840 
instruction I'm showing you how to do it
a<00:01:43.590> couple<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.920> different<00:01:44.189> ways<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.670> don't

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
a couple of different ways if you don't

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.520 
a couple of different ways if you don't
want<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.180> use<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.509> backplate<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.140> don't<00:01:46.320> need

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
want to use the backplate you don't need

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.859 
want to use the backplate you don't need
to<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.280> could<00:01:47.490> actually<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.270> iPhone<00:01:48.600> 5

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
but more people will obviously use it

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.550 
but more people will obviously use it
with<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.820> full<00:01:54.090> protection<00:01:54.299> by<00:01:54.899> putting<00:01:55.380> the
