 I do the manicure will teach us from 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.520
 zero I will start applying this 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.900
 intelligence cuticle remover 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.900
 for all the cuticles 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.700
 once we have applied the product 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.920
 by all the nails we have to leave 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.950
 about two minutes or so so that 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.890
 act we can not get past the eight 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.520
 minutes is worth it so I've already taken the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.040
 time I remove the excess with a paper and 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 used the tweezers like these good 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.960
 they are like a little hook this is 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.780
 deliplus that I had got this stitch 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.360
 without thread I do is remove all the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.220
 the excess of skin that there is to the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.690
 cuticles do not remove them completely as in 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.830
 the other video that I made of how I do 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.620
 the manicure 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.840
 I take everything out but if I remove 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.880
 all the excesses I can see now 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.100
 that I have already removed the cuticles as 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.950
 you can see my washing hands already for 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.600
 remove the product and I applied a 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.060
 little moisturizer avoiding the area 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.000
 the nails I applied more by the fingers and 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.450
 by the hands avoiding the nails should 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.620
 Apply a protective base to the nails 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.110
 the one that you use from this defendant 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.900
 and he applied it to me by all the nails but 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.280
 for now I will not touch the thumbs 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.010
 because I need it to clean the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.660
 nooks so she only went to make up 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.660
 right now these nails here 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.910
 try to create the base for the colors 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.070
 I'm going to use birth until 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.330
 finish these fingers to be able to continue 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.580
 like thumbs 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.320
 I'm going to use white enamel 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.650
 I have to better go the only thing that 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.570
 it really covers is without leaving gaps or 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.660
 nothing is of this god super super 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.110
 white and I'm going to apply for all 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.110
 the ones 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.959
 when you're done with the white like 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.030
 you see and only with two layers of enamel 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.599
 dior that teaches you covers perfectly 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.000
 that's why I like this glaze, it's worth 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.040
 I can not get other tones with others 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.989
 white glazes now what I'm going to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.200
 do now that it is already dry I have also 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.959
 painted the thumbs is already using a 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.030
 sponge like this is a little sponge 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.269
 Makeup is wet right now 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.630
 our dry is moistened and I'm going to 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.480
 mix the tones that I will use 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:59.200
 you can use a mint green tone that 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.600
 is the glaze arena forum is focused 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.450
 to undo 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.500
 east of here the second one I'm going to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.490
 to use is the like is the chain to 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.450
 grace you also have a pastel thread 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.730
 also and the last one is the impala pin 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.920
 that is also a rosita I'm going to mix 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.850
 these three in this in that order in the 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.880
 sponge first I will apply 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.210
 the green 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.090
 I'm going to make a line 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.820
 and now that I have formed these lines 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.630
 what I 'm going to do is use it as if 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.660
 outside a stamp on the nail 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.610
 so I put it in this case I want 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.000
 let the green go up and the pink go 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.600
 down then what I'm going to do is 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.600
 seal it on the nail 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.570
 now that they are already so what I am going to 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.790
 do is apply the top coat over 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.740
 which I'm going to use is also 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.770
 MÃ¡daba is the one that will best dominate me 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.280
 is the map drive 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.880
 and before I clean it I apply it 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:10.110
 Apply for the other to dry 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.690
 and then clean the edges of the nails and 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.320
 now that the nails have dried 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.930
 that is left with form I have put a 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.760
 little bit of nail polish remover in this 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.190
 little bottle that is the enamel kit cap 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.650
 that is to say that I am going to use and I am going to 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.540
 remove all the fat with sticks 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.990
 it's worth first with a cotton bud 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.910
 use these here to remove everything 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.310
 this what is the edges then I will clean 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.689
 the corners well with a toothpick so 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.389
 a doctor the swab 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.519
 and go removing all the excesses more 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.469
 fat people that have good I have given 

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:51.049
 enough to zoom in so you can see the nails 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:53.689
 they are already taking shape and the last thing 

00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:56.179
 I'm going to do is use this stick is 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:59.869
 a normal toothpick is not a 

00:04:56.179 --> 00:05:02.809
 orange stick or nothing is thinner what 

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:05.659
 I came back with a little cotton 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:09.079
 I go back to pick up some acetone from 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:12.229
 nail polish remover and now if I clean the nail 

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:16.449
 well worth clean to the nail all 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.449
 nooks you can see with enamel 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.300
 well now that I've cleaned everything 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.310
 what had 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.270
 they have stayed like this the nails I'm going to 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.230
 zoom in more for you to see 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.230
 how are they? 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.900
 it also seems like super fun 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.570
 It looks pretty and cheerful, so 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.190

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.820
