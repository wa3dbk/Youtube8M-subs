00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
hopefully how this means that maybe

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.310 
hopefully how this means that maybe
zombies<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:56.850> come<00:00:57.030> back<00:00:57.239> even<00:00:57.989> better<00:00:58.140> than

wish the heroes in our game were real

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.020 
wish the heroes in our game were real
because<00:02:13.230> he<00:02:13.560> wants<00:02:13.950> zombies<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.760> real

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
because he wants zombies to be real

because he wants zombies to be real
they're<00:02:15.780> not<00:02:15.900> going<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.110> think<00:02:16.380> that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
they're not going to think that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.810 
they're not going to think that
something<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.220> cool<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.550> people

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
something like that is cool that people

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.640 
something like that is cool that people
dying<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
dying in the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.559 
dying in the
gigantic<00:02:19.159> apocalypse<00:02:19.670> would<00:02:20.180> be<00:02:20.329> cool

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
gigantic apocalypse would be cool

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.660 
gigantic apocalypse would be cool
there's<00:02:21.260> probably<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:21.860> for<00:02:22.040> shadows<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.579> the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
there's probably just for shadows to the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.729 
there's probably just for shadows to the
fact<00:02:22.939> that<00:02:23.209> maybe<00:02:23.870> they<00:02:24.110> are<00:02:24.230> living<00:02:24.590> their

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
fact that maybe they are living their

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.770 
fact that maybe they are living their
own<00:02:24.769> zombie<00:02:25.340> apocalypse<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.420> they<00:02:26.569> wish

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
own zombie apocalypse and they wish

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.240 
own zombie apocalypse and they wish
there<00:02:27.049> was<00:02:27.140> someone<00:02:27.409> there<00:02:27.470> who<00:02:27.799> could<00:02:27.980> help

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
there was someone there who could help

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.069 
there was someone there who could help
them<00:02:28.430> because<00:02:28.939> they<00:02:29.060> refer<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.480> these<00:02:29.569> four<00:02:29.870> as

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
them because they refer to these four as

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.199 
them because they refer to these four as
heroes<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.370> they're<00:02:31.489> not<00:02:31.640> referring<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.090> them

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
heroes so they're not referring to them

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.819 
heroes so they're not referring to them
as<00:02:32.239> playthings<00:02:32.810> are<00:02:33.019> not<00:02:33.140> playing<00:02:33.349> referring

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
as playthings are not playing referring

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:34.929 
as playthings are not playing referring
to<00:02:33.920> them<00:02:34.069> as<00:02:34.099> puppets<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.730> they<00:02:34.879> were

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
to them as puppets that they were

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.250 
to them as puppets that they were
controlling<00:02:35.359> a<00:02:35.540> referring<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.019> them<00:02:36.140> as

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
controlling a referring to them as

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.500 
controlling a referring to them as
heroes<00:02:36.530> which<00:02:37.370> kind<00:02:37.549> of<00:02:37.730> indicates<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.269> fact

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
heroes which kind of indicates the fact

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.390 
heroes which kind of indicates the fact
that<00:02:38.629> possibly<00:02:39.349> they're<00:02:39.590> living<00:02:40.010> their<00:02:40.040> very

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
that possibly they're living their very

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.270 
that possibly they're living their very
own<00:02:40.629> apocalyptic<00:02:41.629> zombie<00:02:42.170> evasion<00:02:43.040> or

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
own apocalyptic zombie evasion or

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.220 
own apocalyptic zombie evasion or
whatever<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.849> want<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.120> call<00:02:44.329> it<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:45.049> then

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
whatever you want to call it and then

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.890 
whatever you want to call it and then
Samantha<00:02:45.500> says<00:02:45.859> you<00:02:46.340> know<00:02:46.459> it'll<00:02:46.760> be<00:02:46.790> okay<00:02:47.180> my

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
Samantha says you know it'll be okay my

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.020 
Samantha says you know it'll be okay my
father<00:02:48.200> has<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> plan<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.819> know<00:02:49.909> he

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
basically says that Maxis is a plan and

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.190 
basically says that Maxis is a plan and
that<00:02:52.280> everything<00:02:52.549> is<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:52.879> to<00:02:52.940> be<00:02:53.000> okay<00:02:53.480> so

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
that everything is going to be okay so

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.809 
that everything is going to be okay so

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
what does this mean it means that we

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.059 
what does this mean it means that we
might<00:02:56.180> see<00:02:56.480> another<00:02:57.230> zombie<00:02:57.590> story

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
might see another zombie story

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.979 
might see another zombie story
completely<00:02:58.879> different<00:02:59.389> from<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.629> game<00:02:59.810> that

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
completely different from the game that

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.649 
completely different from the game that
we've<00:03:00.109> all<00:03:00.319> been<00:03:00.500> playing<00:03:00.769> we<00:03:00.920> all<00:03:01.040> know<00:03:01.190> that

we've all been playing we all know that

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.819 
we've all been playing we all know that
it<00:03:02.659> was<00:03:02.810> just<00:03:03.019> a<00:03:03.109> game<00:03:03.260> as<00:03:03.379> Samantha<00:03:03.709> was

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
it was just a game as Samantha was

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.530 
it was just a game as Samantha was
playing<00:03:04.099> and<00:03:04.280> again<00:03:04.579> when<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.120> made<00:03:05.329> a<00:03:05.359> video

the other day talking about the

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.619 
the other day talking about the
multiverse<00:03:07.430> theory<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.879> mentioned<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.450> there

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
multiverse theory I mentioned that there

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.089 
multiverse theory I mentioned that there
are<00:03:08.720> little<00:03:08.870> things<00:03:08.959> within<00:03:09.409> different

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
are little things within different

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.240 
are little things within different
universes<00:03:10.879> that<00:03:11.090> kind<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.629> mesh<00:03:12.230> together<00:03:12.709> so

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
universes that kind of mesh together so

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.149 
universes that kind of mesh together so
for<00:03:13.459> instance<00:03:13.930> say<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.959> comic<00:03:15.409> book<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.040> know

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
for instance say a comic book you know

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.559 
for instance say a comic book you know
let's<00:03:16.370> say<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.639> comic<00:03:16.909> book<00:03:17.060> seen<00:03:17.299> that<00:03:17.480> we

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
let's say the comic book seen that we

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.929 
let's say the comic book seen that we
see<00:03:17.750> from<00:03:17.870> zombies<00:03:18.379> and<00:03:18.560> our<00:03:19.040> world<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.639> just

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
see from zombies and our world it's just

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.789 
see from zombies and our world it's just
a<00:03:20.209> comic<00:03:20.510> book<00:03:20.689> but<00:03:21.109> there<00:03:21.260> might<00:03:21.439> be<00:03:21.470> another

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
a comic book but there might be another

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.220 
a comic book but there might be another
universe<00:03:22.340> where<00:03:22.609> it's<00:03:22.760> actually<00:03:23.419> a<00:03:23.599> real

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
universe where it's actually a real

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.650 
universe where it's actually a real
world<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:24.949> we're<00:03:25.489> just<00:03:25.669> getting<00:03:26.000> fragments

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
world and we're just getting fragments

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.300 
world and we're just getting fragments
of<00:03:26.810> information<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.440> passes<00:03:27.889> through<00:03:27.919> so

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
of information that passes through so

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.580 
of information that passes through so
for<00:03:28.790> us<00:03:28.819> it's<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.239> comic<00:03:29.540> book<00:03:29.720> but<00:03:30.260> there<00:03:30.410> might

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
for us it's a comic book but there might

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.259 
for us it's a comic book but there might
be<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:30.769> real<00:03:31.010> universe<00:03:31.400> where<00:03:31.760> these<00:03:31.879> people

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
be a real universe where these people

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.610 
be a real universe where these people
are<00:03:32.449> real<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.930> they're<00:03:33.049> actually<00:03:33.199> going

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
are real and they're actually going

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.080 
are real and they're actually going
through<00:03:33.739> whatever<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.370> hell<00:03:34.519> is<00:03:34.639> going<00:03:34.849> on<00:03:34.940> in

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
through whatever the hell is going on in

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.580 
through whatever the hell is going on in
the<00:03:35.150> comic<00:03:35.419> book<00:03:35.449> that's<00:03:36.049> another<00:03:36.230> one<00:03:36.440> of<00:03:36.530> the

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the comic book that's another one of the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.780 
the comic book that's another one of the
you<00:03:36.739> know<00:03:36.769> another<00:03:37.069> part<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.459> multiverse

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
you know another part of the multiverse

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.629 
you know another part of the multiverse
theory<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:38.470> that's<00:03:39.470> what<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.949> whole<00:03:40.099> game<00:03:40.400> was

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
theory so that's what the whole game was

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.729 
theory so that's what the whole game was
for<00:03:41.120> Samantha<00:03:41.599> it<00:03:41.959> was<00:03:42.079> just<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.379> game<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.709> them

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
for Samantha it was just a game to them

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.649 
for Samantha it was just a game to them
but<00:03:43.549> for<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.819> people<00:03:43.940> who<00:03:44.090> were<00:03:44.209> actually

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
but for the people who were actually

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.409 
but for the people who were actually
living<00:03:44.870> it<00:03:45.109> Nikolai<00:03:45.620> tanked<00:03:46.099> MC<00:03:46.459> tacky<00:03:47.120> alan

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
living it Nikolai tanked MC tacky alan

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.659 
living it Nikolai tanked MC tacky alan
Richtofen<00:03:48.019> Maxis<00:03:48.739> all<00:03:48.919> of<00:03:49.129> them<00:03:49.220> were<00:03:49.280> there

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
Richtofen Maxis all of them were there

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.300 
Richtofen Maxis all of them were there
and<00:03:49.909> they<00:03:50.569> were<00:03:50.629> experiencing<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.799> in<00:03:52.040> their

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
and they were experiencing that in their

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.250 
and they were experiencing that in their
own<00:03:52.459> universe<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.780> might<00:03:53.989> have<00:03:54.079> been<00:03:54.199> a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
own universe so it might have been a

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.110 
own universe so it might have been a
game<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.680> them<00:03:54.709> but<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.549> was<00:03:55.699> an<00:03:55.879> actual

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
game to them but it was an actual

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.689 
game to them but it was an actual
universe<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:57.019> was<00:03:57.109> actually<00:03:57.560> happening<00:03:57.769> you

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
universe that was actually happening you

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.509 
universe that was actually happening you
know<00:03:58.819> apart<00:03:59.359> from<00:03:59.449> just<00:03:59.870> being<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.199> game<00:04:00.519> so

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
know apart from just being a game so

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.500 
know apart from just being a game so
what<00:04:01.609> this<00:04:01.699> means<00:04:01.940> is<00:04:02.090> we're<00:04:02.269> gonna<00:04:02.359> get

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
what this means is we're gonna get

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.640 
what this means is we're gonna get
another<00:04:02.659> story<00:04:03.049> we're<00:04:03.229> gonna<00:04:03.319> get<00:04:03.470> another

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
another story we're gonna get another

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.619 
another story we're gonna get another
zombie<00:04:04.040> story<00:04:04.489> this<00:04:05.090> time<00:04:05.269> we're<00:04:05.359> gonna<00:04:05.449> have

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
zombie story this time we're gonna have

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.149 
zombie story this time we're gonna have
Samantha<00:04:05.989> we're<00:04:06.290> gonna<00:04:06.379> have<00:04:06.620> if<00:04:06.889> that's

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
Samantha we're gonna have if that's

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.670 
Samantha we're gonna have if that's
Max's<00:04:07.699> if<00:04:07.879> that<00:04:08.090> guy<00:04:08.299> is<00:04:08.359> Eddie<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.109> a<00:04:09.500> lot<00:04:09.650> of

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
Max's if that guy is Eddie and a lot of

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.960 
Max's if that guy is Eddie and a lot of
people<00:04:09.829> were<00:04:09.979> saying<00:04:10.190> well<00:04:10.370> maybe<00:04:10.579> Eddie

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
people were saying well maybe Eddie

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.879 
people were saying well maybe Eddie
grows<00:04:11.269> up<00:04:11.479> and<00:04:11.629> he's<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:11.989> one<00:04:12.169> who<00:04:12.349> becomes

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
grows up and he's the one who becomes

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.610 
grows up and he's the one who becomes
Richthofen<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.669> you<00:04:14.449> know<00:04:14.569> that<00:04:15.290> kind<00:04:15.530> of

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
Richthofen and you know that kind of

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.289 
Richthofen and you know that kind of
doesn't<00:04:15.769> make<00:04:15.979> any<00:04:16.159> sense<00:04:16.400> because<00:04:16.669> if<00:04:16.940> it<00:04:17.209> was

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
doesn't make any sense because if it was

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.240 
doesn't make any sense because if it was
just<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.690> game<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.139> he's<00:04:18.349> Richthofen<00:04:18.979> then

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
just a game and he's Richthofen then

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.789 
just a game and he's Richthofen then
that<00:04:19.519> means<00:04:19.639> that<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:20.030> qiao<00:04:20.269> that<00:04:20.959> tanked<00:04:21.409> MC

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
that means that a qiao that tanked MC

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.529 
that means that a qiao that tanked MC
and<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.729> know<00:04:22.849> all<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.150> these<00:04:23.330> other

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
and that you know all of these other

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.180 
and that you know all of these other
guys<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:24.080> that<00:04:24.320> they<00:04:24.470> were<00:04:24.530> actually<00:04:24.830> real

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
guys and that they were actually real

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
guys and that they were actually real
people<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:25.550> they're<00:04:25.699> not<00:04:25.820> there<00:04:25.970> were<00:04:26.030> just

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
people and they're not there were just

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.670 
people and they're not there were just
people<00:04:26.330> that<00:04:26.840> were<00:04:26.930> in<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.169> game<00:04:27.409> you<00:04:27.590> don't

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
people that were in the game you don't

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.839 
people that were in the game you don't
think<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:27.950> Eddie's<00:04:28.310> going<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.520> grow<00:04:28.669> up

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
think that Eddie's going to grow up

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.370 
think that Eddie's going to grow up
become<00:04:28.969> Richthofen<00:04:29.599> and<00:04:29.690> then<00:04:29.779> find<00:04:30.080> people

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
become Richthofen and then find people

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.300 
become Richthofen and then find people
that<00:04:30.409> match<00:04:31.039> exactly<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:31.760> script

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
that match exactly the script

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.540 
that match exactly the script
who<00:04:32.670> Takeo<00:04:33.180> Nikolai<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.380> tank<00:04:35.010> Dempsey<00:04:35.340> ards
