it's<00:00:00.599> day<00:00:00.949> 150<00:00:01.949> of<00:00:02.070> my<00:00:02.220> yellowing<00:00:02.730> and

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
it's day 150 of my yellowing and

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.820 
it's day 150 of my yellowing and
termination<00:00:03.389> experiment<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.290> I'm<00:00:04.529> seeing

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
termination experiment and I'm seeing

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.150 
termination experiment and I'm seeing
actual<00:00:05.279> cobwebs<00:00:05.970> from<00:00:06.569> real<00:00:06.960> spiders<00:00:07.560> nearby

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
actual cobwebs from real spiders nearby

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.390 
actual cobwebs from real spiders nearby
not<00:00:09.059> just<00:00:09.420> spider<00:00:10.110> mites<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:10.950> that's<00:00:11.190> good

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
not just spider mites so that's good

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.430 
not just spider mites so that's good

however<00:00:13.440> those<00:00:13.799> strands<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.460> silk<00:00:14.670> were<00:00:14.940> just

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
however those strands of silk were just

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.120 
however those strands of silk were just
single<00:00:15.660> strands<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.260> know<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.619> kinds<00:00:17.070> that

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
single strands you know the kinds that

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.790 
single strands you know the kinds that
spiders<00:00:18.119> set<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.690> then<00:00:19.140> decide<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.650> they

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
spiders set and then decide that they

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.099 
spiders set and then decide that they
don't<00:00:20.279> want<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.520> commit<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.850> full<00:00:20.939> web<00:00:21.300> so

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
don't want to commit to a full web so

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.590 
don't want to commit to a full web so
the<00:00:23.010> problem<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.490> spiders<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.180> they

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the problem with spiders is that they

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.439 
the problem with spiders is that they
only<00:00:24.779> kill<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.010> small<00:00:26.279> fraction<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
only kill a small fraction of all the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.150 
only kill a small fraction of all the
prey<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> area<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.410> know<00:00:28.529> no<00:00:28.710> predator

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
prey in the area you know no predator

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.939 
prey in the area you know no predator
ever<00:00:29.369> kills<00:00:29.849> off<00:00:30.060> 100%<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.750> its<00:00:30.869> prey<00:00:31.140> unless

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
ever kills off 100% of its prey unless

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.979 
ever kills off 100% of its prey unless
it's<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> confined<00:00:32.700> environment<00:00:32.989> that's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
it's in a confined environment that's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.160 
it's in a confined environment that's
failing<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.420> yeah<00:00:36.420> we'll<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.630> make<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> huge

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
failing so yeah we'll just make a huge

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.950 
failing so yeah we'll just make a huge
mess<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.850> not<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.149> benefit<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
mess and not really benefit you in the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.979 
mess and not really benefit you in the
long<00:00:40.050> run<00:00:40.230> either<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:42.149> got<00:00:42.780> rid<00:00:42.960> of

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
long run either so I just got rid of

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.410 
long run either so I just got rid of
those<00:00:43.170> cobwebs<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> paper<00:00:44.070> towel<00:00:44.420> this

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
those cobwebs with a paper towel this

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
those cobwebs with a paper towel this
lone<00:00:45.840> bouquet<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> flowers<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> nowhere

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
lone bouquet of flowers here is nowhere

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.029 
lone bouquet of flowers here is nowhere
near<00:00:47.820> being<00:00:47.850> done<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.539> may<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.469> greatly

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
near being done I may have greatly

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.709 
near being done I may have greatly
underestimated<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> number<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.180> flowers<00:00:51.570> in

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
underestimated the number of flowers in

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
underestimated the number of flowers in
there<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.739> picture<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.280> ring<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.910> these

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
there if you picture a ring of these

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.869 
there if you picture a ring of these
bloomed<00:00:55.739> ones<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.280> know<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.640> could<00:00:56.850> be

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
bloomed ones you know that could be

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
bloomed ones you know that could be
easily<00:00:57.980> 30<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.280> even<00:00:59.309> 40<00:00:59.550> around<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> edges<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
easily 30 or even 40 around the edges it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.130 
easily 30 or even 40 around the edges it
stayed<00:01:02.210> 154<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.480> yellow<00:01:03.780> onion

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
stayed 154 of this yellow onion

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.740 
stayed 154 of this yellow onion
germination<00:01:04.650> experiment<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.360> may<00:01:06.659> have

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
germination experiment so you may have

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.330 
germination experiment so you may have
noticed<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> leaves<00:01:08.100> are

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
noticed that some of the leaves are

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.039 
noticed that some of the leaves are
falling<00:01:08.700> over<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.150> breaking<00:01:09.390> over<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.750> side

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
falling over and breaking over the side

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.050 
falling over and breaking over the side
of<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> bowl<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:11.580> there's<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.000> one

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
of the bowl you know there's this one

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.140 
of the bowl you know there's this one
leaf<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:13.200> one<00:01:13.500> plant<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.010> bulb<00:01:14.580> number<00:01:14.909> two

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
leaf from one plant in bulb number two

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.690 
leaf from one plant in bulb number two
it<00:01:15.930> has<00:01:15.960> four<00:01:16.380> plants<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.979> shot<00:01:17.250> straight<00:01:17.490> up

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it has four plants that shot straight up

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.359 
it has four plants that shot straight up
and<00:01:18.080> formed<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.170> inflorescence<00:01:19.860> at<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> tip

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and formed that inflorescence at the tip

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.880 
and formed that inflorescence at the tip
I<00:01:20.640> think<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.750> four<00:01:21.960> plans<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.470> bowl<00:01:22.619> number

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
I think the four plans for bowl number

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.649 
I think the four plans for bowl number
two<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.189> spaced<00:01:23.430> far<00:01:23.670> apart<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.240> there's

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
two are spaced far apart because there's

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.899 
two are spaced far apart because there's
already<00:01:24.869> four<00:01:25.770> onion<00:01:26.189> bulbs<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.759> are

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
already four onion bulbs that are

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
already four onion bulbs that are
growing<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.600> fattening<00:01:28.049> underground

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
growing and fattening underground

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
growing and fattening underground
I<00:01:28.890> haven't<00:01:29.369> dug<00:01:29.759> underneath<00:01:30.090> there<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
I haven't dug underneath there to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.890 
I haven't dug underneath there to
investigate<00:01:31.740> yet<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:33.000> based<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> read

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
investigate yet but based on what I read

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
investigate yet but based on what I read
online<00:01:34.110> about<00:01:34.380> how<00:01:35.070> long<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.430> takes<00:01:35.640> yellow

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
online about how long it takes yellow

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.819 
online about how long it takes yellow
onions<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.509> form<00:01:36.780> bulbs<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.680> about

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
onions to form bulbs I think it's about

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.520 
onions to form bulbs I think it's about
time<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.189> both<00:01:38.729> started<00:01:39.210> forming<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:40.290> by

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
time that both started forming just by

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.310 
time that both started forming just by
all<00:01:41.040> six<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.670> these<00:01:41.850> plants<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.600> two<00:01:42.869> original

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
all six of these plants the two original

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
all six of these plants the two original

of<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.259> experiment<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.790> refrigerator

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
of this experiment in the refrigerator

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
of this experiment in the refrigerator
one<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> leaves<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.670> plant<00:01:50.970> from<00:01:51.180> bulb

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
one of the leaves from a plant from bulb

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.590 
one of the leaves from a plant from bulb
one<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.229> shooting<00:01:52.770> straight<00:01:53.040> up<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:54.149> tip<00:01:54.420> is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
fried for whatever reason I don't think

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.010 
fried for whatever reason I don't think
it's<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.640> turn<00:01:57.329> into<00:01:57.540> an<00:01:57.719> inflorescence

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
it's gonna turn into an inflorescence

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.319 
it's gonna turn into an inflorescence
and<00:01:58.740> become<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> bouquet<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.820> flowers<00:01:59.939> like

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and become a bouquet of flowers like

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.899 
and become a bouquet of flowers like
this<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.219> know<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.430> never<00:02:02.520> gets<00:02:02.729> old

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
this so you know it never gets old

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.020 
this so you know it never gets old
looking<00:02:03.390> at<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.860> it's<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.009> blooming<00:02:05.939> in

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
looking at this it's just blooming in

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.779 
looking at this it's just blooming in
slow<00:02:06.299> motion<00:02:06.540> every<00:02:07.530> day<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> check<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.520> this

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
slow motion every day I check on this

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.449 
slow motion every day I check on this
through<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> sliding<00:02:09.720> door<00:02:09.929> if

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
through the sliding door if

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.429 
through the sliding door if
don't<00:02:10.670> go<00:02:10.969> on<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.209> balcony<00:02:11.390> outright<00:02:12.019> to<00:02:12.230> tend

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
don't go on the balcony outright to tend

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.679 
don't go on the balcony outright to tend
to<00:02:12.500> my<00:02:12.620> other<00:02:12.799> plants<00:02:13.219> and<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:14.359> seems<00:02:14.569> like

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
to my other plants and this seems like

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.860 
to my other plants and this seems like
only<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.079> few<00:02:15.379> flowers<00:02:15.769> bloom<00:02:16.219> per<00:02:16.670> day<00:02:16.909> this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
only a few flowers bloom per day this

only a few flowers bloom per day this
has<00:02:18.109> been<00:02:18.140> going<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:18.680> for<00:02:18.980> weeks<00:02:19.159> already<00:02:19.519> and

has been going on for weeks already and

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.149 
has been going on for weeks already and
if<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.079> count<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.500> time<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.859> it<00:02:21.980> took<00:02:22.099> for

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
if you count the time that it took for

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.459 
if you count the time that it took for
the<00:02:22.489> inflorescence<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.420> form<00:02:23.719> from<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.170> leaf

tip<00:02:24.769> it's<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.609> amazing<00:02:26.030> at<00:02:26.180> how<00:02:26.359> long<00:02:26.599> this

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
tip it's just amazing at how long this

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.559 
tip it's just amazing at how long this
whole<00:02:27.049> thing<00:02:27.260> lasts<00:02:27.579> it's<00:02:28.579> sort<00:02:28.849> of<00:02:28.909> like<00:02:29.090> War

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569

I<00:02:34.310> bought<00:02:34.879> some<00:02:35.150> Miracle<00:02:35.810> Grow<00:02:36.049> loom<00:02:36.530> booster

I bought some Miracle Grow loom booster
flower<00:02:37.250> food<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:37.819> this<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.180> specialized

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
flower food so this is a specialized

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.399 
flower food so this is a specialized
fertilizer<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:40.810> specializes<00:02:41.810> in<00:02:41.840> producing

fertilizer that specializes in producing

fertilizer that specializes in producing
more<00:02:42.620> flowers<00:02:43.069> for<00:02:43.310> plants<00:02:43.669> and<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:45.560> know<00:02:45.680> it

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
more flowers for plants and you know it

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.250 
more flowers for plants and you know it
also<00:02:45.950> produces<00:02:46.519> more<00:02:47.090> vegetative<00:02:47.750> growth<00:02:47.780> as

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
also produces more vegetative growth as

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.369 
also produces more vegetative growth as
well<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.459> I'm<00:02:49.669> not<00:02:49.819> quite<00:02:50.120> sure<00:02:50.150> on<00:02:50.750> why<00:02:51.319> this

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
well so I'm not quite sure on why this

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.960 
well so I'm not quite sure on why this
would<00:02:51.680> make<00:02:51.829> a<00:02:51.859> huge<00:02:52.099> difference<00:02:52.519> from<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
would make a huge difference from the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.149 
would make a huge difference from the
regular<00:02:53.329> kind<00:02:53.569> but<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.290> got<00:02:54.470> 30<00:02:54.709> percent

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
regular kind but it's got 30 percent

percent<00:02:58.099> nitrogen<00:02:58.669> the<00:02:59.209> composition<00:02:59.750> is

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
percent nitrogen the composition is

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.429 
percent nitrogen the composition is
different

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
different

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.849 
different
I<00:03:00.530> think<00:03:01.069> flipped<00:03:01.400> for<00:03:01.700> one<00:03:01.819> of<00:03:01.939> those

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
I think flipped for one of those

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.530 
I think flipped for one of those
probably<00:03:03.859> just<00:03:04.159> 30<00:03:04.579> percent<00:03:04.669> nitrogen<00:03:05.419> and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
probably just 30 percent nitrogen and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.629 
probably just 30 percent nitrogen and
regular<00:03:05.870> fertilizer<00:03:06.049> I<00:03:06.620> forgot<00:03:07.189> so<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.459> take

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
regular fertilizer I forgot so you take

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.250 
regular fertilizer I forgot so you take
that<00:03:07.849> scoop<00:03:08.209> put<00:03:08.569> some<00:03:08.719> of<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.840> blue

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
that scoop put some of that blue

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.159 
that scoop put some of that blue
crystalline<00:03:09.829> powder<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.340> water<00:03:10.689> shake<00:03:11.689> and

crystalline powder in water shake and

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.619 
crystalline powder in water shake and
you<00:03:13.159> know<00:03:13.250> just<00:03:13.489> water<00:03:13.730> at<00:03:13.849> your<00:03:13.969> leisure<00:03:14.180> I

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
you know just water at your leisure I

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.409 
you know just water at your leisure I
read<00:03:15.079> somewhere<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:16.699> can<00:03:16.940> also<00:03:17.150> be

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
read somewhere that it can also be

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.289 
read somewhere that it can also be
absorbed<00:03:17.750> through<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.079> leaves<00:03:18.379> but<00:03:19.090> I'm<00:03:20.090> not

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
absorbed through the leaves but I'm not

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.119 
absorbed through the leaves but I'm not
really<00:03:20.449> sure<00:03:20.750> like<00:03:21.049> why<00:03:21.500> there<00:03:21.859> would<00:03:21.979> be<00:03:22.010> a

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
really sure like why there would be a

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.059 
really sure like why there would be a
mechanism<00:03:22.579> in<00:03:22.879> plans<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.479> do<00:03:23.629> so<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.229> kind<00:03:25.010> of

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
mechanism in plans to do so so kind of

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.339 
mechanism in plans to do so so kind of
discounting<00:03:25.760> that<00:03:25.790> for<00:03:26.120> now<00:03:26.239> if<00:03:26.750> there<00:03:27.229> are

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
discounting that for now if there are

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.530 
discounting that for now if there are

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
blue crystals on your leaves the next

blue crystals on your leaves the next
day<00:03:29.979> due<00:03:30.979> to<00:03:31.099> evaporation<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.849> can<00:03:32.000> just<00:03:32.209> wash

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
day due to evaporation you can just wash

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.899 
day due to evaporation you can just wash
them<00:03:32.870> off<00:03:33.049> with<00:03:33.349> water<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.949> next<00:03:34.099> time<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.639> get

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
them off with water the next time to get

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.789 
them off with water the next time to get
into<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.299> soil<00:03:36.189> okay<00:03:37.189> it's<00:03:37.340> day<00:03:37.870> 157<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.769> I

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
into the soil okay it's day 157 so I

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.270 
into the soil okay it's day 157 so I
read<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:41.419> leaves<00:03:41.900> will<00:03:42.169> fall<00:03:42.199> over<00:03:42.680> and

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
read that the leaves will fall over and

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.449 
read that the leaves will fall over and
die<00:03:43.340> turn<00:03:44.329> yellow<00:03:44.569> at<00:03:44.780> some<00:03:45.019> point<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.829> wither

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
die turn yellow at some point and wither

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.020 
die turn yellow at some point and wither
away

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
away

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.390 
away
and<00:03:47.349> that'll<00:03:48.349> signal<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:48.979> your<00:03:49.129> harvest

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
and that'll signal that your harvest

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.270 
and that'll signal that your harvest
will<00:03:49.759> be<00:03:49.879> ready<00:03:50.120> within<00:03:50.449> a<00:03:50.689> few<00:03:50.840> weeks<00:03:51.280> so

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
will be ready within a few weeks so

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.369 
will be ready within a few weeks so
we're<00:03:52.849> not<00:03:53.180> quite<00:03:53.389> at<00:03:53.569> that<00:03:53.599> point<00:03:53.750> yet<00:03:54.019> but

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
we're not quite at that point yet but

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.289 
we're not quite at that point yet but
there's<00:03:55.009> separation<00:03:55.519> between<00:03:55.819> these<00:03:56.060> four

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
there's separation between these four

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.420 
there's separation between these four
plants<00:03:56.599> so<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:56.900> think<00:03:57.049> we're<00:03:57.709> not<00:03:57.829> that<00:03:58.129> far

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
plants so I think we're not that far

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.129 
plants so I think we're not that far
away

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
away

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.229 
away
this<00:04:00.139> plant<00:04:00.680> still<00:04:01.040> is<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.459> midst<00:04:01.699> of<00:04:01.970> a

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
this plant still is in the midst of a

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.159 
this plant still is in the midst of a
full<00:04:02.629> bloom

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
full bloom

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.460 
full bloom
I<00:04:03.199> read<00:04:04.009> that<00:04:04.189> yellow<00:04:04.430> onions<00:04:04.909> flower<00:04:05.750> rarely

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
I read that yellow onions flower rarely

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.499 
I read that yellow onions flower rarely
in<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.829> first<00:04:07.069> year<00:04:07.459> not<00:04:07.699> all<00:04:07.909> plants<00:04:08.180> will

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:08.509 
in the first year not all plants will

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.619 
in the first year not all plants will
and<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.739> those<00:04:10.099> that<00:04:10.370> do<00:04:10.609> won't<00:04:11.209> even<00:04:11.479> be

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
and that those that do won't even be

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.080 
and that those that do won't even be
producing<00:04:12.199> seeds<00:04:12.530> which<00:04:12.919> is<00:04:13.129> puzzling<00:04:13.819> to<00:04:13.970> me

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
producing seeds which is puzzling to me

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.120 
producing seeds which is puzzling to me
because<00:04:14.449> why<00:04:14.989> is<00:04:15.049> this<00:04:15.319> plant<00:04:15.620> flowering<00:04:16.039> if

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
because why is this plant flowering if

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.509 
because why is this plant flowering if
it's<00:04:16.280> not<00:04:16.430> gonna<00:04:16.519> produce<00:04:16.789> any<00:04:17.000> seeds<00:04:18.519> maybe

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
it's not gonna produce any seeds maybe

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.709 
it's not gonna produce any seeds maybe
it's<00:04:19.669> just<00:04:19.789> saving<00:04:20.060> its<00:04:20.299> reproductive

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:20.719 
it's just saving its reproductive

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.620 
it's just saving its reproductive
capacity<00:04:21.709> through<00:04:22.370> seed<00:04:22.610> production

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
capacity through seed production

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.650 
capacity through seed production
for<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.350> second<00:04:24.710> year<00:04:24.790> but<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:26.060> other<00:04:26.180> plants

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
for the second year but the other plants

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.390 
for the second year but the other plants
they're<00:04:26.870> just<00:04:27.140> pursuing<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.710> strategy<00:04:27.950> of

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
they're just pursuing a strategy of

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.500 
they're just pursuing a strategy of
vegetative<00:04:29.060> growth

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
vegetative growth

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.470 
vegetative growth
they'll<00:04:29.930> overwinter<00:04:30.860> as<00:04:31.130> fat<00:04:31.670> onion<00:04:32.060> bulbs

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
they'll overwinter as fat onion bulbs

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.320 
they'll overwinter as fat onion bulbs
and<00:04:32.660> come<00:04:33.470> again<00:04:33.710> next<00:04:34.340> spring<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:35.150> produce

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
and come again next spring to produce

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.830 
and come again next spring to produce
plants<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.080> can<00:04:36.380> flower<00:04:37.100> and<00:04:37.610> produce<00:04:38.450> seeds

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
plants that can flower and produce seeds

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.580 
plants that can flower and produce seeds
this<00:04:39.590> is<00:04:39.650> footage<00:04:40.280> from<00:04:40.610> day<00:04:40.880> 160<00:04:41.870> so<00:04:42.290> as<00:04:42.470> you

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
this is footage from day 160 so as you

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.880 
this is footage from day 160 so as you
can<00:04:42.710> see<00:04:42.890> not<00:04:43.130> much<00:04:43.370> has<00:04:43.610> changed<00:04:43.640> this<00:04:44.330> is<00:04:44.570> a

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
can see not much has changed this is a

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.820 
can see not much has changed this is a
slow-moving<00:04:45.890> plant<00:04:47.110> just<00:04:48.110> like<00:04:48.320> ginger<00:04:48.710> is

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
slow-moving plant just like ginger is

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.580 
slow-moving plant just like ginger is
but<00:04:49.160> not<00:04:49.490> quite<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.360> slow<00:04:50.660> well<00:04:50.870> actually<00:04:51.410> it

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
but not quite that slow well actually it

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.470 
but not quite that slow well actually it
is<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.980> mean<00:04:52.160> after<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.700> initial<00:04:53.060> burst<00:04:53.240> of

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
is I mean after the initial burst of

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.460 
is I mean after the initial burst of
leaves<00:04:53.980> there's<00:04:54.980> hardly<00:04:55.250> any<00:04:55.400> growth<00:04:55.670> so<00:04:56.480> some

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
leaves there's hardly any growth so some

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.990 
leaves there's hardly any growth so some
of<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.620> flowers<00:04:57.950> at<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.100> top<00:04:58.370> have<00:04:58.580> started

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
of the flowers at the top have started

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.570 
of the flowers at the top have started
wilting<00:04:59.720> and<00:04:59.840> turning<00:05:00.170> brown<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.370> think

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
wilting and turning brown and I think

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.670 
wilting and turning brown and I think
there's<00:05:01.730> maybe<00:05:01.910> only<00:05:02.030> 5<00:05:02.510> to<00:05:02.720> 10<00:05:02.960> flower<00:05:03.290> bulbs

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
there's maybe only 5 to 10 flower bulbs

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.050 
there's maybe only 5 to 10 flower bulbs
that<00:05:03.740> haven't<00:05:04.100> opened<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:04.610> this<00:05:04.760> entire

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
that haven't opened and this entire

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.570 
that haven't opened and this entire
bouquet<00:05:05.540> I<00:05:05.840> haven't<00:05:06.800> done<00:05:06.890> a<00:05:06.950> count<00:05:07.220> of

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
bouquet I haven't done a count of

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.520 
bouquet I haven't done a count of
anything<00:05:08.090> but<00:05:08.420> you<00:05:08.600> would<00:05:08.750> I<00:05:08.990> would<00:05:09.170> say<00:05:09.350> it's

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
anything but you would I would say it's

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.810 
anything but you would I would say it's
closer<00:05:09.770> to<00:05:10.720> 150<00:05:11.720> at<00:05:11.870> this<00:05:12.050> point<00:05:12.350> so<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:13.340> wrap

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
closer to 150 at this point so to wrap

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.540 
closer to 150 at this point so to wrap
up<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.420> yellow<00:05:14.660> onion<00:05:15.020> is<00:05:15.230> a<00:05:15.530> biennial<00:05:16.250> plant

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
up the yellow onion is a biennial plant

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.660 
up the yellow onion is a biennial plant
that<00:05:16.850> lives<00:05:17.030> for<00:05:17.600> two<00:05:17.780> years<00:05:18.140> and<00:05:18.520> you<00:05:19.520> know

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
that lives for two years and you know

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.490 
that lives for two years and you know
most<00:05:20.180> of<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.360> time<00:05:20.510> it<00:05:20.630> doesn't<00:05:20.810> do<00:05:21.020> this<00:05:21.230> in

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
most of the time it doesn't do this in

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.550 
most of the time it doesn't do this in
the<00:05:21.980> first<00:05:22.220> year<00:05:22.630> so<00:05:23.630> I'm<00:05:23.930> looking<00:05:24.290> forward<00:05:24.530> to

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
the first year so I'm looking forward to

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.140 
the first year so I'm looking forward to
getting<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.220> harvest<00:05:25.760> of<00:05:26.060> bulbs<00:05:26.510> pretty<00:05:26.870> soon
