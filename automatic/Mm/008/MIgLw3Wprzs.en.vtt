is way too easy if you want a challenge
you've<00:02:35.909> got<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.420> set<00:02:36.629> it<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> hard<00:02:37.260> mode

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
you've got to set it to the hard mode

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.979 
you've got to set it to the hard mode
and<00:02:37.739> then<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.220> becomes<00:02:38.489> really<00:02:39.390> fun<00:02:39.780> because

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
and then it becomes really fun because

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.559 
and then it becomes really fun because
it's<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.560> frantic<00:02:40.920> mess<00:02:41.430> with<00:02:42.060> explosions

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
it's just a frantic mess with explosions

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.960 
it's just a frantic mess with explosions
and<00:02:43.110> power-ups<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.920> your<00:02:44.129> opponent<00:02:44.519> defense

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
and power-ups and your opponent defense

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.850 
and power-ups and your opponent defense
becomes<00:02:45.480> far<00:02:45.870> more<00:02:46.049> difficult<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:49.290> it's<00:02:49.590> like

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
becomes far more difficult so it's like

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.390 
becomes far more difficult so it's like
