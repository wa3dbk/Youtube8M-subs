00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that they got up to pretty good for the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.940 
that they got up to pretty good for the
speed<00:00:44.190> before<00:00:44.399> they<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.239> light<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
speed before they got to this light and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
speed before they got to this light and
with<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> conditions<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> being<00:00:48.030> cold

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
with the conditions with the being cold

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
with the conditions with the being cold
the<00:00:49.020> guy<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.469> actually<00:00:49.739> looks<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.340> he

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the guy the right actually looks like he

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.189 
the guy the right actually looks like he
had<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> lot<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> horsepower<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.840> his<00:00:51.960> car

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
had a lot of horsepower with his car

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.049 
had a lot of horsepower with his car
because<00:00:52.770> every<00:00:53.219> time<00:00:53.250> he's<00:00:53.550> found<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> gas

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
because every time he's found the gas

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240 
because every time he's found the gas
the<00:00:54.390> back<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.719> would<00:00:54.930> kind<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.110> break<00:00:55.320> free<00:00:55.620> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the back in would kind of break free I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.520 
the back in would kind of break free I
knew<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.840> cold<00:00:58.109> weather<00:00:59.030> attributed<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
knew that the cold weather attributed to

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.020 
knew that the cold weather attributed to
the<00:01:01.530> amount<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.800> horsepower<00:01:01.920> he<00:01:02.309> had<00:01:02.520> probably

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the amount of horsepower he had probably

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.570 
the amount of horsepower he had probably
just<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.629> him<00:01:03.809> good<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.799> kids<00:01:05.489> are

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
just one get him good you know kids are

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.890 
just one get him good you know kids are
more<00:01:05.729> worried<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.299> riding<00:01:06.600> their<00:01:06.750> bikes

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
more worried about riding their bikes

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.170 
more worried about riding their bikes
and<00:01:07.080> stuff<00:01:07.140> right<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:08.159> seen<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> video

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
probably called a power shift and back

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.620 
probably called a power shift and back
in<00:01:28.439> broke<00:01:28.680> free<00:01:28.979> he<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.210> went<00:01:30.299> over<00:01:30.509> the
