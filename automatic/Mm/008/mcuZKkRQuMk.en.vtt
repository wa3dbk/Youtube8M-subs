00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.620 

I<00:02:03.020> think<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:03.950> have<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:06.280> sign<00:02:07.280> for<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.760> I<00:02:08.000> might

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
I think I have a sign for it I might

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.680 
I think I have a sign for it I might
just<00:02:08.810> do<00:02:09.020> one<00:02:09.289> of<00:02:09.319> these<00:02:09.729> this<00:02:10.729> is<00:02:10.970> exactly<00:02:11.540> how

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
just do one of these this is exactly how

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.660 
just do one of these this is exactly how
it<00:02:11.840> looked<00:02:12.020> like<00:02:12.170> in<00:02:12.319> Lisa<00:02:12.500> birth<00:02:12.770> but<00:02:13.430> it

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
it looked like in Lisa birth but it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.100 
it looked like in Lisa birth but it
wasn't<00:02:13.910> really<00:02:14.120> one<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.390> those<00:02:14.569> it<00:02:14.810> was<00:02:14.930> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
wasn't really one of those it was the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.370 
wasn't really one of those it was the
one<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:16.069> roller<00:02:16.850> coaster<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:17.540> was<00:02:17.840> hanging<00:02:18.260> on

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
one the roller coaster I was hanging on

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.830 
one the roller coaster I was hanging on
yeah<00:02:18.709> this<00:02:18.830> one<00:02:19.040> exactly<00:02:19.700> wait<00:02:20.420> can<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.690> even

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
yeah this one exactly wait can you even

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.229 
yeah this one exactly wait can you even
make<00:02:21.140> one<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.440> these<00:02:21.530> like<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.209> a

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
make one of these like that is this a

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:37.650 
make one of these like that is this a
continuous<00:02:29.660> record<00:02:30.620> mode<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:33.550> don't<00:02:34.550> even<00:02:34.640> know

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.380 

let's<00:02:38.660> find<00:02:38.930> out

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
let's find out

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.090 
let's find out
reverse<00:02:41.390> laughing<00:02:41.930> no<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.560> don't<00:02:42.830> think<00:02:42.890> the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
reverse laughing no I don't think the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.610 
reverse laughing no I don't think the
one<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.280> had<00:02:43.580> can<00:02:43.880> do<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:47.000> sucks

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.650 

well<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:51.860> one<00:02:52.100> can<00:02:52.670> kind<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.030> do<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.209> no<00:02:53.450> not

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
well this one can kind of do it no not

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.420 
well this one can kind of do it no not
really

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
really

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.120 
really
what<00:02:55.430> did<00:02:55.550> that<00:02:55.580> I'm<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.269> my<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.769> could<00:02:57.769> do<00:02:57.980> one<00:02:58.100> of

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
what did that I'm a my I could do one of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.970 
what did that I'm a my I could do one of
these<00:02:58.340> these<00:02:58.880> are<00:02:59.239> pretty<00:02:59.360> weird<00:02:59.600> but<00:03:00.500> I'm<00:03:00.860> not

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
these these are pretty weird but I'm not

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.320 
these these are pretty weird but I'm not
really<00:03:01.280> using<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.580> much<00:03:01.850> but<00:03:02.120> they<00:03:02.209> are

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
really using that much but they are

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.400 
really using that much but they are
interesting<00:03:03.430> they<00:03:04.430> can't<00:03:04.670> loop<00:03:04.910> or<00:03:05.209> do<00:03:05.410> twists

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
interesting they can't loop or do twists

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.910 
interesting they can't loop or do twists
or<00:03:06.560> whatnot

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
or whatnot

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.860 
or whatnot
this<00:03:07.340> one<00:03:07.519> can<00:03:07.730> do<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.480> has<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.630> be<00:03:08.840> a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
this one can do it it has to be a

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.250 
this one can do it it has to be a
complete<00:03:09.110> circle

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.140 

I<00:03:13.360> think<00:03:14.360> I'll<00:03:14.450> be<00:03:14.540> one<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.810> these<00:03:16.090> yeah<00:03:17.410> this

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
I think I'll be one of these yeah this

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.070 
I think I'll be one of these yeah this
yeah<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:22.660> yeah<00:03:23.660> I'll<00:03:23.750> do<00:03:23.900> it

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.340 
that was pretty good idea I might do
something<00:06:36.210> like<00:06:36.330> this<00:06:36.510> I<00:06:36.720> mean<00:06:36.750> this<00:06:36.870> is<00:06:37.140> named

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140 
running conquer and so I might do

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.790 
running conquer and so I might do
something<00:06:43.350> like<00:06:43.470> that

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
something like that

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.430 
something like that
