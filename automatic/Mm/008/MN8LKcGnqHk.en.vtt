00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
demolition sabotage or domination but I

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.340 
demolition sabotage or domination but I
personally<00:02:51.810> think<00:02:52.370> playing<00:02:53.370> ground<00:02:53.670> war<00:02:53.820> on

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
personally think playing ground war on

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.830 
personally think playing ground war on
domination<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.650> spawn<00:02:56.400> spawn<00:02:56.970> spawn<00:02:57.570> killing

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
domination and spawn spawn spawn killing

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.160 
domination and spawn spawn spawn killing
them<00:02:57.990> is<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.800> easiest<00:02:59.130> way<00:02:59.630> but<00:03:00.630> yeah<00:03:00.870> this

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170
