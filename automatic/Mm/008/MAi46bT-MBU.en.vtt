move<00:02:09.170> them<00:02:09.350> in<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.590> fridge<00:02:09.860> which<00:02:10.310> was<00:02:10.459> set

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
move them in the fridge which was set

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.110 
move them in the fridge which was set
completely<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:12.370> think<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.459> reason<00:02:13.730> why<00:02:13.880> this

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
completely I think the reason why this

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.490 
completely I think the reason why this
dessert<00:02:14.450> started<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.930> become<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.260> bit

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
dessert started to become a bit

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.070 
dessert started to become a bit
unpopular<00:02:16.220> on<00:02:16.400> out<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.940> fashion<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.540> because

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
unpopular on out of fashion is because

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.900 
unpopular on out of fashion is because
of<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.290> sweetness<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:19.010> know<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.580> mostly

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
of the sweetness you know it's mostly

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.759 
of the sweetness you know it's mostly
sugar<00:02:20.299> as<00:02:20.480> we'd<00:02:20.690> seen<00:02:20.900> when<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.110> was<00:02:21.260> mixing<00:02:21.620> it

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
sugar as we'd seen when I was mixing it

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.860 
sugar as we'd seen when I was mixing it
away<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.549> that's<00:02:22.760> why<00:02:23.030> I'm<00:02:23.360> gonna<00:02:23.540> serve<00:02:23.840> it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
away and that's why I'm gonna serve it

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.559 
away and that's why I'm gonna serve it
with<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.620> mascarpone<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.459> lemon<00:02:25.549> jello<00:02:26.239> cream

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
with a mascarpone and lemon jello cream

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.090 
with a mascarpone and lemon jello cream

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
and that's gonna give us a great

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.870 
and that's gonna give us a great
contrast

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
contrast

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.060 
contrast
who's<00:02:29.239> gonna<00:02:29.390> balance<00:02:29.870> with<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.590> sweetness

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
who's gonna balance with the sweetness

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.270 
who's gonna balance with the sweetness
and<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.730> tang<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.269> lemon<00:02:32.920> smooth<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.250> the
