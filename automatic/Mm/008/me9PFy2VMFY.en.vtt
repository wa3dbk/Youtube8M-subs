00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.840
 but 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.680
 hello, I am a tile and I saw it as it is 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.050
 done in the video a little while ago 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.150
 I will teach how to put an object 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.250
 on top of another and how to do it from 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.260
 ramps in the gta map maker 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.830
 online as you can see there is no trap or cardboard 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.320
 entered directly to the creator and entered 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.090
 a race but it can be done in 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.530
 any whatever we can do 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.540
 a run of the terrestrial and you can 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.550
 Doing this can also be done in a 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.350
 death game as you see to be able 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.989
 start putting the accessories I have to 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.730
 put then where will start the game 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.769
 and where will the principle of the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.019
 race as you have seen then I already 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.760
 they let put the accessories then like 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.610
 you see lame pump 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.309
 this is the trick to catch the first as 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.140
 You see, he does not leave me then, the second one does not 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.269
 let me put it on but if I put it 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.420
 on the ground and then I catch it again 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.280
 to edit it as you see point and what 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.260
 I can put over that is the thing 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.570
 you see now I can not put it on either 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.490
 but I put it on the floor I'll go back to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.149
 catch to edit it 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.439
 and that's it, you see that I told you 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.170
 I said in the other video that the trick 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.470
 It was very very easy, very easy, you see 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.000
 that can even be erased 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.619
 perfectly you can see it you can 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.869
 erase and then that's how it's done in 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.430
 the aerial battles because it 's all but 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.810
 what I was saying this could go up 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.330
 everything you want as you see 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.520
 even without having more under pump 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.189
 I can put another one and that's the thing as 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.689
 You see, he will not let me put it but just 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.270
 the thing is the same now you see now it proved 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.110
 with the box does not leave me I can not but the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.640
 I put on the floor and edited it and about the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.200
 I can put it up so you can see 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.299
 that you can put any object 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.250
 as long as you have a good base to see no 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.810
 You clearly can not put a car 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.060
 on top of another because they do not have a 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.310
 good base but if as you have seen 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.500
 because the containers can also be 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.330
 or I teach it with the containers but it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.660
 can with the things that they have as I say 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.940
 a flat base is worth having to be 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.890
 you will not be able to do it either 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.840
 it's flat then now I'm going to 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.670
 teach what the ramps are like 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.769
 you saw the career of the video that upload 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.280
 It's been a while since you're going to see it 's very 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.170
 very 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.060
 and easy you just have to look for something 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.120
 that has the height of the ramp first 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.650
 I put the ramp as you see and now the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.120
 only thing that has more or less the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.520
 good height more or less the height 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.890
 nailed off the ramp is this then 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.660
 point is put and a line is made as 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.160
 You see, what I'm doing is like 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.350
 how do you get how you managed to make 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.630
 ramps of the video that uploaded makes a 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.340
 I'm just a little bit here, you see, I'm going 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.530
 putting I'm putting one after another 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.410
 and now simply because you have to do 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.010
 the trick with the with the ramp as you go to 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.530
 see and I'll put the ramp on top of the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.420
 pieces like as right now you will see 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.610
 I tell you the memories will implement veis 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.650
 no no no, you can already know that you do not know 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.980
 can but simply with putting the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.980
 object on the ground and edit it again 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.709
 You see, he did not let me put it, he edited it and 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.390
 boom and let me put it on you have to 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.120
 be so if you have to line up well 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.890
 you have to line up well the line is 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.810
 because if not clearly the ramps do not 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.120
 you can put them but you see this 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.730
 would be the thing even now for you see what 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.769
 I put it back to take it to edit it and 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.850
 already let me put it up this would be the 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.220
 thing for 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.710
 and doing the high ramps like 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.480
 We would like because now, you can see 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.010
 I can make a mountain of bugs 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.230
 these carts of these as everything 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.960
 who wants to go putting ramps on 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.910
 aligned and so everything you want 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.410
 because as you will even see now good 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.660
 As you have seen before, you can 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.310
 erase and things stay in the air 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.750
 that is not a problem you can go 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.610
 doing the mountain and go erasing and 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.950
 making mountain go erasing 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.610
 you could do it if you wanted the 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.110
 50 ramps 50 accessories or almost 40 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.360
 more or less because you would have to do the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.300
 mountain and also about 40 the ramps 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.550
 because of height they are an atrocity already 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.950
 you see there is no trap or cardboard even 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.410
 now I put the car so that it can be 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.650
 see clearly that you can pass the 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.570
 ramps without any without any problem and 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.330
 as I said in the other video is all 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.360
 a famous with this if you have creativity 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.130
 you can do virguerías virguerías de 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.660
 things and now you can see now 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.000
 teach again that perfectly 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.370
 we can erase what is below without 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.190
 no problem and we do not stay the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.650
 ramps or nothing happens the truth 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.350
 a luxury I hope you are liking this 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.720
 this cliché shut up seriously can you 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.780
 make some pretty games with this 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.910
 either races or death games or what 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.940
 what happens to you I hope that you 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.670
 have liked the trick that serves you and if 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.470
 it's like this because you already know like favorites and
