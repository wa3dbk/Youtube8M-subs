basically like the same thing and you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.910 
basically like the same thing and you
were<00:01:39.289> able<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.530> walk<00:01:39.800> in<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.849> the<00:01:41.679> around<00:01:42.679> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.770 
were able to walk in to the around it
like<00:01:43.069> around<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.729> building<00:01:44.090> but<00:01:44.660> the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
like around the building but the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.919 
like around the building but the
building<00:01:45.140> was<00:01:45.229> solid<00:01:45.679> and<00:01:45.830> then<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:47.660> rest<00:01:47.810> of

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
building was solid and then the rest of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.150 
building was solid and then the rest of
it<00:01:48.050> wasn't<00:01:48.380> like<00:01:48.500> you're<00:01:48.619> able<00:01:48.740> in<00:01:48.830> Oakland

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
it wasn't like you're able in Oakland

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.800 
it wasn't like you're able in Oakland
through<00:01:49.369> it<00:01:49.459> basically<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:51.910> this<00:01:52.910> looks<00:01:53.630> to

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
through it basically and this looks to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.779 
through it basically and this looks to
be<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.050> same<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:54.590> I'm<00:01:54.979> just<00:01:55.310> putting<00:01:55.670> a

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
be the same so I'm just putting a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.490 
be the same so I'm just putting a
reference<00:01:56.179> to<00:01:56.539> each<00:01:56.660> other<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.170> believe

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
reference to each other and I believe

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.130 
reference to each other and I believe
they're<00:01:57.739> the<00:01:57.770> same<00:01:58.009> but<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:58.759> could<00:01:58.970> be<00:01:59.000> wrong

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.910 

you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:31.140 

kill<00:02:08.920> you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.229 

I<00:02:32.159> can't<00:02:33.159> I<00:02:33.310> can<00:02:33.519> i<00:02:33.579> press<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.879> switch<00:02:34.060> it

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
I can't I can i press the switch it

00:02:34.239 --> 00:03:03.160 
I can't I can i press the switch it
doesn't<00:02:34.510> do<00:02:34.599> anything<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.890> feel<00:02:42.099> good

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.390 

is<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.560> there's<00:03:05.340> end

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
is that it there's end

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.130 
is that it there's end
is<00:03:07.939> that<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.629> was<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:08.989> there

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
is that so it's that was that there

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.470 
is that so it's that was that there
before
