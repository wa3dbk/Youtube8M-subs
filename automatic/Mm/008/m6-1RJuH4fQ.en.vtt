00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.020
 i 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.620
 very good everyone you know guys and in 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.779
 come to a video blog on the channel and 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.460
 Well the truth is that I've been this week 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.990
 got 2 videoblogs I wanted to tell you 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.700
 things and good I'm doing this 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.740
 second videoblog because I think the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.810
 first it worked very well you understood me 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.970
 the message perfectly and I think it's 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.650
 better try to make a video of this from 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.359
 this guy not commenting what is it 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.430
 what I think and your opinions happen 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.320
 also that is very good and incidentally I think 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.910
 that the issue of power has been better 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.559
 make a videoblog that you see me a little 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.390
 the face even though he can see us 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.220
 but you see me and more or less I think 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.450
 that everything is clearer so good 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.559
 thank you very much for all the support that 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.850
 you gave him in the previous videoblog that 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.950
 I was commenting on the subject of the section 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.600
 more 18 the issue of strikes and so on 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.010
 it's pretty clear and I'm very 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.200
 happy with the result of that blog 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.120
 so it may be that 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.190
 the future of the channel is bringing a 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.480
 little bit more of good videoblogs the thing 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.160
 what do you want to comment on in this first 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.840
 thank you very much for all the 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.700
 support that I received until this week 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.790
 because you know that we have the same day 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.800
 a good moment I'm pretty fucked up 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.690
 but good everything will happen and sure that 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.970
 come better things and that can improve 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.470
 all this trick but good the thing is 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.550
 I'm raffling a west box in case 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.710
 someone found out that I have a pen 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.150
 I'm releasing a quad stoxx by 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.370
 twitter I will surely leave you the tweet 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.180
 here the description in case you want 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.670
 win it you just have to give it 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.619
 retweet to follow me and the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.360
 account and good to the company in this case 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.550
 has provided me with the game so that 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.729
 you can get to all of you and because in 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.590
 a week or so winner was decided 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.360
 a pc windows that the truth is that 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.400
 it's very well in fact I want it and if 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.080
 no, it will be my turn to buy veil and play it 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.090
 but he also wanted to tell you that 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.390
 I am very happy with how it is 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.530
 running the channel a while ago I 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.570
 put a limit has to know either 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.220
 I complained simply that I noticed how 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.530
 that the interaction had dropped a lot 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.360
 not the issue of visits the subject of 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.040
 all that one sees in the channel of his 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.600
 Look a long time ago I had more visits or 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.950
 I had more interaction than now when 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.780
 suddenly to 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.750
 totally and there has been an interaction 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.100
 amazing and I'm having more than ever 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.050
 and I am very happy with all the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.910
 result I think that although some 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.160
 it seems bad there have been many games 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.720
 plus one also not the more 18 but if not 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.980
 all that kind of random games that I'm 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.739
 they have the channel like that of super mario or 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.870
 own games plus 18 I think they are 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.790
 a fresh air for the channel and it comes 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.870
 very good and I'm really happy 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.910
 with the result they are having 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.920
 apart from good you know that all the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.390
 topic of the strike that has fallen to me besides 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.379
 I will touch censor a little more 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.239
 the games but good we will continue 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.860
 enjoying them and always 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.299
 I will try left in the description a 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.739
 link so you can download this 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.390
 game is totally messed up my god 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.280
 is that horrible hairs 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.860
 well another thing I wanted to tell you is 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.900
 the theme of parkour maps because 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.000
 I have reduced a quite enough the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.250
 parkour that I went to the channel my channel has 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.170
 been with many people to better has arrived 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.970
 to my channel because he likes parkour or 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.190
 what is believed in you and I am terrible 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.170
 but good thing is that I had before 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.849
 very much it went up a lot starting with 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.260
 the basis that I did not have a schedule 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.610
 canola had schedule I had when I started 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.810
 on youtube but now back to 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.359
 implement a schedule more than anything to 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.100
 bring the content a bit to football not 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.170
 because I think that 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.180
 it is necessary half in quotation marks 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.920
 because because it is a way to power 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.990
 organize them when it comes to power 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.760
 watch videos not determined and touch 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.530
 some stick and sure it goes up this is 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.720
 indicative because I maybe one day 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.250
 do not feel like it and not just meet those of another 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.570
 thing but more or less those days 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.640
 I will try to fulfill what is going to go up 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.590
 in this case I have reduced the subject a lot 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.350
 of the parkour section because many 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.850
 in the comments you said you see bored 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.620
 both for courses and repro expensive and there 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.030
 an overload of a content type 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.650
 this case parkour as the people 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.330
 I ended up getting tired and it's something that I saw 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.920
 but I 've also seen that what 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.720
 left too much aside when it 's something 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.880
 that should be seen again power in 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.230
 the channel therefore I wanted to ask you to 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.780
 I did not put those comments we would like 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.990
 have some parkour in the channel you can 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.820
 to put on point is putting me please 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.730
 this is because it is very important if I 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.980
 you put the map of parkour ferrÃ¡n or map 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.720
 with effects or parkour map within 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.280
 such or whatever my mail is very much 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.290
 because there are days when we arrived 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.780
 fancy as the best of a pixel art or 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.110
 see a map that is very very curved a 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.110
 heap 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.470
 I have some fat fruits the thing is that 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.820
 I already based my word is that the 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.590
 maps of marcoule have been a bit 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.720
 well or far away and I would like to see if 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.580
 you want me to bring you back to 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.169
 I'm not even better about petar the canal 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.270
 as before but it's best to bring two maps 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.039
 more per week but I will withdraw from 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.930
 the best other section about mario by 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.520
 pure truth that it has gone quite like 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.229
 ass that looks a series that started very 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.940
 ok but something bombs I'm going down 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.380
 going down I think that in the end it can 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.750
 to be even ended up discarding it although I 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.099
 I would like to finish it and in this case 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.870
 subscriber map that has always 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.210
 and I also liked going to play them 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.190
 it's not a method I say so 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.289
 you can transmit to me so much in 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.789
 the books you can not put things that 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.919
 normal better since I can not read though 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.870
 I always say that I try to read everything 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.030
 absolutely everything and another thing that you 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.820
 I wanted to ask you I ask but many things 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.889
 but if you have random games like 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.800
 for example the super Mario and I know that 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.169
 he did not abandon his as well as there is no need 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.660
 that is neither fear nor sexual nor people 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.430
 exempt it from being weird like a game 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.780
 I miss a random game because in it 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.490
 you can mediate so much by message 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.349
 private from youtube as to see if January 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.849
 old point is because I like this guy 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.770
 of content in fact I'm very 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.229
 interested in his life 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.639
 more games of this type I have one 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.710
 prepared from pokemon that is as well as very 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.120
 creepy and surely you see it very soon 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.490
 but the thing is if you have this guy 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.199
 of games that days do to me so 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.150
 well, I do not think I have much 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.770
 more than saying that you have the theme of 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.900
 word doc you know that if you want to win it 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.310
 free of charge and you can make a 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.990
 little football and also very many 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.250
 thanks for all the support I had this 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.319
 You really sent me a week 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.460
 lots of private messages very much 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.020
 football and I'm really grateful 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.539
 because I did not know there were so many people 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.759
 behind not so many people who care about 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.919
 truth is to thank I'm very happy and 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.139
 that's why I'm going to try to bring more things and 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.819
 thank you and surely this month 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.229
 that the previous one I could not do that I'm going to 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.909
 be giving the premium account of 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.080
 minecraft because you deserve it and the 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.729
 wash docs theme and all those are 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.960
 games that draw for people who have 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.090
 premium account as he hears also 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.770
 he deserves to be able to win something else and I think 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.970
 a west box comes in handy so now 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.319
 you know that leaving your I like 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.750
 your comment validated a lot 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:15.259
 that we see a very big hug and 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.259
 until the next
