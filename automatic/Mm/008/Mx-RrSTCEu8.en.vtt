00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.680
 in this tutorial I'm going to teach the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.990
 difference between mac and windows 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.780
 actually the differences between mac and 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.220
 windows are many and here I have windows 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.220
 or else I could have more 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:35.040
 because windows is quite slow 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.320
 and mac instead is very fast that has 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.630
 that see the good have enough 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.150
 differences 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.120
 some are about hardware 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.290
 the windows to run need little 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:54.070
 thing imac uses a little bit more than 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.560
 things but it's also a little faster 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.420
 they carry higher processors 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.059
 more advanced graphics 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.270
 but the software difference at the level 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.520
 of software is the registry 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.070
 people who do not know what the registry is 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.500
 will say and what do you mean 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.020
 and right now the clicks that I'm making 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.789
 or this 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.789
 it is being registered 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.259
 this has a faster solution 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.259
 delete it 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.990
 edit 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.900
 there is a program 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.460
 and it does not start 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.530
 good if you can not use the 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.530
 decline 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.880
 that clears you cookies urls 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.619
 and temporary internet files 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.619
 if you execute it 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:14.220
 this erases files you 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.790
 but they are not files that you use 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.790
 here 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.849
 there are more files that are documents 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.170
 recent executions executions in the 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.409
 start menu all this has been 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.090
 registered and I tell him to run the 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.090
 cleaner and executed it 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.560
 all this is going to clean me 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.960
 I close it intermediate explorer 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:53.210
 and all this has erased 699 mb of the 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.380
 system that once a week can 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.040
 make our computer go 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.070
 pretty fast because I make a 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.380
 week than in a week or something like that 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:08.140
 I do not pass it but the first time I 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.140
 I passed I was quite surprised 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.820
 because a long time ago 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.670
 I did not spend it, I installed the gleaner 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.790
 and I tried it I deleted 7 gigas 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.370
 computer 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.450
 now they are 600 megs but different megs 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.510
 in a week 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.430
 week after week after week 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.430
 it ends up being quite heavy 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.080
 so 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.599
 and just download yourself to pass some 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.220
 Sometimes afterwards this is also not necessary 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.110
 that what 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.940
 I do not need to erase everything 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.620
 example history is not deleted from it 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.530
 can you say do not erase me be the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.510
 story that I use it the urls 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.940
 recently written and because I do not 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.240
 I'm worth nothing to these files 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.530
 also histories of these also the 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.050
 things 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.380
 the passwords not because the access 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.590
 quite then this is configured to your 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.590
 taste 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.769
 and in the end he erases it 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.000
 those that are not very recommendable are 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.590
 this because this will erase the accesses 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.090
 direct from the desk as it can be 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.510
 East East West and East and East 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.160
 trash bin not because it is a file that is 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.870
 default from next windows 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.220
 with children and can not be erased 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.600
 as much as I want 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.750
 suppress 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.860
 here I do not have the option to eliminate 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.860
 very difficult 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.919
 it can only be done in a way 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.139
 rare but not very advisable because 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.960
 is installing the program then 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.960
 after errors and you can not recover 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.480
 Let's see 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:16.760
 the advanced one usually does not touch 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.760
 unless the system is known 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.330
 empty to lose temporary files 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:27.460
 clipboard memory downloads all 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.460
 this can be deleted quietly 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.169
 the trash can 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.659
 depends on files 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.400
 good depends on what files can be 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.350
 erase or there are others that interest you 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.880
 example if you get a virus 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.700
 you are looking at a file that you think 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.620
 It is suspicious but then you realize 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.710
 that it is not 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.500
 then yes, you deleted them , you already have 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.540
 to move down and the whole roll 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.620
 but if you have it in the Trash 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.620
 virus is zero can affect you 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.479
 In a big way 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.479
 and you still have it 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.009
 so now we talk about what we had to 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.610
 talk 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:22.670
 the marq has no record manages 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.580
 otherwise 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:28.040
 that at the moment I do not know too 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.790
 You can search the internet 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.790
 let's look 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.710
 but of 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.750
 max 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.930
 now here 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:58.539
 these are cookies 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.539
 also records and all this 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.040
 and all this 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.139
 the sea ​​that uses all types of registration 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.139
 that is not windows 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:15.290
 that does practically the same but what 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.660
 do otherwise of some files 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.240
 tablets that do not take up almost anything in 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.930
 the disc 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.930
 good 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.990
 to summarize I hope you liked it 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.000
 this tutorial 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.850
 I will leave comments if you liked 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.620
 if you did not like it above all it's 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.860
 considerably important 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.930
 if you did not like me to travel 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.169
 comments to see what I can do and 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.659
 if I can improve 

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:48.379
 because I do these tutorials so that 

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:52.879
 people like it I can take advantage of them 

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:52.879
 not for people to complain 

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:59.389
 well then thanks for watching this tutorial 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.389
 and see you in the next
