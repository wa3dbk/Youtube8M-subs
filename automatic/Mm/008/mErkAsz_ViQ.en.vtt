00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the kids are instructed on how to make a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.189 
the kids are instructed on how to make a
rocket<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.180> they're<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.510> using<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.899> only

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
rocket so they're just using the only

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.930 
rocket so they're just using the only
allowed<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.620> class<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.309> use<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.610> piece<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
allowed in class to use this piece of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.310 
allowed in class to use this piece of
paper<00:00:57.059> alright<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:57.780> use<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> piece<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
paper alright so they use the piece of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.380 
paper alright so they use the piece of
paper<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:59.010> piece<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.309> PVC<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.910> wrap<00:01:00.059> around

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
paper and a piece of PVC to wrap around

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.510 
paper and a piece of PVC to wrap around
it<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.750> gives<00:01:01.170> us<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.800> dimension<00:01:02.280> all

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
it so it just gives us the dimension all

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.560 
it so it just gives us the dimension all
right<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.879> kind<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> roll<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.510> like

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
right so you kind of roll it up like

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.750 
right so you kind of roll it up like
this<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.260> tape<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.610> when

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
this and we tape it and what we get when

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.010 
this and we tape it and what we get when
we're<00:01:05.909> done<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.630> right<00:01:06.810> there

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
we're done is what you have right there

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.750 
we're done is what you have right there
so<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.500> should<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.920> tape<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.280> got<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so that's it should we tape it got it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.120 
so that's it should we tape it got it
and<00:01:08.939> then<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.200> other<00:01:10.439> part<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and then that was the other part that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.380 
and then that was the other part that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
ball of clay so the play that's here and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.980 
ball of clay so the play that's here and
you're<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:14.880> gonna<00:01:15.090> jam<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.869> here

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
you're just gonna jam it down in here

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
you're just gonna jam it down in here
like<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.560> we're<00:01:16.680> cell<00:01:16.920> sure<00:01:17.310> all<00:01:17.520> right

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and then we make a little cone so this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.679 
and then we make a little cone so this
is<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> final<00:01:20.549> piece<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.330> see<00:01:21.509> and

is the final piece here that you see and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.240 
is the final piece here that you see and
we<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.259> cone<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:22.680> wrapped<00:01:22.950> over

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
we get a little cone that's wrapped over

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.920 
we get a little cone that's wrapped over
it<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.670> not<00:01:23.820> pretty<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.390> look<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.840> what

borrowed this one so we have fins that

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.410 
borrowed this one so we have fins that
are<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.610> stability<00:01:35.820> you've<00:01:36.299> got

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
are on this one for stability you've got

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
are on this one for stability you've got
it<00:01:36.540> get<00:01:36.689> altitude<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.799> use

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
it get altitude now we have to use

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.649 
it get altitude now we have to use
Newton's<00:01:38.430> third<00:01:38.610> law<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.479> every

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
Newton's third law right for every

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.210 
Newton's third law right for every
action<00:01:39.810> there's<00:01:40.110> an<00:01:40.200> equal<00:01:40.229> opposite<00:01:40.829> one<00:01:41.009> yes

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
action there's an equal opposite one yes

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.190 
action there's an equal opposite one yes
that's<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.880> all<00:01:41.939> right<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.570> yeah<00:01:42.869> let's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that's the one all right so yeah let's

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.240 
that's the one all right so yeah let's
show<00:01:43.320> everybody<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:43.770> our<00:01:43.890> contraption

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
show everybody what our contraption

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.850 
show everybody what our contraption
looks<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> PVC<00:01:45.780> launcher<00:01:46.380> so

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
looks like here is the PVC launcher so

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.950 
looks like here is the PVC launcher so
it's<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.310> sealed<00:01:47.579> system<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.479> comes<00:01:48.720> up

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it's a sealed system so this comes up

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.420 
it's a sealed system so this comes up
and<00:01:49.079> around<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.009> gauge<00:01:50.220> is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and around here like this the gauge is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.310 
and around here like this the gauge is
here<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:50.939> I'm<00:01:51.060> gonna<00:01:51.149> seal<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.869> place
