previous I was showing how to create a
wireframe<00:00:19.480> right<00:00:20.230> now<00:00:20.320> with<00:00:20.439> the<00:00:20.560> tomb<00:00:20.740> shader

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.479 
all let's just get started here let's go
to<00:00:31.750> file<00:00:32.050> and<00:00:32.290> let's<00:00:32.500> create<00:00:32.680> a<00:00:32.860> project<00:00:33.100> and

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
to file and let's create a project and

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.590 
to file and let's create a project and
you<00:00:33.670> want<00:00:33.700> I'm<00:00:34.510> going<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.750> call<00:00:34.900> mine<00:00:35.170> or<00:00:36.360> b6o

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.150 

f12<00:00:40.600> true<00:00:40.870> oops<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.780> then<00:00:43.840> I'm<00:00:44.680> using<00:00:44.710> the

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
f12 true oops and then I'm using the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.360 
f12 true oops and then I'm using the
defaults<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:46.120> hit<00:00:46.330> accept

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
defaults and hit accept
