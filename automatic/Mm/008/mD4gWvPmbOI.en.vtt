00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
average you're going to lower some of

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.229 
average you're going to lower some of
the<00:00:48.600> settings<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.350> medium<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.860> shit<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
the settings to medium and shit and

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.139 
the settings to medium and shit and
it'll<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> lot<00:00:51.570> better<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.760> flickering

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it'll be a lot better and the flickering

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.250 
it'll be a lot better and the flickering
you<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.680> because<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.800> guess<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.129> center

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
you see is because I guess the center

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.090 
you see is because I guess the center
but<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.350> looked<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.949> actually
