 Next week is the video is a little 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.109
 different because in the last days and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.210
 I'm working a lot on launching the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.139
 university site capenga inclusive 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.670

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.530
 stay nothing is a success more 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.960
 thing for you to waste time or relax 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.340
 While you are studying and why? 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.930
 the video of the week was not that kind 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.310
 vlog about university life that 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.600
 I was doing the following who 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.279
 accompanies a little time to 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.230
 connect what I did exchange and in the end 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.150
 to travel a little between 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.920
 these places that I went I was istanbul 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.800
 I met a guy named 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.420
 jonathan and he does interchange in dublin 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.739
 in ireland the card fine people who 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.300
 I decided to record an interview with him 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.410
 to answer some of my questions and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.239
 galley that is in order to make interchange 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.340
 in ireland and you already know how 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.559
 Interviewer I'm a good student of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.149
 engineering then hope you like it 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.920
 I'll see you next week, we'll come back with 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:54.030
 a super cool video with the release 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.829
 blog everything is already said galerinha 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.149
 I wanted the question I wanted to ask. 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.160
 first the following why you decided 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.350
 make a right exchange because 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.510
 exchange with you are to exchange 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.129
 only by a search for growth not 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.360
 It's personal and professional. I do not think it 's 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.729
 one of the main factors as well as 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.320
 When are you going to get it? 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.970
 arriving in Brazil we were already singing 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.200
 thing better cool job than 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.799
 was with him the labor market in the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.900
 Brazil 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.580
 but were the main factors then in the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.170
 case and decided to exchange 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.450
 study the English language a little more 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 become fans in the English language and why 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.570
 You chose Ireland because we 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.549
 there are united states and canada have many 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.409
 countries there exactly because elano you 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.540
 made is a country that does not have 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.329
 bureaucracy is for us to be able to join 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.549
 inflation in the country and is more in 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.170
 united states and canada same right 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.270
 then it is very easy to get the risk of 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.950
 arrival of the consulate at short notice 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.290
 so I think it's one of the main focuses 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.659
 there for the time being and the Brazilian staff 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.579
 So, we told you that already. 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.159
 of the preparation as was its preparation 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.439
 before you will do much research 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.390
 You have to have been through agencies and it was 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.310
 on your own as you decided it 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.350
 so I actually came by agency 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.240
 It's not you it 's a very 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.829
 bureaucratic so I my opinion 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.329
 just like I did nec corporation 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.180
 agency that is not so difficult for me 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.710
 I advise same type staff 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.210
 It takes a little more on the internet for 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.890
 own account while the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.870
 because it may not be more money 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.460
 You will save. But you will not. 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.840
 invest you think that after you already 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.220
 has the view from there is neither 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.740
 When do you think the university 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.600
 Brazilian or anyone can go alone 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.850
 over the internet without the agency but 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.130
 a safe and quiet journey to ireland 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.510
 it may not be so critical the first one 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.110
 You need to choose a 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.880
 school today have much information 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.350
 solitude in blogs and I have many 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.230
 information are themselves helps 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.730
 people come here understand and month after month 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.830
 the role that we're doing this 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.580
 Do you need a school understood the 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:51.340
 school and hobbies in the forums will help 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:55.130
 in nice and then you need to go back to 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.590
 having this can come alone really 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.959
 give up for a good school can 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.400
 Pressuring a school attended schools and 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.080
 closing the school is still the same as 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.360
 and she will do everything with the 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.670
 intake of housing also initial 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.890
 exactly the same school happened to 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.060
 Class does not understand and trash is just 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.590
 You need to go there, do you understand? 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.700
 Now let's talk a little bit of the day to 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.400
 there day of damage 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.799
 What did you think of the daily routine? 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.770
 It is interesting very polite person without 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.810
 tranquil 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.060
 the city that had you prejudiced 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.800
 suffered some prejudice there I did not suffer 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.180
 A lot of prejudice is a personal 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.300
 there we were already suffering some kind 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.320
 one day try let 's say so is matheus 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.150
 there is 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.440
 but I think my 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.670
 women really have a problem with 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.620
 about the idea of changing the concept of 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.560
 attack nothing but open a safe city 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.500
 like it was the time I was talking 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.030
 Before you work there, but with this 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.560
 issue of work as it is a matter of 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.630
 because many want because many 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.030
 students want to study there too. 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.080
 more precise English of the money also by 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.720
 that's the time to choose ireland 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.090
 because there the student can study and 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.920
 also work without a visa 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.450
 very special work well 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.190
 as that's what I'll talk to 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.400
 You 're hard to find work from. 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.020
 But it's complicated, but it's complicated. 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.820
 important to always have people running 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.340
 ago not always ordered run 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.900
 back could not get behind without 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.239
 insistent in giving these types of 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.650
 substances that feels like I say 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.959
 so you will know if leaving the 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.030
 online resumes gave but let go 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.160
 leaves to be rescued with several was 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.350
 discovered never sack already reminds me 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.240
 was even pulling the job of getting 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.270
 several times arrived in three days in my 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.700
 I work and now I have to call me and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.020
 s financial in the end it worked out we are 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.390
 Truth always has to run behind it. 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.860
 hard arts music right but without 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.190
 chase and ends up finding something 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.190
 cool 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.000
 How am I going to have to buy it? 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.280
 this money is easy to compare things 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.960
 it is cheap to compensate or think about 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.520
 To Brazil, everything really pays more 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.560
 I think make up the day you win there. 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.300
 receiving money so compensates 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.889
 very well it was being comparable and 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.919
 they danced 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.919
 when it rains we have notion for 85 an hour 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.169
 85 hours per month working 40 hours of 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.240
 My friend is little, but what 's this is this? 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.729
 My, I already learned a lot with 500 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.629
 euros surrounds you if you keep it quiet 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:18.060
 insurance only 500 euros until - you 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:22.499
 agency to control the extraction 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.210
 of clay and finally some tip that you 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:26.069
 want to give a final tip to who is 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.689
 wanting to make an exchange mistake 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.639
 because you would have a hint press 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.500
 Anything you do, I know. 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.270
 that before it would have been better to 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.310
 me have any tips then I got home 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.379
 family does not take homestay 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.310
 because they trust the truth so I 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:43.379
 I thought it was cool, it 's cool but it 's expensive 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.060
 given the situation of the person thinks 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:48.090
 it's not worth taking two weeks to 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.400
 spend 400 euros in a family home and 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.339
 with her the week a month or even more 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.550
 more than 125 rentals there a la ata what more 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:06:00.749

 own account also if play play 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:06.779

 talk to someone who is with 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.680
 doubt whether or not to make a 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.960
 exchange if you play is going to be better 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.699

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.830
