 but what if we go to controls it is not 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.830
 changed 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.640

 let's see for a moment we accept here we know 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.830
 that we read ahead and a worse one 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.470
 twice 20 television and protection 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.050

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.740
 horizontal end to review the trash 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.480

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.470
 position of the final pulled out the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.180
 frame this here and even horizontal 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.630

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.630
 in short 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.610
 then 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.360
 how we live 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.650
 as I thought the horizontal ending is in 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.650
 course and uncultivated net 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:54.099
 who is who is damn good morning and 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.099

 the wire interrupted out of the program 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.660

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.820
 the ending is skipped 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.200

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.450
 transformers who downloaded hamas 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.220
 things I hope not because if the 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.510
 unloaded transformer made us 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.080
 outside also something else on the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.850
