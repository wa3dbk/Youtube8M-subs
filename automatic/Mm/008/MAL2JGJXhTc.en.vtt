alright guys I could say yeah I've been
working<00:00:05.069> away<00:00:05.430> on<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.879> new<00:00:06.330> program<00:00:06.779> for<00:00:06.810> vdj

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
working away on a new program for vdj

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.160 
working away on a new program for vdj
basically<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.760> incorporate<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.570> load<00:00:10.050> of

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
basically to incorporate a load of

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.200 
basically to incorporate a load of
elements<00:00:10.559> for<00:00:10.740> scratch<00:00:10.980> DJ<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.670> think<00:00:11.820> we

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
elements for scratch DJ so I think we

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.509 
elements for scratch DJ so I think we
did<00:00:12.389> vdj<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.290> scratch<00:00:13.620> live<00:00:13.860> er<00:00:13.889> lacking<00:00:14.429> at

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
did vdj on scratch live er lacking at

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.890 
did vdj on scratch live er lacking at
the<00:00:14.610> moment

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
the moment

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.109 
the moment
the<00:00:16.139> first<00:00:16.350> option<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:17.100> I've<00:00:17.550> incorporated

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the first option that I've incorporated

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.349 
the first option that I've incorporated
is<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.470> fade<00:00:19.830> fade<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.400> black<00:00:20.490> option<00:00:20.820> which

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
is the fade fade to black option which

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.509 
is the fade fade to black option which
is<00:00:21.600> something<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.260> VDI<00:00:22.830> users<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.400> been

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
is something that VDI users have been

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.880 
is something that VDI users have been
crying<00:00:23.820> out<00:00:24.029> for<00:00:24.180> including<00:00:24.720> myself<00:00:24.859> so<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
crying out for including myself so I

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.410 
crying out for including myself so I
thought<00:00:26.220> I'd<00:00:26.310> get<00:00:26.430> off<00:00:26.550> my<00:00:26.699> ass<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.000> do<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.300> for

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
thought I'd get off my ass and do it for

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.280 
thought I'd get off my ass and do it for
everyone<00:00:32.270> that<00:00:33.270> works<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.690> both<00:00:33.870> channels

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
everyone that works on both channels

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.990 
everyone that works on both channels
just<00:00:34.559> basically<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.340> you've<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
just basically all you've got to do is a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.280 
just basically all you've got to do is a
assign<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.079> level<00:00:37.790> from<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> MIDI<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.290> into

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
assign the level from the MIDI out into

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.360 
assign the level from the MIDI out into
the<00:00:40.469> level<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.550> vdj<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.510> each<00:00:42.719> channel

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
the level in on on vdj on each channel

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.430 
the level in on on vdj on each channel
should<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.430> go<00:00:44.899> other<00:00:45.899> thing<00:00:46.230> I've<00:00:46.410> been

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
should I go other thing I've been

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.060 
should I go other thing I've been
working<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.399> cool<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.860> as<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
working on which is cool is as the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.939 
working on which is cool is as the
timecode<00:00:50.520> slight<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.120> slows<00:00:51.329> down<00:00:51.949> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
timecode slight that slows down the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.590 
timecode slight that slows down the
image<00:00:53.129> will<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> black<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.120> well<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
image will go to black as well and it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
image will go to black as well and it
will<00:00:54.719> also<00:00:54.960> go<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.559> forth<00:00:55.800> between<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
will also go back and forth between the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.180 
will also go back and forth between the
two<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.850> great<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.390> when<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.949> want<00:00:59.129> to

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
two this is great for when you want to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.700 
two this is great for when you want to
cut<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> music<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.629> video<00:01:00.780> cuts<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> so

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
cut the music the video cuts with it so

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.979 
cut the music the video cuts with it so
it's<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.370> kind<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.640> more<00:01:03.300> dynamic<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
it's it's kind of more dynamic in the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.050 
it's it's kind of more dynamic in the
way<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:05.100> audio<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> video<00:01:05.700> goes

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
way the audio and the video goes

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.420 
way the audio and the video goes
together<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.750> also<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.830> scratching<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.340> you

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
together and also for scratching if you

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.390 
together and also for scratching if you
do<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> flat<00:01:09.570> type<00:01:09.780> scratches<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:10.350> tear<00:01:10.590> type

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
do in a flat type scratches or tear type

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.420 
do in a flat type scratches or tear type
you'll<00:01:11.610> only<00:01:12.140> share<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> video<00:01:13.560> when<00:01:14.280> you're

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you'll only share the video when you're

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
you'll only share the video when you're
actually<00:01:14.580> scratching<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.390> when<00:01:15.509> there's<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
actually scratching and when there's a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.050 
actually scratching and when there's a
there's<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.290> turn<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> flare<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> stop

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
there's a turn in the flare or a stop

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.090 
there's a turn in the flare or a stop
it'll<00:01:18.720> cut<00:01:18.930> back<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> other<00:01:19.530> deck<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.979> I'll

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
it'll cut back to the other deck so I'll

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.560 
it'll cut back to the other deck so I'll
basically<00:01:20.460> show<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.880> how<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.030> works<00:01:21.299> with

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
basically show you how that works with

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.760 
basically show you how that works with
no<00:01:21.750> audio<00:01:22.080> first<00:01:23.600> on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.140> right<00:01:25.320> channel<00:01:25.500> no

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
no audio first on the right channel no

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.990 
no audio first on the right channel no
audio<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> right<00:01:26.340> channel<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.820> on

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
audio on the right channel and just on

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.880 
audio on the right channel and just on
the<00:01:27.030> left<00:01:27.299> oh<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.439> how<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.560> works

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the left oh so you see how that works

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.550 
the left oh so you see how that works
pretty<00:01:35.340> cool<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.259> with

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
pretty cool so if I if I do with it with

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:53.270 
pretty cool so if I if I do with it with
the<00:01:37.680> video<00:01:37.920> player

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.520 

so<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.370> see<00:01:54.520> how<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.670> works<00:01:55.170> other<00:01:56.170> thing

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
so you see how that works other thing

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.200 
so you see how that works other thing
that<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.860> this<00:01:57.220> transition<00:01:57.760> is<00:01:57.850> brilliant

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
that this this transition is brilliant

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.110 
that this this transition is brilliant
for<00:01:58.420> is<00:01:58.600> for<00:01:59.200> just<00:01:59.590> plain<00:01:59.740> mixing<00:02:00.370> it<00:02:00.670> just

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
for is for just plain mixing it just

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.670 
for is for just plain mixing it just
takes<00:02:01.300> away<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.690> couldn't<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.140> need<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.440> swap

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
takes away you couldn't the need to swap

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.010 
takes away you couldn't the need to swap
transitions<00:02:03.400> on<00:02:03.580> vdj<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:04.630> if<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.810> have<00:02:04.900> that

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
transitions on vdj so if you have that

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:14.520 
transitions on vdj so if you have that
channel<00:02:05.320> playing

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.170 

right<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:15.739> later<00:02:16.099> for<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> video<00:02:17.030> on<00:02:17.090> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
right so just later for a video on the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:36.990 
right so just later for a video on the
left<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.610> left<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.120> use<00:02:20.330> play

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.250 

that's<00:02:38.000> basically<00:02:38.360> how<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.690> works<00:02:38.720> hope<00:02:39.110> you
