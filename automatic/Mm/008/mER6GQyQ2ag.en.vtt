the<00:00:04.810> octave<00:00:05.200> multiplexer<00:00:05.830> this<00:00:06.040> is<00:00:06.519> a<00:00:06.550> classic

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
true to its predecessor with it you can

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.830 
true to its predecessor with it you can
achieve<00:00:27.310> one<00:00:27.699> octave<00:00:28.060> down<00:00:28.210> so<00:00:28.510> you<00:00:28.570> can<00:00:28.750> get

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
achieve one octave down so you can get

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.529 
achieve one octave down so you can get
really<00:00:29.019> great<00:00:29.320> deep<00:00:29.800> bass<00:00:30.039> tones<00:00:30.369> or<00:00:30.670> you<00:00:31.420> can

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
really great deep bass tones or you can

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.210 
really great deep bass tones or you can
get<00:00:31.660> these<00:00:31.779> kind<00:00:31.990> of<00:00:32.080> gnarly<00:00:32.349> fuzz<00:00:32.710> bass<00:00:32.949> tones

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220

get these kind of gnarly fuzz bass tones
so<00:00:33.699> looking<00:00:34.000> at<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.180> knobs<00:00:34.390> on<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:34.930> octave

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
so looking at the knobs on the octave

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.660 
so looking at the knobs on the octave
multiplex<00:00:35.739> so<00:00:35.890> you'll<00:00:36.010> see<00:00:36.280> that<00:00:36.400> we<00:00:36.489> have<00:00:36.640> a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
multiplex so you'll see that we have a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.640 
multiplex so you'll see that we have a
high<00:00:36.940> filter<00:00:37.360> we<00:00:37.900> have<00:00:38.019> a<00:00:38.049> blend<00:00:38.379> which<00:00:38.620> is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
high filter we have a blend which is

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.110 
high filter we have a blend which is
going<00:00:38.830> to<00:00:38.920> be<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.220> difference<00:00:39.610> between<00:00:39.699> your

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
going to be the difference between your

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.270 
going to be the difference between your
input<00:00:40.479> and<00:00:40.659> your<00:00:40.720> effected<00:00:41.229> signal<00:00:41.589> the<00:00:42.070> bass

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
filter and a sub switch so we have a sub

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.280 
filter and a sub switch so we have a sub
on<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.670> we're<00:00:46.659> going<00:00:46.780> to<00:00:46.809> set<00:00:47.019> the<00:00:47.110> bass

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
on and we're going to set the bass

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.200 
on and we're going to set the bass
filter<00:00:47.650> here<00:00:48.070> and<00:00:48.220> it's<00:00:48.820> going<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:49.000> deliver

this<00:00:49.540> really<00:00:49.809> smooth<00:00:50.260> kind<00:00:50.589> of<00:00:50.739> creamy<00:00:50.979> base

so<00:01:02.049> that<00:01:02.140> sounds<00:01:02.350> pretty<00:01:02.439> cool<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.799> me<00:01:02.949> now<00:01:03.489> we

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
so that sounds pretty cool to me now we

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.760 
so that sounds pretty cool to me now we
take<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:03.850> sub<00:01:04.350> switch<00:01:05.350> it<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.650> off

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
take the sub switch it to the off

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.160 
take the sub switch it to the off
position<00:01:06.090> check<00:01:07.090> out<00:01:07.240> where<00:01:07.390> our<00:01:07.540> high<00:01:07.750> filter

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
position check out where our high filter

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.570 
position check out where our high filter
is<00:01:08.320> so<00:01:08.470> it's<00:01:08.590> that's<00:01:08.770> pretty<00:01:09.070> cranked<00:01:09.430> all<00:01:09.550> the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
is so it's that's pretty cranked all the

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.920 
is so it's that's pretty cranked all the
way<00:01:09.730> and<00:01:10.150> that's<00:01:10.360> going<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.600> give<00:01:10.720> it<00:01:10.840> your

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
way and that's going to give it your

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.730 
way and that's going to give it your
gnarly<00:01:11.350> bass<00:01:11.530> sound

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
gnarly bass sound
