though<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.110> shell<00:03:49.410> covers<00:03:49.890> up<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.160> lot<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.370> his

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
though a shell covers up a lot of his

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.850 
though a shell covers up a lot of his
face<00:03:50.820> he<00:03:51.750> has<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.930> really<00:03:52.410> nice<00:03:52.860> space<00:03:53.250> they're

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.910 
face he has a really nice space they're
really<00:03:55.860> nice<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.750> then<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.870> had<00:03:58.020> back<00:03:58.650> of<00:03:58.860> the

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
really nice and then it had back of the

really nice and then it had back of the
head<00:03:59.130> printing<00:03:59.700> too<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:01.140> yeah<00:04:01.350> he's<00:04:01.860> probably

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
head printing too so yeah he's probably

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.270 
head printing too so yeah he's probably
the<00:04:02.760> main<00:04:03.000> reason<00:04:03.410> one<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.590> he's<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.100> best

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
the main reason one of the he's the best

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.860 
the main reason one of the he's the best
minifigure<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.880> could<00:04:06.060> possibly<00:04:06.480> get<00:04:06.660> an

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
minifigure you could possibly get an

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.040 
minifigure you could possibly get an
assay<00:04:07.220> but<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.730> minifigs<00:04:09.420> aren't<00:04:09.750> even<00:04:09.959> the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
assay but the minifigs aren't even the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.040 
assay but the minifigs aren't even the
best<00:04:10.230> part<00:04:10.320> about<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:11.000> okay<00:04:12.000> now<00:04:12.570> let's<00:04:12.600> move

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
best part about this okay now let's move

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.870 
best part about this okay now let's move
on<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.890> mill<00:04:14.100> itself<00:04:15.049> now<00:04:16.700> first<00:04:17.700> let's

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
on to the mill itself now first let's

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.610 
on to the mill itself now first let's
start<00:04:18.060> off<00:04:18.150> with<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.359> wheel<00:04:18.600> wheel<00:04:19.200> spins

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
start off with the wheel wheel spins

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.930 
start off with the wheel wheel spins
real

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
real

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.500 
real
nice<00:04:20.980> put<00:04:21.980> you<00:04:22.310> could<00:04:22.520> put<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.730> minifig<00:04:23.180> on<00:04:23.360> the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
nice put you could put a minifig on the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.190 
nice put you could put a minifig on the
top<00:04:23.720> here<00:04:24.400> um<00:04:25.400> but<00:04:26.090> if<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:26.480> spin<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.930> you'll

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
top here um but if you spin it you'll

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.640 
top here um but if you spin it you'll
like<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:28.250> know<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.940> won't<00:04:29.090> go<00:04:29.300> around<00:04:29.650> then

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
like you know it won't go around then

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.150

stick a minifig right in here where Jack
was<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:38.450> then<00:04:38.870> if<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.110> put<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.410> wheel<00:04:39.560> back

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
was and then if you put the wheel back

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.690 
was and then if you put the wheel back
down<00:04:40.130> spin<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:41.650> know<00:04:42.650> this<00:04:42.770> Banacek<00:04:43.130> stays
