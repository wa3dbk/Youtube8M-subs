00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.599
 Tell me guys, Bruno, just seven back. 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.730
 All good beauty bringing you today. 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.310
 here is a gameplay trick on the map 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.050
 look like that the shoulders finally 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.609
 managed to play a little bit of the hospital 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.550
 where he had been anxious since the launch 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.619
 I do not remember the game here in the backyard. 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
 zombies was available to anyone who 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.130
 had bought prestige to honor 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.920
 he said chan 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 and there was already available with the dlc and to 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.250
 who did not buy any of these two 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.649
 special editions 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.719
 you could buy the feet feet and this 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.020
 would give you free of charge 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.660
 download the map in the yard is already 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.719
 available on xbox 360 will be 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.480
 released on psn do not know believe in 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.449
 January should not fail is usually a 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.920
 month later to other platforms in this 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.460
 usually microsoft just a little bit 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.890
 on the front then I got off on day 12 if 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.899
 I'm not mistaken, but I had some 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 I had no problem playing 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.159
 if you want to know the reason for the disappearance 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.170
 cases in which I have not yet understood 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.610
 I made a video last video and I'm leaving 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.830
 even the registration for you was in 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.570
 Truly a live stream where I explain 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.220
 that rolled and some problems with 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.890
 internet etc 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.630
 nothing too much not but anyway 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.119
 I played a little in the backyard men 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.729
 Fucking fucking dude, it's like that . 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.170
 survivor fired the best we 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.670
 have in backoffice 2 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.070
 I had already told you that you 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.070
 the team is disappointed a little bit and 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.439
 it remains including what 's the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.030
 eyes and optional like you yes I do not 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.610
 I can say that total profit men 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.020
 saved survival of the black box 2 that still 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.579
 you owe a little, but it's a matter of 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.680
 in love knows something of nostalgia 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.130
 remember the maps from black box 2 until 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.119
 even the code 5 in Mercosur actually and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.070
 even code 5 because they are maps as well 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.280
 delight to play has quite something to 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.810
 you navigate the map itself 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.520
 and here in the blog copies of the maps are 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.290
 Little ones here in the yard by 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.569
 example you do not even have to connect to 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.819
 youth energy all 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.739
 power on actually has a detail 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.260
 here in the yard that is very interesting 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.439
 a very nice edition that is the way 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.290
 how banks appear on the map, do not they? 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:23.689
 They come randomly right of hendon 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.659
 total you have no way to guess which 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.909
 because it comes in which place comes some 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.889
 specific locations where they appear 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.409
 at least I have not yet been able to 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:36.919
 a pattern that indicates the sequence as 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.290
 they fall they fall random rounds 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.969
 I also know that the club always goes down 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.609
 at least playing solo and not yet 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.650
 I played in the cope at least the fifth and will 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.719
 stay in the first round at the beginning yes and 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.169
 has four locations only it can 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:52.909
 appear and the other banks will 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.829
 appearing one usually appears in the 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.439
 third round 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.870
 sometimes it even appears in the fifth and then you 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.939
 always stays between two and three rounds without 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.010
 appear no punk and then back to 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.199
 appear one but sometimes it is a bit more 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.659
 the past has happened to me from falling 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:10.519
 everything that fell flat also is in the 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.260
 Truth is a meteor I'll show you 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.790
 You 'll soon make a video of 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.259
 strategy here in the yard 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.139
 here i am showing a stretch to 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.909
 simulation of 20 then all fell down all 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.129
 the few pec to punch etc 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.400
 but it happened to me like it was 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.109
 talking about falling in round 18 was the maximum 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.509
 the later that happened to fall all 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.949
 Audiences there for me so I go. 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.079
 show already I have a legal strategy 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:35.180
 there on the map 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.979
 I'll bring it, I believe that in the 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.599
 Machinima Brasil and see a video there 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.129
 to sequence the series 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.739
 the video ends this week for post 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.629
 in a china brazil and this week more 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.849
 not sure yet when 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.620
 be available on the 64 th Thursday 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.569
 Anyway, I'm already working on the issue. 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.049
 here is the time that you will enjoy 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.750
 Geez, it 's about the wanted map. 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.489
 talk to you, but that 's it 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.250
 say a little bit around my 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.349
 Impressions map is very cool is and com 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.989
 surety is the best to play in 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.599
 survival mode but not yet 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.789
 I was saved the traffic even more delicious 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.430
 to play in backoffice 2 for now 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:15.349
 let's see from the future 6 there the 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.299
 sisan ps is also worth it for 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.940
 That's what we 're sure is going to 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.620
 Pick up all 6 from here. 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.170
 but then guys are enough to talk 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.450
 backyard by 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.140
 A little bit let's talk about Christmas now 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.660
 almost rhyming I just wanted to enjoy it here 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.360
 the video to send a 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.970
 Merry Christmas to wish you that 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.860
 You can spend as a family, you do not have a 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.800
 It's a fun Christmas with your friends. 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.080

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.960

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.640
 I'll be home in family has not 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.140
 sure my mom will be more than 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.720
 anyway, I'll pass on her house 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.060
 to leave a kiss and I'll meet with 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.880
 My father, my brother, my uncles, cousins, etc. 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.190
 So I think it's going to be tasty like 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.080

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.810

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.400
 r loud talking loudly and eating fucking 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.020
 so at least all the meetings are 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.580
 of my family, so I 'm a cookie 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.620

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.380
 You have a little inclination if 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.180
