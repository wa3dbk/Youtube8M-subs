00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
so hopefully it's good i dunno what the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.039 
so hopefully it's good i dunno what the
final<00:00:11.940> score<00:00:12.120> as<00:00:12.389> though<00:00:12.540> i<00:00:12.570> think<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.870> golf

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
final score as though i think a golf

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.990 
final score as though i think a golf
after<00:00:13.290> 44<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.070> I'm<00:00:14.190> paley<00:00:14.580> sure<00:00:14.730> I'm<00:00:14.849> doing

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
after 44 and I'm paley sure I'm doing

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.790 
after 44 and I'm paley sure I'm doing
here<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> actually<00:00:15.540> scratching<00:00:16.199> my<00:00:16.379> balls<00:00:16.529> or

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
here to actually scratching my balls or

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.920 
here to actually scratching my balls or
something<00:00:17.090> but<00:00:18.090> yeah<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:18.480> my<00:00:18.660> final

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
something but yeah I think my final

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.050 
something but yeah I think my final
score<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.170> there<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> 44<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.820> think<00:00:20.970> it's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
score was there to 44 and I think it's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.250 
score was there to 44 and I think it's
very<00:00:21.119> good<00:00:21.359> game<00:00:21.539> actually<00:00:21.689> show<00:00:21.960> sort<00:00:22.199> of
