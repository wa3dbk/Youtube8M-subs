 x10 speed it is also equipped 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.019
 finally two shimano controllers can be 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.030
 as much pushing forward as towards 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:08.050
 the back then what I found of 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.260
 well on the bike down aesthetic side 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:17.480
 that to the one who is well connected 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.460
 with the bike the colors after the way 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.050
 to try the stone if I see 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.820
 you see a lot okabu it's not 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.980
 written the same on both sides it is written 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.630
 smaller on one side than on the other 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:32.680
 here after that also what I liked is 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.320
 the touch of black paint there 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.390
 who comes a little hungry that last 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.280
 not too much or not enough 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.070
 here is pretty pretty after 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.750
 also what I find quite a lot is the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.780
 little drawings that we have on the stem of 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.030
 Saddle on the stem and on the handlebars 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.950
 but only on part of the guide years ago 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.790
 add a little bit of aesthetics and 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.820
 to avoid black everywhere good at 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.820
