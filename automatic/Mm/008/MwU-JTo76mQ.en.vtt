00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
nice feature here is that there is a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.719 
nice feature here is that there is a
sensor<00:01:13.260> which<00:01:13.380> detects<00:01:13.770> how<00:01:13.950> thick<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.520> and

sensor which detects how thick it is and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.300 
sensor which detects how thick it is and
this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.270> how<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> optical<00:01:16.229> knows<00:01:16.470> how<00:01:16.979> well

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
this is how the optical knows how well

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
this is how the optical knows how well
it's<00:01:17.549> being<00:01:17.820> cooked<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.990> light<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> grill

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
changes color and beeps each time it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.539

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
are great but despite that the most

really impressive

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.420 
really impressive
was<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.259> when<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.439> cut<00:01:40.710> into<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.070> piece<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
was that when I cut into that piece of

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.330

steak it was cooked perfectly and the
only<00:01:44.490> other<00:01:44.610> things<00:01:44.880> I'd<00:01:45.030> say<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
only other things I'd say is the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600 
only other things I'd say is the
optigrill<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.259> quite<00:01:46.649> big<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.310> make<00:01:47.460> sure

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
optigrill is quite big so just make sure

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.910

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you've got the space for it also if

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.139 
you've got the space for it also if
you're<00:01:50.040> cooking<00:01:50.280> things<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.640> fish<00:01:50.939> which

are quite flaky

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.480 
are quite flaky
you'll<00:01:52.380> also<00:01:52.530> need<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.799> put<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.189> bit<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
you'll also need to put a little bit of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.039 
you'll also need to put a little bit of
oil<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> grill<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.479> make<00:01:54.600> sure<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.869> doesn't

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
oil on the grill to make sure it doesn't

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.260 
oil on the grill to make sure it doesn't
stick<00:01:55.380> which<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.070> unfortunately<00:01:56.850> found<00:01:57.030> out
