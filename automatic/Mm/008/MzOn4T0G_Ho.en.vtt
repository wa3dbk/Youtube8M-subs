using<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.600> library<00:00:25.939> so<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.269> video<00:00:27.539> I'll

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
using the library so in this video I'll

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.460 
using the library so in this video I'll
be<00:00:27.810> touching<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.349> EQ<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.189> tempo<00:00:29.789> automation

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
be touching on EQ and tempo automation

be touching on EQ and tempo automation
some<00:00:31.470> people<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.800> asked<00:00:32.070> me<00:00:32.099> if<00:00:32.369> I've<00:00:32.520> used

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
some people have asked me if I've used

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.670 
some people have asked me if I've used
any<00:00:32.940> external<00:00:33.329> processing<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.230> product

demos<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.940> answer<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.480> yes<00:00:36.719> I

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
demos and the answer to that is yes I

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.580 
demos and the answer to that is yes I
have<00:00:37.320> used<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.950> subtle<00:00:38.399> EQ<00:00:38.910> curve<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.590> some

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
have used a subtle EQ curve and some

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
have used a subtle EQ curve and some
reverb<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> I'll<00:00:42.059> discuss<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> reverb<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
reverb and I'll discuss the reverb in a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.160 
reverb and I'll discuss the reverb in a
later<00:00:43.469> video<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.120> I'll<00:00:45.510> start<00:00:46.079> by

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
later video and so for now I'll start by

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.869 
later video and so for now I'll start by
showing<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.800> how<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.010> use<00:00:47.309> two<00:00:47.489> EQ<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:49.879> started

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
showing you how I use two EQ I started

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
showing you how I use two EQ I started
by<00:00:51.000> applying<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.780> instance<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> standard

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
by applying an instance of the standard

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.130 
by applying an instance of the standard

generally<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> find<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.100> using<00:00:59.250> an<00:00:59.489> EQ<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
generally I find that using an EQ in a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.729 
generally I find that using an EQ in a
master<00:01:00.539> channel<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.960> help<00:01:01.170> glue<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> mix

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
master channel can help glue a mix

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.250 
master channel can help glue a mix
together<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.600> this<00:01:03.600> also<00:01:03.899> applies<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
together and this also applies to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.330 
together and this also applies to
strings<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> set<00:01:06.030> band<00:01:06.479> two<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.619> three<00:01:08.070> point

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
strings so I set band two to three point

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.090 
strings so I set band two to three point
nine<00:01:08.400> kilohertz<00:01:09.500> using<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.650> moderate

bandwidth of 0.6 and cut two decibels
this<00:01:15.990> tones<00:01:16.290> down<00:01:16.560> some<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> strong<00:01:17.400> upper

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
this tones down some of the strong upper

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.820 
this tones down some of the strong upper
mid<00:01:18.060> frequencies<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.960> provides<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.560> soft

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
mid frequencies and provides a soft

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.660

character<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> sound<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.770> also<00:01:22.770> set<00:01:23.040> band<00:01:23.310> 3

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
character to the sound I also set band 3

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.760 
character to the sound I also set band 3
to<00:01:23.820> 16<00:01:24.119> kilohertz<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> wider<00:01:25.290> bandwidth

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.280 
to 16 kilohertz with a wider bandwidth
of<00:01:25.920> 2<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:27.000> applied<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.600> decibel<00:01:27.930> boost

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
of 2 and it applied a one decibel boost

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.830 
of 2 and it applied a one decibel boost
I<00:01:28.619> found<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.579> adds<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.000> sort<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.270> lovely

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
I found that this adds a sort of lovely

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.280 
I found that this adds a sort of lovely
Airy<00:01:31.380> quality<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> mix<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.110> I've<00:01:34.110> put

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
Airy quality to the mix and I've put

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.780 
Airy quality to the mix and I've put
together<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.619> little<00:01:34.770> piece<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.250> demonstrate

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
together a little piece to demonstrate

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.760 
together a little piece to demonstrate
the<00:01:35.970> effect<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.509> EQ<00:01:37.020> curve<00:01:37.229> has<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the effect this EQ curve has on the

the<00:02:20.230> other<00:02:20.350> thing<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.620> want<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.830> talk<00:02:20.980> about<00:02:21.100> is

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
the other thing I want to talk about is

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.020 
the other thing I want to talk about is
tempo<00:02:21.820> mapping<00:02:22.150> or<00:02:22.360> tempo<00:02:22.810> automation<00:02:23.850> in<00:02:24.850> a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
real recording environment musicians

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.700 
real recording environment musicians
tend<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.340> drift<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.000> out<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.480> tempo<00:02:28.870> and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
tend to drift in and out of tempo and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.530 
tend to drift in and out of tempo and
they<00:02:29.800> might<00:02:29.950> speed<00:02:30.220> up<00:02:30.250> for<00:02:30.430> one<00:02:30.730> bar<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.270> then

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
they might speed up for one bar and then

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.660 
they might speed up for one bar and then
relax<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.020> tempo<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.560> next<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.490> can

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
relax the tempo the next and this can

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.520 
relax the tempo the next and this can
happen<00:02:33.940> because<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.690> emotional<00:02:35.170> content

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
happen because of the emotional content

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.250 
happen because of the emotional content
of<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.740> piece<00:02:36.180> players<00:02:37.180> might<00:02:37.510> speed<00:02:37.900> up<00:02:37.930> in<00:02:38.170> a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
of a piece players might speed up in a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.710 
of a piece players might speed up in a
more<00:02:38.410> intense<00:02:38.740> moment<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:40.210> of<00:02:40.330> course<00:02:40.390> the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
more intense moment and of course the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.360 
more intense moment and of course the
conductor<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.410> significantly<00:02:41.980> shape<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
conductor can significantly shape the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.660 
conductor can significantly shape the
tempo<00:02:42.700> too<00:02:43.800> even<00:02:44.800> in<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> relatively<00:02:45.310> locked

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
tempo too even in a relatively locked

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.050 
tempo too even in a relatively locked
tempo<00:02:46.180> environment<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.230> find<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.310> adding

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
tempo environment so I find that adding

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.610 
tempo environment so I find that adding
little<00:02:49.210> changes<00:02:49.690> in<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.930> try<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.140> mimic<00:02:50.380> this

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
little changes in to try and mimic this

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.140 
little changes in to try and mimic this
behavior<00:02:51.100> can<00:02:51.250> greatly<00:02:51.550> increase<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
behavior can greatly increase the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.300 
behavior can greatly increase the
realism<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.780> add<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.440> significant<00:02:54.040> human

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
realism and add a significant human

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.180 
realism and add a significant human
element<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.670> your<00:02:54.850> piece<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:56.830> show<00:02:57.130> you

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
element to your piece and so to show you

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.190 
element to your piece and so to show you
what<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.340> mean<00:02:57.550> I'll<00:02:57.880> play<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.480> same<00:02:58.690> piece<00:02:59.050> I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
what I mean I'll play the same piece I

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.320 
what I mean I'll play the same piece I
just<00:02:59.230> played<00:02:59.440> well<00:03:00.340> this<00:03:00.490> time<00:03:00.700> focusing<00:03:00.940> on

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
just played well this time focusing on

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.990 
just played well this time focusing on
the<00:03:01.450> tempo<00:03:01.780> map<00:03:01.990> and<00:03:02.310> as<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.400> can<00:03:03.550> see<00:03:03.760> I've

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
the tempo map and as you can see I've

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.710 
the tempo map and as you can see I've
added<00:03:04.300> subtle<00:03:05.110> changes<00:03:05.590> from<00:03:05.890> bar<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.190> bar

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
added subtle changes from bar to bar

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.030 
added subtle changes from bar to bar
occasionally<00:03:07.720> slowing<00:03:08.020> down<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.530> exaggerate

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
occasionally slowing down to exaggerate

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.100 
occasionally slowing down to exaggerate
the<00:03:09.130> end<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.400> phrase<00:03:09.520> or<00:03:10.000> speeding<00:03:10.630> up<00:03:10.870> to

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
the end of a phrase or speeding up to

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:58.990 
the end of a phrase or speeding up to
add<00:03:11.260> some<00:03:11.410> intensity<00:03:11.800> to<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.130> performance

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.490 

I've<00:04:00.000> also<00:04:00.270> included<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.870> MIDI<00:04:01.050> file<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.410> this

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
I've also included a MIDI file of this

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.750 
I've also included a MIDI file of this
piece<00:04:01.740> so<00:04:01.770> you<00:04:02.040> can<00:04:02.220> load<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.490> into<00:04:02.670> your

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
piece so you can load it into your

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.460 
piece so you can load it into your
sequencer<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.510> check<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.930> out<00:04:04.020> for<00:04:04.140> yourself

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
sequencer and check it out for yourself

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.860 
sequencer and check it out for yourself
I've<00:04:05.280> named<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.760> tracks<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.180> correspond<00:04:06.720> with

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
I've named the tracks to correspond with

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.210 
I've named the tracks to correspond with
the<00:04:06.960> patches<00:04:07.320> are<00:04:07.470> used<00:04:07.710> in<00:04:07.890> cinematic

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
the patches are used in cinematic

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.120 
the patches are used in cinematic
strings<00:04:08.670> so<00:04:09.510> just<00:04:09.660> load<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.930> patches<00:04:10.350> assign

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
strings so just load the patches assign

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.800 
strings so just load the patches assign
them<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.460> correct<00:04:11.670> channels<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.660> can

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
them to the correct channels and you can

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.710 
them to the correct channels and you can
watch<00:04:12.960> the<00:04:13.110> library<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.590> action<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:15.450> can<00:04:15.570> also

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
watch the library in action you can also

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.840 
watch the library in action you can also
take<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.990> look<00:04:16.170> at<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.380> MIDI<00:04:16.560> CC<00:04:16.890> data<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.640> see

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
take a look at the MIDI CC data and see

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.900 
take a look at the MIDI CC data and see
how<00:04:18.000> perform<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.510> individual<00:04:18.959> parts<00:04:19.910> so

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
how perform the individual parts so

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.640 
how perform the individual parts so
