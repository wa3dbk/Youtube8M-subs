00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.240 

now<00:00:00.510> I'm<00:00:00.690> ready<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.989> run<00:00:01.230> my<00:00:01.410> cross<00:00:01.650> strings<00:00:02.010> in

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
now I'm ready to run my cross strings in

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.679 
now I'm ready to run my cross strings in
and<00:00:02.429> there's<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.669> couple<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:02.970> different<00:00:03.330> ways<00:00:03.449> I

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
and there's a couple of different ways I

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.190 
and there's a couple of different ways I
can<00:00:03.750> do<00:00:04.020> that<00:00:04.259> I<00:00:04.500> can<00:00:05.220> use<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.549> long<00:00:06.359> tail<00:00:06.720> here

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
can do that I can use a long tail here

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.280 
can do that I can use a long tail here
that'll<00:00:07.529> reach<00:00:07.710> my<00:00:08.570> tensioner<00:00:09.570> out<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.170> my

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
that'll reach my tensioner out to my

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.830 
that'll reach my tensioner out to my
tensioner<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:10.950> use<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> starting<00:00:12.300> clamp<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
tensioner and use a starting clamp to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.499 
tensioner and use a starting clamp to
clamp<00:00:12.960> down<00:00:13.170> on<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.740> string<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.429> hold<00:00:15.179> it

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
clamp down on the string and hold it

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.099 
clamp down on the string and hold it
right<00:00:15.719> there

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
right there

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.590 
right there
but<00:00:16.800> then<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.190> I'd<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.490> doing<00:00:17.520> when<00:00:18.270> our<00:00:18.390> full

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
but then what I'd be doing when our full

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.510 
but then what I'd be doing when our full
tension<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.350> string<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.949> I'm<00:00:20.160> pulling

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
tension on the string is I'm pulling

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.630 
tension on the string is I'm pulling
tension<00:00:21.029> against<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.170> single<00:00:22.590> plant<00:00:22.890> with

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
tension against a single plant with

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.130 
tension against a single plant with
nothing<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.449> side<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.230> clamp<00:00:25.769> so

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
nothing on this side of the clamp so

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.810 
nothing on this side of the clamp so
although<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.170> doubt<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.949> would<00:00:29.160> happen<00:00:29.369> there's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
although I doubt it would happen there's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.659 
although I doubt it would happen there's
a<00:00:29.880> chance<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.929> string<00:00:31.320> could<00:00:31.560> slip<00:00:32.040> through

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
a chance the string could slip through

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.090 
a chance the string could slip through
this<00:00:32.880> starting<00:00:33.300> clamp<00:00:33.600> if<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.530> slips<00:00:34.829> through

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
this starting clamp if it slips through

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.069 
this starting clamp if it slips through
that<00:00:35.309> starting<00:00:35.790> clamp<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.300> I'll<00:00:36.420> damage<00:00:36.870> my

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
that starting clamp then I'll damage my

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.610 
that starting clamp then I'll damage my
string<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:37.790> using<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:39.390> multi<00:00:39.960> filament<00:00:40.379> string

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
string I'm using a multi filament string

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
string I'm using a multi filament string
here<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.399> already<00:00:41.730> see<00:00:42.120> where<00:00:42.420> I've

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
here and I can already see where I've

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.160 
here and I can already see where I've
left<00:00:42.780> ghosting<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.780> multi<00:00:45.780> filament

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
left ghosting on that multi filament

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.060 
left ghosting on that multi filament
string<00:00:46.379> right<00:00:46.590> there

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
string right there

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.900 
string right there
so<00:00:47.399> that's<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.920> good<00:00:49.920> no<00:00:50.219> matter<00:00:50.370> which<00:00:50.670> way

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
so that's not good no matter which way

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.760 
so that's not good no matter which way
you<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.570> what<00:00:51.750> I'm<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.530> I'm

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
you do it so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.529 
you do it so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> pull<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.610> string<00:00:53.969> out<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> little

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
going to pull this string out a little

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.610 
going to pull this string out a little
bit<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:55.980> rid<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.430> ghosting<00:00:57.059> problem

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
bit to get rid of that ghosting problem

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.349 
bit to get rid of that ghosting problem
and<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.520> my<00:00:59.640> tile<00:00:59.910> hole

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
and I'm going to go into my tile hole

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.250 
and I'm going to go into my tile hole
and<00:01:00.719> I'm<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.199> use<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:01.739> call<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
and I'm going to use what they call a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
and I'm going to use what they call a
starting<00:01:04.260> knot<00:01:04.470> except<00:01:05.280> I'm<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
starting knot except I'm not going to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.890 
starting knot except I'm not going to
use<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.540> normal<00:01:06.890> starting<00:01:07.890> knot<00:01:08.689> okay<00:01:09.689> your

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
use the normal starting knot okay your

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.580 
use the normal starting knot okay your
normal<00:01:10.380> starting<00:01:10.860> knot<00:01:11.369> now<00:01:11.990> has<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.320> loops

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
normal starting knot now has two loops

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.160 
normal starting knot now has two loops
in<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.400> tail<00:01:14.670> goes<00:01:15.210> down<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.960> anchor

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
in it and the tail goes down the anchor

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.760 
in it and the tail goes down the anchor
string<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.310> sticks<00:01:18.200> down<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.500> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
string so that it sticks down this and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.390 
string so that it sticks down this and
doesn't<00:01:20.009> go<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.939> against<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> frame<00:01:22.189> like<00:01:23.189> all

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
doesn't go up against the frame like all

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.730 
doesn't go up against the frame like all
my<00:01:23.610> other<00:01:23.640> knots<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:25.439> I'm<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
my other knots do so what I'm going to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980 
my other knots do so what I'm going to
do<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.040> start<00:01:26.280> out<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.240> tying<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
do is start out just like I'm tying a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.940 
do is start out just like I'm tying a
Parnell<00:01:28.590> knot<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.960> pro<00:01:30.960> knot<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.500> I'll<00:01:31.680> just

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
Parnell knot or a pro knot and I'll just

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.840 
Parnell knot or a pro knot and I'll just
do<00:01:32.220> over<00:01:33.020> under<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.049> through<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.740> loop<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
do over under and through the loop and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.190 
do over under and through the loop and
then<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> same<00:01:36.869> thing

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
then I'm going to do the same thing

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.219 
then I'm going to do the same thing
again<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> go<00:01:38.340> over<00:01:39.079> under<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
again I'm going to go over under and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.770 
again I'm going to go over under and
through<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:41.100> loop<00:01:41.280> making<00:01:41.939> sure<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.540> come

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
through the loop making sure that I come

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.700 
through the loop making sure that I come
back<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:44.119> closest<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.450> Ramat<00:01:45.960> hole<00:01:46.140> then

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
back up closest to this Ramat hole then

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.460 
back up closest to this Ramat hole then
I've<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.070> two<00:01:47.369> loops<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.380> I'm

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
I've got two loops here and what I'm

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.990 
I've got two loops here and what I'm
going<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.280> I'm<00:01:50.520> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> take<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
going to do is I'm going to take the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.920 
going to do is I'm going to take the
tail<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:51.720> back<00:01:52.020> through<00:01:52.049> those<00:01:52.680> two<00:01:52.979> loops

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
tail and go back through those two loops

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.560 
tail and go back through those two loops
okay<00:01:54.930> then<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.189> pull<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.549> down<00:01:59.000> okay<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.210> I

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
okay then I can pull it down okay and I

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.709 
okay then I can pull it down okay and I
can<00:02:00.659> actually<00:02:01.560> get<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.090> root<00:02:03.090> very<00:02:03.479> very

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
can actually get this root very very

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.440 
can actually get this root very very
small<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.619> where<00:02:04.770> I've<00:02:04.920> got<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.579> very<00:02:06.060> short

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
small to where I've got to very short

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.719 
small to where I've got to very short
tail<00:02:06.750> right<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.140> let<00:02:08.039> me<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.340> give<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.520> an

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
tail right here let me just give you an

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.920 
tail right here let me just give you an
idea<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.530> can<00:02:10.530> make<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.890> about

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
idea I can make it about

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.199 
idea I can make it about
that<00:02:12.930> one<00:02:13.260> because<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.160> not<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.000> pull

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
that one because it's not going to pull

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.580 
that one because it's not going to pull
through<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:17.750> don't<00:02:18.750> know<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.319> last

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
through I don't know that that last

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.070 
through I don't know that that last
picture<00:02:19.860> showed<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.599> don't<00:02:21.599> know<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.900> that

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
picture showed I don't know that that

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.960 
picture showed I don't know that that
last<00:02:22.319> picture<00:02:22.620> showed<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.190> how<00:02:23.310> short<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.790> cut

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
last picture showed you how short I cut

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.000 
last picture showed you how short I cut
that<00:02:24.150> tail<00:02:24.480> off<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.050> there's<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.470> tail<00:02:25.709> so

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
that tail off that there's the tail so

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.790 
that tail off that there's the tail so
maybe<00:02:26.310> about<00:02:26.670> an<00:02:26.970> inch<00:02:27.090> long<00:02:27.239> or<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.410> what

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
maybe about an inch long or so and what

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.840 
maybe about an inch long or so and what
I'm<00:02:28.890> going<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.069> do<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.340> I'm<00:02:29.459> going<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.640> pull

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
I'm going to do is I'm going to pull

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.330 
I'm going to do is I'm going to pull
tension<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.540> top<00:02:30.780> cross<00:02:31.050> now<00:02:31.380> but<00:02:32.190> you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
tension on this top cross now but you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.280 
tension on this top cross now but you
can<00:02:32.489> see<00:02:32.730> here<00:02:33.030> there's<00:02:33.239> my<00:02:33.480> two<00:02:33.540> loops<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.230> I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
can see here there's my two loops that I

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.610 
can see here there's my two loops that I
made<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:35.520> inside<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.000> other<00:02:36.209> one<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.810> went

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
made one inside the other one I went

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.809 
made one inside the other one I went
down<00:02:38.160> under<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.239> anchor<00:02:39.600> string<00:02:39.959> back<00:02:40.350> up

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
down under the anchor string back up

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.479 
down under the anchor string back up
down<00:02:41.819> back<00:02:42.239> up<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.690> then<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.709> took<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.100> tail

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
down back up and then I took the tail

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.350 
down back up and then I took the tail
that<00:02:44.790> came<00:02:45.030> closest<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:47.150> grommet<00:02:48.150> hole

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
that came closest to the grommet hole

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.449 
that came closest to the grommet hole
and<00:02:48.660> went<00:02:48.810> back<00:02:49.050> through<00:02:49.410> those<00:02:49.620> two<00:02:49.890> loops<00:02:49.920> so

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
and went back through those two loops so

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.809 
and went back through those two loops so
that<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.970> tail<00:02:51.390> goes<00:02:51.840> up<00:02:51.870> against<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.560> frame

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
that the tail goes up against the frame

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.259 
that the tail goes up against the frame
then<00:02:53.819> when<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.120> pull<00:02:54.390> tension<00:02:54.690> on<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:57.030> knot

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
then when I pull tension on it that knot

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.640 
then when I pull tension on it that knot
doesn't<00:02:57.569> move<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.110> off<00:02:59.840> okay<00:03:00.840> plus<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.380> fact

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
doesn't move it off okay plus the fact

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.979 
doesn't move it off okay plus the fact
that<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:02.130> tail<00:03:02.519> lays<00:03:02.940> right<00:03:03.269> up<00:03:03.450> against<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
that the tail lays right up against the

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.959 
that the tail lays right up against the
frame<00:03:04.730> just<00:03:05.730> like<00:03:05.880> all<00:03:06.090> my<00:03:06.120> other<00:03:06.269> not<00:03:06.660> stay
