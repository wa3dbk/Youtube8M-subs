use<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.440> we<00:02:12.920> put<00:02:13.100> a<00:02:13.130> line<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.550> tape<00:02:13.730> on<00:02:14.030> as<00:02:14.270> you

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
use so we put a line of tape on as you

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.900 
use so we put a line of tape on as you
can<00:02:14.510> see

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
can see

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.960 
can see
remove<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.060> back<00:02:17.210> in<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.050> then<00:02:18.380> it's<00:02:19.280> folded

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
remove the back in and then it's folded

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.610 
remove the back in and then it's folded
across<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.130> inside<00:02:22.520> line<00:02:24.850> just<00:02:25.850> like<00:02:26.060> that

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
across to the inside line just like that

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.170 
across to the inside line just like that
and<00:02:27.620> then<00:02:27.800> we'll<00:02:27.950> do<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.250> all<00:02:28.430> four<00:02:28.490> all

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
and then we'll do that on all four all

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.990 
and then we'll do that on all four all
four<00:02:29.480> sides<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.080> then<00:02:30.670> then<00:02:31.670> we<00:02:31.760> put<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
four sides and then then we put the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.970 
four sides and then then we put the
eyelets<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.390> okay<00:02:32.750> now<00:02:32.900> we've<00:02:33.110> folded<00:02:33.590> all<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
eyelets in okay now we've folded all the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.070 
eyelets in okay now we've folded all the
edges<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.459> let's<00:02:35.270> just<00:02:35.420> have<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.570> look<00:02:35.750> at<00:02:35.900> what

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
edges and let's just have a look at what

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.560 
edges and let's just have a look at what
a<00:02:36.260> poor<00:02:36.590> pocket<00:02:36.950> actually<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.550> as<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.420> can<00:02:38.450> see

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
a poor pocket actually is as you can see

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.020 
a poor pocket actually is as you can see
it's<00:02:39.020> a<00:02:39.140> wider<00:02:39.470> hem<00:02:39.800> than<00:02:40.040> normal<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.730> it

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
it's a wider hem than normal and it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.060 
it's a wider hem than normal and it
actually<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.750> left<00:02:41.959> open<00:02:42.320> at<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.500> ends<00:02:42.800> so<00:02:42.830> you

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
actually is left open at the ends so you

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.190 
actually is left open at the ends so you
can<00:02:43.370> use<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.970> put<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.390> pole<00:02:44.660> through<00:02:44.900> and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
can use that to put a pole through and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.949 
can use that to put a pole through and
that's<00:02:45.920> one<00:02:46.130> way<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.490> fixing<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.150> normally

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
that's one way of fixing it normally

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.830 
that's one way of fixing it normally
banners<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.530> have<00:02:48.770> a<00:02:49.160> standard<00:02:49.910> hem<00:02:50.150> much

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
banners just have a standard hem much

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.560 
banners just have a standard hem much
like<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.350> one<00:02:51.590> all<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.400> way<00:02:52.519> around<00:02:52.820> but<00:02:53.510> in

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
like this one all the way around but in

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.910 
like this one all the way around but in
this<00:02:53.690> case<00:02:53.900> these<00:02:54.019> poor<00:02:54.260> pockets<00:02:54.500> but<00:02:54.830> we

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
this case these poor pockets but we

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.130 
this case these poor pockets but we
still<00:02:55.160> do<00:02:55.340> put<00:02:55.610> some<00:02:55.790> eyelets<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.269> which<00:02:56.600> Chris

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
still do put some eyelets in which Chris

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.140 
still do put some eyelets in which Chris
is<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.530> show<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:57.769> now<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.850> eyelet

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
is going to show you now the eyelet

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.060 
is going to show you now the eyelet
would<00:02:59.300> actually<00:02:59.630> go<00:02:59.750> through<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.590> end<00:03:00.769> of<00:03:00.920> the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
would actually go through the end of the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.130 
would actually go through the end of the
hem<00:03:01.250> where<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.580> four<00:03:01.790> pocket<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.630> this

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
hem where the four pocket is and this

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.620 
hem where the four pocket is and this
just<00:03:03.350> helps<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.739> strengthen<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.400> as<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.510> can

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
just helps to strengthen it as you can

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.030 
just helps to strengthen it as you can
see<00:03:05.780> we<00:03:05.870> have<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:06.019> pneumatic<00:03:06.530> eyelet<00:03:06.950> in

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
see we have a pneumatic eyelet in

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.280 
see we have a pneumatic eyelet in
machine<00:03:08.290> which<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.440> line<00:03:09.680> up<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:10.100> slit<00:03:11.290> and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
machine which we line up the slit and

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.370 
machine which we line up the slit and
then<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.560> puts<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.820> eyelet<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:15.140> on

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
then it puts it in so the eyelet is on

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.100 
then it puts it in so the eyelet is on
the<00:03:15.560> hem<00:03:15.769> itself<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:17.209> obviously<00:03:17.690> keeps

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
the hem itself and that obviously keeps

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.680 
the hem itself and that obviously keeps
it<00:03:18.260> nice<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.410> strong<00:03:18.860> stops<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.610> hem<00:03:20.450> from

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
it nice and strong stops the hem from

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:31.570 
it nice and strong stops the hem from
pulling<00:03:21.050> up<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.380> if<00:03:21.500> any<00:03:21.769> tension<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.370> applied

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.890 

that's<00:03:32.360> two<00:03:32.680> just<00:03:33.680> another<00:03:33.920> two<00:03:34.450> as<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.510> say<00:03:35.840> if

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
that's two just another two as I say if

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.630 
that's two just another two as I say if
this<00:03:36.110> was<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.320> standard<00:03:36.890> banner<00:03:37.250> then<00:03:37.490> we'd

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
this was a standard banner then we'd

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.340 
this was a standard banner then we'd
just<00:03:37.790> be<00:03:37.940> putting<00:03:38.150> eyelets<00:03:38.660> all<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.260> way

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
just be putting eyelets all the way

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.950 
just be putting eyelets all the way
around<00:03:39.680> but<00:03:40.610> in<00:03:40.730> this<00:03:40.850> case<00:03:41.090> just<00:03:43.660> on<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.750> hems

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
around but in this case just on the hems

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:58.120 
around but in this case just on the hems
and<00:03:45.490> the<00:03:46.490> last<00:03:46.670> one<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:57.530> there<00:03:57.680> we<00:03:57.770> go<00:03:57.920> all

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
and the last one and there we go all

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.080 
and the last one and there we go all
finished<00:03:58.490> ready<00:03:59.390> for<00:03:59.570> packaging<00:04:00.490> so<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.970> way

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
finished ready for packaging so the way

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.610 
finished ready for packaging so the way
that<00:04:02.270> we<00:04:02.360> package<00:04:02.720> them<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:02.990> send<00:04:03.230> out<00:04:03.410> in<00:04:03.530> the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
that we package them to send out in the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.240 
that we package them to send out in the
in<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.010> post<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.180> cardboard<00:04:05.480> tube<00:04:06.100> which<00:04:07.100> we

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
in the post of a cardboard tube which we

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.120 
in the post of a cardboard tube which we
roll<00:04:07.460> it<00:04:07.610> around<00:04:07.700> like<00:04:08.420> that<00:04:08.710> that<00:04:09.710> keeps<00:04:09.950> it

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
roll it around like that that keeps it

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.349 
roll it around like that that keeps it
safe<00:04:14.260> as<00:04:15.260> you<00:04:15.680> can<00:04:15.800> see<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.220> tube<00:04:16.459> ends<00:04:16.850> stick

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
safe as you can see the tube ends stick

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.670 
safe as you can see the tube ends stick
out<00:04:17.540> further<00:04:17.840> than<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.380> banner

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
out further than the banner

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.789 
out further than the banner
so<00:04:19.220> if<00:04:19.580> parcel<00:04:20.090> force<00:04:20.299> drop<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.200> tube<00:04:21.440> on<00:04:21.620> one

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
so if parcel force drop the tube on one

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:29.700 
so if parcel force drop the tube on one
end<00:04:21.980> that<00:04:22.550> means<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.150> won't<00:04:23.300> get<00:04:23.480> damaged

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:05:29.719 

now<00:04:30.710> some<00:04:30.950> bubble<00:04:31.220> wrap

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.339 

and<00:05:30.729> there<00:05:30.880> we<00:05:30.970> go<00:05:31.120> that's<00:05:31.599> pretty<00:05:31.810> much<00:05:32.080> it

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
and there we go that's pretty much it

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.830 
and there we go that's pretty much it
one<00:05:32.770> banner<00:05:33.009> done<00:05:33.280> just<00:05:34.180> now<00:05:34.330> needs<00:05:34.630> the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
one banner done just now needs the

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.770
