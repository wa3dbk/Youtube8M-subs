00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello there are ideas for you again 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.290
 the editorial 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.859
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.859
 look at 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:19.680
 I show you today is a pattern that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.020
 I call Thomas pattern Thomas pattern 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.449
 because of me a lady from the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.660
 facebook the tip to this pattern 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.540
 has given me that before too 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.200
 did not know one beats straight 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.200
 number of air masses 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:49.460
 until 10 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:53.780
 Help 12 13 14 15 16 the first row 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.780
 one works in basic stitch 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.310
 I always do that one 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.630
 pretty edge to get 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.570
 especially if you like this pattern 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.350
 want to use an example for a cap 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.909
 it has a stable knew 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.909
 given cutout 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.950
 Crochet back as usual 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:46.360
 and now so thomas starts pattern you 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.360
 works an additional air mesh 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.090
 go through the first brand for the edge 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.460
 and also an additional air mass 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.960
 work and now a sting and the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.630
 pulling up thread 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.229
 the following stitch also 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.500
 sting and pull up the thread 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.980
 both make hang out and a 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.690
 envelope from below leading up to 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.600
 put the needle back in the following 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.650
 pierce both meshes fervently and 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 pull up the thread 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.910
 both together most from crochet and 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.910
 put an envelope on the needle 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:40.580
 at 2 again in the property 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:43.480
 sting abt disgust and an envelope 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.480
 insert the needle 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:11.139
 and mine ends with two stitches in the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:17.709
 Strictly just an additional one 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:21.909
 air mass for the height and then with 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.329
 an additional air mass back 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.329
 crochet 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.890
 again with an additional one 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:45.260
 start air mass 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:50.510
 a stitch in the works plus 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.909
 also one air mass now two again 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.790
 mesh in the plot on the needle 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:04:02.079
 Let's summarize this envelope 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.079
 Unwind and an envelope 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.740
 the pattern is not heavy and so 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:38.050
 these two rows are repeated 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:43.660
 constantly and tight again with one 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:46.360
 knit stitch and your stitch just 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.970
 likewise in the strictly engraved only the 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.970
 Add additional air before turning 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:14.870
 you can already see that there is a net 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:16.700
 like pattern I'm still working one 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.070
 row again with an air mass 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.050
 begin 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:26.240
 a stitch in the strict start going on the 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:31.760
 air mass again from the following 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:35.920
 two stitches unwind a loop 18 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.920
 and the envelope lying on the needle 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.970
 So here's this envelope that lays down 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.970
 Almost on the needle 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:53.810
 So that's a pattern that's easy of 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.810
 the hand goes 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:14.300
 and again we end with these two 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:19.730
 stitches in the strictly stitch on the edge 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.730
 desire to turn the extra air mass 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.470
 that's how the dollar needed me 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.470
 I wish you a lot of fun with it
