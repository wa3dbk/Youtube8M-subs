when<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.469> repeat<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.039> you're<00:00:47.399> trying<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
when you repeat that you're trying to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
get a lower score so you're going to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880 
get a lower score so you're going to
decrease<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.210> score<00:00:51.600> by<00:00:51.780> either<00:00:51.960> decreasing

the number of strokes or decreasing the
time<00:00:55.980> or<00:00:56.370> both<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.719> you're<00:00:57.840> doing<00:00:58.020> here

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
time or both and what you're doing here

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.869 
time or both and what you're doing here
is<00:00:58.440> you're<00:00:58.469> trying<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.890> find<00:00:58.949> where<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.760> are

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
is you're trying to find where you are

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.170 
is you're trying to find where you are
most<00:01:00.059> efficient<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:01.079> you're<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.680> most

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
most efficient what you're your most

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.060 
most efficient what you're your most
efficient<00:01:03.180> stroke<00:01:03.390> count<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:04.049> stroke<00:01:04.799> rate

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
efficient stroke count is stroke rate

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.960 
efficient stroke count is stroke rate
and<00:01:05.960> stroke<00:01:06.960> length<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.850> you're

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and stroke length and so when you're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.370 
and stroke length and so when you're
doing<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> swimming<00:01:09.630> golf<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> be

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
doing the swimming golf you want to be

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.800 
doing the swimming golf you want to be

little tiny things that you experiment

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.969 
little tiny things that you experiment
with<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.920> find<00:01:23.580> where<00:01:24.590> you're<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.770> most

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
with I find where you're the most

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.780 
efficient all right Xbox out stream line
stream<00:01:31.380> line<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.979> basically<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
stream line is basically just the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.420 
stream line is basically just the
position<00:01:33.170> then<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.530> usually<00:01:34.890> push<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
position then you usually push up the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.030 
position then you usually push up the
ball<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.470> nice<00:01:37.680> straight

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
ball in and it's just a nice straight

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.770 
ball in and it's just a nice straight
line

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.690

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
by your ears straight line for your

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.450 
by your ears straight line for your
hands<00:01:47.690> when<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.530> push<00:01:48.710> off<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.040> wall<00:01:49.070> you're

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
hands when you push off the wall you're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
hands when you push off the wall you're
going<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.670> be<00:01:49.730> in<00:01:49.820> that<00:01:49.910> streamline<00:01:50.330> position

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
going to be in that streamline position

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.510 
going to be in that streamline position
underwater<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.650> then<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.040> want<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.280> try<00:01:52.460> to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
underwater and then you want to try to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.310 
underwater and then you want to try to
maintain<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:53.300> same<00:01:53.570> line<00:01:53.780> position<00:01:54.200> with

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
maintain that same line position with

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.950 
maintain that same line position with
your<00:01:54.410> body<00:01:54.650> even<00:01:55.220> as<00:01:55.610> your<00:01:55.790> arms<00:01:56.210> are<00:01:56.480> moving

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
your body even as your arms are moving

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.320 
your body even as your arms are moving
through<00:01:57.170> your<00:01:57.260> sweat<00:01:57.410> stroke<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.940> we're<00:01:59.240> going

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
through your sweat stroke so we're going

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:43.860 
through your sweat stroke so we're going
to<00:01:59.390> practice<00:02:00.200> just

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.820 

the<00:02:44.870> next<00:02:46.150> drill<00:02:47.650> basically<00:02:48.650> you're<00:02:48.800> just

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
the next drill basically you're just

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.500 
the next drill basically you're just
swimming<00:02:49.130> with<00:02:49.400> your<00:02:49.550> hands<00:02:49.730> closed<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.450> a

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
swimming with your hands closed in a

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.980 
swimming with your hands closed in a
fist

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
fist

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.280 
fist
you<00:02:51.709> can<00:02:51.980> hold<00:02:52.940> tennis<00:02:53.300> balls<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.870> do<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.050> hard

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
you can hold tennis balls to do a hard

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.530 
you can hold tennis balls to do a hard
time<00:02:54.470> making<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.800> fist<00:02:55.300> something<00:02:56.300> just<00:02:56.450> so

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
time making a fist something just so

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.610 
time making a fist something just so
that<00:02:56.660> your<00:02:56.780> hands<00:02:56.959> are<00:02:57.080> closed<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:57.530> you're

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
that your hands are closed and you're

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.590 
that your hands are closed and you're
taking<00:02:57.890> your<00:02:57.920> hands<00:02:58.370> out<00:02:58.520> of<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:59.060> swim<00:02:59.270> stroke

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
taking your hands out of the swim stroke

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.500 
taking your hands out of the swim stroke
and<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.200> idea<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:01.130> learn<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.610> use<00:03:01.640> your

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
and the idea is to learn to use your

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.530 
and the idea is to learn to use your
forearm<00:03:02.959> here<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:04.040> grab<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.489> water<00:03:04.700> with

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
forearm here to grab the water with

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.140 
forearm here to grab the water with
rather<00:03:05.900> than<00:03:06.170> your<00:03:06.530> hands<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:07.850> it's<00:03:07.970> teaching

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
rather than your hands so it's teaching

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.309 
rather than your hands so it's teaching
you<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.600> pull<00:03:08.930> with<00:03:08.959> your<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.140> just<00:03:12.260> a

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
you to pull with your this and just a

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:41.990 
you to pull with your this and just a
normal<00:03:12.650> sense

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.770 

you<00:03:43.000> do<00:03:43.150> 25<00:03:43.750> with<00:03:44.710> your<00:03:44.860> first<00:03:45.070> close<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:46.420> then

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
you do 25 with your first close and then

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.280 
you do 25 with your first close and then
you<00:03:46.810> swim<00:03:47.140> back<00:03:47.410> with<00:03:48.400> your<00:03:48.580> hands<00:03:48.910> open<00:03:49.290> you

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
will feel a significant difference in

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.950 
will feel a significant difference in
the<00:03:54.400> grab<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.270> get<00:03:55.420> in<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.600> water<00:03:55.750> how

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960

to<00:06:58.020> lift<00:06:58.170> your<00:06:58.380> head<00:06:58.530> and<00:06:58.680> look<00:06:58.740> forward<00:06:59.130> as

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
to lift your head and look forward as

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.890 
to lift your head and look forward as
you<00:06:59.640> extend<00:06:59.910> your<00:07:00.060> arm<00:07:00.240> out<00:07:00.360> in<00:07:00.420> front<00:07:00.540> of<00:07:00.780> you

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
you extend your arm out in front of you

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.570 
you extend your arm out in front of you
and<00:07:01.230> just<00:07:01.290> look<00:07:01.680> towards<00:07:01.890> the<00:07:02.070> other<00:07:02.190> end<00:07:02.490> of

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
and just look towards the other end of

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.960 
and just look towards the other end of
the<00:07:02.700> pool<00:07:02.940> you<00:07:03.330> want<00:07:04.230> to<00:07:04.350> try<00:07:04.560> to<00:07:04.670> lift<00:07:05.670> their

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
the pool you want to try to lift their

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.050 
the pool you want to try to lift their
head<00:07:06.270> elbows<00:07:07.140> come<00:07:07.530> up<00:07:07.710> but<00:07:08.490> not<00:07:08.640> your<00:07:08.850> whole

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
head elbows come up but not your whole

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:45.189 
head elbows come up but not your whole
face

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.320 

so<00:07:45.710> if<00:07:45.800> you<00:07:45.889> notice<00:07:46.069> I<00:07:46.460> took<00:07:46.669> a<00:07:46.699> breath<00:07:46.939> first

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:47.330 
so if you notice I took a breath first

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.689 
so if you notice I took a breath first
and<00:07:47.930> then<00:07:48.409> did<00:07:48.560> one<00:07:48.740> more<00:07:48.949> stroke<00:07:49.249> and<00:07:49.520> on<00:07:49.610> the

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:49.699 
and then did one more stroke and on the

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:52.959 
and then did one more stroke and on the
next<00:07:50.029> stroke<00:07:50.270> I<00:07:50.599> lifted<00:07:51.259> my<00:07:51.319> head<00:07:51.759> doing<00:07:52.759> that

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:52.969 
next stroke I lifted my head doing that

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:54.850 
next stroke I lifted my head doing that
will<00:07:53.180> help<00:07:53.300> keep<00:07:53.509> your<00:07:53.779> straw<00:07:54.409> a<00:07:54.439> little<00:07:54.770> bit

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:54.860 
will help keep your straw a little bit

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:00.489 
will help keep your straw a little bit
smoother<00:07:55.370> and<00:07:56.949> not<00:07:57.949> as<00:07:58.279> much<00:07:59.379> flinging<00:08:00.379> around

00:08:00.489 --> 00:08:00.499 
smoother and not as much flinging around

00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:02.950 
smoother and not as much flinging around
as<00:08:01.039> you<00:08:01.159> try<00:08:01.340> to<00:08:01.400> breathe<00:08:01.699> and<00:08:01.969> lift<00:08:02.689> your<00:08:02.810> head

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 
as you try to breathe and lift your head

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.219 
as you try to breathe and lift your head
at<00:08:03.080> the<00:08:03.169> same<00:08:03.409> time<00:08:04.569> so<00:08:05.569> I<00:08:05.599> think<00:08:05.779> that's<00:08:06.080> it

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:06.229 
at the same time so I think that's it

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:08.620 
at the same time so I think that's it
for<00:08:06.259> today
