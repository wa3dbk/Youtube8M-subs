start<00:01:58.649> thinking<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.399> simple<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.479> using

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
start thinking really simple like using

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.280 
start thinking really simple like using
less<00:02:01.409> laundry<00:02:02.009> detergent<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:03.570> you're<00:02:03.869> using<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
less laundry detergent if you're using a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.810 
less laundry detergent if you're using a
quarter<00:02:04.619> cup<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.490> able

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
quarter cup and you're able

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.400 
quarter cup and you're able
cut<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.180> down<00:02:06.390> by<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> tablespoon<00:02:07.140> or<00:02:07.260> two

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
cut that down by a tablespoon or two

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.990 
cut that down by a tablespoon or two
probably<00:02:07.710> every<00:02:08.160> couple<00:02:08.460> votes<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.850> you're

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
probably every couple votes that you're

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.249 
probably every couple votes that you're
doing<00:02:09.210> you're<00:02:09.420> actually<00:02:09.750> getting<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.050> free

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
doing you're actually getting a free

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.490 
doing you're actually getting a free
load<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.860> what<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.100> were<00:02:11.330> using<00:02:12.330> before

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
load and to what you were using before

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.080 
load and to what you were using before
so<00:02:13.500> that's<00:02:13.680> by<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.190> end<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> year<00:02:14.880> even

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
though it's only pennies it's probably

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.040

so obviously the gift cards aren't cash

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.750 
so obviously the gift cards aren't cash
but<00:04:03.570> if<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.140> are<00:04:04.320> weakly<00:04:04.920> visiting<00:04:05.280> Starbucks
