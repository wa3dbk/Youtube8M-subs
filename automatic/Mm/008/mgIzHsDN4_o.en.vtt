00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
layers of sponge in the center to make

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.830 
layers of sponge in the center to make
it<00:00:26.170> a<00:00:26.230> bit<00:00:26.410> more<00:00:26.439> 3d<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:28.390> filled<00:00:28.750> with

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
it a bit more 3d and it's filled with

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.960

strawberry<00:00:29.380> jamming<00:00:29.800> but<00:00:29.980> I<00:00:30.220> got<00:00:30.820> some

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
strawberry jamming but I got some

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.729 
strawberry jamming but I got some
inspiration<00:00:31.599> from<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.930> internet<00:00:32.379> and<00:00:32.529> then<00:00:32.680> I

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
inspiration from the internet and then I

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.200 
inspiration from the internet and then I
drew<00:00:32.950> my<00:00:33.100> own<00:00:33.250> design<00:00:33.580> because<00:00:33.850> I<00:00:33.940> couldn't

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
drew my own design because I couldn't

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.360 
drew my own design because I couldn't
find<00:00:34.480> anything<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:35.170> was<00:00:35.800> quite<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.129> way

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
find anything that was quite the way

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.400 
find anything that was quite the way
that<00:00:36.400> I<00:00:36.610> wanted<00:00:37.030> it<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:38.140> I<00:00:38.500> just<00:00:38.530> ensel<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.350> it

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
that I wanted it so I just ensel so it

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.619 
that I wanted it so I just ensel so it
made<00:00:41.590> it<00:00:41.620> easier<00:00:42.129> to<00:00:42.670> shape<00:00:42.879> my<00:00:43.059> K<00:00:43.239> over<00:00:43.420> the

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
made it easier to shape my K over the

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.830 
made it easier to shape my K over the
cake<00:00:43.840> in<00:00:44.110> white<00:00:44.470> fondant<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:45.400> I<00:00:46.000> used<00:00:46.720> a

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
cake in white fondant and I used a

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.530 
cake in white fondant and I used a
slightly<00:00:47.140> different<00:00:47.559> methods<00:00:48.100> normal<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:49.269> add

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
slightly different methods normal to add

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.600 
slightly different methods normal to add
color<00:00:50.019> I<00:00:50.410> came<00:00:50.739> up<00:00:50.920> with<00:00:50.949> this<00:00:51.129> different

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
color I came up with this different

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.880 
color I came up with this different
method<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.180> color<00:00:52.570> in<00:00:52.750> white<00:00:52.930> fondant<00:00:53.200> because

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
method of color in white fondant because

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.979 
method of color in white fondant because
colored<00:00:54.219> fondant<00:00:54.430> is<00:00:54.820> proving<00:00:55.270> quite<00:00:55.420> hard<00:00:55.780> to

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
colored fondant is proving quite hard to

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.889 
colored fondant is proving quite hard to
get<00:00:56.230> around<00:00:56.890> where<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.399> am<00:00:57.730> I<00:00:57.969> know<00:00:58.629> you<00:00:58.780> can

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
get around where I am I know you can

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.319 
get around where I am I know you can
order<00:00:59.320> it<00:00:59.500> offline<00:00:59.890> but<00:01:00.309> it<00:01:00.520> does<00:01:00.820> sometimes

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
order it offline but it does sometimes

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.460 
order it offline but it does sometimes
take<00:01:01.660> quite<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.110> while<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.379> come<00:01:02.829> so<00:01:03.670> I<00:01:04.289> came<00:01:05.289> up

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
take quite a while to come so I came up

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.580 
take quite a while to come so I came up
with<00:01:05.500> this<00:01:05.649> new<00:01:05.860> method<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:08.350> probably

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
with this new method and it's probably

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.800 
with this new method and it's probably
cheaper<00:01:09.119> than<00:01:10.119> ordering<00:01:10.720> lots<00:01:11.440> of<00:01:11.619> colored

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
cheaper than ordering lots of colored

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.350 
cheaper than ordering lots of colored
fondant<00:01:13.810> packs<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.490> orange<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.090> grey

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
fondant packs for the orange and grey

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.680 
fondant packs for the orange and grey
striped<00:01:16.660> background<00:01:17.289> I<00:01:18.009> used<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.149> small<00:01:19.390> amount

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
striped background I used a small amount

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.430 
striped background I used a small amount
of<00:01:19.810> white<00:01:20.080> fondant<00:01:20.640> mixed<00:01:21.640> with<00:01:22.080> black<00:01:23.080> and

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
orange food coloring and I made it into

smoothed it out with a bit of warm water
and<00:01:34.209> it<00:01:34.869> had<00:01:34.990> quite<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.259> good<00:01:35.319> effect<00:01:35.679> for<00:01:36.670> the

you<00:02:15.010> add<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.220> thought<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.670> had<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.819> better<00:02:16.540> effect

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
you add I thought it had a better effect

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.510 
you add I thought it had a better effect
than<00:02:17.080> what<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.530> would<00:02:17.680> have<00:02:17.709> done<00:02:17.920> if<00:02:18.099> I<00:02:18.250> just

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
than what it would have done if I just

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.479 
than what it would have done if I just
bought<00:02:18.700> some<00:02:19.000> plain<00:02:19.720> black<00:02:20.140> matte<00:02:20.770> fondant

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
bought some plain black matte fondant

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.869 
bought some plain black matte fondant
for<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.120> Superman<00:02:22.629> part<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.140> logo<00:02:23.560> I

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
for the Superman part of the logo I

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.850 
for the Superman part of the logo I
decided<00:02:24.879> that<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.180> wanted<00:02:25.660> some<00:02:26.050> blue<00:02:26.470> along

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
decided that I wanted some blue along

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.600 
decided that I wanted some blue along
the<00:02:27.040> edge<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.870> again<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.710> mixed<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.130> small<00:02:30.340> amount

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the edge so again I mixed a small amount

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.980 
the edge so again I mixed a small amount
of<00:02:30.730> white<00:02:30.910> fondant<00:02:31.300> where

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990

center<00:02:43.810> where<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.230> yellow<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:45.100> did<00:02:45.760> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
center where the yellow is I did the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.510 
center where the yellow is I did the
same<00:02:46.090> again<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.830> added<00:02:47.830> some<00:02:47.860> yellow<00:02:48.280> food

chocolate<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:13.830> decided<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:15.100> add<00:03:15.250> some<00:03:15.490> silver

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
the Superman part of the logo in attempt

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.020 
the Superman part of the logo in attempt
to<00:03:23.530> make<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:23.980> stand<00:03:24.280> out<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.490> little<00:03:24.640> bit<00:03:24.820> more

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
to make it stand out a little bit more

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.680 
to make it stand out a little bit more
it<00:03:25.990> seems<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.440> have<00:03:26.560> worked<00:03:27.420> initially<00:03:28.420> I

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
it seems to have worked initially I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.050 
it seems to have worked initially I
wasn't<00:03:28.990> quite<00:03:29.620> sure<00:03:29.770> about<00:03:30.280> whether<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.700> wanted

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
wasn't quite sure about whether I wanted

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.630 
wasn't quite sure about whether I wanted
them<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:31.360> there<00:03:31.570> or<00:03:31.720> not<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:33.130> like<00:03:33.430> them<00:03:33.610> a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
them on there or not and I like them a

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.470 
them on there or not and I like them a
bit<00:03:33.850> better<00:03:33.970> than<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.270> did<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.630> start<00:03:34.930> with<00:03:35.170> and

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
bit better than I did to start with and

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
bit better than I did to start with and
but<00:03:37.480> I'm<00:03:37.600> still<00:03:37.930> not<00:03:38.080> one<00:03:38.170> hundred<00:03:38.260> percent

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
but I'm still not one hundred percent

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.860 
but I'm still not one hundred percent
sure<00:03:38.800> whether<00:03:39.610> it<00:03:39.790> looked<00:03:40.000> better<00:03:40.180> without

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
sure whether it looked better without

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.150 
sure whether it looked better without
