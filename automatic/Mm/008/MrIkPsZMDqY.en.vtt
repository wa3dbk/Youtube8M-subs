 I are shooting and has come out a 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.950
 zombie that does not 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.870
 It's worth cooking spits of those because 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.390
 this mode only transforms and 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.030
 transformed also normal 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.890
 but there are more mods with textures 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.989
 of minecraft zombies and others that 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.850
 adds a lot more new the situation 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.600
 just in addition videos of this is also 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.550
 singing 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.610
 my mother how boxes fly and all for 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.610
 there 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.239
 in retreat 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.630
 a matrix has been made 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.860
 a stain 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.500
 there it is fallen, it's worth it 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.850
 I have very little life 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.010
 I'm going to cure this time like now 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.300
 I have life now I 'm fine 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.440
 free 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.910
 vale vale and it is not bad 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.210
 will increase temporarily 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.210
 OK 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.599
 let's recharge this I have bullet 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.730
 guys from the shotgun if I'm going to see if 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.380
 there's something here because if I'm not going to 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:58.120
 to pass badly for here there is nothing 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.549
 here comes 1 2 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.560
 but do not take them off, I've already told you 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.400
 I have few bullets where we are going 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.189
 here we go here to adventure 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.840
 but there is another way that what does 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.290
 It also transforms the texture of 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.290
 character 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.760
 my mother 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.330
 another one here my mother a car 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.330
 police and everything 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:47.690
 is super realistic of the year that if all 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:49.540
 this was strategic withdrawal that is 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.060
 good 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.380
 you're strong with medicine cabinet where you 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:01.380
 supports the groningen that thus peace injury 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:04.110
 There is healing very good now 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.890
 I already am fine 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.700
 that a man's story led her to 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.280
 the silver the bullets has this 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.500
 good come let's go gang let's go for 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.510
 there to see where we are going now 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.849
 where do we have to go through here I guess 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:25.400
 that will have to open something will leave me 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:27.530
 we can not guys where I'm going 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.020
 here is a door I'm going to get through 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.020
 here to see that there is city an ax 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.030
 my mother 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:44.140
 an axe 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.140
 is that it has gone to the head and almost 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.900
 always gets on a horse in addition 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.910
 and no one 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.910
 to fall from the sky again
