you can see all the CNC work behind here

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.480 
you can see all the CNC work behind here
which<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.329> absolutely<00:01:05.509> love<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.859> instructions

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
which I absolutely love the instructions

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.569 
which I absolutely love the instructions
are<00:01:07.609> very<00:01:07.639> clear<00:01:08.270> very<00:01:08.539> easy<00:01:08.929> to<00:01:09.170> follow<00:01:09.579> now

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
are very clear very easy to follow now

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:11.919 
are very clear very easy to follow now
it<00:01:10.789> does<00:01:10.939> include<00:01:11.209> everything<00:01:11.630> you're<00:01:11.869> going

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
it does include everything you're going

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.230 
it does include everything you're going
to<00:01:12.020> need<00:01:12.109> to<00:01:12.229> install<00:01:12.649> it<00:01:12.709> and<00:01:13.009> this<00:01:13.969> boat

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
to need to install it and this boat

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.059 
to need to install it and this boat
we're<00:01:14.450> looking<00:01:14.689> at<00:01:14.810> here<00:01:15.079> actually<00:01:15.319> just<00:01:15.889> is

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069 
we're looking at here actually just is

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:18.789 
we're looking at here actually just is
there<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:16.579> remove<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.119> factory<00:01:17.469> ball<00:01:18.469> drainer

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
there to remove the factory ball drainer

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.069 
there to remove the factory ball drainer
I<00:01:18.889> guess<00:01:19.100> we<00:01:19.189> call<00:01:19.369> it<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.520> pivot<00:01:19.880> joint<00:01:20.119> from

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
I guess we call it the pivot joint from

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.289 
I guess we call it the pivot joint from
the<00:01:21.200> factory<00:01:21.590> arm<00:01:21.799> and<00:01:22.069> this<00:01:22.459> whole<00:01:22.939> piece

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
the factory arm and this whole piece

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.389 
the factory arm and this whole piece
actually<00:01:23.539> just<00:01:23.929> clamps<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.709> the<00:01:24.829> factory<00:01:25.130> army

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
actually just clamps to the factory army

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.980 
actually just clamps to the factory army
you've<00:01:25.520> got<00:01:25.670> these<00:01:25.789> little<00:01:25.969> set<00:01:26.329> screws<00:01:26.659> and

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
you've got these little set screws and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.389 
you've got these little set screws and
these<00:01:27.350> are<00:01:27.469> going<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.619> be<00:01:27.679> difficult<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.249> see

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
these are going to be difficult to see

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.879 
these are going to be difficult to see
but<00:01:28.549> they're<00:01:28.700> down<00:01:28.999> inside<00:01:29.749> there<00:01:30.349> so

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:30.889 
but they're down inside there so

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:32.349 
but they're down inside there so
basically<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:31.520> just<00:01:31.759> clamps<00:01:32.090> onto<00:01:32.209> the

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
basically this just clamps onto the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.879 
basically this just clamps onto the
factory<00:01:32.509> I'm<00:01:32.749> so<00:01:32.899> it's<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.079> very<00:01:33.109> very<00:01:33.590> easy

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:33.889 
factory I'm so it's a very very easy

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:35.410 
factory I'm so it's a very very easy
install<00:01:34.369> I'd<00:01:34.549> say<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.819> hardest<00:01:35.149> part<00:01:35.359> is

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
install I'd say the hardest part is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.870 
install I'd say the hardest part is
probably<00:01:35.749> getting<00:01:36.469> to<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.920> actual<00:01:37.369> shifter

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
probably getting to the actual shifter

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.550 
probably getting to the actual shifter
arm<00:01:38.029> itself<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.509> popping<00:01:38.840> off<00:01:38.959> that<00:01:39.170> factory

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
arm itself and popping off that factory

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.230 
arm itself and popping off that factory
ball<00:01:39.740> joint<00:01:39.950> but<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.490> is<00:01:40.639> kind<00:01:40.819> of<00:01:40.880> cool<00:01:40.939> how

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
ball joint but this is kind of cool how

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.769 
ball joint but this is kind of cool how
they<00:01:41.799> cut<00:01:42.799> that<00:01:42.979> out<00:01:43.219> of<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:43.669> bolt<00:01:44.029> so<00:01:44.569> it's<00:01:44.719> a

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:44.779 
they cut that out of that bolt so it's a

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:47.109 
they cut that out of that bolt so it's a
