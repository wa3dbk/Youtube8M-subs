00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 you want to finnish blockbuster finn 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.259
 because you are so excellent 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.300
 rare innovations or excellent 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.900
 achievements almost a lot of money 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.900
 can earn 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.410
 Now most companies are trying 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.510
 to also invent consultants in the process like 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.520
 you can plan on such billion rand 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.169
 So magath is practical and mining too 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.079
 find and I do not think that the 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.670
 So it really works if you are 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.829
 you have such a process you sit down 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.309
 Go on brainstorming actions 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.290
 write down ideas on the cook 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.870
 if they will win, etc 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.059
 and these processes forget that one 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.649
 the more correct highest performances too 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.370
 bring a certain feeling for 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.739
 absolute beauty customer satisfaction 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.679
 for pretend greek word for that 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.800
 means excellence in German 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:05.820
 greek councils or abc are more 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.890
 intoxication was but that is the innermost 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.080
 core of excellence so that a thing 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.120
 just like that, every human sees it 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.250
 is it the business processes are 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.490
 actually they always try too 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.259
 capture the beauty of an ipad 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.240
 a harry potter or nutella 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.000
 exists that in lists to describe 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.490
 and then reproducible mechanisms too 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.579
 find out how to do that and then 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.130
 you win the billions and they are 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.610
 that is such a common misconception 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.320
 So either it is a misbelief or 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.229
 it is a certain helplessness because 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.390
 one sometime one sees that people completely 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.710
 what an excellent out there so 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.020
 what like Harry potter write one 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.030
 make billions and then you start 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.340
 to defend against helplessness 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.110
 elements has a bestseller in recent years 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.850
 Three years have been fixed 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.350
 must have had something to do with magicians 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.390
 have the best with vampires or 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.920
 be filmed and so on and then 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.500
 Start according to these criteria 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.509
 to build innovations but with people 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.450
 they do not understand what excellence 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.399
 actually is and there just silted up 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 everything for reasons of principle because the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.420
 people methodically start something 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.200
 actually made something awesome 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.200
 must become
