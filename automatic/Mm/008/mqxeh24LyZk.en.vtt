00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.680
 Oh, and if you look at it here, that's the sensitivity. 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:13.670
 Yes 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.670
 In the case of directors, 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.160
 Those who have been here in the past will be athletic and know the day. 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.810
 Oh, only about 400 horse mackerel Iran 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.699
 Give the kid a 4-pin to a chapter called Oh save more in the past four cuts 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.120
 I'll write it. 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:40.059
 It's called iOS 100 these days. 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.890
 - 100, but I have an international standard for my US table . 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.540
 Strength 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.960
 usually 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.430
 I'm going to suffer from low intensity to start 50 yo Furniture Example 1 times 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.950
 Yes 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:59.100
 Low intensity and usually from 1 100 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.620
 No more than four. 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.620
 I 've eaten 4 2 and 402. 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.299
 What is 800 to 1000 is pretty 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.899
 When you go to your uncle's mouth like this 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.020
 What's the difference between high-strength and me and Joe ? 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.570
 4 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.570
 It's the same as film and sense. 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.430
 The lower the sensitivity of the particles of the magnetic film 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.880
 It's very big and small. 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.909
 Because it's small, please put the photo very crab . 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.479
 In this case, 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:50.450
 Also, the particles of the film are larger 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.430
 It's a bigger picture, but it's a bit more than that angle. 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.830
 It's easy to confirm the shots. 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.830
 Yes, because the reaction rate is fast. 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.650
 If the uterus is melted, it will be accelerated so quickly 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.159
 The particles in the film are very large. 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:13.819
 on 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:18.049
 Charyeong Hagen would really pyeonhajyo doing out at night carrying jjikeodo taken well 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.650
 But because of my disadvantages What date is too big 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.790
 on 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.720
 It's very hard on the flop to Xu if not used or 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.100
 4 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:34.290
 This press skirt photos so you can spread out even as you see in the picture 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:37.490
 If the picture Enlarge the picture look at me so I have a lot of high-sensitivity shooting, etc. 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.490
 It's a lot tough now. 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.690
 This is the case with the sensor and it works on the same principle 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.900
 When you shoot the film, 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.440
 He goes to the bishop and finally shoots him. 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.200
 Yes nowadays the camera is almost as good as the castle node now 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.349
 Strength 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:05.239
 Even if you shoot about four times 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:10.849
 I really liked jyeoteumyeon sold seongnim so no big bags or * dareulge 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:14.720
 However, the product endures the extra money taken thanks also rattling addition to portraits 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:18.760
 You see , you know the best resolution. 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.519
 Use the sensitivity pack when the resolution is the highest. 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:27.319
 You can use a sensitivity of 405 in a typical car. 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:30.290
 If possible, you 'd better not pass the first time . 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:35.989
 No matter how bout cameras nowadays have improved performance 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:40.819
 These days, it looks too big, so that software testing is St. haebomyeon 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:46.099
 I've used the noise reduction to make an apology. 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.880
 Now only substantially so uh, the resolution of the screen, or creating a good 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.630
 It's not. 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.769
 If it is possible , I will give you the first imprisonment . 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.769
 Hwaji-dong is much better 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.629
 Ah
