00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello everyone, I will answer one more 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 a very common question is why 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.730
 all the same it is important to play such a good 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.130
 so see the reason the first is sound 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.600
 first play room quint I ate 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.880
 such 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.769
 and 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.080
 children pier normal 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.300
 and 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.890
 as seen in the first case, the guitar sounds 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.420
 well let's say a thousand dollars cheaper 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.070
 i.e. feeling that somewhere cancer is 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.050
 Chinese made from plywood and so on 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.849
 that is, there is no new 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.869
 crazy for nothing up 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.610
 the second case of the guitar immediately growls bites 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.070
 hews and so on, that is to you 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.170
 direct dependence of the sound of the guitar and 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.300
 just generally such a sound path from 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.610
 hands now see what the difference is 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.620
 that is, when we play very sluggishly 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.720
 the sound is not revealed, that is, we 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.880
 get out of the guitar there is no bottom 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.330
 middle and top of nothing and when we play 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.330
 more powerful 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.530
 everything appears in the guitar immediately 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.790
 necessary frequencies so despite 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.350
 what we play here from the noise 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.390
 distortion sound pulses anyway 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.100
 timbral decent difference so on 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.140
 The topic of the attack is at least worth the trouble. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.600
 but perhaps not the second reason 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.880
 important this is a drum game now i'm 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.480
 put on fire come from playing 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.480
 first goal 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.760
 and now as normal 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.380
 but I think that even comment here 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.240
 nothing because the difference is just 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.890
 obviously well and finally I would like to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.360
 say that it is correct so she herself everything 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.520
 nowhere not taken that is above it 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.720
 you need to work so you need to start 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.760
 be choose the right landmark by 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.020
 I would immediately say the sound here 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.240
 that the vast majority of guitarists 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.790
 only sluggish enough is small 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.280
 a bunch of firm whose really miss sounds but 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.600
 on 1 of them some kind of material is not very 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.700
 angry anyway something sounds like 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.250
 slaughter so if you watch youtube 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.320
 is there anything and see how they have 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.320
 Toris, which is a jerk 3, let's say 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.799
 and then the next video is chagoy so 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.910
 I think you know immediately delicious ru 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.860
 watch 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.860
 good luck everyone and bye
