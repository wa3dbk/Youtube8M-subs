which I've often used with my milk of
magnesia<00:00:40.739> primer<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.350> milk<00:00:43.649> of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
magnesia primer because this the milk of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.380 
magnesia primer because this the milk of
magnesia<00:00:44.190> primer<00:00:44.399> tends<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.850> very<00:00:44.969> drying

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
magnesia primer tends to be very drying

this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.289> dark<00:02:00.289> so<00:02:01.289> I'm<00:02:01.530> going<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> blend<00:02:02.039> it
