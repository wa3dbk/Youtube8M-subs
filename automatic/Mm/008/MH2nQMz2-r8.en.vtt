learn<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> bottom<00:00:15.089> line<00:00:15.240> they<00:00:15.389> were<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.660> to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
learn the bottom line they were going to

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:24.360 
learn the bottom line they were going to
do<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:18.230> let's<00:00:19.230> do<00:00:20.150> let's<00:00:21.150> see

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.370 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.120 

they're<00:00:24.940> actually<00:00:25.270> should<00:00:25.480> be<00:00:25.690> a<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.890> put<00:00:30.100> a

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
they're actually should be a you put a
