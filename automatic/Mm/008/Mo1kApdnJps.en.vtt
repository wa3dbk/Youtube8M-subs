LeBron<00:01:44.150> James<00:01:44.479> no<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:45.020> think<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.680> really

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
LeBron James no I think it's a really

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.320 
LeBron James no I think it's a really
really<00:01:46.130> cool<00:01:46.310> dunk<00:01:46.580> I'm<00:01:46.759> not<00:01:46.880> gonna<00:01:47.000> lie<00:01:47.180> I

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
really cool dunk I'm not gonna lie I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.050 
really cool dunk I'm not gonna lie I
feel<00:01:47.540> like<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.990> it's<00:01:48.440> not<00:01:48.649> super<00:01:49.250> arcade<00:01:49.729> and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
feel like the it's not super arcade and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.670 
feel like the it's not super arcade and
it<00:01:50.180> did<00:01:50.330> have<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.570> nice<00:01:50.810> touch<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.500> it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
it did have a nice touch to it

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.710 
it did have a nice touch to it
now<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.100> James<00:01:52.520> Harden<00:01:52.970> Drive<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.479> all<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.600> lot

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
now the James Harden Drive and all a lot

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.450 
now the James Harden Drive and all a lot
of<00:01:53.810> people<00:01:54.080> might<00:01:54.229> be<00:01:54.380> spectacle<00:01:54.979> about<00:01:55.220> that

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
of people might be spectacle about that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.950 
of people might be spectacle about that
they<00:01:55.670> might<00:01:55.850> think<00:01:55.880> it's<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.330> not<00:01:56.600> realistic

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
they might think it's just not realistic

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.990 
they might think it's just not realistic
some<00:01:57.710> people<00:01:57.979> might<00:01:58.130> think<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.430> animation

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
some people might think the animation

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.219 
some people might think the animation
isn't<00:01:59.150> look<00:01:59.360> nice<00:01:59.540> I<00:01:59.720> think<00:01:59.780> it's<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.080> pretty

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
isn't look nice I think it's a pretty

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.469 
isn't look nice I think it's a pretty
decent<00:02:00.470> animation<00:02:01.190> be<00:02:01.550> try<00:02:01.850> if<00:02:01.909> he<00:02:02.090> drives<00:02:02.270> to

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
decent animation be try if he drives to

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.180 
decent animation be try if he drives to
the<00:02:02.540> rim<00:02:02.630> he<00:02:03.080> goes<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.530> left<00:02:03.740> side<00:02:03.920> because

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
the rim he goes to the left side because

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.340 
the rim he goes to the left side because
he<00:02:04.400> is<00:02:04.549> a<00:02:04.580> lefty<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.390> he<00:02:05.540> does<00:02:05.720> get<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:05.960> finish

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
he is a lefty and he does get a finish

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.229 
he is a lefty and he does get a finish
that<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:06.920> possible<00:02:07.370> because<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.760> is<00:02:07.970> James

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
that is possible because this is James

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.240 
that is possible because this is James
Harden<00:02:08.600> as<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:09.140> can<00:02:09.260> see<00:02:09.470> he's<00:02:09.649> like<00:02:09.830> taunting

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
Harden as you can see he's like taunting

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.820 
Harden as you can see he's like taunting
