00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
so it just kind of repeats that pattern

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
okay so for the bridge we're starting

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.710 
okay so for the bridge we're starting
this<00:03:43.870> right<00:03:44.080> here<00:03:44.260> this<00:03:44.380> be<00:03:44.730> second<00:03:45.730> fret

going to C sharp they're going to I'm
sorry<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:01.120> D<00:04:01.390> major<00:04:01.630> set

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
sorry a D major set

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.540 
sorry a D major set
you're<00:04:03.970> just<00:04:04.180> kind<00:04:04.390> of

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.270 

and<00:04:06.640> then<00:04:07.300> you<00:04:07.390> want<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.600> bounce<00:04:07.720> back<00:04:08.280> by

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
and then you want to bounce back by

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.020 
and then you want to bounce back by
going<00:04:09.490> to<00:04:09.880> in<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.870> major<00:04:11.650> 7

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.190 

so<00:04:18.030> we're<00:04:18.180> just<00:04:18.210> bouncing<00:04:18.660> back<00:04:18.840> between

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
so we're just bouncing back between

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.710 
so we're just bouncing back between
those<00:04:19.350> two<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.650> think<00:04:20.010> twice<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:21.210> lead<00:04:21.420> into

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
those two I think twice so you lead into

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:35.480 
those two I think twice so you lead into
it<00:04:33.080> get<00:04:34.080> back<00:04:34.230> to<00:04:34.380> this<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.650> major<00:04:34.860> seven<00:04:35.340> and

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
it get back to this a major seven and

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.030 
it get back to this a major seven and
then<00:04:36.360> we're<00:04:36.630> going<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.980> lead<00:04:37.980> into<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:40.040> C

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
then we're going to lead into the C

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.250 
then we're going to lead into the C
major<00:04:41.250> seven<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.030> we're<00:04:42.780> just<00:04:42.930> going<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.080> hit

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
major seven so we're just going to hit

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.800 
major seven so we're just going to hit
the<00:04:43.560> fifth<00:04:44.040> string<00:04:44.310> open<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.860> we<00:04:46.950> go<00:04:47.540> and<00:04:48.540> then

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
the fifth string open so we go and then

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.210 
the fifth string open so we go and then
we<00:04:48.900> hit<00:04:49.050> that<00:04:50.090> B<00:04:51.090> again<00:04:51.420> on<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.200> fifth<00:04:52.470> string

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
we hit that B again on the fifth string

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.880 
we hit that B again on the fifth string
second<00:04:53.700> fret<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.150> then<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.080> go<00:04:55.260> into<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.680> C

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
second fret and then you go into the C

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.670 
second fret and then you go into the C
major<00:04:56.100> seven<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:56.700> we<00:04:56.790> have<00:05:00.290> and<00:05:01.290> then<00:05:01.440> we<00:05:01.530> go

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
major seven so we have and then we go

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:10.460 
major seven so we have and then we go
into<00:05:01.860> it<00:05:05.030> then<00:05:06.030> we<00:05:06.090> go<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.240> G<00:05:06.870> sharp<00:05:07.260> major<00:05:07.710> 7<00:05:09.470> we

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
into it then we go to G sharp major 7 we

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.040 
into it then we go to G sharp major 7 we
do<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.680> same<00:05:10.830> thing<00:05:11.130> like<00:05:11.930> bouncing<00:05:12.930> back

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
do the same thing like bouncing back

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:30.200 
do the same thing like bouncing back
between<00:05:13.230> those<00:05:13.530> two<00:05:13.740> so<00:05:13.950> we<00:05:14.040> have<00:05:14.070> this

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.150 

and<00:05:30.480> then<00:05:30.630> you<00:05:30.720> only<00:05:30.840> do<00:05:31.050> it<00:05:31.080> once<00:05:31.740> and<00:05:32.100> then

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
and then you only do it once and then

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:40.629 
and then you only do it once and then
you<00:05:33.120> want<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.420> go<00:05:33.510> to<00:05:33.570> an<00:05:33.930> a<00:05:34.140> minor<00:05:34.500> 7

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.839 

and<00:05:40.909> you<00:05:41.000> want<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.210> go<00:05:41.300> to<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.509> B<00:05:41.930> flat<00:05:42.849> seven

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
and you want to go to a B flat seven

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:51.429 
and you want to go to a B flat seven
sharp<00:05:44.360> five

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:51.439 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:59.199 

and<00:05:51.679> then<00:05:52.129> we<00:05:52.610> start<00:05:53.059> the<00:05:53.589> verse<00:05:54.589> again<00:05:58.209> let's

00:05:59.199 --> 00:05:59.209 
and then we start the verse again let's

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:01.209 
and then we start the verse again let's
go<00:05:59.330> over<00:05:59.599> the<00:05:59.749> bridge<00:05:59.959> one<00:06:00.259> more<00:06:00.439> time<00:06:00.649> then

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
go over the bridge one more time then

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:04.179 
go over the bridge one more time then
we'll<00:06:01.339> wrap<00:06:01.699> things<00:06:01.999> up
