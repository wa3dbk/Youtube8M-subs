dryers on top and the washer is at a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.300 
dryers on top and the washer is at a
bottom<00:00:29.210> just<00:00:29.480> change<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.199> switch<00:00:30.590> on<00:00:31.009> this

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
bottom just change the switch on this

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.610 
bottom just change the switch on this
dryer<00:00:32.260> just<00:00:33.260> joy<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:34.040> switch<00:00:35.440> switch<00:00:36.440> is

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
dryer just joy the switch switch is

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.910 
dryer just joy the switch switch is
broken<00:00:37.160> switch<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:37.910> is<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.239> activator<00:00:38.920> it's

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
broken switch this is the activator it's

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.090 
broken switch this is the activator it's
this<00:00:40.100> little<00:00:40.519> piece<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:40.940> opinion<00:00:41.540> you're<00:00:41.750> on

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
this little piece of opinion you're on

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.119 
this little piece of opinion you're on
when<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.220> door<00:00:43.400> closes<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:45.050> door<00:00:45.230> pushes<00:00:45.800> on

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
when the door closes the door pushes on

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.540 
when the door closes the door pushes on
this<00:00:46.430> activator<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:48.680> you<00:00:48.890> know<00:00:49.010> completes

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
this activator and you know completes

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:59.410 
this activator and you know completes
the<00:00:49.820> circuit<00:00:50.360> okay<00:00:52.390> like<00:00:53.390> that<00:00:56.949> all<00:00:57.949> right<00:00:58.420> but

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
the circuit okay like that all right but

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.320 
the circuit okay like that all right but
this<00:00:59.690> is<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.229> old<00:01:00.589> old<00:01:01.989> switch<00:01:03.790> ON<00:01:04.790> switch<00:01:04.850> it

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
this is the old old switch ON switch it

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.380 
this is the old old switch ON switch it
goes<00:01:05.360> behind<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:06.170> like<00:01:06.409> this<00:01:06.650> right<00:01:06.710> here<00:01:07.390> if

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
goes behind it like this right here if

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.219 
goes behind it like this right here if
you<00:01:08.600> notice<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.850> actuator<00:01:10.960> little<00:01:11.960> black

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
you notice the actuator little black

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.870 
you notice the actuator little black
piece<00:01:12.799> right<00:01:13.130> there<00:01:14.290> goes<00:01:15.290> behind<00:01:15.530> there<00:01:16.100> it

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
piece right there goes behind there it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.530 
piece right there goes behind there it
was<00:01:17.030> broken<00:01:17.360> off<00:01:17.689> from<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.110> door<00:01:19.390> opening<00:01:20.390> and

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
was broken off from the door opening and

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.469 
was broken off from the door opening and
clothes<00:01:20.900> all<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.350> time<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:22.759> replace<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.150> new

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
clothes all the time so replace a new

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:31.250 
clothes all the time so replace a new
switch<00:01:24.460> is<00:01:25.460> what<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.700> new<00:01:25.970> switch<00:01:26.360> looks<00:01:26.630> like

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.710 

there's<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.400> new<00:01:32.580> one<00:01:33.620> the<00:01:34.620> new<00:01:34.800> switch

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.020 

actuator<00:01:39.720> intact<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:44.030> old

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
actuator intact and this is the old

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.110 
actuator intact and this is the old
switch<00:01:46.160> with<00:01:47.160> a<00:01:47.190> little<00:01:47.640> piece<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
switch with a little piece of the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.900 
switch with a little piece of the
actuator<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:50.010> it's<00:01:50.250> broken<00:01:50.640> off<00:01:51.800> okay

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
actuator and it's broken off okay

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.630 
actuator and it's broken off okay
because<00:01:53.910> it's<00:01:54.240> broken<00:01:54.540> off<00:01:54.900> then<00:01:55.460> when<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
because it's broken off then when the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.990 
because it's broken off then when the
door<00:01:56.880> closes

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
door closes

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
door closes
it<00:02:00.000> doesn't<00:02:00.600> activate<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.470> said<00:02:04.740> hold

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
it doesn't activate and I said hold

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.060 
it doesn't activate and I said hold
switch<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:08.700> new<00:02:08.850> switch<00:02:09.619> this<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
switch and the new switch this is the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.850 
switch and the new switch this is the
timer<00:02:12.050> for<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.080> washing<00:02:13.440> machine<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.800> is

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
timer for the washing machine this is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.790 
timer for the washing machine this is
the<00:02:17.990> model<00:02:18.990> level<00:02:19.230> switch<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:21.810> plastic<00:02:22.530> hose

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
the model level switch this plastic hose

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.650 
the model level switch this plastic hose
right<00:02:23.100> here<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.700> what<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.000> pressure<00:02:24.360> of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
right here this is what the pressure of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.460 
right here this is what the pressure of
the<00:02:24.810> water<00:02:25.310> comes<00:02:26.310> up<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.720> activate<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the water comes up in to activate the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.730 
the water comes up in to activate the
switch<00:02:28.680> all<00:02:29.520> right
