00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 the square goal was the gift of 18 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.319
 years together with the driver's license 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.300
 he spent almost one thousand reais for 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.820
 lower the car suspension with parts 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.920
 maintenance of vehicle safety 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.599
 but you can not regularize the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.590
 documentation because of the changes 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.020
 made 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.090
 You did not ask for authorization before it 's not the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.449
 I have your money to come legalize 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.800
 to be all right but ride 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.539
 legalizing according to the head of the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.039
 vehicle control division of the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.170
 detran de mato grosso do sul 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.780
 The problem was that the changes only 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.149
 may be made on the vehicle after the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.640
 owner to obtain authorization from the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.980
 transit authority, any change in the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.440
 feature that you own and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.750
 if you do in your vehicle, look first 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.760
 transparent department to obtain the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.460
 prior authorization and has the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.140
 aggravating that some changes are not 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.320
 authorized by Brazilian law 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.390
 even if requested in advance 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.719
 because they change the security configuration 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.640
 of the vehicle is one of the operations 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.519
 can be made in vehicle is a system 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.710
 any operation 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.380
 that you want to do 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.290
 has a rule observed in the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.360
 the inspections carried out today by the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.180
 detran are just to check if the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.560
 characteristics of the vehicle are the same as 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.350
 described in the 1998 document contran 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.049
 has downloaded a resolution creating etv 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.060
 vehicular technical inspection aimed at 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.710
 ensure the safety of all 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.470
 vehicle systems so that he could 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.900
 be licensed and thus transit 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.640
 legally on the streets but this resolution 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.790
 is suspended 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.430
 it was suspended by another resolution 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.460
 Finally, we have a resolution that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.590
 of a subtle inspection where, before each 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.960
 licensing, the vehicle should be 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.659
 submitted to view the conditions of their 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:02.219
 brake systems is lighting and even 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.110
 still can not be used 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.930
 I already hit it to regularize the car 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.509
 also the CN that he lost because he was 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.459
 caught with the car demoted and fined 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.790
 so you're going to have to squeeze a loss 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.080
 to undo what had been done is 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.080
 he again, right?
