00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
so yeah as you can tell the spandex part

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.879 
so yeah as you can tell the spandex part
is<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.709> lot<00:02:55.920> darker<00:02:56.159> than<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.900> original<00:02:58.260> one

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
is a lot darker than the original one

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.240 
is a lot darker than the original one
because<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.670> repainted<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.450> whole<00:03:00.629> thing<00:03:00.840> I

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
because I repainted the whole thing I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.890 
because I repainted the whole thing I
thought<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.370> looked<00:03:02.489> much<00:03:03.180> nicer<00:03:03.690> with<00:03:03.840> a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
thought it looked much nicer with a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.460 
thought it looked much nicer with a
darker<00:03:04.260> color<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.709> also<00:03:05.609> what<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:07.049> original

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
darker color and also what the original

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.050 
darker color and also what the original
one<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.769> bought<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.099> this<00:03:08.250> one<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.700> was<00:03:08.879> has

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
one that I bought of this one it was has

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.509 
one that I bought of this one it was has
minor<00:03:09.450> scratches<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.769> had<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.099> fix<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.489> so

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
minor scratches so I had to fix it so

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.280 
minor scratches so I had to fix it so
the<00:03:11.819> only<00:03:11.849> way<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.120> could<00:03:12.269> think<00:03:12.329> of<00:03:12.629> Breed<00:03:12.900> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
the only way I could think of Breed the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.520 
the only way I could think of Breed the
fixing<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.799> was<00:03:14.010> repainting<00:03:14.639> it<00:03:14.730> completely

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
fixing it was repainting it completely

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.280 
fixing it was repainting it completely
the<00:03:16.530> yellow<00:03:16.799> parts<00:03:17.129> also<00:03:17.519> right<00:03:18.329> like<00:03:18.780> had<00:03:19.019> um

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
the yellow parts also right like had um

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.589 
the yellow parts also right like had um
paint<00:03:20.040> scratches<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:20.849> just<00:03:20.910> repeated

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
paint scratches on it so I just repeated

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.689 
paint scratches on it so I just repeated
it<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.900> would<00:03:22.290> have<00:03:22.349> were<00:03:22.470> painted<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:23.220> head

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
it I would have were painted the head

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.009 
it I would have were painted the head
but<00:03:23.970> there<00:03:24.150> was<00:03:24.239> completely<00:03:24.660> perfect

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
but there was completely perfect

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.710 
but there was completely perfect
condition<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.620> didn't<00:03:25.769> have<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:26.069> UM<00:03:26.720> so

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
condition so I didn't have to UM so

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.199 
condition so I didn't have to UM so
that's<00:03:28.199> all<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.379> used<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:30.540> make<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.840> Goku<00:03:31.290> and
