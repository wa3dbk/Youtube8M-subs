the regular maps that we have like
firebase<00:01:45.360> goals<00:01:45.630> fiber<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.110> staggering

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
firebase goals fiber a staggering

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.460 
firebase goals fiber a staggering
firebase<00:01:47.040> giant<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.060> those<00:01:48.990> environmental

firebase giant so those environmental

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.410 
firebase giant so those environmental
hazards<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.070> don't<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:50.460> what<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.180> but

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
hazards I don't know what what it is but

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.910 
hazards I don't know what what it is but
looking<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> gameplay<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.860> in

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
looking at the gameplay you can see in

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.469 
looking at the gameplay you can see in
the<00:01:52.979> background<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.610> some<00:01:53.880> sort<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.149> maps

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the background like some sort of maps

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.480 
the background like some sort of maps
that<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.750> already<00:01:55.020> know<00:01:55.200> our<00:01:55.470> dark<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.460> looks

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that we already know our dark it looks

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.550 
that we already know our dark it looks
like<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.180> might<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.049> don't<00:01:58.290> know<00:01:58.380> maybe

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
like there might be I don't know maybe

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.010 
like there might be I don't know maybe
lightning<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.369> rain<00:01:59.640> or<00:01:59.670> something<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.540> if

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
lightning or rain or something and if

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
lightning or rain or something and if
you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.320> tell<00:02:01.530> from<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.890> from<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.250> gameplay

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
you can tell from the from the gameplay

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.730 
you can tell from the from the gameplay
they<00:02:03.509> also<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.840> new<00:02:04.020> weapons<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.590> got<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
they also have new weapons they got a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.170 
they also have new weapons they got a
collector<00:02:05.189> soul<00:02:05.430> rifle<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:05.969> is

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
collector soul rifle which is

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.609 
collector soul rifle which is
interesting<00:02:06.659> because<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.899> already<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
interesting because I already have it

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.680 
interesting because I already have it
but<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> guess<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:08.940> finally<00:02:09.239> gonna<00:02:09.360> make<00:02:09.539> it

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
but I guess it's finally gonna make it

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.140 
but I guess it's finally gonna make it
to<00:02:09.780> multiplayer<00:02:10.289> DLC<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.190> regular<00:02:12.000> weapon

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
for the collector SMG which we what I

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.180 
for the collector SMG which we what I
can<00:02:15.840> see<00:02:16.050> from<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> collector<00:02:16.590> sniper<00:02:16.830> rifle

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
can see from the collector sniper rifle

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.370 
can see from the collector sniper rifle
looks<00:02:17.340> pretty<00:02:17.550> beastly<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.450> scope<00:02:18.840> at<00:02:19.080> least

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
looks pretty beastly the scope at least

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.020 
looks pretty beastly the scope at least
just<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.770> little<00:02:20.040> bit<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.310> saw<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.520> pause

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
just a little bit that I saw I pause

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.300 
just a little bit that I saw I pause
this<00:02:21.270> video<00:02:21.600> quite<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.080> bit<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.410> then<00:02:23.220> a

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
this video quite a bit and then a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.390 
this video quite a bit and then a
collector<00:02:23.670> sng<00:02:24.000> which<00:02:24.150> looks<00:02:24.930> pretty<00:02:24.990> cool

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
collector sng which looks pretty cool

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.590 
collector sng which looks pretty cool
they<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.520> new<00:02:26.700> ammo<00:02:27.000> types<00:02:27.210> which<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.540> don't

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
know what they do but i'm looking

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.680 
know what they do but i'm looking
forward<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> exploring<00:02:29.880> them<00:02:30.150> which<00:02:30.360> are<00:02:30.570> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
forward to exploring them which are the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.960 
forward to exploring them which are the
explosive<00:02:31.230> rounds<00:02:31.620> phasic<00:02:32.160> rounds<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.700> drew

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
explosive rounds phasic rounds and drew

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.910 
explosive rounds phasic rounds and drew
around<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.110> explosive<00:02:34.560> rounds<00:02:34.830> that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
around and the explosive rounds that

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.650 
around and the explosive rounds that
kind<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.160> makes<00:02:35.310> sense<00:02:35.490> from<00:02:35.790> Mass<00:02:36.060> Effect<00:02:36.390> one

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
kind of makes sense from Mass Effect one

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.330 
kind of makes sense from Mass Effect one
you<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.230> know<00:02:37.320> shots<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.800> just<00:02:37.980> explode

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
you have you know shots to just explode

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.460 
you have you know shots to just explode
on<00:02:38.490> impact<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.940> those<00:02:39.150> were<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.510> beast<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:40.080> love

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
on impact and those were a beast I love

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.900 
on impact and those were a beast I love
those<00:02:40.650> those<00:02:41.070> runs<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.460> only<00:02:41.610> thing<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.790> that

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
those those runs the only thing is that

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.850 
those those runs the only thing is that
rounds<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.110> only<00:02:43.290> allows<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.710> to

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
rounds like that only allows you to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.280 
rounds like that only allows you to
shoot<00:02:44.070> once<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.790> for<00:02:44.970> Mass<00:02:45.120> Effect<00:02:45.450> one<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:46.260> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
shoot once and for Mass Effect one so I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.560 
shoot once and for Mass Effect one so I
don't<00:02:46.680> know<00:02:46.950> how<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.250> do<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.700> mass<00:02:47.880> effect<00:02:48.270> 3

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
don't know how to do it a mass effect 3

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.240 
don't know how to do it a mass effect 3
and<00:02:48.960> multiplayer<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.920> would<00:02:50.040> be<00:02:50.130> very

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
and multiplayer that would be very

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.790 
and multiplayer that would be very
interested<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.790> see<00:02:51.230> which<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.380> pretty
