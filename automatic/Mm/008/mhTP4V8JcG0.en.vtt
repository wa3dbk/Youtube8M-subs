00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
more than five to ten seconds or so okay

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.470 
more than five to ten seconds or so okay
and<00:02:24.980> you're<00:02:25.310> just<00:02:25.430> going<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.610> roll<00:02:25.850> over<00:02:25.880> here

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
and you're just going to roll over here

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.590 
and you're just going to roll over here
get<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.590> underarm<00:02:28.310> attachment<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.090> that's

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
get the underarm attachment so that's

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.210 
get the underarm attachment so that's
all<00:02:29.900> these<00:02:30.050> things<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.440> attach<00:02:30.710> up<00:02:30.920> under

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
all these things that attach up under

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.540 
all these things that attach up under
the<00:02:31.310> humerus<00:02:31.700> they're<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:33.020> lean<00:02:33.230> across<00:02:33.560> you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
the humerus they're the lean across you

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.550 
the humerus they're the lean across you
should<00:02:34.820> find<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.330> point<00:02:35.630> that's<00:02:35.840> probably<00:02:36.350> not

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
should find a point that's probably not

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.650 
should find a point that's probably not
really<00:02:36.920> comfortable<00:02:37.160> if<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.240> can<00:02:38.390> roll<00:02:38.630> back

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
really comfortable if you can roll back

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.570 
really comfortable if you can roll back
this<00:02:39.290> way<00:02:39.500> you're<00:02:39.740> going<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.920> find<00:02:40.160> some<00:02:40.370> more

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
this way you're going to find some more

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.610 
this way you're going to find some more
but<00:02:41.120> again<00:02:41.150> we're<00:02:41.570> not<00:02:41.600> trying<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.080> grind<00:02:42.350> in

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
but again we're not trying to grind in

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.590 
but again we're not trying to grind in
there<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.190> hurt<00:02:43.760> ourselves<00:02:44.330> we're<00:02:44.420> just

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
there and hurt ourselves we're just

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.240 
there and hurt ourselves we're just
trying<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.870> get<00:02:44.990> some<00:02:45.170> light<00:02:45.380> passes<00:02:45.860> probably

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
trying to get some light passes probably

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.000 
trying to get some light passes probably
ten<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.550> fifteen<00:02:46.970> or<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:48.050> continually

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
ten to fifteen or so just continually

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.530 
ten to fifteen or so just continually
kind<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.250> rolling<00:02:49.550> back<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.760> forth<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.420> get

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
kind of rolling back and forth to get

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.530 
kind of rolling back and forth to get
all<00:02:50.720> those<00:02:50.840> aspects<00:02:51.410> there<00:02:51.680> okay<00:02:52.390> once<00:02:53.390> we're

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
all those aspects there okay once we're

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.150 
all those aspects there okay once we're
done<00:02:53.690> there<00:02:53.990> we're<00:02:54.350> going<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.530> hop<00:02:54.680> up<00:02:54.890> onto

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
done there we're going to hop up onto

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.690 
done there we're going to hop up onto
the<00:02:55.340> glute<00:02:55.690> cross<00:02:56.690> one<00:02:56.960> leg<00:02:57.140> over<00:02:57.200> here<00:02:57.950> lean

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
the glute cross one leg over here lean

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.390 
the glute cross one leg over here lean
towards<00:02:59.240> that<00:02:59.480> side<00:02:59.780> your<00:03:00.350> cross<00:03:00.650> leg<00:03:00.980> and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
towards that side your cross leg and

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.730 
towards that side your cross leg and
again<00:03:02.090> we<00:03:02.300> want<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.600> rotate<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.260> can<00:03:03.320> spin

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
again we want to rotate you can spin

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.310 
again we want to rotate you can spin
this<00:03:04.010> way<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> little<00:03:04.430> bit<00:03:04.550> side<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.000> side<00:03:05.320> put

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
this way a little bit side to side put

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.380 
this way a little bit side to side put
more<00:03:06.890> or<00:03:07.010> less<00:03:07.160> pressure<00:03:07.520> you<00:03:08.000> know<00:03:08.120> towards

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
more or less pressure you know towards

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.230 
more or less pressure you know towards
the<00:03:08.510> lateral<00:03:08.960> aspect<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.530> glute<00:03:09.890> and

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
the lateral aspect of that glute and

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.150 
the lateral aspect of that glute and
kind<00:03:11.240> of<00:03:11.300> find<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.720> point<00:03:12.350> for<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.890> that's

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
kind of find the point for you that's

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.010 
kind of find the point for you that's
the<00:03:13.340> most<00:03:13.520> tender<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.540> should<00:03:14.720> be<00:03:14.840> your

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
the most tender and that should be your

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.699 
the most tender and that should be your
sort<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.709> your<00:03:15.800> default<00:03:17.590> position<00:03:18.590> that

sort of your default position that

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.050 
sort of your default position that
you're<00:03:18.860> going<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.010> roll<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.430> of<00:03:19.520> course<00:03:19.700> keep

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
you're going to roll it of course keep

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.090 
you're going to roll it of course keep
moving<00:03:20.390> around<00:03:20.480> get<00:03:21.260> some<00:03:21.290> better<00:03:21.620> coverage

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
moving around get some better coverage

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.729 
moving around get some better coverage
but<00:03:23.060> focus<00:03:23.510> on<00:03:23.660> where<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:23.959> find<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.560> most

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
but focus on where you find the most

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.479 
hamstring adductor on this leg here okay
so<00:03:47.810> when<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.320> roll<00:03:48.650> all<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:48.860> way<00:03:48.980> here<00:03:49.340> I'm

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
so when I roll all the way here I'm

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.220 
so when I roll all the way here I'm
almost<00:03:49.760> sideways<00:03:50.030> alright<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:50.930> we<00:03:51.019> really

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
almost sideways alright so we really

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.009 
almost sideways alright so we really
want<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.410> get<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.680> origin<00:03:52.450> those<00:03:53.450> adductors

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
want to get that origin those adductors

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.050 
want to get that origin those adductors
in<00:03:54.140> particular<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.680> tend<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.100> stay<00:03:55.310> higher<00:03:55.790> up

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
in particular I tend to stay higher up

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.580 
in particular I tend to stay higher up
towards<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.420> pelvis<00:03:56.630> although<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.200> can<00:03:57.410> go

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
towards the pelvis although you can go

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.280 
towards the pelvis although you can go
all<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.340> way<00:03:58.670> down<00:03:58.940> here<00:03:59.300> get<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.570> few<00:03:59.780> passes

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
all the way down here get a few passes

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.130 
all the way down here get a few passes
on<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.650> inner<00:04:00.860> aspect<00:04:01.570> rotate<00:04:02.570> here<00:04:02.900> so

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
on that inner aspect rotate here so

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.830 
on that inner aspect rotate here so
we're<00:04:03.320> straight<00:04:03.800> on<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.640> centerline<00:04:05.000> those

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
we're straight on the centerline those

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.830 
we're straight on the centerline those
hamstrings<00:04:06.380> okay<00:04:07.400> view<00:04:08.000> passes<00:04:08.390> there<00:04:08.630> and

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
hamstrings okay view passes there and

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.500 
hamstrings okay view passes there and
then<00:04:09.470> out<00:04:09.680> along<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.400> outer<00:04:10.790> aspect<00:04:11.330> of<00:04:11.450> the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
then out along that outer aspect of the

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.000 
then out along that outer aspect of the
hamstring<00:04:11.989> so<00:04:12.110> what<00:04:12.230> we're<00:04:12.350> looking<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.680> do<00:04:12.830> is

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
hamstring so what we're looking to do is

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.580 
hamstring so what we're looking to do is
kind<00:04:13.190> of<00:04:13.280> get<00:04:13.489> all<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.360> way<00:04:14.450> up<00:04:14.690> into<00:04:14.900> where

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
kind of get all the way up into where

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.240 
kind of get all the way up into where
that<00:04:15.800> hamstring<00:04:16.340> is<00:04:16.580> kind<00:04:16.790> of<00:04:16.820> a

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
that hamstring is kind of a

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.729 
that hamstring is kind of a
that<00:04:17.640> IT<00:04:17.880> band<00:04:18.060> okay<00:04:18.660> so<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.019> few<00:04:19.230> more<00:04:19.320> passes

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
that IT band okay so a few more passes

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.670 
that IT band okay so a few more passes
there<00:04:20.239> once<00:04:21.239> we've<00:04:21.420> got<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:21.630> stuff<00:04:22.200> we're

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
there once we've got that stuff we're

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.600 
there once we've got that stuff we're
just<00:04:22.830> going<00:04:22.950> to<00:04:23.010> flip<00:04:23.280> over<00:04:23.660> all<00:04:24.660> right<00:04:25.610> we're

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
just going to flip over all right we're

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.060 
just going to flip over all right we're
going<00:04:26.730> to<00:04:26.760> go<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.690> midline<00:04:28.620> at<00:04:28.920> both<00:04:29.130> quads<00:04:29.580> okay

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
going to go a midline at both quads okay

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.590 
going to go a midline at both quads okay
so<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:32.370> few<00:04:32.520> passes<00:04:32.910> there<00:04:33.090> guys<00:04:33.360> be

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
so just a few passes there guys be

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.060 
so just a few passes there guys be
really<00:04:33.840> careful<00:04:34.230> about<00:04:34.260> coming<00:04:34.710> up<00:04:34.800> towards

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
really careful about coming up towards

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.800 
really careful about coming up towards
the<00:04:35.130> top<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.820> can<00:04:35.970> figure<00:04:36.180> out<00:04:36.420> what<00:04:36.720> the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
the top you can figure out what the

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.500 
the top you can figure out what the
potential<00:04:37.230> problem<00:04:37.560> is<00:04:37.710> all<00:04:38.490> right<00:04:38.610> once<00:04:39.390> we

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
potential problem is all right once we

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.450 
potential problem is all right once we
hit<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:39.960> what<00:04:40.290> we're<00:04:40.410> going<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.590> do<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.980> get

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
hit that what we're going to do is get

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.350 
hit that what we're going to do is get
down<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.110> VMO<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.440> adapter<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:45.030> get<00:04:45.210> those

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
down to the VMO and adapter so get those

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.540 
down to the VMO and adapter so get those
legs<00:04:45.630> out<00:04:45.930> as<00:04:46.290> far<00:04:46.590> as<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:46.830> can<00:04:47.070> while<00:04:47.520> still

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
legs out as far as you can while still

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.430 
legs out as far as you can while still
being<00:04:47.940> on<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.240> roller<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.810> then<00:04:49.320> you're

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
being on the roller and then you're

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.090 
being on the roller and then you're
going<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.650> rotate<00:04:49.950> a<00:04:50.430> little<00:04:50.490> bit<00:04:50.760> okay<00:04:51.300> so<00:04:51.360> I'm

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
going to rotate a little bit okay so I'm

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.740 
going to rotate a little bit okay so I'm
externally<00:04:53.100> rotating<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:53.760> leg<00:04:54.000> internally

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
externally rotating this leg internally

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.900 
externally rotating this leg internally
rotating<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.350> other<00:04:55.500> so<00:04:56.370> that<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.550> can<00:04:56.730> get

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
rotating the other so that I can get

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.590 
rotating the other so that I can get
pressure<00:04:57.270> on<00:04:57.419> this<00:04:57.750> this<00:04:58.290> leg<00:04:58.800> VMO<00:04:59.430> okay<00:04:59.910> and

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
pressure on this this leg VMO okay and

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.330 
pressure on this this leg VMO okay and
lift<00:05:00.780> yourself<00:05:01.110> up<00:05:01.230> a<00:05:01.350> little<00:05:01.530> bit<00:05:01.770> get<00:05:02.100> more

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
lift yourself up a little bit get more

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.659 
lift yourself up a little bit get more
be<00:05:02.820> more<00:05:03.090> pressure<00:05:03.360> put<00:05:03.980> only<00:05:04.980> one<00:05:05.190> leg<00:05:05.400> on

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
be more pressure put only one leg on

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.300 
be more pressure put only one leg on
here<00:05:06.030> same<00:05:06.630> idea<00:05:06.990> where<00:05:07.740> we're<00:05:07.950> going<00:05:08.070> to<00:05:08.160> get

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
here same idea where we're going to get

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.700 
here same idea where we're going to get
from<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.700> VMO<00:05:09.210> all<00:05:09.480> the<00:05:09.720> way<00:05:09.840> up<00:05:09.990> towards<00:05:10.620> the

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
from the VMO all the way up towards the

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.850 
from the VMO all the way up towards the
pelvis<00:05:10.919> on<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.730> a<00:05:11.760> doctor<00:05:12.270> okay<00:05:12.720> once<00:05:13.680> we've

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
pelvis on that a doctor okay once we've

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.000 
pelvis on that a doctor okay once we've
hit<00:05:14.040> that<00:05:14.070> you<00:05:15.030> can<00:05:15.210> come<00:05:15.360> over<00:05:15.540> and<00:05:16.500> hit<00:05:16.980> all

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
hit that you can come over and hit all

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.460 
hit that you can come over and hit all
the<00:05:17.280> quads<00:05:17.580> alright<00:05:18.330> so<00:05:18.510> again<00:05:18.660> we<00:05:18.900> want<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.169> go

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
the quads alright so again we want to go

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.130 
the quads alright so again we want to go
from<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:20.430> lateral<00:05:20.880> aspect<00:05:21.060> basically<00:05:21.900> where

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
from the lateral aspect basically where

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.650 
from the lateral aspect basically where
that<00:05:22.350> folds<00:05:22.770> into<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:23.040> IT<00:05:23.250> band<00:05:23.640> all<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.540> way

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
that folds into the IT band all the way

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.300 
that folds into the IT band all the way
back<00:05:24.840> around<00:05:25.110> towards<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.560> center<00:05:25.890> so<00:05:26.010> I<00:05:26.100> like

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
back around towards the center so I like

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.700 
back around towards the center so I like
to<00:05:26.430> start<00:05:26.640> on<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:26.880> side<00:05:27.120> it<00:05:27.930> says<00:05:28.110> typically

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
to start on the side it says typically

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.110 
to start on the side it says typically
where<00:05:28.979> you're<00:05:29.190> going<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.400> get<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.910> most

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
where you're going to get the most

discomfort if you're like me it feels

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.130 
discomfort if you're like me it feels
like<00:05:32.430> there's<00:05:32.729> a<00:05:32.790> bag<00:05:33.060> of<00:05:33.240> marbles<00:05:33.479> right<00:05:33.900> here

then finally shift back to the midline
okay<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:43.860> course<00:05:44.070> you<00:05:44.250> can<00:05:45.020> do<00:05:46.020> one<00:05:46.229> or<00:05:46.260> two

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
okay and of course you can do one or two

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.159 
okay and of course you can do one or two
passes<00:05:46.880> shift<00:05:47.880> and<00:05:48.210> just<00:05:48.510> keep<00:05:48.690> going<00:05:49.020> back

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169

passes shift and just keep going back
and<00:05:49.200> forth<00:05:49.440> alright<00:05:50.100> so<00:05:51.200> for<00:05:52.200> me<00:05:52.380> that's

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
and forth alright so for me that's

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.440 
and forth alright so for me that's
typically<00:05:53.010> the<00:05:53.130> complete<00:05:53.580> series<00:05:53.970> that's<00:05:54.210> all

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
typically the complete series that's all

typically the complete series that's all
I<00:05:54.479> need<00:05:54.840> that's<00:05:55.020> all<00:05:55.260> most<00:05:55.530> of<00:05:55.590> my<00:05:55.710> lifters
