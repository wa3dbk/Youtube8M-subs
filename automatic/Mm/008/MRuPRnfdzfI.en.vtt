the<00:00:49.710> main<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:51.030> that's

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the main one that I have there that's

the main one that I have there that's
what<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.360> use<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.809> export<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.250> go

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
what I use for this export so if I go

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.520 
what I use for this export so if I go
into<00:00:53.550> rendered<00:00:53.969> view<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.750> looks<00:00:54.989> kind<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.379> what

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
into rendered view it looks kind of what

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.590 
into rendered view it looks kind of what
you<00:00:55.620> would<00:00:55.710> expect<00:00:56.090> note<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.360> already

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
you would expect note that I already

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.720 
you would expect note that I already
have<00:00:57.870> pre<00:00:58.199> upscale<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> textures<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
have pre upscale the textures but it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.720 
have pre upscale the textures but it
still<00:00:59.910> has<00:01:00.090> things<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:01.100> bad<00:01:02.100> interpolation

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
still has things like bad interpolation

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.710 
still has things like bad interpolation
modes<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.510> over<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.589> slow

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
modes we go over here but slow

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.210 
modes we go over here but slow
doo-doo-doo-doo<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.650> notice<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.130> like

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
doo-doo-doo-doo you notice I was like

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.620 
doo-doo-doo-doo you notice I was like
interpolation<00:01:09.000> which<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.299> typically<00:01:09.540> want

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
interpolation which you typically want

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.149 
interpolation which you typically want
to<00:01:09.750> turn<00:01:09.900> off<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.260> bit<00:01:10.409> mapping<00:01:10.740> off<00:01:10.860> things

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
to turn off and bit mapping off things

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.730 
to turn off and bit mapping off things
like<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> main<00:01:12.540> thing<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
like that but the main thing and this is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.410 
like that but the main thing and this is
what<00:01:14.010> most<00:01:14.250> people<00:01:14.430> will<00:01:14.760> realize<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.330> be

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
what most people will realize to be

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.060 
what most people will realize to be
switched<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:15.869> cycles<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:16.740> go<00:01:16.920> into

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
switched into cycles and then go into

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.130 
switched into cycles and then go into
rendered<00:01:17.369> view<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.119> materials<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.780> don't

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
rendered view the materials just don't

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.120 
rendered view the materials just don't
work<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.710> all

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
work at all

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.850 
work at all
so<00:01:20.900> with<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.110> click<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:23.070> button<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:24.320> will<00:01:25.320> press

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
so with a click of a button I will press

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.410 
so with a click of a button I will press
this<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.640> all<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.090> sudden<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
this and then all of a sudden the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020 
this and then all of a sudden the
materials<00:01:27.930> are<00:01:28.170> all<00:01:28.409> nice<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.400> working

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
materials are all nice and working

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.810 
materials are all nice and working
they're<00:01:30.390> great<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:31.020> beautiful<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.159> what<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
they're great it's beautiful so what the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.340 
they're great it's beautiful so what the
add-on<00:01:33.150> did<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.780> created<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.970> the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
add-on did is it created all of the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.780 
add-on did is it created all of the
material<00:01:37.350> nodes<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.250> each<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.700> these

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
material nodes for each of these

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.840 
material nodes for each of these
materials<00:01:39.329> specifically<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:41.520> add<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> little

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
materials specifically to add a little

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
materials specifically to add a little
bit<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.390> actually<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
bit of what I'm actually going to so you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.880 
bit of what I'm actually going to so you
can<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.710> things<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:45.750> they're<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.439> add<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
can see things that they're and add that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.760 
can see things that they're and add that
to<00:01:47.189> they're<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.909> adding<00:01:48.689> an<00:01:49.020> environment

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
to they're just adding an environment

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.850 
to they're just adding an environment
texture<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.649> works

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
texture so you can see that it works

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.819 
texture so you can see that it works
fine<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:54.000> does<00:01:54.149> things<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.689> knows<00:01:55.350> what

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
fine and it does things like knows what

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.380 
fine and it does things like knows what
should<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.250> emitting<00:01:56.790> light<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.240> what

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
should be emitting light and what

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.969 
should be emitting light and what
shouldn't<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.750> emitting<00:01:58.049> light<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.680> for

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
shouldn't be emitting light so for

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.020 
shouldn't be emitting light so for
example<00:02:00.860> this<00:02:01.860> guy<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.610> emitting<00:02:03.000> light

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
example this guy here is emitting light

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.020 
example this guy here is emitting light
as<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.600> see<00:02:03.840> onto<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.829> torch<00:02:05.369> here<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
as you can see onto the torch here it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.960 
as you can see onto the torch here it
does<00:02:06.810> handle<00:02:07.340> transparency<00:02:08.340> correctly<00:02:08.759> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
does handle transparency correctly so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.029 
does handle transparency correctly so
you<00:02:09.030> notice<00:02:09.330> how<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.629> example<00:02:09.660> these<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.470> 2d

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
you notice how for example these are 2d

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.770 
you notice how for example these are 2d
planes<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:12.030> when<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.300> into<00:02:12.450> rendered

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
planes but when you go into rendered

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.760 
planes but when you go into rendered
view<00:02:13.020> with

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
view with

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.070 
view with
any<00:02:13.980> artifacts<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.180> see<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.870> looks

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
any artifacts you do see that it looks

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.720 
any artifacts you do see that it looks
like<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.680> solid<00:02:17.070> object<00:02:17.220> even<00:02:17.670> though

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
like it's a solid object even though

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.060 
like it's a solid object even though
it's<00:02:17.880> not<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> same<00:02:19.830> way<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
it's not really in the same way that

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.350 
it's not really in the same way that
minecraft<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> game<00:02:20.820> does<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.210> in

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
minecraft in the game does it in

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.560 
minecraft in the game does it in
addition<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.410> things<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.340> glass<00:02:24.180> or

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
addition to that things like glass or

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.560 
addition to that things like glass or
iron<00:02:25.230> bars<00:02:25.680> as<00:02:25.980> there<00:02:26.130> down<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:26.340> are<00:02:26.880> set<00:02:27.480> up

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
iron bars as there down here are set up

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.720 
iron bars as there down here are set up
to<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.900> reflections<00:02:28.740> automatically<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:29.670> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
to have reflections automatically so you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.820 
to have reflections automatically so you
can<00:02:29.850> see<00:02:30.060> very<00:02:30.390> clear<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:30.900> reflecting

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
can see very clear that it's reflecting

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.710 
can see very clear that it's reflecting
this<00:02:32.070> object<00:02:32.340> which<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> missing

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
this object which I have a missing

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.740 
this object which I have a missing
texture<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.700> pink<00:02:35.700> as<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.210> displays<00:02:36.630> in

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
texture on in pink as it displays in

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.330 
texture on in pink as it displays in
cycles<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.290> see<00:02:37.530> being<00:02:37.710> reflected<00:02:38.220> in

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
cycles you can see being reflected in

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.700 
cycles you can see being reflected in
the<00:02:38.910> iron<00:02:39.300> bars<00:02:39.690> down<00:02:39.930> here<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:40.260> well<00:02:40.410> as<00:02:40.560> on

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
the iron bars down here as well as on

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.870 
the iron bars down here as well as on
the<00:02:40.890> glass<00:02:41.100> up<00:02:41.370> here<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.330> all<00:02:42.510> works<00:02:43.110> in

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
the glass up here so it all works in

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.970 
the glass up here so it all works in
addition<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.260> there<00:02:46.260> has<00:02:46.380> been<00:02:46.560> some<00:02:46.830> big

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
addition to that there has been some big

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.180 
addition to that there has been some big
updates<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.000> MC<00:02:48.330> prep<00:02:48.630> add-on<00:02:49.230> mesh

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
updates to the MC prep add-on mesh

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.070 
updates to the MC prep add-on mesh
swapping<00:02:50.670> capability<00:02:51.270> that's<00:02:51.450> done<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> little

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
swapping capability that's done a little

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.830 
swapping capability that's done a little
bit<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.470> backend<00:02:53.270> but<00:02:54.270> one<00:02:54.570> thing<00:02:54.720> you'll

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
bit in the backend but one thing you'll

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.050 
bit in the backend but one thing you'll
note<00:02:55.020> is<00:02:55.230> for<00:02:55.470> example<00:02:55.590> well<00:02:56.460> firstly<00:02:56.850> it

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
note is for example well firstly it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.270 
note is for example well firstly it
still<00:02:57.360> works<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.170> if<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.380> press<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.650> it's

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
still works so if I press that it's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.370 
still works so if I press that it's
imported<00:02:59.820> all<00:03:00.000> these<00:03:00.180> objects<00:03:00.660> for<00:03:01.020> me<00:03:01.170> so

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
imported all these objects for me so

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.290 
imported all these objects for me so
it's<00:03:01.530> instead<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.040> having<00:03:02.310> just<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.670> cube<00:03:03.270> you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
it's instead of having just a cube you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.590 
it's instead of having just a cube you
had<00:03:03.630> this<00:03:03.840> 3d<00:03:04.350> modeled<00:03:04.710> mesh<00:03:04.950> here<00:03:05.480> but<00:03:06.480> again

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
had this 3d modeled mesh here but again

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.730 
had this 3d modeled mesh here but again
those<00:03:07.560> materials<00:03:08.190> were<00:03:08.310> set<00:03:08.580> up<00:03:08.610> for<00:03:09.740> blender

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
those materials were set up for blender

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.230 
those materials were set up for blender
internal<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.430> when<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.610> go<00:03:11.730> into<00:03:11.850> render<00:03:12.090> mode

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
internal so when I go into render mode

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.230 
internal so when I go into render mode
here<00:03:12.570> oh<00:03:12.720> no<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.740> doesn't<00:03:14.100> look<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.880> same

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
here oh no it doesn't look like the same

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.360 
here oh no it doesn't look like the same
normal<00:03:15.420> materials<00:03:15.990> but<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:16.950> pretty<00:03:17.220> easy

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
normal materials but it's pretty easy

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.040 
normal materials but it's pretty easy
you<00:03:17.610> can<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:17.820> run<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:19.820> material

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
you can just run the material

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.430 
you can just run the material
preparation<00:03:22.050> again<00:03:22.890> on<00:03:23.130> Auld<00:03:23.760> message<00:03:24.440> so

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
preparation again on Auld message so

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.250 
preparation again on Auld message so
note<00:03:25.860> for<00:03:26.070> example<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.760> if<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.810> were<00:03:27.990> to<00:03:28.110> do

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
note for example that if I were to do

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.910 
note for example that if I were to do
this<00:03:28.290> now

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
this now

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.890 
this now
press<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.400> I've<00:03:29.580> selected<00:03:29.760> everything<00:03:30.180> then

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
press it I've selected everything then

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.440

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
go into render view yes this object here

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.330 
go into render view yes this object here
looks<00:03:33.810> fine<00:03:34.110> but<00:03:34.410> then<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.650> torch<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.100> still

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
looks fine but then the torch is still

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
looks fine but then the torch is still
don't

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
don't

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.290 
don't
that<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:36.930> because<00:03:37.370> torches<00:03:38.370> are<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.610> group<00:03:38.940> so

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
that is because torches are a group so

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.540 
that is because torches are a group so
as<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.780> can<00:03:39.900> see<00:03:40.080> there's<00:03:40.410> animation<00:03:41.190> here

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
as you can see there's animation here

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.240 
as you can see there's animation here
I'm<00:03:42.240> just<00:03:42.870> playing<00:03:43.260> out<00:03:43.440> there's<00:03:43.740> a<00:03:43.800> particle

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
I'm just playing out there's a particle

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.560 
I'm just playing out there's a particle
system<00:03:44.370> part<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:44.880> group<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.240> well<00:03:45.420> as<00:03:45.480> the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
system part of this group as well as the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.560 
system part of this group as well as the
lamp<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:45.990> there<00:03:46.250> but<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.280> haven't<00:03:47.640> changed<00:03:48.330> the

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
there's an append layer for when you're

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.340 
there's an append layer for when you're
not<00:03:56.340> linking<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.360> groups<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.050> external

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
not linking the groups to the external

not linking the groups to the external
button<00:03:58.740> file<00:03:58.920> but<00:03:59.730> basically<00:04:00.030> all<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.540> means

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
button file but basically all it means

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.710 
button file but basically all it means
is<00:04:00.990> go<00:04:01.470> into<00:04:01.980> this<00:04:02.100> last<00:04:02.400> layer<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:03.270> see<00:04:03.300> that

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
is go into this last layer you see that

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.320 
is go into this last layer you see that
these<00:04:04.020> objects<00:04:04.470> are<00:04:04.590> all<00:04:04.910> have<00:04:05.910> been<00:04:06.030> added

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
these objects are all have been added

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.080 
these objects are all have been added
here<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:07.050> if<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.200> can<00:04:08.070> press<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:08.940> select

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
here so if I can press a to select

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.910 
here so if I can press a to select
everything<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.690> then<00:04:09.840> mesh<00:04:10.080> or<00:04:10.350> not<00:04:10.709> mesh

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
everything and then mesh or not mesh

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.490 
everything and then mesh or not mesh
drop<00:04:11.160> but<00:04:11.370> prep<00:04:11.820> those<00:04:12.090> materials<00:04:12.750> then<00:04:13.290> go

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
drop but prep those materials then go

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.199 
drop but prep those materials then go
back<00:04:13.770> into<00:04:13.980> here<00:04:14.370> you'll<00:04:14.850> see<00:04:15.060> that

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
back into here you'll see that

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.740 
back into here you'll see that
everything<00:04:15.630> looks<00:04:15.900> as<00:04:16.080> it<00:04:16.500> should<00:04:17.570> which<00:04:18.570> is

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
everything looks as it should which is

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.219 
everything looks as it should which is
fabulous<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:21.180> can<00:04:21.390> do<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.690> reverse<00:04:21.989> of

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
fabulous and I can do the reverse of

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.860 
fabulous and I can do the reverse of
course<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.770> can<00:04:22.979> go<00:04:23.160> back<00:04:23.490> into<00:04:23.760> blender<00:04:24.240> render

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
course I can go back into blender render

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.990 
course I can go back into blender render
if<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.470> were<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.620> render<00:04:25.740> now<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.550> basically

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
if I were to render now it basically

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.770 
if I were to render now it basically
wouldn't

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
wouldn't

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.650 
wouldn't

set up for blender internals render but

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.640 
set up for blender internals render but
if<00:04:33.000> I<00:04:33.150> select<00:04:33.720> both<00:04:33.780> layers<00:04:33.930> select

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
if I select both layers select

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.170 
if I select both layers select
everything<00:04:34.920> again<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.460> press<00:04:35.700> mesh<00:04:36.030> wrap

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.630 
everything again and press mesh wrap
again<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:36.750> auto<00:04:37.170> recognizes<00:04:37.830> which<00:04:38.070> rendering

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
again it auto recognizes which rendering

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.120 
again it auto recognizes which rendering
