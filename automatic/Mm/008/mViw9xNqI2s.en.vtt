together a long time I saw some footage
of<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.049> when<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.260> were<00:01:10.350> little<00:01:10.439> kids<00:01:10.740> skating

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189

of you when you were little kids skating
together<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:13.400> I<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:15.049> when<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> started

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
together and I think when you started

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.380 
together and I think when you started
together

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
together

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
together
realistically<00:01:18.390> did<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.070> mind

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
realistically did you have this in mind

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.100 
realistically did you have this in mind
did<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.580> think<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.119> could<00:01:21.330> get<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.840> point

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
did you think I could get to this point

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.490 
did you think I could get to this point
you're<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> first<00:01:22.650> team<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.159> North<00:01:23.310> America

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
you're the first team from North America

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.100 
you're the first team from North America
no<00:01:26.390> well<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.689> even<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.020> remember

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
no well we don't even really remember

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.660 
no well we don't even really remember
when<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.680> first<00:01:28.920> started<00:01:29.220> skating<00:01:29.430> together

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
when we first started skating together

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.999 
when we first started skating together
that's<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.150> young<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.570> were<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.680> were<00:01:31.799> so

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that's how young we were so it were so

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
that's how young we were so it were so
fortunate<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.790> were<00:01:33.090> able<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.720> grow<00:01:33.960> up

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
fortunate that we were able to grow up

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.950 
fortunate that we were able to grow up
together<00:01:34.700> did<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.240> mind<00:01:36.420> no<00:01:36.630> not

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
together did we have this in mind no not

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
together did we have this in mind no not
at<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.880> took<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.090> one

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
at all and I think we just took it one

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.999 
at all and I think we just took it one
year<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.509> time<00:01:39.540> after<00:01:40.049> every<00:01:40.500> season<00:01:40.710> our

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
year at a time after every season our

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.380 
year at a time after every season our
parents<00:01:41.340> would<00:01:41.460> sit<00:01:41.640> us<00:01:41.729> down<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.090> say<00:01:42.240> did

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
parents would sit us down and say did

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.789 
parents would sit us down and say did

you have fun do you want to do it again
I'm<00:01:44.009> gonna<00:01:44.100> say<00:01:44.310> sure<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:46.439> wasn't<00:01:46.770> until<00:01:46.890> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I'm gonna say sure so it wasn't until I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.569 
I'm gonna say sure so it wasn't until I
would<00:01:47.729> say<00:01:48.140> six<00:01:49.140> years<00:01:49.350> ago<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:50.250> that's

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
would say six years ago that that's

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.960 
would say six years ago that that's
really<00:01:51.860> set<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.340> thought<00:01:53.520> oh<00:01:53.729> maybe

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
really set in and we thought oh maybe

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.850 
really set in and we thought oh maybe
this<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.420> become<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.720> reality<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.290> maybe<00:01:55.740> we

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
this can become a reality and maybe we

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.010 
this can become a reality and maybe we
can<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.159> there<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.430> 2010<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.420> maybe<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
can be there in 2010 and and maybe that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.190 
can be there in 2010 and and maybe that
can<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.200> our<00:01:58.409> games<00:01:59.659> what<00:02:00.659> was<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.930> moment

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
can be our games what was the moment

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.679 
can be our games what was the moment

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
like well I'll ask it this way what was

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.539 
like well I'll ask it this way what was
the<00:02:03.840> best<00:02:04.079> moment<00:02:04.530> was<00:02:04.560> at<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> end<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the best moment was at the end of the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.230 
the best moment was at the end of the
program

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
program

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.419 
program
or<00:02:06.329> was<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.570> standing<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.560> hearing<00:02:08.459> Oh<00:02:08.550> Canada

or was it standing and hearing Oh Canada
I<00:02:09.459> don't<00:02:10.000> know<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.179> might<00:02:10.299> be<00:02:10.450> pretty<00:02:10.599> close

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
I don't know it might be pretty close

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.490 
I don't know it might be pretty close
tie<00:02:11.200> there<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:12.269> think<00:02:13.269> being<00:02:13.900> on<00:02:14.079> top<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.439> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
tie there I think being on top of the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.470 
tie there I think being on top of the
podium<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:15.219> was<00:02:15.340> my<00:02:15.489> favorite<00:02:15.879> so<00:02:16.030> far<00:02:16.060> because

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
podium it was my favorite so far because

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.390 
podium it was my favorite so far because
we<00:02:16.629> thought<00:02:16.840> about<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.109> moment<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:18.189> tough

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
we thought about that moment the tough

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.910 
we thought about that moment the tough
days<00:02:18.609> training<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:20.349> always<00:02:20.500> look<00:02:20.680> at<00:02:20.799> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
days training and we always look at the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.589 
days training and we always look at the
flag<00:02:21.159> and<00:02:21.489> just<00:02:21.670> think<00:02:21.939> you<00:02:22.090> know<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.209> can't

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
focused and even throughout the program

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.469 
focused and even throughout the program
we<00:04:20.979> are<00:04:21.009> thinking<00:04:21.340> one<00:04:21.579> step<00:04:21.609> at<00:04:21.940> a<00:04:22.000> time<00:04:22.030> and

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479

we are thinking one step at a time and
just<00:04:22.690> kind<00:04:23.199> of<00:04:23.289> ticking<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.770> elements<00:04:24.129> off<00:04:24.250> as

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
just kind of ticking the elements off as

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.520 
just kind of ticking the elements off as
