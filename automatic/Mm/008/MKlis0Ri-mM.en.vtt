any lower than 15 just because it's

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.230

move noise and this is just going to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.399 
move noise and this is just going to
make<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.889> a<00:02:49.980> little<00:02:50.159> more<00:02:50.280> um

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
make it a little more um

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.629 
make it a little more um
noise-cancelling<00:02:52.409> i<00:02:53.010> guess<00:02:53.189> and<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.519> if

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
noise-cancelling i guess and it's if

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.009 
noise-cancelling i guess and it's if
your<00:02:53.790> mic<00:02:53.939> is<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.150> very<00:02:54.419> good<00:02:54.480> it's<00:02:54.810> going<00:02:54.930> to

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
your mic is a very good it's going to

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.149 
your mic is a very good it's going to
make<00:02:55.139> it<00:02:55.260> sound<00:02:55.439> a<00:02:55.560> lot<00:02:55.680> better<00:02:55.739> than<00:02:56.129> it

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
make it sound a lot better than it

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.099 
make it sound a lot better than it
actually<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.639> so<00:02:57.299> that's<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.540> pretty<00:02:57.750> good<00:02:57.930> deal

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
actually is so that's a pretty good deal

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.559 
actually is so that's a pretty good deal
right<00:02:58.319> there<00:02:59.120> once<00:03:00.120> you're<00:03:00.269> done<00:03:00.359> with<00:03:00.419> that

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.229 
is the folder where you have all your
video<00:03:31.379> so<00:03:32.010> what<00:03:32.250> fraps<00:03:32.519> does<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.060> um

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
video so what fraps does is that um

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.659 
video so what fraps does is that um
since<00:03:33.690> video<00:03:34.169> files<00:03:34.530> are<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:34.859> large<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.340> splits

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
since video files are so large it splits

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.369 
since video files are so large it splits
it<00:03:35.790> up<00:03:35.879> into<00:03:36.120> multiple<00:03:36.329> files<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:37.109> so<00:03:37.290> you

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
it up into multiple files just so you

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.309 
it up into multiple files just so you
get<00:03:37.560> better<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.120> hit<00:03:39.449> bless<00:03:39.690> lag<00:03:39.959> when<00:03:40.199> I'm

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
get better so you hit bless lag when I'm

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.619 
get better so you hit bless lag when I'm
trying<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.709> watch<00:03:40.829> videos<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.479> so<00:03:42.479> you'll

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
have you should have a decent amount in

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.309 
have you should have a decent amount in
here<00:03:45.000> depending<00:03:45.389> on<00:03:45.510> how<00:03:45.629> long<00:03:45.810> your<00:03:45.959> veil<00:03:46.109> is

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
here depending on how long your veil is

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.469 
here depending on how long your veil is

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
and you'll have the video files and

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.939 
and you'll have the video files and
you'll<00:03:48.569> have<00:03:48.690> one<00:03:48.959> voice<00:03:49.169> file<00:03:49.530> which<00:03:49.829> is<00:03:49.859> a

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
you'll have one voice file which is a

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.819 
you'll have one voice file which is a
wab<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:51.810> now<00:03:51.959> we're<00:03:52.109> going<00:03:52.199> to<00:03:52.260> open<00:03:52.379> up<00:03:52.530> Sony

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829

of this and that's going to make your

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.460 
of this and that's going to make your
videos<00:05:15.330> look<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.570> lot<00:05:15.750> better<00:05:15.930> once<00:05:16.170> they<00:05:16.290> get

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
videos look a lot better once they get

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.810 
videos look a lot better once they get
on<00:05:16.530> YouTube<00:05:17.390> especially<00:05:18.390> when<00:05:18.480> they're<00:05:18.630> in<00:05:18.690> HD

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
on YouTube especially when they're in HD

so<00:05:20.820> now<00:05:21.090> our<00:05:21.360> let's<00:05:21.840> say<00:05:22.020> our<00:05:22.050> videos<00:05:22.470> on<00:05:22.710> I

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
so now our let's say our videos on I

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.520 
so now our let's say our videos on I
like<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.640> add<00:05:23.820> a<00:05:23.850> little<00:05:23.940> bit<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.290> fade<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:25.500> the

five is the lowest you're going to want
to<00:06:21.720> go<00:06:21.870> to<00:06:22.380> like<00:06:22.680> 15<00:06:23.130> and<00:06:23.370> the<00:06:24.150> higher<00:06:24.300> the

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
to go to like 15 and the higher the

higher<00:06:26.490> the<00:06:26.700> size<00:06:27.470> so<00:06:28.470> i<00:06:28.860> would<00:06:29.790> say<00:06:30.060> you

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
higher the size so i would say you
