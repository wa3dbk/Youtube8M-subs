00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
was like here we go

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.609 
was like here we go
extend<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.909> 300<00:01:18.540> obviously<00:01:19.439> key

extend it all out to 300 obviously key
in<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.740> attachment<00:01:20.130> camera<00:01:20.900> so<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.049> see

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
in that attachment camera so you can see

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.590 
in that attachment camera so you can see
the<00:01:22.409> difference<00:01:24.799> okay<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.880> right<00:01:27.180> side<00:01:27.420> we

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the difference okay the right side we

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
the difference okay the right side we
have<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.189> stabilizers<00:01:30.409> knots<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.740> step

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
have the stabilizers knots you know step

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.870 
have the stabilizers knots you know step
on<00:01:32.509> focusing<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.780> does<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.229> focuses

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
on focusing what it does is it focuses

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.550 
on focusing what it does is it focuses
or<00:01:35.880> helps<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> speed<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.600> focus<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.170> example

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
or helps to speed up focus for example

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.090 
or helps to speed up focus for example
if<00:01:38.520> you're<00:01:38.880> within<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.479> plate<00:01:39.930> seven<00:01:40.409> leaders

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
if you're within the plate seven leaders

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.210 
if you're within the plate seven leaders
to<00:01:41.460> infinity<00:01:42.200> let's<00:01:43.200> compare<00:01:43.470> two<00:01:43.740> point<00:01:44.040> five

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
to infinity let's compare two point five

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.149 
to infinity let's compare two point five
meters<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.930> those<00:01:46.110> are<00:01:46.380> close<00:01:46.560> up<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.500> want<00:01:49.740> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
meters so those are close up you want to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.520 
meters so those are close up you want to
switch<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> 0.7<00:01:51.479> meter<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.140> infinity

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
switch it to the 0.7 meter to infinity

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.219 
switch it to the 0.7 meter to infinity
lens<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:53.490> you're<00:01:53.610> farther<00:01:53.909> away<00:01:54.090> 2.5<00:01:54.960> meters

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
lens if you're farther away 2.5 meters

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.859 
lens if you're farther away 2.5 meters
or<00:01:55.350> father<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.740> want<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.420> switch<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.719> there

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
or father you want to switch to there

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.330 
or father you want to switch to there
and<00:01:58.170> what<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.320> does<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.710> helps<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.009> speed<00:01:59.189> up

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and what that does is helps to speed up

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
and what that does is helps to speed up
the<00:01:59.520> autofocus<00:02:00.060> process<00:02:00.600> because<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the autofocus process because it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.600 
the autofocus process because it
searches<00:02:01.530> within<00:02:01.770> certain<00:02:02.100> areas<00:02:04.189> next<00:02:05.189> in

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
searches within certain areas next in

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.670 
searches within certain areas next in
the<00:02:05.759> wardrobe<00:02:06.420> though<00:02:06.570> our<00:02:06.990> focus<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.590> manual

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the wardrobe though our focus and manual

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.960 
the wardrobe though our focus and manual
focus<00:02:07.890> obviously<00:02:09.080> then

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
focus obviously then

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.620 
focus obviously then
next<00:02:11.450> going<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.870> your<00:02:12.760> toward<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.880> left<00:02:14.090> is

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
next going to your toward the left is

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.650 
next going to your toward the left is
your<00:02:15.260> stepmother<00:02:15.470> on<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.130> off<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:17.360> if<00:02:17.540> you

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
your stepmother on and off and if you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.420 
your stepmother on and off and if you
turn<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.170> stabilizer<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:19.190> two

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
turn the stabilizer on you have two

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.920 
turn the stabilizer on you have two
different<00:02:19.580> loads<00:02:19.880> which<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.480> can<00:02:20.630> switch

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
different loads which you can switch

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.000 
different loads which you can switch
between<00:02:21.080> on<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:23.120> far<00:02:23.450> left<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:24.500> basically<00:02:24.830> you

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
between on the far left so basically you

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.220 
between on the far left so basically you
have<00:02:25.100> four<00:02:25.280> settings<00:02:25.610> off<00:02:25.850> but<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:26.990> have

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
have four settings off but you have

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.880 
have four settings off but you have
three<00:02:27.410> settings<00:02:27.650> off<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:29.210> water<00:02:29.840> on<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.500> so

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
three settings off on water on to so

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
beautiful I think and here's the front

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.680 
beautiful I think and here's the front
of<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.040> lens<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.570> slight<00:02:53.570> angle<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:56.510> very

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
of the lens a slight angle it's very

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.710 
of the lens a slight angle it's very
beautiful<00:02:57.220> pretty<00:02:58.220> well<00:02:58.400> made<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.880> wish<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.600> had

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
beautiful pretty well made I wish I had

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.780 
beautiful pretty well made I wish I had
one<00:03:01.960> here<00:03:02.960> is<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.530> one<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.860> which<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.250> would

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
one here is the one to which I would

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.120 
one here is the one to which I would
probably<00:03:05.000> not<00:03:05.480> use<00:03:05.750> at<00:03:06.290> all<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.620> hate<00:03:06.920> lens

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
probably not use at all I hate lens

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.490 
probably not use at all I hate lens
hoods<00:03:09.340> because<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.550> idea<00:03:10.820> behind<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:12.350> that

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
hoods because the idea behind it is that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.260 
hoods because the idea behind it is that
I<00:03:12.710> mean<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.370> lot<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.760> times<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.120> get

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
I mean just a lot of times you get

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.430 
I mean just a lot of times you get
reflective<00:03:15.340> planning<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.959> peripheral<00:03:17.959> what

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
reflective planning and peripheral what

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.680 
reflective planning and peripheral what
they<00:03:18.530> call<00:03:18.709> peripheral<00:03:19.690> peripheral

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
they call peripheral peripheral

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.500 
they call peripheral peripheral
illumination<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:22.490> the<00:03:22.700> idea<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.270> lens

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
illumination and the idea of the lens

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.740 
illumination and the idea of the lens
hood<00:03:23.780> is<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:24.370> not<00:03:25.370> London<00:03:25.580> that<00:03:25.880> why<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.390> stop

hood is to not London that why and stop

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.400 
hood is to not London that why and stop
the<00:03:26.900> peripheral<00:03:27.320> illumination<00:03:27.530> well<00:03:28.750> it's<00:03:29.750> I

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
the peripheral illumination well it's I

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.310 
the peripheral illumination well it's I
found<00:03:31.130> with<00:03:31.220> my<00:03:31.280> 22300<00:03:32.060> some<00:03:32.660> probably<00:03:33.140> can't
