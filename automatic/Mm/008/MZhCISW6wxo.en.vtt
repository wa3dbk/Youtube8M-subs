00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470 

so<00:00:00.870> welcome<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:02.190> new<00:00:02.480> consideration

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
so welcome to a new consideration

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.980 
so welcome to a new consideration
concerning<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.259> original<00:00:04.770> flam<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.839> the<00:00:06.839> now

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
concerning the original flam and the now

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.169 
concerning the original flam and the now
following<00:00:07.410> performance<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.280> interesting

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
following performance is interesting

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.280 
following performance is interesting
because<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:11.330> performance<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.750> original

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
because the performance of the original

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.180 
because the performance of the original
layer<00:00:15.139> was<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.289> consequence<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
layer was the consequence of the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.330 
layer was the consequence of the
performance<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.570> produce<00:00:18.869> three<00:00:19.680> sounds

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
performance is to produce three sounds

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.130 
performance is to produce three sounds
three<00:00:21.210> sounds<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:22.220> equal<00:00:23.220> time<00:00:23.810> well<00:00:24.810> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
three sounds with equal time well you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.759 
three sounds with equal time well you
but<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.849> also<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.630> reason<00:00:27.810> why<00:00:28.260> we

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
but this is also the reason why we

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.999 
but this is also the reason why we
obtain<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.580> irregular<00:00:30.210> rhythm<00:00:30.869> because<00:00:31.199> three

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
obtain a irregular rhythm because three

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.709 
obtain a irregular rhythm because three
is<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:33.059> odd<00:00:33.690> number<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.800> record<00:00:35.790> motions<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
is a odd number of record motions and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.720 
is a odd number of record motions and
now<00:00:37.640> I<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.469> considerations<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.590> remove<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
now I the considerations that remove the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.380 
now I the considerations that remove the
record<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.930> last<00:00:43.170> sound<00:00:44.010> saw<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.789> backward

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
record the last sound saw the backward

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
record the last sound saw the backward
motion<00:00:45.629> not<00:00:46.469> twice<00:00:47.039> as<00:00:47.370> fast<00:00:48.590> we<00:00:49.590> move<00:00:49.829> it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
motion not twice as fast we move it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.260 
motion not twice as fast we move it
twice<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.730> long<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.629> obtain<00:00:52.760> actually<00:00:53.760> three

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
twice as long we obtain actually three

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.680 
twice as long we obtain actually three
sounds<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.020> another<00:00:55.969> duration<00:00:56.969> another

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
sounds but another duration another

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.670 
sounds but another duration another
summit<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.559> duration<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.460> this<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.680> this

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
summit of duration and this is in this

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.759 
summit of duration and this is in this
case<00:01:01.920> its<00:01:02.430> variation<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.449> quarter<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.619> how

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
case its variation one a quarter so how

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.830 
case its variation one a quarter so how
it<00:01:04.920> sounds<00:01:05.430> how<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.640> functions<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.600> see

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
it sounds how it functions can we see

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:18.440 
it sounds how it functions can we see
now<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.130> lomo<00:01:08.790> performance<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> we

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
now in this lomo performance so we

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.620 
now in this lomo performance so we
obtain<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.080> regular<00:01:19.740> wisdom<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.790> our

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
obtain a regular wisdom because our

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.830 
obtain a regular wisdom because our
third<00:01:22.380> sound<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.460> twice<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.180> fast<00:01:24.390> our

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
third sound is not twice as fast our

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.210 
third sound is not twice as fast our
third<00:01:25.380> sound<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.420> such<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.689> long<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
third sound is such as long as the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.590 
third sound is such as long as the
summit<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.380> second<00:01:31.920> sound

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
summit of the first and the second sound

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.350 
summit of the first and the second sound
okay<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:34.020> play<00:01:34.259> actually<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> baby<00:01:35.610> scratch<00:01:36.090> or

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
okay we play actually a baby scratch or

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.480 
okay we play actually a baby scratch or
in<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.810> case<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.110> forward<00:01:37.710> backward<00:01:37.890> scratch

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
in this case a forward backward scratch

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.569 
in this case a forward backward scratch
and<00:01:38.729> recut<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.720> first<00:01:40.020> note<00:01:40.380> twice<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and recut it the first note twice and

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.910 
and recut it the first note twice and
then<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.090> move<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.540> back<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> start<00:01:43.710> point

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
then we move it back to the start point

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.190 
then we move it back to the start point
with<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> open<00:01:44.700> motion<00:01:45.060> once<00:01:45.750> again<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
with the open motion once again the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:56.120 
with the open motion once again the
performance<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.409> play<00:01:55.710> now

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
performance so and when you play now

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.139 
performance so and when you play now
this<00:01:56.670> performance<00:01:57.450> twice<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.079> fast<00:01:58.579> it<00:01:59.579> sounds

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
this performance twice as fast it sounds

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.190 
this performance twice as fast it sounds
like<00:02:00.210> this

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.919 

when<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.320> play<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.680> twice<00:02:07.280> as<00:02:07.700> fast<00:02:08.149> like<00:02:08.569> this

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
when you play it twice as fast like this

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.490 
when you play it twice as fast like this
it<00:02:09.289> sounds<00:02:09.709> like<00:02:09.739> this<00:02:13.360> it's<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:14.690> brushing

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
it sounds like this it's like brushing

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.150 
it sounds like this it's like brushing
through<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.340> sounds<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.090> sounds<00:02:17.200> really<00:02:18.200> fast

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
through the sounds it sounds really fast

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.470 
through the sounds it sounds really fast
when<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.730> play<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.209> more<00:02:20.840> faster<00:02:21.970> than<00:02:22.970> this

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
when you play it more faster than this

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.979 
when you play it more faster than this
performance<00:02:24.110> here<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:27.910> many<00:02:28.910> variations<00:02:29.540> are

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
performance here and many variations are

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.390 
performance here and many variations are
possible<00:02:30.220> by<00:02:31.220> playing<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:32.030> methodology<00:02:32.630> and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
possible by playing this methodology and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.370 
possible by playing this methodology and
yeah<00:02:34.400> really<00:02:34.850> simple<00:02:35.360> I<00:02:35.480> think<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.080> it's

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
yeah really simple I think but it's

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.220 
yeah really simple I think but it's
interesting<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:37.459> players<00:02:38.209> are<00:02:38.480> originally

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
interesting to players are originally

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.979 
interesting to players are originally
are<00:02:39.350> now<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.980> another<00:02:40.640> type<00:02:41.299> of<00:02:41.330> radiation<00:02:43.989> so

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
are now in another type of radiation so

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.120 
are now in another type of radiation so
to<00:02:45.049> understand<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.459> difference<00:02:47.060> between<00:02:47.299> the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
to understand the difference between the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.559 
to understand the difference between the
normally<00:02:49.130> practical<00:02:49.730> conversion<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.360> the

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
normally practical conversion of the

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.960 
normally practical conversion of the
original<00:02:51.019> flyer<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.950> new<00:02:52.220> variation

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
original flyer and the new variation

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.729 
original flyer and the new variation
let's<00:02:53.660> have<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.840> look<00:02:54.080> at<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.500> original

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
let's have a look at the original

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.340 
let's have a look at the original
pattern<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.670> original<00:02:56.150> flyer<00:02:56.390> goes<00:02:57.110> like

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
pattern of the original flyer goes like

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.370 
pattern of the original flyer goes like
this<00:02:57.530> year<00:03:00.100> yeah<00:03:01.100> this<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.400> clear<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.940> think<00:03:02.380> Tin

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
this year yeah this is clear I think Tin

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.559 
this year yeah this is clear I think Tin
Tin<00:03:03.560> Tin<00:03:03.799> Tin<00:03:04.010> Tin<00:03:04.250> Tin<00:03:04.459> Tin<00:03:04.700> Tin<00:03:04.910> Tin<00:03:05.120> Tin<00:03:05.360> Tin

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.400 
Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin Tin
Tin<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.290> every<00:03:06.709> sound<00:03:07.130> got<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:08.120> same<00:03:08.570> time

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
Tin so every sound got the same time

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.460 
Tin so every sound got the same time
were<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.730> same<00:03:11.209> duration<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.230> now<00:03:12.410> we

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
were you the same duration and now we

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:26.220 
were you the same duration and now we
see<00:03:12.650> our<00:03:13.220> new<00:03:13.790> variation<00:03:21.070> know<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.459> original

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.410 

ok<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:27.410> means<00:03:27.560> we<00:03:27.829> play<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.579> last<00:03:28.790> sound

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
ok that means we play the last sound

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.289 
ok that means we play the last sound
it's<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:30.109> new<00:03:30.290> variation<00:03:30.650> not<00:03:31.160> twice<00:03:31.730> as<00:03:32.030> fast

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
it's a new variation not twice as fast

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.979 
it's a new variation not twice as fast
we<00:03:33.079> play<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.560> such<00:03:34.190> as<00:03:34.400> long<00:03:34.670> as<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.510> summit<00:03:35.959> of

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
we play it such as long as the summit of

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.800 
we play it such as long as the summit of
the<00:03:36.320> first<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.859> the<00:03:37.070> second<00:03:37.489> sound<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.480> now<00:03:38.750> we

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
the first and the second sound so now we

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.630 
the first and the second sound so now we
came<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.470> practical<00:03:39.859> conversion<00:03:40.489> of<00:03:40.579> the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
came to the practical conversion of the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.090 
came to the practical conversion of the
variation<00:03:41.359> bones<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:41.780> means<00:03:41.989> we<00:03:42.680> play

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
variation bones it means we play

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.670 
variation bones it means we play
basically<00:03:43.850> a<00:03:44.150> forward<00:03:44.660> backward<00:03:44.810> motion<00:03:45.200> that

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
basically a forward backward motion that

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.509 
basically a forward backward motion that
means<00:03:45.920> we<00:03:46.100> let<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.370> record<00:03:46.670> player<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:51.519> then

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
means we let the record player and then

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.910 
means we let the record player and then
move<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:53.030> in<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.480> same<00:03:53.780> speed<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.380> duration

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
move it in the same speed and duration

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.390 
move it in the same speed and duration
back<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.489> start<00:03:55.819> point<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:57.049> um<00:03:57.400> the

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
back to the start point so um the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.210 
back to the start point so um the
crossfader<00:03:58.970> sequence<00:03:59.420> is<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:02.209> same<00:04:03.220> likes

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
crossfader sequence is the same likes

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.760 
crossfader sequence is the same likes
original<00:04:04.790> flare

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
original flare

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.010 
original flare
and<00:04:07.040> we<00:04:07.550> can<00:04:07.840> now<00:04:08.840> obtain<00:04:09.310> or<00:04:10.540> observe<00:04:11.540> the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
and we can now obtain or observe the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.560 
and we can now obtain or observe the
single<00:04:13.010> status<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.640> this<00:04:13.790> performance<00:04:14.420> that

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
single status of this performance that

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.260 
single status of this performance that
means<00:04:14.750> we<00:04:14.960> let<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.230> record<00:04:15.500> play<00:04:16.060> like<00:04:17.060> the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
means we let the record play like the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.150 
means we let the record play like the
original<00:04:17.840> pattern<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.709> we<00:04:19.220> close<00:04:19.610> the<00:04:19.790> fader

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
original pattern and we close the fader

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.620 
original pattern and we close the fader
after<00:04:22.160> this<00:04:22.280> we<00:04:22.520> play<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.730> transformer<00:04:23.390> click

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
after this we play a transformer click

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.850 
after this we play a transformer click
up<00:04:24.410> but<00:04:25.160> we<00:04:25.370> must<00:04:25.610> play<00:04:25.880> this<00:04:26.570> node<00:04:26.960> as<00:04:27.290> one

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
up but we must play this node as one

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.040 
up but we must play this node as one
this<00:04:28.370> is<00:04:28.490> important<00:04:29.000> now<00:04:29.210> we<00:04:29.270> move<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.750> record

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
this is important now we move the record

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.330 
this is important now we move the record
back<00:04:30.290> but<00:04:31.000> not<00:04:32.000> twice<00:04:32.360> as<00:04:32.750> fast<00:04:35.230> like<00:04:36.230> this<00:04:36.530> ok

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
back but not twice as fast like this ok

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.620 
back but not twice as fast like this ok
and<00:04:37.520> now<00:04:37.580> we<00:04:37.760> are<00:04:37.940> at<00:04:38.270> our<00:04:38.300> start<00:04:38.870> positioning

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.030 

and<00:04:44.630> this<00:04:44.900> is<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.140> performance<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:48.440> now<00:04:48.680> we<00:04:48.740> came

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
and this is a performance so now we came

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.400 
and this is a performance so now we came
to<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.340> reverse<00:04:49.730> pattern<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.450> this<00:04:51.170> is

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
to the reverse pattern and this is

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.280 
to the reverse pattern and this is
basically<00:04:52.010> symbolizing<00:04:52.810> removes<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.990> record

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
basically symbolizing removes the record

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.940 
basically symbolizing removes the record
back<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:55.420> cut<00:04:56.420> it<00:04:56.570> twice<00:04:57.140> for<00:04:57.590> us<00:04:57.710> by<00:04:57.890> the

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
back and cut it twice for us by the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.640 
back and cut it twice for us by the
closing<00:04:58.520> motion<00:04:58.880> engine<00:04:59.210> by<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.900> transformer

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
closing motion engine by the transformer

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.780 
closing motion engine by the transformer
click<00:05:00.890> like<00:05:01.250> this<00:05:01.460> year<00:05:02.920> to<00:05:03.920> produce<00:05:04.130> two

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
click like this year to produce two

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.360 
click like this year to produce two
sounds<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:05.480> then<00:05:05.810> we<00:05:06.440> let<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.800> record<00:05:07.100> play

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
sounds and then we let the record play

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.480 
sounds and then we let the record play
and<00:05:07.640> we<00:05:07.820> open<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.450> cross<00:05:08.720> fader<00:05:08.990> oh<00:05:10.450> ok<00:05:12.490> this

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
and we open the cross fader oh ok this

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.180 
and we open the cross fader oh ok this
is<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:14.300> variation<00:05:14.750> one<00:05:15.320> of<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.680> original

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
is the variation one of the original

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.390 
is the variation one of the original
flare<00:05:16.430> a<00:05:16.730> really<00:05:17.390> simple<00:05:18.250> consideration<00:05:19.250> I

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
flare a really simple consideration I

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.200 
flare a really simple consideration I
think<00:05:19.790> but<00:05:20.210> it<00:05:21.140> opens<00:05:22.240> some<00:05:23.240> possibilities<00:05:24.080> to

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
think but it opens some possibilities to

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:32.530 
think but it opens some possibilities to
em<00:05:26.590> create<00:05:27.590> new<00:05:28.040> patterns<00:05:28.540> ok<00:05:29.540> so<00:05:30.230> bye-bye
