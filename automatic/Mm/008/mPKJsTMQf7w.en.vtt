SONIA MANZANO: Hola!

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.850
I'm Sonia Manzano from Sesame
Street, and we are here in New

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.300
York City for the first time
ever open casting call for a

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.980

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.830
This is Carol-Lynn Parente,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.856
Street, and my boss.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.320
Carol-Lynn!

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.440
Why are you casting a
new Hispanic cast

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.070
member on Sesame Street?

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.820
CAROL-LYNN PARENTE: We know that
the Hispanic population

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.130
in the US is growing.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.330
And, as you well know, Sesame
Street is always modeled that

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.850
diversity from the
very beginning.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.100
SONIA MANZANO: Actors,
[SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.300
Now, if you didn't understand
what I said, you'll

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.060
never get the part.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.485
Rocio, [SPEAKING SPANISH]?

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:47.910

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.335

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:55.120
ROCIO GASLARZA:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.610
SONIA MANZANO: Well, she says
things are going really great,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.920
and a lot of the actors'
Spanish is fantastic.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.585
This is next phase of
the casting session.

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:07.130
These are called
the call backs.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.536

ACTRESS: [SINGING]

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:16.065
Until the ocean covers

00:01:16.065 --> 00:01:16.241
ELMO: [SINGING]

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:17.094

ACTRESS: [SINGING]

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:17.860

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.390
Street neighbor.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.760
I am standing here in front of
Stage J. Now behind those

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.090
doors is the iconic,
and well known, and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.785
beloved Sesame Street.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.790
So, we are here to meet the new
Sesame Street neighbor.

00:02:03.538 --> 00:02:04.920
ISMAEL CRUZ CORDOVA:
I'm so excited.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.210
Every child wants to get
to Sesame Street.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.620
And I will officially be
able to do that today.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.090
[LAUGHING]

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.570
This is so amazing.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.320
SONIA MANZANO: The character's
name is Armando.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.684
ISMAEL CRUZ CORDOVA:
It's my new street.

00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:21.934
It's my new home.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.620
SONIA MANZANO: And
I'd like you to

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.870
meet Ismael Cruz Cordova.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.225
ISMAEL CRUZ CORDOVA:
Hello there.

00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:35.460
CREW MEMBER: Is this the
first time you--

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.780
ISMAEL CRUZ CORDOVA: Yeah.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.360
CREW MEMBER: Oh, my God!

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.960
You're going to love this!

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.300
ISMAEL CRUZ CORDOVA: I know.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.690
Oh,my God!

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.166
CREW MEMBER: I remember the
first time I was here.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:41.190
SONIA MANZANO: How do you feel
about the character that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.700
you're going to play, Armando?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.860
ISMAEL CRUZ CORDOVA: I thought
I was going to have to play

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.080
this character and put up an
energy, or put up some kind of

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.900
facade to appeal.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.400
But they want you to be yourself
and just connect.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.830
And Armando really looks
a lot like me.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.046
[SINGING]

00:02:56.046 --> 00:03:00.398
That's not all, there's
even more.

00:03:00.398 --> 00:03:01.374
[SINGING IN SPANISH]

00:03:01.374 --> 00:03:01.536
[SINGING]

00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:04.302
Every chico, every chica spoke
a language that's the same.

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:05.875
Like the one they
speak in Spain.

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:08.160
There's people who speak Spanish
down in Mexico and

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.350
Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela,
Panama, Paraguay, and all

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.920
across the USA.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.830
We come from all around.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.665
We're not so different
from each other.

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:24.890
SONIA MANZANO: I'm so happy that
you're with us, and we're

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.415
going to have a great
44th season with our

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:28.700
new character, Armando.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.390
Adios.
