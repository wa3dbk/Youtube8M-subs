00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.400
 Hi guys, all good today but only for you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.499
 What is my recording day like? 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.360
 so I 'm alone at home then 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:16.259
 I enjoyed to record several videos to 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.060
 So you guys, I'm sorry if I make 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.529
 videos with the same face that same 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.000
 clothes and everything else 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.480
 well I'll show you here the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.859
 things and everything 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.830
 I'll start with the dressing table some 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.590
 things I used that I did this tutorial 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.690
 Makeup will then air for you 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.660
 at some point do not know if before that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.820
 video then good anyway here then ok 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.220
 this mess all the products that I 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.480
 I used it during the video that I here. 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.820
 I bought it is an area for the camera then 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.680
 here is the light so usually I 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.090
 I use this lamp when I record at night 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.510
 are the products that I used to record 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.270
 this video 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.730
 good people always ask me what camera 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 use to record and the camera I use 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.470
 This is where I can not give a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.030
 zoom for you to see better and this is 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.050
 camera that I use to record my 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.600
 videos 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.940
 so usually when I record at home 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.310
 this camera that I use and when I do 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.370
 videos and blogs for example I use the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.260
 My gopro then today I'm just going to show 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.880
 to it because I'm using it only but 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.830
 usually on goal 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.500
 then this one is my camera is the 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:45.120
 canon is 3 and ok 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.920
 besides that I use this so I hope you 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.870
 kill the curiosity 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.400
 well I recorded another video here 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.590
 so I separated the products from that 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.390
 mess complains tpas so this is it 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.549
 Now I'm going to show you how a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.210
 how I edit the videos with 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.129
 the program I use and everything else 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.360
 good people so now it's the part of the 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:14.220
 video editing and generally 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.130
 As you can see, I'm lying down. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.020
 because it's too bad because in my bed it's the 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.210
 most comfortable place that I have as 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.370
 it takes a little while to edit all the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.630
 videos so I always choose to stay 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.790
 lying here 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.320
 So I'll show you or 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.590
 equipment that I use to edit my 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:37.290
 videos and the program I use is also 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:42.240
 good the computer you use is dell's 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.920
 this one is simple but it does everything 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.840
 I want I love the computer does not 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.750
 I have the slightest desire to change 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.209
 good the editing program I use this 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.739
 This is the powerdirector everybody 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.730
 question is powerdirector 9.0 and I do not 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.560
 I'll show you how and why 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.709
 It's kind of complicated to use this program. 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.170
 Anyway, I'll show you to 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.970
 you a video only showing how I 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:15.750
 edit ok, that's it 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:21.650
 scenario that I just recorded my 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:26.549
 messy room the tripod 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:29.760
 so I hope you have liked 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.739
 of my day 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.470
 so when I'm recording and what 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:42.290
 I usually wear only a sweater 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.519
 more tidy up and a pair of 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.110
 sweatshirt or whatever is more comfortable 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.459
 for me 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.500
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.739
 liked the video 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.780
 if you want then some more video 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.549
 more detailed description of some subject 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.459
 Do you want to let me know? 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:06.019
