so<00:00:53.020> watch<00:00:53.170> what<00:00:53.379> happens<00:00:53.680> when<00:00:53.829> I<00:00:53.859> put<00:00:54.100> the

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
so watch what happens when I put the

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.520 
so watch what happens when I put the
battery<00:00:54.609> in<00:00:54.760> there's<00:00:55.449> no<00:00:55.600> input<00:00:56.079> signal

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
battery in there's no input signal

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.930 
battery in there's no input signal
hooked<00:00:56.710> up<00:00:56.859> to<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.100> right<00:00:57.129> now<00:00:57.250> but<00:00:57.520> I<00:00:57.609> got<00:00:57.789> this

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
hooked up to it right now but I got this

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.910 
hooked up to it right now but I got this
for<00:00:58.149> an<00:00:58.239> input<00:00:58.570> signal<00:00:58.719> here<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.710> hear<00:01:02.829> that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
for an input signal here you hear that

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.820 
for an input signal here you hear that
music<00:01:03.039> stops<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:05.320> I'm<00:01:05.410> gonna<00:01:05.500> go<00:01:05.590> get<00:01:05.710> an

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
music stops now I'm gonna go get an

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.469 
music stops now I'm gonna go get an
input<00:01:06.010> signal<00:01:06.370> and<00:01:06.670> show<00:01:06.820> you<00:01:06.880> something<00:01:07.300> cool

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
input signal and show you something cool

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
input signal and show you something cool
okay<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.560> my<00:01:10.650> input<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:11.189> gonna<00:01:11.340> use<00:01:11.520> my

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
okay so for my input I'm gonna use my

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.870 
okay so for my input I'm gonna use my
chaos<00:01:11.970> synth<00:01:12.479> then<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.780> built<00:01:13.020> right<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
chaos synth then I built right here and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.480 
chaos synth then I built right here and
we'll<00:01:14.880> go<00:01:14.970> ahead<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.240> flip<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> this

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
we'll go ahead and flip that on and this

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.810 
we'll go ahead and flip that on and this
is<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.350> converter<00:01:19.610> for<00:01:20.610> RCA<00:01:21.479> from

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
is the converter for RCA from

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.070 
is the converter for RCA from
quarter-inch<00:01:23.820> headphone<00:01:24.299> jack<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:24.869> just

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
quarter-inch headphone jack there just

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.289 
quarter-inch headphone jack there just
so<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.229> will<00:01:25.350> fit<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.649> my<00:01:25.830> jack<00:01:26.789> that<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.030> put<00:01:27.270> on

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
so it will fit in my jack that I put on

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.450 
so it will fit in my jack that I put on

it's going
I<00:01:45.190> mean<00:01:45.700> here<00:01:45.909> we<00:01:46.030> are<00:01:46.060> with<00:01:46.360> pirate<00:01:46.900> radio

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
I mean here we are with pirate radio

this<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:54.900> potentiometer<00:01:55.900> here<00:01:56.350> was<00:01:56.530> for

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
this is this potentiometer here was for

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.910 
this is this potentiometer here was for
the<00:01:56.740> attenuation<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:59.049> if<00:01:59.290> your<00:01:59.470> signals

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
the attenuation because if your signals

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.850 
the attenuation because if your signals
too<00:02:00.460> loud<00:02:00.759> or<00:02:01.090> whatever<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.690> got<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.990> adjust

it with this 500k potentiometer you can

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.990 
it with this 500k potentiometer you can
hear<00:02:06.520> it<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.850> changes<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.600> sound<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
hear it it changes the sound so you

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.540 
hear it it changes the sound so you
either<00:02:10.179> hear<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.450> or<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:10.660> don't<00:02:10.929> hurt<00:02:11.550> no
