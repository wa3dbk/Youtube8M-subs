we're<00:03:48.359> gonna<00:03:48.449> check<00:03:48.659> it<00:03:48.840> anyway<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.549> I<00:03:50.549> also

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
we're gonna check it anyway and I also

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.460 
we're gonna check it anyway and I also
doubt<00:03:51.090> he's<00:03:51.359> gonna<00:03:51.479> have<00:03:51.720> any<00:03:51.870> giant<00:03:52.139> bombs

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
doubt he's gonna have any giant bombs

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.649 
doubt he's gonna have any giant bombs
but<00:03:52.889> what<00:03:53.519> worries<00:03:53.760> me<00:03:53.879> is<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.209> there<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.629> one

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
but what worries me is that there is one

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.020 
but what worries me is that there is one
mortar<00:03:55.379> outside<00:03:55.979> and<00:03:56.250> one<00:03:56.609> more<00:03:56.790> time<00:03:56.819> behind

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
mortar outside and one more time behind

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.089 
mortar outside and one more time behind
the<00:03:57.269> wall<00:03:57.479> which<00:03:58.079> is<00:03:58.349> probably<00:03:58.650> going<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.919> kill

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
the wall which is probably going to kill

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.159 
the wall which is probably going to kill
some<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.400> my<00:03:59.609> troops<00:03:59.879> but<00:04:00.180> again<00:04:00.479> the<00:04:00.900> good

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
some of my troops but again the good

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.199 
some of my troops but again the good
thing<00:04:01.379> about<00:04:01.409> having<00:04:02.009> a<00:04:02.220> premature<00:04:02.729> tom<00:04:02.970> whole

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
thing about having a premature tom whole

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.539 
thing about having a premature tom whole
if<00:04:03.419> there<00:04:03.599> is<00:04:03.720> one<00:04:03.959> good<00:04:04.229> thing<00:04:04.259> is<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.680> as

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
if there is one good thing is that as

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.879 
if there is one good thing is that as
soon<00:04:05.729> as<00:04:05.879> you<00:04:05.970> get<00:04:06.120> maxed<00:04:06.449> out<00:04:06.569> troops<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:07.560> are

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
soon as you get maxed out troops you are

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.539 
soon as you get maxed out troops you are
absolutely<00:04:09.409> devastating<00:04:10.409> attacker<00:04:10.889> yeah<00:04:11.489> you

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
absolutely devastating attacker yeah you

absolutely devastating attacker yeah you
don't<00:04:11.909> need<00:04:11.939> any<00:04:12.030> skills<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:12.959> troops<00:04:13.199> will<00:04:13.409> do

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
don't need any skills the troops will do

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.809 
don't need any skills the troops will do
the<00:04:13.650> magic<00:04:13.799> for<00:04:14.129> you<00:04:14.220> I'm<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:14.489> kidding<00:04:14.790> guys

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
the magic for you I'm just kidding guys

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.270 
the magic for you I'm just kidding guys
you<00:04:15.599> still<00:04:15.810> need<00:04:15.930> some<00:04:16.109> skill<00:04:16.380> because<00:04:16.889> you

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
you still need some skill because you

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.069 
you still need some skill because you
don't<00:04:17.549> always<00:04:17.729> find<00:04:18.030> bases<00:04:18.479> like<00:04:18.630> this<00:04:18.840> one

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
don't always find bases like this one

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.529 
don't always find bases like this one
and<00:04:19.289> there's<00:04:19.530> ton<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.739> bases<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.400> are<00:04:20.579> better

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
and there's ton of bases that are better

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.350 
and there's ton of bases that are better
defenses<00:04:22.169> better<00:04:22.639> protection<00:04:23.639> for<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.120> loot

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
defenses better protection for the loot

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.029 
defenses better protection for the loot
and<00:04:24.570> therefore<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.229> need<00:04:25.380> some<00:04:25.620> skill<00:04:25.889> to

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
and therefore you need some skill to

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.790 
and therefore you need some skill to
attack<00:04:26.340> those<00:04:26.520> so<00:04:27.360> we<00:04:28.080> definitely<00:04:28.320> not<00:04:28.620> going

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
attack those so we definitely not going

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.740 
attack those so we definitely not going
to<00:04:28.860> take<00:04:29.009> this<00:04:29.220> one<00:04:29.280> in<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.699> middle<00:04:29.880> but<00:04:30.389> I

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
to take this one in the middle but I

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.170 
to take this one in the middle but I
think<00:04:31.590> every<00:04:31.979> everything<00:04:32.490> else<00:04:32.759> is<00:04:32.970> going<00:04:33.090> to

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
think every everything else is going to

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.730 
think every everything else is going to
be<00:04:33.300> good<00:04:33.449> so<00:04:33.779> I'm<00:04:34.020> going<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.200> draw<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.409> few<00:04:34.620> more

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
be good so I'm going to draw a few more

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.860 
be good so I'm going to draw a few more
barbarians<00:04:35.370> I'm<00:04:36.000> trying<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.389> be<00:04:36.510> conservative

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
barbarians I'm trying to be conservative

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.959 
barbarians I'm trying to be conservative
as<00:04:37.320> much<00:04:37.800> as<00:04:37.979> possible<00:04:38.159> and<00:04:38.580> also

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:38.969 
as much as possible and also

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.179 
as much as possible and also
so<00:04:39.659> I<00:04:39.689> could<00:04:39.899> save<00:04:40.049> my<00:04:40.199> troops<00:04:40.439> for<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:40.949> next

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:41.189 
so I could save my troops for the next

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:43.879 
so I could save my troops for the next
rate<00:04:41.399> and<00:04:41.699> speed<00:04:42.029> up<00:04:42.059> the<00:04:42.360> next<00:04:42.629> raid<00:04:43.199> as<00:04:43.469> much

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
rate and speed up the next raid as much

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.039 
rate and speed up the next raid as much
as<00:04:44.069> possible<00:04:44.249> so<00:04:45.239> what<00:04:45.419> i'm<00:04:45.509> doing<00:04:45.809> here<00:04:45.989> is

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:46.049 
as possible so what i'm doing here is

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:48.589 
as possible so what i'm doing here is
trying<00:04:46.289> to<00:04:46.469> trick<00:04:46.709> the<00:04:47.089> way<00:04:48.089> stauber<00:04:48.360> by

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
trying to trick the way stauber by

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.629 
trying to trick the way stauber by
dropping<00:04:48.989> few<00:04:49.139> barbarians<00:04:49.679> it's<00:04:50.279> kind<00:04:50.489> of<00:04:50.549> a

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
dropping few barbarians it's kind of a

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.489 
dropping few barbarians it's kind of a
meat<00:04:50.849> shield<00:04:50.879> and<00:04:51.449> i'm<00:04:51.599> using<00:04:51.839> my<00:04:51.869> archers<00:04:52.319> to

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:52.499 
meat shield and i'm using my archers to

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:54.559 
meat shield and i'm using my archers to
take<00:04:52.709> it<00:04:52.949> out<00:04:53.159> again<00:04:53.429> like<00:04:54.029> i<00:04:54.059> said<00:04:54.149> if<00:04:54.479> you

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
take it out again like i said if you

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.439 
take it out again like i said if you
guys<00:04:54.749> have<00:04:55.019> um<00:04:55.879> prematurely<00:04:56.879> upgraded<00:04:57.360> your

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
guys have um prematurely upgraded your

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.899 
guys have um prematurely upgraded your
town<00:04:57.749> hall<00:04:58.019> and<00:04:58.259> you're<00:04:59.249> trying<00:04:59.399> to<00:04:59.519> recover

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
town hall and you're trying to recover

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.429 
town hall and you're trying to recover
the<00:05:00.089> first<00:05:00.419> thing<00:05:00.629> that<00:05:00.659> you<00:05:00.959> should<00:05:00.989> be

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:01.439 
the first thing that you should be

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.089 
the first thing that you should be
invested<00:05:02.159> in<00:05:02.279> is<00:05:02.899> definitely<00:05:03.899> barbarians<00:05:04.889> and

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
invested in is definitely barbarians and

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.399 
invested in is definitely barbarians and
archers<00:05:05.249> get<00:05:05.699> them<00:05:05.819> to<00:05:05.939> level<00:05:06.179> 7<00:05:06.569> as<00:05:06.689> soon<00:05:07.139> as

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
archers get them to level 7 as soon as

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.339 
archers get them to level 7 as soon as
possible<00:05:08.249> that<00:05:08.849> will<00:05:08.969> be<00:05:09.089> the<00:05:09.119> trick<00:05:09.449> so<00:05:09.839> just

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
possible that will be the trick so just

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.069 
possible that will be the trick so just
like<00:05:10.499> that<00:05:10.529> we<00:05:10.709> got<00:05:11.009> one<00:05:11.219> star<00:05:11.659> we<00:05:12.659> still<00:05:12.929> have

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:13.079 
like that we got one star we still have

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.659 
like that we got one star we still have
some<00:05:13.229> loot<00:05:13.439> left<00:05:13.769> and<00:05:14.099> we're<00:05:14.339> going<00:05:14.459> to<00:05:14.519> try<00:05:14.639> to

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
some loot left and we're going to try to

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.789 
some loot left and we're going to try to
take<00:05:14.939> it<00:05:14.999> out<00:05:15.209> as<00:05:15.389> well<00:05:15.569> so<00:05:15.839> I'm<00:05:15.989> not<00:05:16.319> gonna<00:05:16.469> use

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:16.799 
take it out as well so I'm not gonna use

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:19.819 
take it out as well so I'm not gonna use
as<00:05:17.209> many<00:05:18.209> troops<00:05:18.659> because<00:05:18.989> like<00:05:19.259> I<00:05:19.379> said<00:05:19.439> there

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:19.829 
as many troops because like I said there

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:22.100 
as many troops because like I said there
