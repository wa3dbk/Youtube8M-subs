00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.000
 why do not you write it ? 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.019
 hello and welcome here 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.039
 the pink panther and we are in 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.890
 battlefield 4 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.320
 i have a few colleagues from ign 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.399
 invited and we do one now 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:40.699
 Idea bot race is for example the early 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:45.399
 boy or then we have the tobias plaz 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:49.250
 That's why I get stupid at domagk gaming 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.649
 and stupid gaming max then munich has 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.829
 to prepare the kavalier 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.829
 ladies and gents the mister nico delpy 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:07.600
 The poker clicks all overdrive him nicely 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.900
 also says somehow the sudheimer 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.660
 still the swatch group and then 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.400
 Of course, even two helpers left that 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.280
 is the burning wulff and nosferatu 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.050
 hello my and my little one now 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.940
 also unpack the elodie board and if 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.950
 We now look at the map then we 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.260
 shoot the nosferatu then see again 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.540
 me where we have to go to the left 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.600
 at the eyes test small lights red 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.940
 light up and everyone has to speak so to speak 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:43.600
 shortest way to get there 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:46.600
 hence eu debate on the squares 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 finished 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:05.210
 fight with bandages when your time 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:11.660
 then you can turn off the whole car 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:15.590
 the outside view was much better 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.130
 here were blocked in places 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.860
 Team are in the gate offered that he complained 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.260
 number five a bit so I go now 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.370
 in the wind switch 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.470
 the others have the better way 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.640
 chosen that is uncool about seven 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.640
 you have to drive bridge 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.860
 he probably has 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:47.480
 he probably just has it 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.739
 overloaded and so explodes so 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.750
 simple but damn where am I me 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:59.510
 I'm in second place who is in first place 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.980
 that friends are extremely fast 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.829
 somehow also have a better way 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.829
 chosen as we just the fucking 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:17.930
 yes you can also wind shadow the 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:22.880
 then throw me over there 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.530
 what's the point that you can make me hot 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.950
 but with the scream you are 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:33.920

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.579
 server you were sent by the 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.579
 actors 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.849
 I see that the target fell in front of the eyes 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.120
 my team last good i have 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.410

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.410
 can not be 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:17.079
 but not at the finish 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:19.570
 you are so and now we still do 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:28.150
 so here's who's fighting his 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:30.940

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.169
 is a team that is team falls exactly 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:52.180

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.039

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:45.880

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:51.070
 he escapes out how he got out I 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:55.479
