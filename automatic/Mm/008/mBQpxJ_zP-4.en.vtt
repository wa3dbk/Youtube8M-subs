00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
this this gives me a little preview of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.069 
this this gives me a little preview of
how<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> letter<00:01:42.060> will<00:01:42.270> merge<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:42.930> there

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
how the letter will merge and then there

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.660 
how the letter will merge and then there
here's<00:01:43.229> my<00:01:43.439> information<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> bottom<00:01:44.250> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
here's my information at the bottom and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.700 
here's my information at the bottom and
then<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> next<00:01:44.939> letter<00:01:45.390> starts<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:46.530> don't

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
then the next letter starts they don't

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.469 
then the next letter starts they don't
paginate<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.909> print<00:01:48.240> preview

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
paginate well in this print preview

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.260 
paginate well in this print preview
screen<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.229> don't<00:01:49.409> worry<00:01:49.619> about<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.270> my

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
screen but don't worry about that my

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.210 
screen but don't worry about that my
favorite<00:01:51.509> way<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.840> print<00:01:52.259> these<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.710> by

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
favorite way to print these is by

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.609 
favorite way to print these is by
actually<00:01:53.430> exporting<00:01:54.329> them<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> PDF<00:01:55.200> file

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
actually exporting them to a PDF file

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.160 
actually exporting them to a PDF file
the<00:01:56.549> reason<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.899> can

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the reason for this is because I can
