their<00:00:53.850> power<00:00:54.059> meter<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:55.050> following<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
their power meter and then following the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.709 
their power meter and then following the
race<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:56.219> retrieved<00:00:56.640> their<00:00:56.820> power<00:00:57.059> data<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
race we retrieved their power data and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.990 
race we retrieved their power data and
we're<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> analyze<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.879> if

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
we're going to analyze it and see if

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
their race panned out the way they

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.410 
their race panned out the way they
thought<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> would<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.250> nor<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:02.670> numbers<00:01:03.059> so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
thought it would they nor my numbers so

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.600 
thought it would they nor my numbers so
i<00:01:03.449> will<00:01:03.930> never<00:01:04.170> i<00:01:04.559> will<00:01:04.890> never<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.250> out<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
i will never i will never go out and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.710 
i will never i will never go out and
write<00:01:05.760> 400<00:01:06.210> watts<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:07.229> 100<00:01:07.710> UK<00:01:08.010> bike<00:01:08.220> rides

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
write 400 watts for 100 UK bike rides

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.179 
write 400 watts for 100 UK bike rides
because<00:01:09.720> i<00:01:09.960> know<00:01:10.020> i<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.770> finish

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
because i know i will not see the finish

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.120 
because i know i will not see the finish
so<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> approached<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.200> bit<00:01:13.380> faster<00:01:13.920> maybe

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
so so I approached it a bit faster maybe

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.760 
so so I approached it a bit faster maybe
two<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:15.509> catch<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> beginning<00:01:16.619> but

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
two to catch up in the beginning but

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.730 
two to catch up in the beginning but
never<00:01:17.100> go<00:01:17.340> over<00:01:17.610> my<00:01:17.759> my<00:01:18.390> numbers<00:01:18.810> hold<00:01:19.500> back

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
never go over my my numbers hold back

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
never go over my my numbers hold back
all<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.670> way<00:01:20.790> even<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> could<00:01:21.630> always

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
all the way even if you could always

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.230 
all the way even if you could always
push<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.409> more<00:01:22.619> hold<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.340> back<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.790> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
push a bit more hold it back it's it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.270 
push a bit more hold it back it's it
will<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.720> will<00:01:24.750> pay<00:01:25.049> back<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.830> positive<00:01:25.979> way

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
will it will pay back in a positive way

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
will it will pay back in a positive way
because<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.150> conserve<00:01:27.689> some<00:01:27.869> some<00:01:28.170> energy<00:01:28.470> I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
because you conserve some some energy I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.550 
because you conserve some some energy I
can<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.820> things<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.450> happen<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.900> marry<00:01:31.229> me

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
can see things that happen to marry me

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.929 
can see things that happen to marry me

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
his head what he was thinking was

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
his head what he was thinking was
experiencing<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:36.119> was<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.810> race

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.940 
experiencing what was going on the race
around<00:01:37.320> him<00:01:37.850> how<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> heat<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.450> fact

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
around him how the heat was in fact

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.130 
around him how the heat was in fact
I<00:01:39.979> can't<00:01:40.399> tell<00:01:40.670> as<00:01:40.909> much<00:01:41.149> a<00:01:41.180> power<00:01:41.539> meter<00:01:41.780> so

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
I can't tell as much a power meter so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.660 
I can't tell as much a power meter so
we're<00:01:42.380> going<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.619> just<00:01:42.860> kind<00:01:43.219> of<00:01:43.250> like<00:01:43.399> put<00:01:43.579> the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
we're going to just kind of like put the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.730 
we're going to just kind of like put the
two<00:01:43.820> together<00:01:43.939> when<00:01:44.780> i<00:01:44.810> came<00:01:45.049> up<00:01:45.200> with<00:01:45.320> water<00:01:45.590> I

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
two together when i came up with water I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.789 
two together when i came up with water I
was<00:01:46.009> with<00:01:46.219> Sebastian<00:01:46.850> keenly<00:01:47.299> with<00:01:47.780> with<00:01:48.590> um

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
was with Sebastian keenly with with um

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.770 
was with Sebastian keenly with with um
be<00:01:48.979> red<00:01:49.159> alert<00:01:49.369> I<00:01:49.670> had<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:49.969> plan<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.509> write

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
be red alert I had a plan to write

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.380 
be red alert I had a plan to write
constant<00:01:51.530> about<00:01:51.979> 300<00:01:52.549> ones<00:01:52.729> in<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.969> beginning

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
constant about 300 ones in the beginning

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.990 
constant about 300 ones in the beginning
and<00:01:53.539> then<00:01:53.719> after<00:01:54.649> movie<00:01:54.920> if<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.429> still<00:01:55.729> can<00:01:55.970> i

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
and then after movie if I still can i

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.389 
and then after movie if I still can i
write<00:01:56.420> 310<00:01:56.960> then<00:01:57.319> there<00:01:57.500> are<00:01:57.530> tactics<00:01:58.039> as<00:01:58.220> well

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
write 310 then there are tactics as well

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.330 
write 310 then there are tactics as well
so<00:01:59.179> i<00:01:59.210> thought<00:01:59.569> if<00:01:59.990> i<00:02:00.229> have<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.590> group<00:02:00.860> like<00:02:01.100> this

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
spikes that you see early on when the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.990 
spikes that you see early on when the
gaps<00:03:55.230> open<00:03:55.590> up<00:03:55.740> and<00:03:56.010> you've<00:03:56.160> got<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.460> really

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
gaps open up and you've got to really

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.700 
gaps open up and you've got to really
make<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.480> up<00:03:57.570> quick<00:03:57.840> or<00:03:58.080> otherwise<00:03:58.380> guys

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
make it up quick or otherwise guys

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.650 
make it up quick or otherwise guys
jumped<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.610> then<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.880> end<00:04:00.030> up<00:04:00.150> at<00:04:00.630> the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
jumped in and then you end up at the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.360 
jumped in and then you end up at the
back<00:04:00.960> of<00:04:00.990> that<00:04:01.230> train<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.830> just<00:04:02.040> gets<00:04:02.190> harder

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
back of that train and just gets harder

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.690 
back of that train and just gets harder
and<00:04:02.670> harder<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:04.470> was<00:04:04.860> just<00:04:04.890> trying<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.370> spot

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
and harder so I was just trying to spot

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.240 
and harder so I was just trying to spot
when<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.420> could<00:04:06.840> make<00:04:07.080> a<00:04:07.110> move<00:04:07.410> past<00:04:07.710> one<00:04:07.950> or<00:04:08.070> two

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
when I could make a move past one or two

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.580 
when I could make a move past one or two
guys<00:04:08.490> into<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.540> gap<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:09.960> I've<00:04:10.050> been<00:04:10.230> hit<00:04:10.410> back

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
guys into that gap so I've been hit back

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.380 
guys into that gap so I've been hit back
down<00:04:10.800> towards<00:04:11.160> in<00:04:11.310> front<00:04:11.550> but<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.790> really<00:04:12.180> liked

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
down towards in front but I really liked

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.630 
down towards in front but I really liked
it<00:04:12.570> wants<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.870> pack<00:04:13.350> split<00:04:13.830> up<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.430> could

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
it wants the pack split up and I could

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.729 
it wants the pack split up and I could
just<00:04:14.820> kind<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.600> get<00:04:15.810> out<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:16.080> front<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.560> get

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
just kind of get out in front and get

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.440
