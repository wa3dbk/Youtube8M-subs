00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.410
 today visiting iva Driebergen and 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.840
 I see you immediately respond or name someone 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.430
 eva and and I think 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.900
 You must have done something about it 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.090
 certainly none on the right 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.560
 why did she ever choose that 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.689
 well i was looking for a fantastic good one 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.490
 training for the automotive sector and 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.689
 we didn't have a bell and that one 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.689
 we would have found in the Netherlands 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.339
 franc on the dear booth 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.899
 good morning why do you get up here 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.979
 the Brussels motor show 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.690
 why together at the 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.710
 we are actually already here 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.510
 years 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.519
 And that's because we have a large influx 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.500
 of students from Belgium too 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.760
 so we try as much as possible 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.460
 to introduce our students here 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.170
 deal with everything that goes on and around the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.119
 car industry a hand 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.619
 arriva is the business school for the 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.299
 car moses where they also elected the 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.569
 just ask yourself how are you 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:14.970

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.679
 project with the belgian students 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.080
 they can do a practical internship at 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.130
 the Brussels motor show in such a way that they 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.200
 actually what we do work and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.220
 get learning experience so as to actually be one 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.360
 apply subject matter in the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.310
 reality but post-it help with me 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.560
 white pants and now a nice hampshire and 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.099
 I immediately think of center hot 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.769
 when I say centro peer we think about it 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:42.810
 beach sun warm weather and of course one 

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:45.269
 Hood wants it I'm sure this 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.030
 the perfect car is further 

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:49.769
 no i am also going to die the industry 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.479
 not so good Waal should 

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:52.950
 people are still into it that like 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.679
 do not hail you train for 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.140
 unemployment happy and car industry 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.269
 goes a little less that is true 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.500
 And what you see is that companies are now 

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:02.390
 have to switch 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.709
 things have to change 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.539
 sales processes change the way they are dealt 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.060
 changes with the customer and we 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.700
 guide the student in that process 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.830
 look at our job bank now too 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.840
