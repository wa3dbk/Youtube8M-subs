 to be able to use the application of the 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.590
 I play the other of the sciences 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.299
 then the name of

 in science 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.809
 to be able to listen to the tutorial 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.780
 we will turn off the music that includes this 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.030
 page when starting or that science is 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.309
 You can see a small screen where the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.039

 mathematics the yellows of education 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.600
 physical

 question options 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.340
 this is the interesting data box 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.460
 and this is the leaf when your frog fell 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.170
 this sheet jumps to the next and can 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.630
 return to throw the player 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.370
 this is the swirl when the frog that 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.380
 there is here is absorbed by this swirl 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.140
 of water and it appears in the next 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.450
 swirling there are also traps in this 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.820
 game like this for example it seems 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.680
 be leaves over a hole if your frog 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.920
 what's in this hole will lose a turn 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.620
 this blue box shows the questions 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.989
 of social science in this may have 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.359
 questions about history countries like 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.270
 geography and this is the box for 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.330
 natural Sciences 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.850
 now let's learn to play to be able 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.830
 Move your frog from the box must 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.830
 roll the die click here 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.350
 Greetings and the frog jumps to the next 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.800
 box this question is about education 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.860
 physical and it appears with a question and the 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.350
 four possible answers in this case 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.420
 we will choose the first one when it is wrong 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.710
 question appears in red and stretches that 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.710
 it is well appears in green 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.330
 when you can not get the answer 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.430
 correct is returned to the same place in the 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.120
 that was and does not advance must return 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.120
 to throw the dice 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.379
 here the roulette appeared and the guy dropped 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.379
 of question you can answer 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.569
 there are also questions about relating 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.410
 the objects with the name relate the 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.570
 following conventional signs 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.900
 frequent on maps 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.940
 these are other types of questions and 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.620
 some extras that you should know if 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.139
 you want to play in X and a number 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.720
 different from players 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:34.040
 will appear a different option should be 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.610
 put a name to each type of player 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.610
 and a file 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.650
 and a turn drawing will appear this 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.210
 will indicate which student will start first 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.210
 this is done randomly 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.940
 the goal of the game is to bring the 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.070
 frog to his pond but this is not 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.990
 enough to be able to win the one that 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.600
 wins is the one that got the most 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.430
 of points this is obtained by each 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.760
 correct answer that was obtained in the 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.700
 path in this button can be observed 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.140
 the correct answers you had and 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.950
 according to the subject 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.140
 so go ahead and invite your teachers 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.480
 friends and companions to play the goose of 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.730
 the sciences and catch up to see who 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.160
 get to the pond first and get the 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.260
 more points this game is 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.220
