but for most bosses it's there as long

but for most bosses it's there as long
as<00:00:35.780> there<00:00:35.960> is<00:00:36.199> a<00:00:36.230> corner<00:00:36.710> in<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.010> room<00:00:37.250> as<00:00:37.519> long

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
as it's a pillar and out of rock you

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.770 
as it's a pillar and out of rock you
could<00:00:40.160> say<00:00:40.309> spot<00:00:40.609> the<00:00:40.760> monster<00:00:41.120> well<00:00:41.660> it's

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
could say spot the monster well it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.349 
could say spot the monster well it's
actually<00:00:41.899> not<00:00:42.260> as<00:00:42.500> simple<00:00:43.219> as<00:00:43.489> that

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
actually not as simple as that

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:45.880 
actually not as simple as that
but<00:00:44.539> I'll<00:00:44.750> go<00:00:44.960> into<00:00:45.199> explaining<00:00:45.559> it<00:00:45.739> more

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
but I'll go into explaining it more

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.700 
but I'll go into explaining it more
death<00:00:46.160> as<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.760> go<00:00:46.969> but<00:00:47.390> for<00:00:47.539> now<00:00:47.660> I'll<00:00:48.019> be<00:00:48.469> just

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
death as I go but for now I'll be just

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.860 
death as I go but for now I'll be just
sticking<00:00:48.949> to<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.429> desire<00:00:49.820> area<00:00:50.149> first<00:00:50.690> thing

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
sticking to the desire area first thing

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.380 
sticking to the desire area first thing
you<00:00:51.050> want<00:00:51.289> is<00:00:51.469> a<00:00:51.530> strong<00:00:51.920> melee<00:00:52.190> weapon<00:00:52.640> which

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
you want is a strong melee weapon which

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.239 
you want is a strong melee weapon which
by<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:53.600> way<00:00:53.660> this<00:00:53.899> only<00:00:54.079> works<00:00:54.379> with<00:00:54.469> melee<00:00:54.920> it

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:55.249 
by the way this only works with melee it

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:57.610 
by the way this only works with melee it
does<00:00:55.460> not<00:00:55.609> work<00:00:55.820> with<00:00:56.030> rage<00:00:56.300> or<00:00:56.629> mage<00:00:56.960> because

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
does not work with rage or mage because

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.889 
does not work with rage or mage because
it's<00:00:58.070> just<00:00:58.370> how<00:00:58.519> melee<00:00:59.149> hits<00:00:59.449> right<00:00:59.659> away

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
it's just how melee hits right away

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.919 
it's just how melee hits right away
whereas<00:01:00.469> rage<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:01.699> mage<00:01:01.969> is<00:01:02.269> a<00:01:02.300> projectile

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
whereas rage and mage is a projectile

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.390 
whereas rage and mage is a projectile
that<00:01:03.109> doesn't<00:01:03.409> hit<00:01:03.499> the<00:01:03.530> target<00:01:03.980> right<00:01:04.129> away

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
that doesn't hit the target right away

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.610 
that doesn't hit the target right away
so<00:01:05.059> here<00:01:05.300> I'm<00:01:05.449> using<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:05.780> route<00:01:06.050> which<00:01:06.260> sword

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
so here I'm using a route which sword

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.040 
so here I'm using a route which sword
because<00:01:07.160> I'm<00:01:07.460> only<00:01:07.670> 40<00:01:08.060> attack<00:01:08.360> it<00:01:08.600> has<00:01:08.870> the

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
because I'm only 40 attack it has the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.840 
because I'm only 40 attack it has the
highest<00:01:09.260> strength<00:01:09.680> bonus<00:01:10.190> that<00:01:10.370> I<00:01:10.610> have

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
highest strength bonus that I have

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.990 
highest strength bonus that I have
access<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.360> at<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:12.290> point<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.160> it's<00:01:13.610> as<00:01:13.760> good

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
access to at this point so it's as good

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.610 
access to at this point so it's as good
as<00:01:14.120> it's<00:01:14.300> going<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.510> get<00:01:14.630> for<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.870> while<00:01:14.960> well

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
as it's going to get for a while well

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.980 
as it's going to get for a while well
until<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:16.250> get<00:01:16.730> either<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:17.000> granite<00:01:17.390> wall<00:01:17.510> or<00:01:17.930> a

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
until I get either a granite wall or a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.290 
until I get either a granite wall or a
dragon<00:01:18.590> but<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.100> once<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.400> have<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.640> good<00:01:20.030> as

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
dragon but so once you have a good as

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.360 
dragon but so once you have a good as
good<00:01:20.960> as<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.140> weapon<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:21.620> can<00:01:21.770> get<00:01:21.950> find<00:01:22.280> a

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
good as a weapon you can get find a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.910 
good as a weapon you can get find a
monster<00:01:22.760> hit<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:23.870> I<00:01:24.350> would<00:01:24.710> suggest

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
monster hit it and I would suggest

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.160 
monster hit it and I would suggest
practicing<00:01:25.340> this<00:01:26.090> before<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:26.750> actually<00:01:26.870> do

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
practicing this before you actually do

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.010 
practicing this before you actually do
it<00:01:27.260> on<00:01:27.440> any<00:01:27.680> hard<00:01:28.190> bosses<00:01:28.450> but<00:01:29.450> once<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:29.900> have

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
it on any hard bosses but once you have

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.990 
it on any hard bosses but once you have
a<00:01:30.050> good<00:01:30.530> as<00:01:30.830> weapons<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.580> can't<00:01:31.790> fight<00:01:31.970> a

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
a good as weapons you can't fight a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.330 
a good as weapons you can't fight a
monster<00:01:32.150> hit<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.320> then<00:01:33.500> find<00:01:33.830> a<00:01:33.950> corner

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
monster hit it and then find a corner

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.480 
monster hit it and then find a corner
note<00:01:34.640> that<00:01:34.670> an<00:01:35.230> obstacle<00:01:36.230> like<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.280> have<00:01:37.370> to

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
note that an obstacle like you have to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.600 
note that an obstacle like you have to
move<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.940> like<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.780> corner<00:01:39.260> where<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:40.010> obstacle

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
move to like a corner where the obstacle

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.240 
move to like a corner where the obstacle
is<00:01:40.820> directly<00:01:41.300> north<00:01:41.720> or<00:01:42.050> south<00:01:42.620> of<00:01:42.830> you<00:01:43.010> it

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
is directly north or south of you it

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.520 
is directly north or south of you it
will<00:01:43.400> not<00:01:43.580> work<00:01:43.730> if<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.300> obstacle<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:45.020> like

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
will not work if the obstacle is like

your target is unable to attack you is

for<00:02:35.780> about<00:02:36.140> five<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.920> six<00:02:37.160> seconds<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.849> this

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
for about five to six seconds and this

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.449 
for about five to six seconds and this
is<00:02:38.510> why<00:02:38.660> getting<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.140> first<00:02:39.379> hit<00:02:39.650> in<00:02:39.860> box

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
is why getting the first hit in box

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.300 
is why getting the first hit in box
taking<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:41.230> essential<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.379> winning<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:43.099> is

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
taking is essential to winning this is

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.699 
taking is essential to winning this is
why<00:02:43.489> monsters<00:02:44.360> are<00:02:44.599> unable<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:44.959> attack<00:02:45.470> me

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
why monsters are unable to attack me

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:46.180 
why monsters are unable to attack me
right<00:02:45.739> away

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
right away

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.819 
right away
and<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.150> why<00:02:47.329> pretty<00:02:47.750> much<00:02:47.840> no<00:02:48.349> monster

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
and this is why pretty much no monster

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.740 
and this is why pretty much no monster
in<00:02:48.859> this<00:02:49.250> game<00:02:49.459> is<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.730> challenge<00:02:50.420> when<00:02:50.599> it's

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
in this game is a challenge when it's

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.369 
in this game is a challenge when it's
1v1

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
1v1

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.559 
1v1
unless<00:02:52.160> you're<00:02:52.519> fighting<00:02:52.940> fairly<00:02:53.329> the

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
unless you're fighting fairly the

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.710 
unless you're fighting fairly the
downside<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.440> this<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.730> lower<00:02:55.970> your<00:02:56.269> DPS

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
downside of this is you lower your DPS

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.390 
downside of this is you lower your DPS
because<00:02:57.019> you're<00:02:57.200> not<00:02:57.349> constantly<00:02:58.040> attacking

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
because you're not constantly attacking

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.849 
because you're not constantly attacking
your<00:02:58.640> opponent<00:02:59.090> but<00:02:59.629> you<00:03:00.049> stay<00:03:00.319> completely

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
your opponent but you stay completely

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.460 
your opponent but you stay completely
safe<00:03:01.579> so<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.299> kind<00:03:02.629> of<00:03:02.690> like<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:02.870> trade<00:03:03.170> up<00:03:03.290> if

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
safe so it's kind of like a trade up if

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.949 
safe so it's kind of like a trade up if
you<00:03:04.099> can't<00:03:04.489> find<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.790> one<00:03:04.970> on<00:03:05.060> one<00:03:05.090> then<00:03:05.629> you<00:03:05.810> can

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
you can't find a one on one then you can

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.750 
you can't find a one on one then you can
just<00:03:06.109> save<00:03:06.349> yourself<00:03:06.500> some<00:03:06.829> time<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.099> attack

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
just save yourself some time and attack

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.849 
just save yourself some time and attack
them<00:03:07.940> normally<00:03:08.269> but<00:03:08.840> if<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.379> need<00:03:09.650> to

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
them normally but if you need to

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.770 
them normally but if you need to
conserve<00:03:10.220> some<00:03:10.430> supplies<00:03:10.849> for<00:03:11.120> example<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.660> to

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
conserve some supplies for example in to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.780 
conserve some supplies for example in to
fight<00:03:11.989> caves<00:03:12.319> then<00:03:13.069> this<00:03:13.340> could<00:03:13.489> come<00:03:13.670> in

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
fight caves then this could come in

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.300 
fight caves then this could come in
handy<00:03:13.940> like<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.660> said<00:03:14.840> earlier<00:03:15.230> choose<00:03:16.099> your

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
handy like I said earlier choose your

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.190 
handy like I said earlier choose your
strongest<00:03:16.669> melee<00:03:16.910> weapon<00:03:17.060> with<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.989> highest

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
strongest melee weapon with the highest

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.650 
strongest melee weapon with the highest
strength<00:03:18.560> bonus<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.190> oh<00:03:19.760> this<00:03:20.090> by<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.329> way<00:03:20.450> it

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
strength bonus and oh this by the way it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.020 
strength bonus and oh this by the way it
works<00:03:20.959> with<00:03:21.169> special<00:03:21.560> attacks<00:03:21.889> but<00:03:22.549> since<00:03:22.910> I'm

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
works with special attacks but since I'm

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.520 
works with special attacks but since I'm
only<00:03:23.180> for<00:03:23.419> the<00:03:23.510> attack<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.930> cannot<00:03:24.139> demonstrate

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
only for the attack I cannot demonstrate

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.569 
only for the attack I cannot demonstrate

if I came to the early waves are mostly
melee<00:03:31.099> monsters<00:03:31.639> so<00:03:31.849> these<00:03:32.090> are<00:03:32.299> quite<00:03:32.480> simple

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
once they're lined up as they should be

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.180 
once they're lined up as they should be
just<00:04:43.850> flinch<00:04:44.180> them<00:04:44.449> as<00:04:44.630> you<00:04:45.110> would<00:04:45.289> now<00:04:45.949> here

just flinch them as you would now here
lies<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.610> second<00:04:47.060> problem<00:04:47.330> you'll<00:04:47.660> have<00:04:47.990> to

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
lies a second problem you'll have to

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.499 
lies a second problem you'll have to
deal<00:04:48.380> with<00:04:48.590> if<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:49.400> wave<00:04:49.550> has<00:04:49.789> a<00:04:50.000> ranger<00:04:50.479> or

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
deal with if the wave has a ranger or

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.450 
deal with if the wave has a ranger or
mage<00:04:51.020> in<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.470> you<00:04:51.620> have<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.860> position<00:04:52.039> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
mage in it you have to position the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.570 
mage in it you have to position the
monsters<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.449> that<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:54.080> range<00:04:54.380> or<00:04:54.680> mage<00:04:54.889> is<00:04:55.160> in

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
monsters so that the range or mage is in

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.400 
monsters so that the range or mage is in
front<00:04:55.910> of<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.210> so<00:04:56.449> that<00:04:56.600> you<00:04:56.750> can<00:04:56.900> hit<00:04:57.080> him

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
front of you so that you can hit him

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.189 
front of you so that you can hit him
first<00:04:57.800> if<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.699> range<00:04:58.970> or<00:04:59.180> mage<00:04:59.330> is<00:04:59.539> not<00:04:59.930> in

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
first if the range or mage is not in

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.170 
first if the range or mage is not in
front<00:05:00.410> of<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.710> they'll<00:05:01.310> be<00:05:01.460> able<00:05:01.699> to<00:05:01.910> get

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
front of you they'll be able to get

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.879 
front of you they'll be able to get
attack<00:05:02.510> off<00:05:02.720> on<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:03.110> each<00:05:03.289> time<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.680> try<00:05:03.830> to

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
attack off on you each time you try to

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.270 
attack off on you each time you try to
flinch<00:05:04.220> one<00:05:04.729> of<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:04.910> other<00:05:05.090> monsters<00:05:05.660> so<00:05:06.530> then

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
flinch one of the other monsters so then

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.770 
flinch one of the other monsters so then
to<00:05:07.580> solve<00:05:07.760> this<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.120> just<00:05:08.240> have<00:05:08.389> to<00:05:08.539> position

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
to solve this you just have to position

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.870 
to solve this you just have to position
it<00:05:09.080> so<00:05:09.110> that<00:05:09.289> the<00:05:09.620> range<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.979> mage<00:05:10.190> is<00:05:10.460> in<00:05:10.639> front

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
it so that the range of mage is in front

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.120 
it so that the range of mage is in front
of<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.330> it<00:05:12.260> could<00:05:12.440> be<00:05:12.620> kind<00:05:12.800> of<00:05:12.830> tricky

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
of you and it could be kind of tricky

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.339 
of you and it could be kind of tricky
but<00:05:13.490> once<00:05:13.850> you<00:05:14.120> know<00:05:14.479> what<00:05:14.690> to<00:05:14.720> look<00:05:14.960> for<00:05:15.229> it's

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
but once you know what to look for it's

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.550 
but once you know what to look for it's
easy<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.860> do<00:05:16.010> so<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.760> this<00:05:16.880> example<00:05:17.560> well

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
easy to do so in this example well

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.900 
easy to do so in this example well
actually<00:05:18.740> in<00:05:19.010> this<00:05:19.099> example<00:05:19.490> there<00:05:19.699> are<00:05:19.760> two

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
actually in this example there are two

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.990 
actually in this example there are two

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
Rangers one is kind of off map you can

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.540 
Rangers one is kind of off map you can
see<00:05:23.030> them<00:05:23.270> on<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.660> map<00:05:23.810> but<00:05:24.110> he's<00:05:24.410> ranging<00:05:25.400> me

the only way to fix flinching is if they

flinching<00:07:22.970> is<00:07:23.210> if<00:07:23.570> they<00:07:23.750> remove<00:07:24.110> it<00:07:24.289> from<00:07:24.380> the

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560
