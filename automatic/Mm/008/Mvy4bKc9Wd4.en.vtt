and they had a series of workshops that

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.870 
and they had a series of workshops that
led<00:00:14.700> up<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.849> one<00:00:15.299> which<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.880> electrical

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.210 
led up to one which was on electrical
energy<00:00:18.060> storage<00:00:18.660> where<00:00:19.020> they<00:00:19.170> identified<00:00:19.980> the
