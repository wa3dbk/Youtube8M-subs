00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.689
 and unity at that time complex where 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:03.620
 I could do jumpers in the water 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.620
 showed athletes a turn 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.319
 pockets of the city was forced to interrupt 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.790
 training athletes went 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.070
 one by one but now the situation 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.820
 turned 180 degrees and therefore us 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.799
 years you can envy sure 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.769
 Nikita Balashov 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.119
 Petersburg athletes artists 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.880
 singers whose level is possible 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.219
 make a great jump 

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.069
 swimming center on john read's street 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.140
 which was built in less than a year for 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.169
 doors december 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.369
 meets all international standards here 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.019
 hundreds can easily compete 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.019
 athletes before an audience of thousands 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.629
 viewers 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.460
 True Perm Petersburg such 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.740
 mass is not threatened 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.060
 didn't happen so easy to climb 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.940
 top of success 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.630
 Wright Phillips was instantly 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.440
 absolutely free began to download 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.220
 trivia silver medals the day before 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.570
 currently she was taking on one 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.570
 times a day 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.280
 16 year old Semen Pechkovsky 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.290
 rises to springboard getting ready 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.640
 jumps 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.940
 this victory from the first jump 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.250
 the fact is that in competitive 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340
 protocol his name is unique in his 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.129
 several age categories 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.860
 years of training almost 1 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.730
 his peers never waited for them 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.480
 favorite sport of our city will come out 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.480
 crisis among them by itself 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 not straining to calm 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.790
 while it is even better 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.320
 I will immediately say that here 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.680
 but so serious problems 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.750
 only elder junior 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.159
 younger age categories 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.150
 even 50 participants are recruited 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.540
 now when water jumpers are here 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.230
 all conditions for the class number 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.550
 athletes should increase 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.330
 surely the group she would become more 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.780
 Astana, more children grow 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.420
 what 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.140
 we don't take 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.860
 new trails and this one 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.670
 the result will be in five years from us 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.440
 there will be a long bench with us 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.180
 pay for a third person in a row 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.750
 and of course there will be completely different 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.760
 results 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.450
 the organizers call this tournament 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.120
 first present 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.990
 i.e. reduced normal conditions 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.380
 when an athlete and strive to show 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.179
 result 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.599
 they just get sown now power 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.239
 character tempered power 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:04.009
 there should be a form of championship medals 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.120
 country 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.720
 so in the opinion of the judge falls short 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.700
 the top ten of the strongest Russia 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.660
 true in such a swimming room 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.809
 difficult to tune in to the wave of victory 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.279
 Nikita Bobryshev Dmitriy Grishin 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:16.759
 Evgeny Gavrilov, the latter is 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:17.249
