a<00:00:23.730> finished<00:00:24.150> product<00:00:25.400> obviously<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.960> it's

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
a finished product obviously it's a it's

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.040 
a finished product obviously it's a it's
an<00:00:28.080> upscale<00:00:28.349> version<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.810> larger<00:00:30.810> scale

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
an upscale version of a larger scale

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.520 
an upscale version of a larger scale
version<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.740> weed<00:00:32.309> remote<00:00:33.030> control<00:00:33.530> so

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
version of a weed remote control so

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.590 
version of a weed remote control so
let's<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.280> put<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> camera<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.030> macro<00:00:36.390> mode

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
let's we put the camera in a macro mode

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.990 
let's we put the camera in a macro mode
and<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.200> take<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.579> better<00:00:38.579> look<00:00:38.670> at

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
and see if we can take a better look at

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.510 
and see if we can take a better look at
it<00:00:39.120> here

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.660

here are these these are LED lights

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.410 
here are these these are LED lights
these<00:00:56.239> are<00:00:56.420> embedded<00:00:56.840> into<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.140> wood<00:00:58.300> let<00:00:59.300> me

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
these are embedded into the wood let me

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.990 
these are embedded into the wood let me
show<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.020> other<00:01:00.230> side<00:01:00.559> here<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.520> this<00:01:01.699> is<00:01:01.879> the

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
show the other side here so this is the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.100 
show the other side here so this is the
electronics<00:01:02.960> right<00:01:03.770> here<00:01:04.040> have<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.570> mp3<00:01:05.570> player

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
electronics right here have a mp3 player

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.760 
electronics right here have a mp3 player
that<00:01:06.440> I<00:01:06.820> integrated<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.530> then<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.560> have<00:01:09.740> a

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
that I integrated and then I have a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.890 
that I integrated and then I have a
little<00:01:09.920> pig<00:01:10.190> microprocessor<00:01:11.150> that's<00:01:11.390> driving

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
little pig microprocessor that's driving

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.899 
little pig microprocessor that's driving
the<00:01:11.990> lights<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.619> I've<00:01:13.340> got<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.550> couple<00:01:13.790> of

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.740 
speakers there's a speaker underneath
the<00:01:16.750> mp3<00:01:17.750> player<00:01:18.520> right<00:01:19.520> there<00:01:19.550> so<00:01:20.119> let<00:01:20.659> me

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
the mp3 player right there so let me

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.770 
the mp3 player right there so let me
turn<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.710> switch<00:01:21.950> on<00:01:22.130> here<00:01:22.399> I<00:01:25.539> don't<00:01:26.539> know<00:01:26.690> if

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
turn the switch on here I don't know if

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.090 
turn the switch on here I don't know if
it's<00:01:26.869> still<00:01:27.050> in<00:01:27.080> focus<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.649> got<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:27.920> camera

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
it's still in focus I got the camera

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.260 
it's still in focus I got the camera
macro<00:01:28.670> mode

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.910 

I<00:01:33.359> could<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:33.960> put<00:01:34.109> the<00:01:34.200> switch<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> little

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I could have put the switch for a little

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.240 
I could have put the switch for a little
easier

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
easier

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:49.520 
easier
there<00:01:36.790> we<00:01:36.910> go<00:01:38.940> don't<00:01:39.940> switch<00:01:40.240> on<00:01:40.420> here

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:05.230 

now<00:01:50.530> these<00:01:50.680> button<00:01:51.010> types<00:01:51.190> of<00:01:51.370> work

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.250 

and<00:02:06.240> go<00:02:06.359> back<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.750> play<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.080> pause

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and go back this is a play and pause

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.309 
and go back this is a play and pause
button<00:02:13.730> mp3<00:02:14.730> player<00:02:15.269> comes<00:02:15.569> on<00:02:15.720> at<00:02:15.900> maximum

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
button mp3 player comes on at maximum

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.430 
button mp3 player comes on at maximum
volume<00:02:16.500> already<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.780> that's<00:02:19.110> my<00:02:19.290> little

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
volume already and that's my little

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.259 
volume already and that's my little
light<00:02:19.680> sequence<00:02:20.129> there<00:02:20.340> for<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.760> blue<00:02:21.030> lights

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
light sequence there for the blue lights

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.000 
light sequence there for the blue lights
at<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.510> bottom<00:02:21.599> so<00:02:22.140> what<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.349> did<00:02:22.470> here<00:02:23.299> when<00:02:24.299> I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
at the bottom so what I did here when I

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.650 
at the bottom so what I did here when I
to<00:02:26.010> embed<00:02:26.310> these<00:02:26.489> things<00:02:26.760> into<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> wood

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
to embed these things into the wood

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.770 
to embed these things into the wood
basically<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.410> drilled<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.069> holes<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.870> used

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
basically I drilled out holes and used

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.460 
basically I drilled out holes and used
just<00:02:33.780> some<00:02:33.870> regular<00:02:34.700> hot<00:02:35.700> glue<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.209> hold<00:02:36.540> some

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
just some regular hot glue to hold some

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.589 
just some regular hot glue to hold some
LEDs<00:02:37.890> into<00:02:38.250> place<00:02:38.489> they<00:02:38.760> were<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.000> rectangle

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
LEDs into place they were the rectangle

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.930 
LEDs into place they were the rectangle
kind<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.049> had<00:02:40.230> them<00:02:40.319> stick<00:02:40.650> out<00:02:40.799> of<00:02:41.160> the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
kind and I had them stick out of the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.630 
kind and I had them stick out of the
surface<00:02:42.299> a<00:02:42.599> little<00:02:42.780> bit<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.220> then<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.250> filled

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
surface a little bit and then I filled

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.100 
surface a little bit and then I filled
the<00:02:44.819> rest<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.239> hole<00:02:45.420> with<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.690> wood<00:02:45.870> putty

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
the rest of the hole with the wood putty

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.050 
the rest of the hole with the wood putty
and<00:02:46.470> then<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.739> sanded<00:02:47.040> everything<00:02:47.579> down<00:02:47.790> and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
and then I sanded everything down and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.300 
and then I sanded everything down and
then<00:02:48.209> was<00:02:48.360> just<00:02:48.540> uh<00:02:48.680> very<00:02:49.680> careful<00:02:50.190> with

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
then was just uh very careful with

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.759 
then was just uh very careful with
painting<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.329> embeds<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.440> into<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
painting it so it embeds it into the

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.309 
painting it so it embeds it into the
wood<00:02:52.950> pretty<00:02:53.519> good<00:02:53.760> these<00:02:54.690> buttons<00:02:55.140> are<00:02:55.230> not

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
wood pretty good these buttons are not

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.370 
wood pretty good these buttons are not
real<00:02:55.620> these<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:57.030> emblems<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.930> stuff<00:02:58.170> these

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380

image of a Wii remote control and

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.410 
image of a Wii remote control and
created<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.069> decals<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.850> then<00:03:20.970> cut<00:03:21.209> those

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
anyway I got some holes right here

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.860 
anyway I got some holes right here
because<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.030> know<00:03:27.090> we're<00:03:27.359> gonna<00:03:27.450> probably<00:03:27.690> have

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
because I know we're gonna probably have

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.390 
because I know we're gonna probably have
to<00:03:28.019> add<00:03:28.139> a<00:03:28.170> little<00:03:28.410> their<00:03:28.590> weight<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.100> we'll<00:03:29.250> do

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
to add a little their weight so we'll do

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.150 
to add a little their weight so we'll do
that<00:03:29.430> at<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:29.940> weigh-in

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.970 

this<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:36.849> kind<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.780> embedded<00:03:38.170> her<00:03:38.470> but<00:03:38.769> this

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
this I kind of embedded her but this

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.369 
this I kind of embedded her but this
button<00:03:39.310> does<00:03:39.459> not<00:03:39.489> work<00:03:39.670> although<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.379> did

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
button does not work although I did

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
drill a countersink for that so anyway

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.119 
drill a countersink for that so anyway
but<00:03:46.780> these<00:03:47.050> are<00:03:47.200> only<00:03:47.230> these<00:03:47.620> are<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.890> three

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
that work and I've got them connected to

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
we'll see I don't know how fast this

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.660 
we'll see I don't know how fast this
thing<00:03:55.300> will<00:03:55.540> go<00:03:55.660> we'll<00:03:55.959> win<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.440> race<00:03:56.670> but
