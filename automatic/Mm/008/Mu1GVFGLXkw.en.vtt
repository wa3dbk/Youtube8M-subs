00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 Hi, how are you? I'm going to record one today. 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.719
 video on capillary hydration and a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.059
 Homemade recipe a very easy recipe 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.089
 and we'll need three 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.550
 ingredients that are easy to make 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.130
 as you can not have at home to be 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.949
 that you do not have but it's too much 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.859
 cheap banana water with 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.359
 sure everyone has an argan oil 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:34.170
 so then let's go in an ordinary car 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.719
 of crockery with the banana banana silver here 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.930
 inside but independent of abadÃ¡ may 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:45.149
 be any type of banana with the fork 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:52.219
 in five drops of argan oil more 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:58.020
 so in fact 14 g plastic to own 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:13.640
 thing of hair how to mix with 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:13.640
 banana that we made the smell 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.090
 the animal is down yes there are not a few 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.000
 and at the post office in sÃ£o gabriel 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.490
 I said that I would wait for 15 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.430
 minutes and I was supposed to understand you 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.950
 from part to water because of the slow 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.900
 Appointment people, it's all because 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.460
 there's a window behind me then 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.280
 It's super clear I think if I do not 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.259
 to get to see more or less is this the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.190
 First box I 'm going to wash this mine. 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.920
 hair 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.740
 the ground because you want it if you want 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.539
 use example day shampoo can use if you 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.800
 want to use the shampoo but it is for 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.340
 use I like to use a shampoo 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.200
 normal moisturizer but sonae and I will not 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.440
 down here and it's logical that it was 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.810
 look at the time you are James Arraes more 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.239
 No problem, let's go. 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.820
 if this occurred by one of the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.090
 Upstairs did not arrive Upside down not so 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.370
 This is the second step I'm going to smoke. 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.090
 With you, for you to see what I said. 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.400

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.910
 close a book because otherwise it will 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.980
 choosing the option of playing a tie that 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.980
 I can with water with gaza 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.350
 We love talking to a conditioner. 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.440
 the high 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.560
 the consolation of the bank that is a father was 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.960
 normal that I was knocked over with a 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:23.300
 cart with that even though there are sometimes 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:25.100
 control of beige tone and I loved it 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.330
 Look at the result as it was in my 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.250
 hair 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.870

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.170

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:58.100
 amino acid and fairly easy which is great 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:04.640
