00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.990 

like<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.260> said<00:00:52.320> adding<00:00:52.800> hair<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.010> both<00:00:53.309> sides<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
like I said adding hair to both sides of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
like I said adding hair to both sides of
the<00:00:54.270> braid<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:56.120> again<00:00:57.120> braiding<00:00:57.780> once<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the braid and again braiding once and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.410 
the braid and again braiding once and
when<00:00:59.160> you're<00:00:59.280> braiding<00:00:59.460> hair<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.090> layered

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
when you're braiding hair that's layered

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.750 
when you're braiding hair that's layered
you<00:01:00.570> want<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> brood<00:01:01.320> firmly<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.640> can

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you want to brood firmly because it can

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.740 
you want to brood firmly because it can
become<00:01:03.059> loose<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.359> slide<00:01:03.899> off

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.210 

so<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.230> see<00:01:10.410> I'm<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.800> repeating<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
so as you can see I'm just repeating the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.340 
so as you can see I'm just repeating the
same<00:01:11.340> process<00:01:11.640> adding<00:01:12.420> heritage<00:01:13.050> of<00:01:13.140> bread

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
same process adding heritage of bread

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.230 
same process adding heritage of bread
breeding<00:01:13.890> ones<00:01:14.100> adding<00:01:14.610> hair<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.090> braid

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
breeding ones adding hair to the braid

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.150 
breeding ones adding hair to the braid
of<00:01:15.450> braiding<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.920> just

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
of braiding on so I'm just

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:28.740 
of braiding on so I'm just
fast-forwarding<00:01:17.790> cuz<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.210> guys<00:01:18.360> noticed

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.090 

you<00:01:29.750> will<00:01:29.869> eventually<00:01:29.990> run<00:01:30.530> out<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.740> hair<00:01:31.070> to

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
you will eventually run out of hair to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.889 
you will eventually run out of hair to
add<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:31.729> once<00:01:31.909> you<00:01:32.060> reach<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:32.390> stage<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.840> can

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
add so once you reach this stage you can

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.719 
add so once you reach this stage you can
just<00:01:33.259> break<00:01:33.470> normally<00:01:36.189> and<00:01:37.189> I<00:01:37.250> with<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.460> little

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
just break normally and I with a little

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.660 
just break normally and I with a little
hair<00:01:37.909> tie<00:01:37.939> fasten<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.840> ends<00:01:39.490> now<00:01:40.490> I'm<00:01:40.549> going

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
to talk the braid to create a messy

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.469 
to talk the braid to create a messy
effect<00:01:42.680> because<00:01:43.070> I'm<00:01:43.310> not<00:01:43.850> really<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.180> fan<00:01:44.450> of

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
effect because I'm not really a fan of

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.300 
effect because I'm not really a fan of
meat<00:01:44.960> breeds<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.470> like<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.740> when<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.009> looks<00:01:46.159> all

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
because it's a lot easier by grabbing

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.630 
because it's a lot easier by grabbing
the<00:01:59.630> hair<00:01:59.899> above<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.409> ears<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.069> when<00:02:01.310> split
