00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.240
Chose an Amazon

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.820
If someone wants to have a talking parrot,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.160
staying in a good relations with the whole family,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.700
an amazon appears to be the right choice.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.840
Different species of amazons vary in sizes.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.240
On my right hand

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.860
you can see the Mealy Amazon,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.180
the biggest amazon available in trade.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.940
The second bird is the smallest amazon,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.400
called the White-fronted amazon.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.400
Despite a remarkable size difference,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.260
both these birds have very good imitating skills

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.040
and pleasant personalities.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.820
This parrot might look like

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.080
all other popular amazons,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.220
but it can be compared

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.880
to an ugly duckling,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.300
which will change into a beautiful swan.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.140
It is the Double Yellow-headed Amazon.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.840
It’s an amazing bird.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.280
It has outstanding imitating skills

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.800
and an exceptional look.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.440
Very soon in about a year,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.940
this parrot’s head and the neck

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.240
will turn golden-yellow

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.920
and it will get some blue and red spots

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.720
on the wings and the tail.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.260
The Double Yellow-headed Amazons

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.540
are extremely popular thanks to

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.140
their leading imitating skills

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.660
and a wonderful look and a character.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.700
But the bird sitting in the front of me now,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.340
the Yellow-fronted Amazon

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.440
has one major superiority

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.540
over to the Double Yellow-headed Amazon.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.160
It’s worth half the price.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.400
This amazon

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.600
perhaps even more frequently kept at homes,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.360
is a really nice companion bird.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.600
It accustoms easily.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.960
Its imitating skills are not as exceptional

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.580
as those of the Double Yellow-headed Amazon.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.260
But it’s still a very good imitator.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.540
When they are young

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.980
the Yellow-fronted and the Double Yellow-headed Amazon

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.340
are almost identical

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.580
and only a specialist can tell the difference.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.340
The Orange-winged Amazon

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.740
and the Blue-fronted Amazon

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.780
have a middling price compared to other exotic birds.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.520
It’s a favorable choice for someone

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.540
who wants to have a talking bird

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.640
which will not be too expensive.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.440
Both species

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.420
are quite easy to breed

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.600
and are more and more often bread

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.540
also in Poland.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.980
When it comes to character,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.720
it’s believed that the Blue-fronted Amazon

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.980
is easier to domesticate

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.740
and has slightly better imitating skills.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.360
[Hand-reared amazon babies]

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.460
[in the Parrot Shop in Warsaw, Poland]

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.420
If someone wants to have a domesticated

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.740
and very friendly talking parrot

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.700
and wants to avoid some problems which may appear

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.300
when keeping for instance the African Grey parrot,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.300
amazons are definitely the best choice.
