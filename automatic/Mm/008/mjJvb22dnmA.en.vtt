00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
comes inside now when we open the box we

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.950 
comes inside now when we open the box we
can<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> first<00:00:45.239> thing<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.719> see

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
need a dual link DVI to get that full

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.310 
need a dual link DVI to get that full
resolution<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:54.210> after<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.110> see

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
resolution now after that we can see

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.930 
resolution now after that we can see
that<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> power<00:00:56.250> supply<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that we have a power supply for the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.139 
that we have a power supply for the
monitor<00:00:57.620> now<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:58.770> thing<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> note<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.609> if

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
find tons of these power cables just

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.830 
find tons of these power cables just
lying<00:01:14.340> around<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.790> house<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.600> probably

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
lying around the house they probably

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
lying around the house they probably
cost<00:01:16.200> less<00:01:16.530> than<00:01:16.740> two<00:01:16.950> dollars<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.729> buy

we can take a look at the pedestal as
you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.110> see<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> pedestal<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.829> quite<00:01:35.130> small

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you can see the pedestal is quite small

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.490 
you can see the pedestal is quite small
on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> unit<00:01:36.270> even<00:01:36.869> though<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> monitor<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
monitor of course is LED backlit so it

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.630 
monitor of course is LED backlit so it
doesn't<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> standard<00:02:27.720> CFL<00:02:28.440> backlit<00:02:29.010> so

doesn't have a standard CFL backlit so

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.800 
doesn't have a standard CFL backlit so
it's<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.970> be<00:02:30.090> better<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.450> terms<00:02:30.660> of

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
it's going to be better in terms of

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.810 
it's going to be better in terms of
power<00:02:31.020> efficiency<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:32.070> going<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.520> give<00:02:32.700> you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
power efficiency it's going to give you

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.640

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
five to six hundred dollars they'd still

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.860 
five to six hundred dollars they'd still
be<00:03:32.340> much<00:03:32.580> better<00:03:32.820> than<00:03:32.970> most<00:03:33.300> things<00:03:33.660> out

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870
