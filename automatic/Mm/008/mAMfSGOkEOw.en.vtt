of five I did a six or eight sets here
of<00:01:22.470> three<00:01:23.090> trying<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.179> be<00:01:24.300> as<00:01:24.509> explosive<00:01:25.229> as

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
of three trying to be as explosive as

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.570 
of three trying to be as explosive as
possible<00:01:26.179> and<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:28.200> far<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.500> found<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.369> my

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
possible and so far I found in my

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.090 
possible and so far I found in my
explosive<00:01:30.300> movements<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.920> really

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
explosive movements that it really

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.889 
explosive movements that it really
carries<00:01:32.520> over<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.880> when<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.270> when<00:01:33.750> you're

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
carries over to when you when you're

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.380 
carries over to when you when you're
using<00:01:34.140> heavy<00:01:34.530> weight<00:01:34.800> later<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
using heavy weight later it's just so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.200 
using heavy weight later it's just so
much<00:01:36.450> easier<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.740> bottom<00:01:38.069> if<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.729> train

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
much easier at the bottom if you train

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.980 
much easier at the bottom if you train
moving<00:01:39.929> fast<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.090> give<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.750> find

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
moving fast so give it a go if you find

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410 
moving fast so give it a go if you find
some<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.259> your<00:01:43.440> heavy<00:01:43.679> lists<00:01:44.210> stolen<00:01:45.210> at<00:01:45.330> the

bottom<00:01:45.750> at<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:46.080> star<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.530> super

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
bottom at the star and this was super

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.080

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
realized my biceps are kind of small

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.550 
realized my biceps are kind of small
because<00:02:39.180> I've<00:02:40.180> never<00:02:40.240> really<00:02:40.780> tongue<00:02:41.020> barbell

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
because I've never really tongue barbell

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.500 
because I've never really tongue barbell
curls<00:02:41.920> before<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:44.260> was<00:02:44.440> 35<00:02:44.950> kilos<00:02:45.510> which

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
curls before so this was 35 kilos which

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.280 
curls before so this was 35 kilos which
is<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.350> know<00:02:48.070> 70<00:02:48.580> pounds<00:02:48.970> or<00:02:49.090> summat<00:02:49.390> 78<00:02:49.900> 80

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
is like I know 70 pounds or summat 78 80

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.700 
is like I know 70 pounds or summat 78 80
pounds<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.600> really<00:02:56.170> good<00:02:56.380> core

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
pounds and here is a really good core

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.650 
pounds and here is a really good core
exercise<00:02:57.430> barbell<00:02:58.270> ab<00:02:58.870> rollouts<00:02:59.790> i<00:03:00.790> found

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
exercise barbell ab rollouts i found

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.110 
exercise barbell ab rollouts i found
this<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.080> this<00:03:02.770> is<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:02.980> lot<00:03:03.280> better<00:03:03.430> than<00:03:03.760> using

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
this is this is a lot better than using

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.990 
this is this is a lot better than using
one<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.750> those<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:05.140> wheels<00:03:05.470> because<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.850> can

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
one of those have wheels because you can

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.170 
one of those have wheels because you can
gradually<00:03:07.390> add<00:03:07.660> weight<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.320> barbell<00:03:08.800> and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
gradually add weight to the barbell and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.060 
gradually add weight to the barbell and
it's<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.300> great<00:03:10.600> way<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.870> adding<00:03:11.110> resistance<00:03:11.380> on

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
it's a great way of adding resistance on

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.230 
it's a great way of adding resistance on
the<00:03:12.100> way<00:03:12.340> back<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:14.400> do<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> few<00:03:15.670> reps<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.090> ease

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
the way back you do a few reps of ease

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.750 
the way back you do a few reps of ease
and<00:03:16.270> you<00:03:16.540> really<00:03:16.840> feel<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.260> i<00:03:17.490> think<00:03:18.490> i<00:03:18.550> could

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
and you really feel it i think i could

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.870 
and you really feel it i think i could
do<00:03:18.910> like<00:03:19.090> 20<00:03:19.810> or<00:03:19.900> 30<00:03:20.200> reps<00:03:20.530> with<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.800> wheel<00:03:21.040> but

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
do like 20 or 30 reps with a wheel but

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.440 
do like 20 or 30 reps with a wheel but
add<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.450> few<00:03:22.720> kilos<00:03:23.340> pounds<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.610> bar<00:03:24.820> makes

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
add a few kilos pounds to the bar makes

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.640 
add a few kilos pounds to the bar makes
a<00:03:25.540> lot<00:03:25.750> harder<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:28.030> great<00:03:28.270> way<00:03:28.510> of

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
a lot harder and it's a great way of

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.880 
a lot harder and it's a great way of
actually<00:03:29.700> progressing<00:03:30.700> in<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:32.170> movement<00:03:32.470> to

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
actually progressing in this movement to

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.650 
actually progressing in this movement to
because<00:03:33.250> gets<00:03:33.580> kind<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:33.850> boring<00:03:33.910> just<00:03:34.390> doing

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
because gets kind of boring just doing

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.480 
because gets kind of boring just doing
more<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:34.870> more<00:03:35.140> reps<00:03:35.440> for<00:03:35.710> this<00:03:35.890> way<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.160> know

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
more and more reps for this way you know

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.780 
more and more reps for this way you know
you<00:03:36.520> just<00:03:36.880> had<00:03:37.090> at<00:03:37.900> kilos<00:03:38.440> each<00:03:38.680> work<00:03:38.920> on<00:03:39.190> it's

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
you just had at kilos each work on it's

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.720 
you just had at kilos each work on it's
a<00:03:39.880> good<00:03:40.060> way<00:03:40.210> of<00:03:40.240> measuring<00:03:40.660> progress<00:03:41.730> and

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
a good way of measuring progress and

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:54.230 
a good way of measuring progress and
keeping<00:03:43.210> motivation

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240
