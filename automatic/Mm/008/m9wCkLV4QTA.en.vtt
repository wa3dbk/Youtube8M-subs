 no 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.420
 first to see plans for some 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.109
 business of course a ahoy is ahoy is 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.869
 aos game they dove and so for the pc and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.890
 mac and everything and that just went smooth 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.210
 see the stage 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.150
 yes well yes they actually have it now 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.380
 made a first person shooter 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.869
 of course it was always a game 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.000
 from above is always will 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.420
 plants indeed and drop you 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.160
 garden protected against the zombies not so 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.230
 came to you but now you just go 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.579
 as a plant you will shoot with you 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.000
 tentacles 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.710
 sure it will be exciting man and around 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.450
 finally a title where i just got one 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
 have waited all the time and actually 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.289
 re just not really many of these 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.600
 title but in this case it is 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.879
 Clearly that stole war game or front 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.670
 comes back with the title a game that 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.960
 I was fucking on the playstation there at the time 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.579
 have played often 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.290
 I don't know if you can know this game 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.150
 I say nothing about it but in everyone 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.439
 case i found the weather case a whole 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.090
 great game I always have it with my 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.200
 brother for sale played 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.049
 it's just a game where you have one 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.939
 big mat actually in a vehicle then 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.170
 steps you can choose a class 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.090
 he is just going to fight against the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.750
 opponents to droid for example 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.890
 you're just you name it and yes the game 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.409
 coming back it was just a whole 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.670
 simple steps unfortunately but I am 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.970
 very curious to go there more 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 seeing who for speed rivals says something 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.740
 about 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.960
 yes game now pj yes i i i know free 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.460
 tell little about a series no but 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.130
 I think I always have fat 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.350
 played games played and witches graph 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.590
 my head a chain now multiple race 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.930
 Games to see the i3 ones 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.030
 crew what I found all Fat 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.710
 ubisoft he was your soft me now 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.420
 really thinking what wasn't wasted on it 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.310
 because it thea he was naturally also with 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.290
 not for speed do you have early too 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.579
 played at I may be curious than what 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.380
 do you think of this franchise 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.329
 I like the very cool franchise 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.070
 changes you very much can you know 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.720
 do you have police at the back sit here must 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.789
 your whole open world is just what is 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.200
 also saw with that kind of multiplayer whole 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.190
 good job you are especially bit one 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.660
 single player 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.270
 you have good videos single player 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.980
 played end comes on their way come 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.830
 a lot of old looked at it 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.570
 or race past and the thought of you go 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.580
 participates in that race and given up 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.590
 moment you are playing with this or one 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.820
 other players do it somewhere too 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.880
 and the joint also simply in a to b 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.160
 just go to this together that's the fat 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.180
 but yes I don't like it very much 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.130
 news don't bring anything 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.880
 has wasted let's continue 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.890
 erfolgen 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.989
 welcome to dragon age and zwergnase 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.930
 actually a game that i already have one 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.250
 all the time so come out the fourth 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.560
 not in interesting times 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.390
 I always felt that it just felt like it 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.530
 previous part time pressure and case of ordinary 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.330
 don't look like 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.920
 anyway the gameplay doesn't attract me enormously 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.709
 on and of course you did work 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.970
 springs and was frankly we give 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.930
 drink supplement when the game 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.780
 is announced with I have direction 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.140
 and then we came back and came 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.450
 ea sports here when the game jam you know 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.160
 I go I had nothing with it I went I went 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.170
 I have it that is so fat that I 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.140
 used to play a lot of fifa 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.100
 And yes it's the same thing those guys put on 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.870
 stage they 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.690
 or both I was there watching dancing 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.549
 every discussion and it was also one 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.170
 guest at who said yes in addition to four years 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.670
 I buy a new title because I think 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.190
 not worth every 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.110
 new languages ​​every year because then there is 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.120
 not so much change 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.350
 yes if you compare it to four 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.180
 years ago there is a disadvantage a lot 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.820
 have changed a lot now 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.190
 with been with the podo which stage 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.100
 very very lively is what more with it 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.079
 again this is how one would work there but well 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.459
 it is just a franchise it 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.100
 Diet sports games are just whole 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.630
 popular I mean call of duty but then 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.050
 you also just have fifa games that are green 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.880
 super popular 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.300
 and there are just so many people who 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.570
 still buy 3 of 2014 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.550
 call villa 2015 on and is just one 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.140
 very large audience but actually 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.700
 You can especially expect these to share 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.710
 just everything becomes a little nicer 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.390
 because yes that is the most you 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.710
 can change these games 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.690
 because changes so good they are also normal 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.570
 the players were wrap the computer 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.310
 Control the players who are slightly more unique 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.950
 it's all slightly better it goes 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.000
 all slightly nicer and yes every player 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.790
 surely has its own 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.910
 In the meantime had to be in the MSI chef 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.920
 who said yes god they had to see this on TV 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.210
 from parents real msi thing 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.100
 then you have now also in the game 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.270
 That is very far that she stayed that way 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.100
 have focused on that 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.380
 yes and we also didn't see the basketball 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.840
 according to me and bc and d 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.400
 h &amp; b is actually one of the best 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.710
 I like sports games once 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.540
 reviewed and 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.580
 oh i don't have much with athletes is real 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.650
 a game it is super well put together 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.020
 just they have their own here too 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.390
 especially that dribbling dribbling right yes 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.640
 yes you really need more good control 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.040
 on the couch because that is just what was missing 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.680
 there was also a baller in the previous games 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.419
 if they invite seem like one of them 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.350
 the better drippers in the nb on this 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.169
 moment 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.510
 yes that man is so used to it 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.460
 ball control sometimes nice so in your saw 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.080
 first saw on large screens 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.550
 You like him too in real life some 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.720
 very strange because that game developer 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.140
 standing next to him was another piece 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.970
 longer 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.820
 yes he also went to request it 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.890
 them who does themselves is to a meter 95 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.810
 that basketball player so that guy was something 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.490
 from 220 euros they were always to see 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.230
 say we if you also control the ball from 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.110
 want to see mike check out retro games 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.480
 boske bal back for is even more 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.760
 him with was yes and brands 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.230
 soccer yes also just the same with 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.360
 finds in one that especially the game quite 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.919
 is popular in America itself that is in a 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.230
 token sportel is the most popular there 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.530
 also just to better story yourself 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.730
 computer focused players and yes yes just 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.980
 all beautiful 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.650
 j sports and then mirrors edge came 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.150
 unfortunately I don't know what I am after that 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.650
 postage friend of mine went to the bathroom 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.690
 that Alpert had sent my video 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.030
 where the event we are currently at 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.850
 to sit 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.620
 no indeed and you will go there anyway 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.060
 a lot about seeing more sesvete game 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.830
 will train to check 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.480
 you come more than what we tell 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.310
 but your case 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.690
 so where we are now is a special location 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.930
 you will see that too 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.880
 yes indeed attitudes 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.430
 ok this was then press conference of idea 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.110
 let me know again in the comments 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.550
 of what you all thought about this 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.130
 nevertheless go to the forum indeed 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.260
