of tutorial videos on how to create
custom<00:00:16.859> armors<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.210> place<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:18.990> into<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
custom armors and place them into the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.870 
custom armors and place them into the
Skyrim<00:00:19.680> engine<00:00:20.010> now<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.310> order<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.550> create<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
Skyrim engine now in order to create a

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.029 
Skyrim engine now in order to create a
custom<00:00:21.090> armor<00:00:21.600> first<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.590> good<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
custom armor first it's good to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.099 
custom armor first it's good to
understand<00:00:23.460> how<00:00:23.730> armors<00:00:24.240> work<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> game

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
understand how armors work in the game

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
understand how armors work in the game
so<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:26.189> best<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.609> start<00:00:26.910> with<00:00:27.000> pre<00:00:27.390> created

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
so it's best to start with pre created

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.630 
so it's best to start with pre created
armors<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.619> we're<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.250> we're

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
armors what we're going to do is we're

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.479 
armors what we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.050> extract<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.470> hide<00:00:31.830> armor<00:00:32.219> from<00:00:32.399> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
a series of tutorial videos that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.230 
a series of tutorial videos that

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.289 
by step in order to create these
wonderful<00:01:28.100> armors<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.369> place<00:01:29.970> them<00:01:30.180> into

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
wonderful armors and place them into

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.319 
wonderful armors and place them into

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
looking forward to working on these

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.700 
looking forward to working on these
armors<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.540> hopefully<00:01:49.110> maybe<00:01:49.290> I'll<00:01:49.500> learn<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
armors and hopefully maybe I'll learn a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.460 
armors and hopefully maybe I'll learn a
couple<00:01:50.100> things<00:01:50.280> along<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.820> way<00:01:51.020> myself

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
couple things along the way myself

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.170 
couple things along the way myself
so<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.220> first<00:01:53.460> video<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.119> be
