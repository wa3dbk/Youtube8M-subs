00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 wait what happens with Maurice de 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.430
 At the moment what seems to be the clearest are the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.580
 possible exits that you have taken care of and that 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.580
 action 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.290
 goal by luca 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.500
 who signs the first goal of the real 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.439
 madrid 2012-2013 does it at 8 minutes 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.940
 of party in the carlos tartiere in that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.130
 value in depth to which he ran 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.910
 it did not come out because of the dean and neighborhood that was 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.220
 waiting 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.340
 to the resolution of that play to see what 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.220
 happened maybe he could have left his 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.050
 goal to derail that action but 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.100
 he ended up solving with that shot 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.510
 adjusted lucas vázquez 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.800
 taking advantage of a great pass from Ivan 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.800
 gonzález from the defense 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.710
 Well, the first of the real 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.440
 madrid in this preseason 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.980
 he scores it lucas vázquez is the 0-1 front 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.980
 to the real oviedo 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.010
 the 0-2 in the minute 39 score of the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.220
 first part real oviedo 0 real madrid 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.220
 two 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.100
 there we see once again the action of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.409
 tcheryshev 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.409
 the second goal of Real Madrid 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.510
 and a goal with certain morbid because I already 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.550
 we have said 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.950
 Denis is the son 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.290
 from tcheryshev who played five seasons 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.000
 in the sporting of Gijón 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.380
 Dennis himself has played in the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.180
 lower categories of sporting 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.180
 and it is by all known and more the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.770
 rivalry between 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.090
 the molinón set and the one 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.630
 Tartiere care of love until it goes 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.310
 to paste it gets out dan and bar in what 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.660
 goes on match for the set of jose 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.580
 mourinho for now none for the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.550
 oviedo to iván lucas vázquez bicicleteada 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.280
 within the area 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.540
 the value I was looking for barn and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.240
 final the own goal 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.140
 that they do not even celebrate the players 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.659
 targets in one action at most 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.400
 unfortunate for the real oviedo 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.810
 well so the third only two minutes 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.030
 after 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.920
 of the goal of chelís 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.990
 0 3 arrives for the Real Madrid goal in 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.490
 own door there we will see it after 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.770
 a great action, everything has to be said- 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.770
 lucas vázquez there goes from juanpa 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.820
 and notice what happens 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.820
 candela clears 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.700
 the ball in paschal and is introduced 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.700
 directly at the goal of dani neighborhood 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.040
 the 03 for the real madrid that is 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.450
 combining this first one 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.450
 pre - season meeting 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.700
 he tries now the real oviedo through 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.700
 d 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.150
 he got that ball 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.650
 raffled jesus fernandez and just had 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.350
 have to push it between the three poles 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.240
 It seemed easy but maybe it was not so much the 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.420
 In the end, he ended up checking to 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.690
 reduce distances to make him fit 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.790
 to Real Madrid the first goal 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.070
 the preseason after this 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.220
 disfavor behind Raphael's faulty 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.320
 varanne 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.140
 and that which seriously compromises your 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.380
 goalkeeper jesús fernández and whoever 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.510
 gives the possibility to kill martins of 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.360
 reduce distances with the 13th first goal 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.200
 of this second half 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.830
 arrives in the 52 it marks martins for 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.830
 add fear 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.200
 the gift I will 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.349
 of angel di maría taking advantage of a 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.420
 clamorous I miss a blunder of 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.150
 danny neighborhood that wanted to bargain before the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.340
 noodle and mariano but did not snatch 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.020
 the ball and ended up returning the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.210
 Three goals advantage to your team 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.420
 and we're going to see the forwarding of 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.480
 luciano bona 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.060
 and life gets complicated in what way they go 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.560
 and neighborhood that we have not said along 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.810
 of the first half had been stellar 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.970
 in a lot of actions avoiding goals 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.770
 who seemed delighted but here has 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.830
 committed one of those bulk errors 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.350
 that the goalkeepers probably do not 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.530
 they let the night sleep too comfortable 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.480
 post -match in any case and 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.330
 fortunately this is a friendly so 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.669
 bani neighborhood 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.819
 this has to serve as a lesson in 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:51.729
 face to the season simply neither 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:55.880
 you have to make more fire an error like that 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.880
 jandrín one of the pearls of 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.880
 m 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.690
 I did not deserve 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.399
 because I had done 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:17.399
 a uniquely exceptional control 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.380
 the wayne vaseline critical in him 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.520
 riveting the play angel di Maria for 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.520
 the 15
