00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello and welcome to leipzig dts in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.370
 we will join this video 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.200
 digital mirror reflex or short 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.200
 deal DSLR cameras 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.790
 the familiar notion of slr which one 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.430
 digital reflex camera called 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.460
 is made up of the words digital single 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.199
 lens reflex together a digital 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.449
 SLR consists of two 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.130
 divide the lens by that the picture 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.960
 is caught and the image recipient 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.179
 or polit which the whole 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.460
 Technology involves and that of the objective 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.260
 captures captured light as a picture and 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.300
 stores we first look at how 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.129
 a DSLR or SLR camera 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.450
 works through the objective drops 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.860
 light in the camera 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.510
 This is about a make-up mirror 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.700
 and another simplified here 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.100
 represented as an optical system on the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.420
 eyepiece thrown by the eyepiece which 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.399
 can be called on searcher the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.899
 Photographer looking directly at the picture 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.430
 the viewfinder is the little window 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.410
 by looking at a photo 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.120
 if you are satisfied with the motive 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.680
 is the trigger is pressed now 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.899
 works the make-up mirror of the light 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.129
 previously diverted the picture upwards 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.989
 is no longer a seeker 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.519
 passed on but falls directly on 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.650
 the lock behind the mirror 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.420
 This closure is now being used for the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.460
 previously set exposure time 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.560
 opened directly behind the shutter 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.390
 seat the digital sensor on the now that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.009
 light falls this digital sensor 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.689
 consists of many small cells 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.310
 These cells are sensitive to light 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.900
 are also called pixels 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.700
 The pixel number is in the known 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.380
 unit megapixel indicated 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.330
 the incident light which now opens 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.040
 The sensor field generates a charge 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.360
 the pixels of the sensor if the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.310
 Closure after the set 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.170
 shutter speed closes again and the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.909
 charge on the pixel now dissipated and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.439
 analog digitally converted 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.380
 then the picture is in one 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.939
 common format such as jpeg or raw 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.710
 a memory card in the digital camera 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.240
 saved now works 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.070
 Make-up mirror back and that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.899
 picture becomes visible again on the sofa 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.820
 this whole process has only the duration 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.560
 one snaps pretty amazing 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.149
 or I hope this video has you 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.600
 please let me do it with one 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.100
 comment or a thumbs up 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.930
 share this video with your friends 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.280
 and I forget to subscribe like that 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.970

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.950
 the world of technology and I thank you 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.950
