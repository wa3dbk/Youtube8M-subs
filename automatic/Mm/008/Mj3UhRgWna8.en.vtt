 stylization for amateur shooting reception 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.480
 though not the latest on films and 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.270
 computer games are quite rare 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.710
 Blair Witch Monster reportage these 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.810
 films relied on the effect 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.060
 the presence of the camera specifically avoided 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.160
 too artistic angles regularly 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.440
 Received drops on the lens and did not hear 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.000
 about a flat horizon in the frame but the viewer 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.100
 it was reported that this camera was found 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.469
 quite by accident and recording from it 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.159
 got to the cinema screens or to 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.719
 computer games kane &amp; lynch 2 dog days 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.519
 a continuation of the story of two 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.100
 colorful criminals with a dark past 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.510
 however, unlike the first part of the event 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.370
 here are served in a different way 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.469
 in the race for beauty special effects 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.089
 the developers looked back and decided 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.129
 take advantage of other visuals 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.350
 tricks now the scene 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.510
 criminal action movie virtual shanghai 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.879
 after the events of the original kane &amp; lynch and 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.100
 each went their separate ways Kane 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.799
 still working mercenaries and lynch found himself 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.659
 girl and became a debt collector again 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.539
 unite them forcing simple but 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.130
 seemingly profitable work 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.049
 however before you take kane to the hotel 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.140
 for the night lynch need to go to one 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.340
 street leader 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.750
 But the leader is not in 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.909
 mood to receive the message 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.829
 10 minutes accomplices rush on the roofs and 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.460
 lanes up to make their way through the whole 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.679
 a crowd of opponents call it that 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.689
 Lenchik is finally one of the heroes 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.369
 shoots at all the wrong place and 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.920
 becomes a very natural enemy 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.119
 serious crime boss 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.159
 consequences don't keep you waiting 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.990
 for kane and small street hunt 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.740
 police gangs and even army 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.810
 divisions 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.630
 the only way to survive escape from 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.789
 Shanghai all sorts on lynch 2 stylized under 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.280
 shooting on a mobile phone or cheap 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.960
 digital soapbox while other games 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.969
 squeeze what they can from their engines 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.340
 pursuing picture clarity smoothness 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.590
 angles dog days achieves realism 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.560
 by other methods trying to be like 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.569
 streaming video from say youtube camera 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.220
 cracks barely holding characters in 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.649
 field of vision 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.420
 tries in vain to put the focus 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.430
 illuminates bright lamps with signs yes and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.680
 do not forget about the characteristic squares and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.020
 it works at first comfortable 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.030
 will play a very tough game characters 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.620
 don't build thoughtful replicas basically 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.240
 and mouth and briefly explain what you need 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.970
 make a friend instead of grenades 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.750
 available tools 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.850
 fire extinguisher balloon of the years 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.470
 and after the headshots of the opponent's head 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.540
 covered by pixel censorship 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.110
 interesting move relying not on 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.450
 graphics 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.490
 however, kane &amp; lynch 2 has a problem 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.620
 after surprise from dirty 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.360
 pictures of selected mat and several 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.640
 cruel scenes subside it becomes 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.830
 there is nothing more to cling to under aggressive 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.020
 wrap already dozens of times the ice formula 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.540
 wherever the hero is to not 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.760
 there was a task around them in 99 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.620
 cases from 100 the same find 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.780
 shelter protruding or firing 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.320
 blindly kill opponents pass 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.350
 farther 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.730
 then again find shelter popping out 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.720
 or shooting without looking to kill 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.980
 opponents pass on then again 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.260
 one of the few novelties in the scheme 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.320
 shooting from cover for state down but 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.900
 you got enough lead hero not 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.120
 surely perish he may fall on 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.430
 the floor and then either lie down or crawl away 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.560
 to the nearest shelter without losing 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.510
 opportunities to lead less targeted 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.650
 the fire 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.170
 the only problem is 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.120
 that the process is poorly controlled by the player 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.100
 may just want to raise a character 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.910
 on his feet and make him run away from under 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.220
 heavy fire 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.230
 however, both actions are assigned to one 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.850
 button in the end he can get on 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.049
 obviously unfavorable position and 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.780
 go to checkpoint 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.130
 besides monotony is not the only 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.590
 thing that ruins 10 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.080
 dogs mode it makes also ragged 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.940
 script even though styling under 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.250
 video shooting he puts a lot 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.960
 questions that do not answer to 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.490
 For example, who is this brave operator? 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.800
 next on the heels of the heroes 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.890
 the developers never explain though in 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.210
 screen savers the camera is clearly carried in hand 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.890
 kane &amp; lynch 2 looks like 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.550
 at first she was much more and 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.170
 bigger 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.120
 but then the developers for some 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.160
 reason have created a fairly simple story 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.340
 the essence of which can fit into one 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.380
 an offer to go far on one 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.299
 only high-quality styling and 2 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.760
 colorful characters the game failed 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.980
 single dog days entertaining pass 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.810
 unless on the highest complexity where 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.490
 rare for the genre of arrogance artificial 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.040
 intelligence is revealed in all its glory 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.540
 opponents come press down smoke 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.150
 heavy fire and one shot 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.860
 release captured comrades so 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.230
 passing some missions may 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.210
 seriously stretch what's up regime 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.000
 co-passing then so his 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.890
 can be called with a stretch playing 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.930
 even for a couple of live comrades easy 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.750
 just not to notice the difference between him 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.940
 and single level like and not created 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.520
 for two their architecture is extremely rare 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.440
 pushes act together supplements 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.820
 because of the possibility to rest in bed, the heroes became 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.070
 less dependent on each other 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.080
 companion mate support required 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.850
 except in front of the heavy door or in 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.860
 case of injury to not give your 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.950
 character die one player fast 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.200
 knocking the button e and another hurry on 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.310
 by the way split screen mode yes bye 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.440
 version did not get online only reason 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.390
 gives for purchase multiplayer based 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.030
 on the so-called prisoners de lemmy 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.370
 initially the prisoners dilemma is a whole 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.290
 mathematical theory but in one word its 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.970
 can be described as anti-cooperative 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.920
 gameplay is built on 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.560
 psychological relationships of players 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.110
 main mode is called fragile alliance 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.000
 8 players gather in a virtual gang 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.800
 criminals abducting jewelery 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.980
 smuggling or intercepting 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.840
 stolen money until collection 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.690
 mining and to her need to break through all 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.480
 together as soon as 1 pack is taken 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.220
 currency begins time intrigue now 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.430
 robbers can kill each other and 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.960
 pick up loot from former companions 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.610
 However, it is important to guess the moment . 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.740
 hijackers also need to break through 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.240
 police cordons whose transport 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.430
 takes them from the crime scene 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.890
 left without your own make it very 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.260
 hard ways branch and sometimes need 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.150
 run literally on the open street 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.010
 more that those who betrayed get a chance 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.920
 on retribution and being reborn as 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.770
 policemen the other two modes 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.390
 fragile alliance variations in secret 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.220
 an agent to the raiders sit down 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.110
 camouflaged policeman who 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.700
 must eliminate them peculiar 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.990
 a reference to the famous card game 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.930
 mafia 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.390
 but in the cops against the robbers 12 players 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.730
 divided into two teams are six robbing and 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.290
 six bother them extra 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.490
 the feature is that each side 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.590
 there is reinforcement 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:42.130
 up to a certain point, characters can 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.620
 revive network mode turns 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.650
 quite fascinating shooting moves away to 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.090
 second plan giving way to psychology 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.800
 cooperative where participants are pushed 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.530
 work for yourself and come up with ways 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.420
 getting around the rules is extremely cynical and 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.430
 freshly 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:00.070
 in all three modes, the one who wins 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.050
 eventually collect more money after the same 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.090
 the end of the match should be scoring for 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.340
 which raise in rank and open 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.950
 new weapons so addictive 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.870
 direct more mining more points 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.360
 faster virtual career growth 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.100
 true all weapons accessories and even 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.870
 card not get if not pay extra 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.790
 real money some of them are 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.100
 small additions and require 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.290
 special code for yourself what's up 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.690
 convenience here kane &amp; lynch 2 is also not 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.640
 everything is smooth though the computer version of the game 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.070
 supports steam network menu in it 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.900
 same as the boot console in 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.240
 such a shell occur about and 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.460
 without even leaving the match takes 10 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.010
 seconds a full server browser 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.020
 there is no trace of the main sweetness that is 

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.210
 gameplay can break through a few
