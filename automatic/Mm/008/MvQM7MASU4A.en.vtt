00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 hi there is a smartwatch pro and review 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 smart watch bass sb1 seems 1 on 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.389
 Russian language 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:22.680
 what do we try to tell all that 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:25.640
 know it went to Macy US 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.470
 ab1 is the first so-called 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.019
 portable bio recorder for the first time 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 gadget shown at the exhibition with the cee and more 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.620
 in 2012, the main feature of bass sb1 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.899
 sensors that monitor not only for 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
 familiar indicators like passed 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.550
 kilometers and calories burned 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.280
 but also for the heart rate and temperature 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.800
 even skin moisture but first about 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.110
 appearance 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 into one solid metal base and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.449
 nice soft touch plastic strap 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.969
 and tightly fitted watches to be controlled from 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.719
 the gadget is comfortable and familiar you can easily and 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.250
 quickly fit to your size 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.090
 default straps 2 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.470
 white and black but available to order and 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.920
 customized options including with 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.560
 copyrighted design 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.750
 b one unusual in everything for example 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.159
 way to control the main buttons 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.009
 are right here 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.590
 turn on backlight off navigation 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.259
 menu up down home button or 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.689
 watch time right mechanical 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.049
 key for synchronization and activation 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.450
 bluetooth side charging connector 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.970
 own format and it works all this 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.280
 construction frankly strange well and 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.399
 question what to do if the charger 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.200
 will break and get lost but the cradle can 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.200
 put on your watch without removing it from your hand 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.590
 little screen is very small diagonal 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.590
 just one inch monochrome and clearly 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.930
 smaller than we would like the most 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.450
 interesting part here is a module with 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.910
 sensors and 3 axial gyros which 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.220
 measure your pulse rate study your 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.590
 activity and even analyze power 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.750
 load on the level of sweating hands and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.730
 temperature 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.050
 the sensor is definitely the most useful thing 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.480
 is in sb1 boys 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.600
 but because of the large thickness of the watch look 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.000
 on hand bulky b1 is very nice 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.370
 decorated the gadget has its own style 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.540
 here for example a box on which are written 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.150
 main features including by the way 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.770
 Waterproof started not 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.680
 completely standard and the clock is activated 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.560
 only through the computer you need to go to 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.000
 website register and download 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.180
 the application without this hour and not even 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.400
 turn on b1 running out of apple and with 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.709
 android devices watch themselves very 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.320
 limited to functionality first 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.540
 this sensor to collect information which 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.640
 then you can see analyze 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.400
 on the computer or using the application 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.500
 here we only have a heart rate 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.200
 number of steps completed and burnt 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.660
 calories and strip goals 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.970
 for example the distance traveled but u and 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.920
 watches themselves their appearance cannot be changed 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.410
 moreover, they can not put time 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.019
 you just specify the time zone and 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.209
 time is synchronized via the Internet well 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.610
 and in general all the fun just in 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.890
 the internet 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.140
 watches accumulate data and after 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.150
 sync save in the cloud and 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.840
 displays them in the form of beautiful diagrams and 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.300
 drawings 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.670
 here you can set goals and watch 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.130
 the process of their execution follow the mode and 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.770
 so on graphics to be honest very 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.350
 tricky but I want to believe that if 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.480
 them figure out then this information will start 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.370
 do about the same 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.800
 can view us in smartphone 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.230
 applications are only greatly curtailed 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.990
 an interesting form of organized analyzer 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.950
 sleep in no special clock modes 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.160
 no need to translate 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.770
 basis b1 themselves understand that you fell asleep by 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.570
 heart rate true to sleep with such 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.209
 gizmo on hand of course not very 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.370
 Convenient battery would be one standard 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.860
 for many models of smart watches it 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.020
 Lasts for 3-4 days when the battery 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.620
 the clock sits give out a special 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.600
 warning gadget basic version 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.260
 worth 179 dollars 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.950
 2014 carbon steel model with the same 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.700
 the most functional 199 simple strap 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.130
 25 dollars designer 35 here such 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.680
 very smart watch semi medical gadget 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.940
 bass sb1 not only entertainment but also 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.400
 real tool 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.620
 the main thing is not to be lazy to use everyone 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.970
 its functions then benefit with 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.919
 you were smartwatch 2 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.919
