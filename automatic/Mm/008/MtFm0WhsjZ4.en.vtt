 welcome to the spin 4 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.570
 4 test 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.509
 Today with Daniel and you from the 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.400
 Regionalliga in the upcoming season in the 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.310
 Added the new introduction of the plastic courtship 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.960
 Today we test the special on 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.640
 These plastic are soon matched 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.679
 we already have the amigo for you 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.050
 40plus tested today we test one 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:33.540
 further cover of mario the hidden 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:37.540
 dragon 40 plus you are both now 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.829
 energy player and of course is now 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.159
 in china covering how are your expectations 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.590
 basically i think that china 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.270
 cover something will be more handy than the 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.379
 Trainers are well known that 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.050
 they are pretty handy meanwhile 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.430
 pretty much sticking to it and he 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.530
 alone but not as much out 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.879
 prove that china comes out 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.969
 to wait a bit for the covering 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.559
 to offer us here is exactly what it is 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.899
 mostly the problem the handy 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.899
 surface that occupy it at china 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.660
 but give the catapult effect of missing 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.960
 clearly at the china show now 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.700
 look like the hidden dragon yes we 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.140
 are very excited 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.849
 Palio as a manufacturer writes about this 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.800
 that's a specially developed one 

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:20.709
 Also swam a fresh lever sponge 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.810
 slightly open-pored anyway is like 

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:24.550
 often said that in comparison 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.349
 to the esm prove or the take ii 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.530
 clearly show the dynamics of butterfly 

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:32.319
 Something missing surface is easy here 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.420
 minimal sticky and very handy we 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.890
 look at us now if that in 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.340
 combination with the 40th 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.709
 with the 40 plus at plastic because 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.599
 leads to interesting game results 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.599
 have fun and see you later 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.790
 Welcome to the spin factory test center 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.870
 Now we come to a conclusion 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.170
 daniel we now have the back 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.140
 push 40plus tested how were yours 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.390
 first experience with the flooring 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.860
 my first conclusion is a bit 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.819
 softer than the amigo 40plus's before 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.799
 have tested 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.810
 you have a bit more control and 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.120
 is doing really well how was that at 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.099
 you so yes I also found him a bit 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.190
 Soft sponge was a bit softer 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.299
 and now found him completely blockable 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.879
 very very pleasant 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.340
 Of course, the top spin is included 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.849
 you have to show softer ones 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.030
 Do a little more but in the big and 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.970
 all over this cover fits my 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:25.160
 opinion, the new to the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.539
 look at plastic ball now is exactly 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.550
 if that stood a bit 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.120
 exciting a bit softer yet 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:37.099
 he is also a bit rubbery 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:39.050
 open-pored here a bit and how was 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.990
 that in your case before your a top 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.760
 spin what a feeling did you have there 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.590
 I've just noticed that the in 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.120
 The ball stop is a bit softer 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.229
 is 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.490
 Personally, I prefer doing it when it does 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.320
 it's just a bit harder 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.810
 now for players the more on control 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.550
 I think that is a good one 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.979
 Variant to simply keep the ball safe 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.630
 back to the table but to play 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.550
 does not notice how the ball in the rubber 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.360
 comes in and then back out again 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.360
 catapulted 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:10.700
 that was also my feeling that you too 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.890
 here that one here that the cover 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.510
 the player know what forgives if 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.620
 he is not right to the ball right now 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.740
 in the amigo 40plus there you should 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.740
 rather right to the ball then pops 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.260
 then right but where the the 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.710
 hidden dragon that appears 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:35.940
 really much to forgive 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.380
 good then thank you again 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.250
 back out of the speedfactory
