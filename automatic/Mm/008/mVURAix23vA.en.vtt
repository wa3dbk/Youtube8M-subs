are several advantages to doing this

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.490 
are several advantages to doing this
first<00:00:35.250> off<00:00:35.489> you've<00:00:36.120> got<00:00:36.270> extra<00:00:36.660> firepower<00:00:36.899> and

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
first off you've got extra firepower and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.250 
first off you've got extra firepower and
an<00:00:37.590> extra<00:00:37.860> set<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> eyes<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.899> let's<00:00:40.109> say

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
an extra set of eyes you know let's say

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680 
an extra set of eyes you know let's say
you're<00:00:40.410> fighting<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:41.789> a<00:00:41.850> tank<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> know

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
you're fighting with a tank and you know

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
you're fighting with a tank and you know
infantry<00:00:43.170> comes<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.219> bushes<00:00:44.429> you

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
infantry comes up out of the bushes you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.450 
infantry comes up out of the bushes you
know<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.510> can't<00:00:45.749> really<00:00:45.960> focus<00:00:46.679> on<00:00:47.039> both<00:00:47.249> at

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
know you can't really focus on both at

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.099 
know you can't really focus on both at
once<00:00:47.609> so<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.179> you<00:00:48.269> can<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.839> just<00:00:48.960> have

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
once so what you can do is just have

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.319 
once so what you can do is just have
your<00:00:49.230> gunner<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.829> know<00:00:49.949> suppress<00:00:50.370> summer<00:00:50.699> cut

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
them down that way you'll be able to

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
them down that way you'll be able to
focus<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> main<00:00:56.100> threat<00:00:56.429> which<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.699> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
especially in between fights even though

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.220 
especially in between fights even though
you're<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.550> disabled<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.270> tank<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.990> still

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
you're not disabled the tank is still

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.260 
you're not disabled the tank is still
damaged<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.190> regenerates<00:01:47.790> health<00:01:48.030> rather

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
damaged and it regenerates health rather

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.380 
damaged and it regenerates health rather
slowly<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:49.500> having<00:01:49.710> him<00:01:49.830> prepare<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.910> pretty

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
slowly so having him prepare you pretty

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.640

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
paramount you know can be the difference

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.470 
paramount you know can be the difference

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
health or you know seventy percent

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.580 
health or you know seventy percent
almost<00:01:56.910> disabled<00:01:57.510> also<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.500> them

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
almost disabled also you can have them

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.260 
almost disabled also you can have them
prepared<00:01:58.890> during<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.370> know<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> fight<00:02:00.090> you

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
adding gadgets to the tanks this is

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.630 
adding gadgets to the tanks this is
another<00:02:15.780> distinct<00:02:16.469> advantage<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.609> fact

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
another distinct advantage is the fact

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.070 
another distinct advantage is the fact
that<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.120> gunner<00:02:18.329> and<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.629> drive

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
that the gunner and the drive

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.640 
that the gunner and the drive
can<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.500> share<00:02:19.740> their<00:02:20.400> abilities<00:02:21.410> let's<00:02:22.410> say

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
can you share their abilities let's say

can you share their abilities let's say
let's<00:02:23.010> take<00:02:23.250> two<00:02:23.430> things<00:02:23.700> for<00:02:23.940> example

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
let's take two things for example

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.660 
let's take two things for example
proximity<00:02:24.900> scan<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.410> reactive<00:02:26.130> armor<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
proximity scan and reactive armor the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.810 
proximity scan and reactive armor the
driver<00:02:27.630> itself<00:02:28.110> has<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.130> decide<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.790> know

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
driver itself has to decide you know

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.490 
driver itself has to decide you know
what<00:02:29.940> do<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.420> want<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.600> pick<00:02:30.780> don't<00:02:30.960> reactive

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
what do I want to pick don't reactive

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500 
what do I want to pick don't reactive
armor<00:02:31.770> or<00:02:31.950> proximity<00:02:32.340> skin<00:02:32.760> well<00:02:33.270> if<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.420> have

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
armor or proximity skin well if you have

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.960 
armor or proximity skin well if you have
a<00:02:33.540> gunner<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.350> takes<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.770> away<00:02:34.830> as<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
a gunner that takes that away as the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.630 
a gunner that takes that away as the
driver<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:37.080> select<00:02:37.590> reactive<00:02:38.220> armor<00:02:38.460> and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
driver you can select reactive armor and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.790 
driver you can select reactive armor and
your<00:02:38.970> gunner<00:02:39.210> can<00:02:39.480> pick<00:02:39.690> proximity<00:02:40.290> scans<00:02:40.530> and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
your gunner can pick proximity scans and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.790 
your gunner can pick proximity scans and
you've<00:02:41.190> got<00:02:41.340> both<00:02:41.610> now<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.780> being<00:02:43.470> able<00:02:43.620> to
