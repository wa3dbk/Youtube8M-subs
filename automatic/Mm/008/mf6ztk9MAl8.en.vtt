00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.980 

now<00:00:12.629> let's<00:00:12.840> see<00:00:13.049> question<00:00:13.260> number<00:00:13.440> 49<00:00:14.779> so<00:00:15.779> out

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
now let's see question number 49 so out

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.650 
now let's see question number 49 so out
of<00:00:16.020> these<00:00:16.379> four<00:00:16.439> animal<00:00:17.189> shark<00:00:17.550> frog<00:00:18.119> lizard

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
of these four animal shark frog lizard

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.710 
of these four animal shark frog lizard
and<00:00:18.900> whale<00:00:19.189> which<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.430> has<00:00:20.699> two<00:00:21.119> separate

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and whale which one has two separate

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.890 
and whale which one has two separate
circulatory<00:00:22.320> pathways<00:00:23.060> now<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.420> separate

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
circulatory pathways now to separate

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.410 
circulatory pathways now to separate
circulatory<00:00:25.680> pathways<00:00:26.280> are<00:00:26.550> only<00:00:26.880> possible

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
circulatory pathways are only possible

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.140 
circulatory pathways are only possible
if<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.050> heart<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.860> completely<00:00:29.250> four

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
if the heart is completely four

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.420 
if the heart is completely four
chambered<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.350> if<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> heart<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.189> completely

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
chambered so if the heart is completely

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.099 
chambered so if the heart is completely
four<00:00:33.300> chambered<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.649> means<00:00:34.980> there<00:00:35.370> are

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
four chambered so that means there are

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.160 
four chambered so that means there are
two<00:00:37.109> atria<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> two<00:00:38.070> ventricles<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
two atria and two ventricles so the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.250 
two atria and two ventricles so the
right<00:00:40.350> atrium<00:00:41.039> and<00:00:41.899> here<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.079> right

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
right atrium and here the right

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.309 
right atrium and here the right
ventricle<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.550> left<00:00:44.579> atrium<00:00:45.449> and<00:00:45.659> the<00:00:46.289> left

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:46.319 
ventricle the left atrium and the left

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:53.119 
ventricle the left atrium and the left
ventricle<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:52.109> atrium<00:00:52.920> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
ventricle and the right atrium is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.430 
ventricle and the right atrium is
receiving<00:00:55.609> deoxygenated<00:00:56.609> blood<00:00:56.819> from<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
receiving deoxygenated blood from the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.670 
receiving deoxygenated blood from the
body<00:01:00.589> and<00:01:02.629> this<00:01:03.629> blood<00:01:04.640> passes<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:07.500> right

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
body and this blood passes to the right

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.980 
body and this blood passes to the right
side<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.310> from<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.440> transported<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
side and from here it is transported to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:21.600 
side and from here it is transported to
lungs<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:18.260> from<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.470> lungs

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
lungs and from the lungs

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.590 
lungs and from the lungs
oxygenated<00:01:22.610> blood<00:01:22.909> is<00:01:24.370> transported<00:01:25.370> to<00:01:25.600> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
oxygenated blood is transported to the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.850 
oxygenated blood is transported to the
left<00:01:26.840> atrium<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:28.540> from<00:01:29.540> here<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.620> left

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
left atrium and from here to the left

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.940 
left atrium and from here to the left
ventricle<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.729> from<00:01:32.600> here<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.610> body<00:01:35.950> so

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
ventricle and from here to the body so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.940 
ventricle and from here to the body so
complete<00:01:37.430> two<00:01:38.090> pathways<00:01:38.450> are<00:01:39.080> possible<00:01:39.710> only

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
complete two pathways are possible only

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.030 
complete two pathways are possible only
when<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.550> heart<00:01:41.210> is<00:01:41.390> fully<00:01:41.750> four<00:01:42.530> chambered

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
when the heart is fully four chambered

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.180 
when the heart is fully four chambered
and<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.820> in<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.090> case<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.570> whale<00:01:45.530> being<00:01:46.070> a

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
and that is in the case of whale being a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.980 
and that is in the case of whale being a
mammal<00:01:46.400> so<00:01:47.150> our<00:01:47.270> answer<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:47.780> four<00:01:52.780> let's<00:01:53.780> move

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
mammal so our answer is four let's move

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:09.400 
mammal so our answer is four let's move
on<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.259> next<00:01:54.440> question

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.470
