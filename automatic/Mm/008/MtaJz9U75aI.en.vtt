00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.470
 last week we had a lot of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.610
 success on the whiskey tv site with 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.290
 our first recipe 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.030
 this week I chose in the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.759
 Martin's recipes to present you a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.950
 orange salad a salad that comes 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.259
 all right from Morocco with essences 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.430
 interesting because we will talk 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:26.099
 onions request almond so we go there 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.899
 to go with cointreau of oil and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.669
 salt of the Himalayas so that will give 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.110
 something rather interesting it is 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.880
 again a salad we can do 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.430
 very quickly all we have to do 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.630
 it is to prepare us orange in 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.330
 making sure to remove the skin 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:47.030
 covers everything you want in 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.030
 do is keep only the flesh 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.700
 afterwards well we make sure 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.430
 take some oranges to go 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:06.070
 look for the juice so we make sure 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.890
 can still have a good 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.810
 amount of orange juice because one 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:18.369
 wants to try everyone to have enough 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:21.130
 of juice to cover us orange measuring 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.409
 the recipe we start with our oil 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.479
 olive that we put in our juice 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.300
 of orange and by the wish well we will 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.950
 put cointreau 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:38.080
 we could have also mastered the great 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.180
 marry then really these few 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.450
 tablespoons each of 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.310
 ingredients and I like to put some 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.770
 salt of the himalaya 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.070
 I really like the texture so really 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.070
 in the saddle a little bit and we have 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.729
 is orange so we place some 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.860
 orange zest and we keep it for the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.990
 end and then that's going to put on 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.560
 arrange us 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.440
 our preparation we make sure 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.680
 soaked it orange as much as possible this 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.040
 that they have to do is let that 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.069
 side 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.540
 we have prepared our onions our world and 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.349
 all the other ingredients so we're going 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.349
 cut some dates 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.390
 we had prepared especially we had done 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.400
 roast our fines beforehand in a 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.989
 stove 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.440
 only a few members so we have our 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:45.819
 dates and we place them on our 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.890
 orange preparation that has already begun 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.540
 she marinated with our others 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.290
 ingredients 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.879
 so all we have to do is 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.879
 to add our fines 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.960
 to add another a young lion and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.530
 then 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:13.510
 mint on the top so our 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.380
 preparation was put in the fridge during 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.750
 many hours 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.430
 and there and all that remains to be done 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.680
 it's putting it in a bowl for the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.980
 introduce to our guests who will arrive 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.280
 in the next few minutes at the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.840
 House 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.390
 you see I still have a lot of 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.460
 liquid formed during the course of 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.910
 last hours in everything we do 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.910
 we put it all in our bowl 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.360
 and I 'm still in reserve and 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:49.200
 some slices for our preparation 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.200
 right here 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.069
