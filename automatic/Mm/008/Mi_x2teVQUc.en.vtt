00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.840
 hi everyone guys are games for 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.849
 the guys on our channel today vi 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.980
 we bring a core, only the buyers did 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.240
 with the kap 40 from our real sandwich 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.619
 gtf to bots 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.419
 for those who do not yet know what he wants 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.900
 say the fire I'll explain for the last one 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.329
 time 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.429
 and how to say the nos with the sniper alone 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.919
 which for all other weapons is used to say 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.779
 i fire or without ever aiming was 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.989
 made on domain will put on stand of 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.460
 luck at 40 let's say it's the gun 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.920
 better than a little easier together 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.109
 all'abi plus 23r to facilitate it has 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.750
 used this laser sight that told him 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.429
 more or less where it was then fired 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.280
 guys all in all it's gameplay 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.109
 very nice though it also turns out 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.539
 quite frantic just that I do 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.879
 let's say cut in the best parts 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.710
 because he did two kilos for half an hour 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.449
 he couldn't find any more enemies and so I have 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.249
 had to cut it that the second round 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.230
 you will understand wonder in the second was a 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.300
 because you have the white flag 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.790
 he will start let's say gear will do 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.650
 enough that the also because the enemies 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.930
 were born said that we pass to the two 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.790
 topics of today the first and g2 a 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.710
 guys we signed up for this site 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.020
 really delicious so now we have 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.660
 we also leave our link in 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.330
 description if you click there you can 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.560
 buy things at a very low price are 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.570
 subscriptions that the dlc psn card to all 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.840
 these very low priced stuff indeed 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.400
 but a subscription of the xbox live of 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.310
 three months it costs 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.630
 even 15 euros really a thing 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.760
 very good in my opinion it is true not 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.840
 you have to pay with card methods 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.240
 credit thing like that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.610
 then in theory they send you an email or not 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.680
 I just never bought from there though and I know 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.720
 which is really very good so if you 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.670
 you need something like that o 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.800
 some your friend needs a 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.950
 subscription so you give him our 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.960
 link and buy at a very low price 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.300
 so guys if you want the link 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.760
 description let it run share it 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.830
 having said this let's move on to zodiac 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.900
 you say then zodiac says will be done 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.300
 Thursday and Wednesday of this week 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.490
 because I am very free at three o'clock 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.500
 afternoon on both days 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.420
 if you are smart, sign up 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.010
 that both days you are there 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.540
 I can put you either Tuesday or 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.790
 Wednesday or Thursday 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.060
 and why are they sure they will write in 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.340
 lots like the other time and then 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.570
 let's say that if you are more flexible 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.030
 you will have more possibilities 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.870
 like I said last time who he had 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.270
 already written 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.680
 this time I will rewrite will have the little la 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.120
 precedence over others 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.590
 how do I know who had me 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.980
 written because I have all the messages 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.690
 still there on the xbox unread so I see 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.730
 immediately kim wrote 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.709
 said this guys i want you in 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.810
 many to participate 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.910
 and then as I said in the video of 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.010
 zodiac says take a moment 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.810
 take good care of the video like this and not 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.580
 clean immediately because otherwise we must 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.709
 make us 50 thousand matches 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.239
 I do not say that it bothers me indeed 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.400
 pleasure because also the other time to me 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.010
 you asked we will make sure if you 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.170

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.320
 the second if we record two why 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.180
 in the first 70th evil and I will do it 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.980
 we will do a lot maybe we start at e3 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.959
 we end up at four-thirty at 5 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.150

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.430
