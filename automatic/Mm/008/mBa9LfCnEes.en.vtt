00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.430
 fire the meals 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.739
 p 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:11.129
 all together 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.129
 everyone 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.949
 I will respect the following points 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.050
 and we are in November and we have seen children parading through the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.340
 dressed streets be a fright asking you to weaken and before Mexico this day is 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.570
 more than fear, a mockery towards death is made, I would like to let it pass 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.580
 this opportunity 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.980
 after making a count in which the hair will stand on end as well as 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.300
 we have the most addictive charges the most played by the most difficult 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.210
 this time I present you today the list of the most terrifying games are 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.780
 exactly what children should not play and that adults 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.650
 I wish I had not played 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.600
 They will surely have a terrifying night 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.400
 unlike horror movies, video games are even more 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.510
 chilling 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.720
 and that is that when you watch a movie you are only a spectator 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.730
 at any time we can turn around and simply ignore what happened but 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.470
 in a videogame it is exactly the opposite because you are the character 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.360
 main and are your actions do that will keep you alive 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.550
 will create a game that scare is not necessarily easy 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.910
 you need to create a whole sample that catches you 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.950
 so better to decide if you want to keep listening 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.840
 because here I leave you the five most terrifying half games of all 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.840
 history 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.860
 in the fifth place we are based in the corts this is a gift from 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.840
 the Japanese 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.390
 that are very good for this kind of stories 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.820
 in addition to the atmosphere and a dark tante peace story 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.940
 in this game it turns out that the enemies simply 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.120
 totally seriously 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.050
 so you really should leave them unconscious to continue with their 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.619
 path 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.249
 but be careful because sooner or later you return to your part 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.380
 also within the characters 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.929
 you can choose a girl 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.539
 which by the way is completely helpless 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.539
 so the milan simply lie 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.060
 in number four we find coloto lopo 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.209
 of alcohol in blood 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.090
 psychological terror and paranoia would be the two words that best describe 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.229
 this title is based on the novels of hp in the afa 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.859
 it's about a former detectives who has just returned to the trade 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.479
 after being in an insane asylum for years 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.819
 is sent to a pretty gloomy town to investigate the disappearance of a 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:42.450
 young 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.490
 and anticipated 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.849
 the whole game has a halo of terror 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.349
 to the level at which this increase 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.539
 then you do not have any weapon to defend 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.539
 you are completely helpless 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.379
 in third place we have also noticed 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.299
 a game in which terror is seen in a different way than 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.179
 previous 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:08.050
 well in this one 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.170
 you must wait for a city below the ocean where you will meet 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.190
 humans that have mutated and wolves that work automatically and 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.019
 destroy if those goals 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.019
 the environment is what makes this one 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:26.239
 your 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.689
 pamplona 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.639
 in second place we have clear is silent this video game is one of the 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.790
 most feared many know their history because of the films they have had 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.109
 However, in reality they have little to do with each other 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.349
 keeps this promotion together and employed by 21 although in terms that makes 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.609
 people become 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.899
 niculae was afraid 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.899
 any delivery of this video game will make you sweat 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:03:59.820
 and in number one 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.039
 Without a doubt the most terrifying video game in all history 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:08.419
 is any delivery of that energy, because I do not see an environment simply 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.469
 spooky 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.949
 makes a conclusion of the camera and the music 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:14.339
 and everything intensifies 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:18.459
 for things like not being able to see beyond the faint glow of a small 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.309
 Lantern 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.659
 and the aesthetics of the end stadium 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.309
 when there is danger of being 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:27.509
 this atmosphere added to a great story and a situation is simply 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:28.680
 twisted 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.309
 make this the most terrifying fire in history 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:34.210
 Cuba not only and at night 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.210
 it is practically impossible 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.050
 I mention this is because they are the most chilling however they have existed 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.809
 and they keep getting more and more out every day 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.259
 that will get you out more at least one scream 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.529
 as all boarding expands and 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.749
 and as the name says it reflects fear 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:59.759
 alone in the dark one of the first horror games the octave where there is no 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.689
 opportunity to defend yourself only from escaping takeoffs where the zombies 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.639
 appear in a spaceship made 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.120
 the game of the aya longeva saga from the movie with the same name 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:15.949
 so if you want to know what fear is and experience the adrenaline 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.620
 no doubt with these games you will have a bit of it however remember that 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.849
