00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
controller I've used it for various

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.369 
controller I've used it for various
consoles<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:52.570> would<00:00:52.720> actually<00:00:52.839> like<00:00:53.170> to

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
consoles and I would actually like to

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.229 
consoles and I would actually like to
start<00:00:53.440> using<00:00:53.890> it<00:00:54.070> with<00:00:54.220> my<00:00:54.399> computer<00:00:54.820> but<00:00:55.180> I

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
start using it with my computer but I

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.780 
start using it with my computer but I
don't<00:00:55.510> want<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.780> sacrifice<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:57.220> use<00:00:57.489> for<00:00:57.699> the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
don't want to sacrifice the use for the

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.539 
don't want to sacrifice the use for the
consoles<00:00:58.239> as<00:00:58.420> well<00:00:58.659> so<00:00:59.439> to<00:00:59.500> that<00:01:00.070> end<00:01:00.339> I

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
consoles as well so to that end I

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.299 
consoles as well so to that end I
purchased<00:01:01.030> one<00:01:01.239> of<00:01:01.269> these<00:01:01.540> guys<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.920> is<00:01:03.009> the

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.820 
purchased one of these guys this is the
multi<00:01:03.729> console<00:01:04.239> cthulhu<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.140> this<00:01:05.350> seems<00:01:05.650> to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
multi console cthulhu and this seems to

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.920 
multi console cthulhu and this seems to
be<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.220> best<00:01:06.369> all-in-one<00:01:07.119> solution<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.780> my

be the best all-in-one solution to my

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.760 
be the best all-in-one solution to my

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
you the PCB a little bit closer here so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.980 
you the PCB a little bit closer here so
you<00:01:42.369> know<00:01:42.609> for<00:01:42.819> instance<00:01:42.939> you'd<00:01:43.270> have<00:01:43.450> like

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
you know for instance you'd have like

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.660 
you know for instance you'd have like
your<00:01:44.590> oops

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
your oops

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.419 
your oops
backwards<00:01:46.749> your<00:01:47.139> ground<00:01:47.499> here<00:01:48.069> and<00:01:48.280> then

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
backwards your ground here and then

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.059 
backwards your ground here and then
you'd<00:01:48.549> have<00:01:48.579> button<00:01:49.389> one<00:01:49.659> two<00:01:50.109> three<00:01:50.679> four

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
you'd have button one two three four

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.309 
you'd have button one two three four
five<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.609> six<00:01:51.939> and<00:01:52.210> then<00:01:52.959> I<00:01:53.079> can't<00:01:53.289> remember

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
five and six and then I can't remember

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.779 
five and six and then I can't remember
the<00:01:53.619> rest<00:01:53.799> of<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.039> there's<00:01:54.189> another<00:01:54.429> ground

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
the rest of it there's another ground

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.669 
the rest of it there's another ground
here<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.600> think<00:01:55.659> one<00:01:55.959> of<00:01:55.990> these<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.380> home

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
here and I think one of these is a home

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.709 
here and I think one of these is a home
button<00:01:56.979> so<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:57.909> can<00:01:57.999> have<00:01:58.270> up<00:01:58.299> to<00:01:58.479> eight

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
button so you can have up to eight

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.010 
button so you can have up to eight
buttons<00:01:59.020> as<00:01:59.469> well<00:02:00.219> as<00:02:00.670> start<00:02:00.969> select<00:02:01.389> and<00:02:01.719> home

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
buttons as well as start select and home

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.719 
buttons as well as start select and home
and<00:02:02.469> they've<00:02:02.889> got<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.130> couple<00:02:03.219> of<00:02:03.609> different

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
and they've got a couple of different

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.300 
and they've got a couple of different
ground<00:02:04.119> spots<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:05.350> really<00:02:05.679> all<00:02:05.829> you<00:02:05.859> have<00:02:06.130> to

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
ground spots so really all you have to

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.730 
ground spots so really all you have to
do<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.880> just<00:02:07.779> take<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.140> wires<00:02:08.350> from<00:02:08.619> your

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
do is just take the wires from your

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.650 
do is just take the wires from your
buttons<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.310> hook<00:02:09.910> them<00:02:10.090> straight<00:02:10.479> into

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
buttons and hook them straight into

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.780 
buttons and hook them straight into
these<00:02:10.959> these<00:02:11.380> screw<00:02:11.770> terminals<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.610> you're

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
these these screw terminals and you're

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.930 
these these screw terminals and you're
pretty<00:02:13.000> much<00:02:13.120> ready<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.510> go<00:02:13.680> now<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
pretty much ready to go now the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.460 
pretty much ready to go now the
instructions<00:02:16.540> don't<00:02:17.080> come<00:02:17.350> with<00:02:19.080> anything<00:02:20.080> to

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
instructions don't come with anything to

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.780 
instructions don't come with anything to
tell<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.800> how<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.069> hook<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.400> up<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.640> your

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
consoles if you want now the USB is on

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.330 
consoles if you want now the USB is on

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.520 
the end here and I should note that it
does<00:02:27.520> not<00:02:27.700> come<00:02:28.120> with<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.450> USB<00:02:28.900> cable<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.410> you'll

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
does not come with a USB cable so you'll

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.500 
does not come with a USB cable so you'll
have<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.830> have<00:02:29.890> your<00:02:29.980> own<00:02:30.160> but<00:02:31.000> most<00:02:31.240> people

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
have to have your own but most people

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.240 
have to have your own but most people
have<00:02:31.660> online<00:02:31.900> around<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.620> that's<00:02:32.770> usually<00:02:33.220> not

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
have online around so that's usually not

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.340 
have online around so that's usually not
a<00:02:33.430> big<00:02:33.700> deal

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
a big deal

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.540 
a big deal
and<00:02:35.560> then<00:02:35.830> for<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.100> rest

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
and then for the rest

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.460 
and then for the rest
consoles<00:02:37.060> they<00:02:37.300> actually<00:02:37.630> tell<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.080> where<00:02:38.380> to

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
consoles they actually tell you where to

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.720 
consoles they actually tell you where to
go<00:02:38.620> online<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.430> look<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:41.160> what<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.280> do<00:02:42.490> is<00:02:42.640> you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
go online to look and what you do is you

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.700 
go online to look and what you do is you
actually<00:02:42.850> hook<00:02:43.240> them<00:02:43.390> into<00:02:43.570> these<00:02:43.900> you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
actually hook them into these you

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.560 
actually hook them into these you
actually<00:02:44.860> do<00:02:45.190> have<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.400> solder<00:02:45.760> for<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.270> part

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
actually do have to solder for this part

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.620 
actually do have to solder for this part
if<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.810> just<00:02:46.960> want<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.260> make<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.940> USB<00:02:48.940> or<00:02:49.240> a<00:02:49.270> ps3

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
if you just want to make a USB or a ps3

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.140 
if you just want to make a USB or a ps3
controller<00:02:50.380> then<00:02:51.220> you're<00:02:51.550> pretty<00:02:51.760> much<00:02:51.850> done

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
controller then you're pretty much done

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.670 
controller then you're pretty much done
at<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:52.480> point<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:52.930> screw<00:02:53.320> your<00:02:53.470> wires

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
at that point you just screw your wires

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.370 
at that point you just screw your wires
in<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:55.060> plug<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.420> in<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.690> it's<00:02:55.810> ready<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.200> go

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
in and plug it in and it's ready to go

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.590 
in and plug it in and it's ready to go
but<00:02:57.100> if<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.220> want<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.550> use<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.910> with<00:02:58.150> any<00:02:58.450> of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
but if you want to use it with any of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.300 
but if you want to use it with any of
your<00:02:58.720> consoles<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.410> are<00:02:59.590> gonna<00:02:59.800> have<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.160> get

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
your consoles you are gonna have to get

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.220 
your consoles you are gonna have to get
out<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.730> soldering<00:03:01.240> iron<00:03:01.420> just<00:03:01.780> for<00:03:01.960> a<00:03:02.020> little

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
out the soldering iron just for a little

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.040 
out the soldering iron just for a little
bit<00:03:02.350> but<00:03:02.710> it's<00:03:02.890> not<00:03:02.980> too<00:03:03.460> bad<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.900> see

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
bit but it's not too bad so you can see

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.950 
bit but it's not too bad so you can see
we<00:03:05.230> have<00:03:05.380> these<00:03:05.620> these<00:03:05.980> little<00:03:06.400> uh<00:03:06.960> solder

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
we have these these little uh solder

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.150 
we have these these little uh solder
points<00:03:08.230> here<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.300> we<00:03:10.300> have<00:03:10.420> one<00:03:10.630> two<00:03:10.810> three

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
points here and we have one two three

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.650 
points here and we have one two three
the<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.190> rows<00:03:12.730> here<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.330> then<00:03:13.450> we<00:03:13.540> have

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
the the rows here and then we have

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.200 
the the rows here and then we have
columns<00:03:14.170> I'm<00:03:14.920> assuming<00:03:15.250> that's<00:03:15.400> ground<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
columns I'm assuming that's ground and

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.040 
columns I'm assuming that's ground and
then<00:03:16.740> ABCDEF<00:03:17.740> and<00:03:18.240> that<00:03:19.240> you<00:03:19.510> or<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.870> or

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
then ABCDEF and that you or the or

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.450 
then ABCDEF and that you or the or
something<00:03:20.260> like<00:03:20.470> that

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
something like that

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.700 
something like that
but<00:03:21.790> anyway<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:22.720> it'll<00:03:23.080> tell<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.500> which<00:03:23.650> ones

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
but anyway so it'll tell you which ones

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.670 
but anyway so it'll tell you which ones
to<00:03:24.340> solder<00:03:24.610> your<00:03:24.820> controller<00:03:25.410> cables<00:03:26.410> into

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
to solder your controller cables into

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.410 
to solder your controller cables into
and<00:03:27.160> generally<00:03:27.610> what<00:03:27.790> you're<00:03:27.910> gonna<00:03:28.000> do<00:03:28.270> is

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
and generally what you're gonna do is

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.030 
and generally what you're gonna do is
you're<00:03:28.540> gonna<00:03:28.600> have<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.110> sacrifice<00:03:29.380> either

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
you're gonna have to sacrifice either

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.970 
you're gonna have to sacrifice either
controller<00:03:30.670> or<00:03:31.200> preferably<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.350> controller

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
controller or preferably a controller

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.060 
controller or preferably a controller
extension<00:03:33.730> cable<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.420> those<00:03:35.200> can<00:03:35.440> usually<00:03:35.590> be

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
extension cable and those can usually be

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.490 
extension cable and those can usually be
had<00:03:36.310> pretty<00:03:36.760> cheap<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.300> then<00:03:37.990> you<00:03:38.110> just<00:03:38.320> cut

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
had pretty cheap and then you just cut

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.320 
had pretty cheap and then you just cut
the<00:03:38.620> end<00:03:38.770> off<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.340> they'll<00:03:39.460> tell<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.700> you

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
the end off and they'll tell you you

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.510 
the end off and they'll tell you you
know<00:03:40.450> where<00:03:40.720> where<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.500> solder<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.950> wires<00:03:42.160> in

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
know where where to solder the wires in

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.360 
know where where to solder the wires in
so<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:43.630> is<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:44.020> is<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.230> pretty<00:03:44.440> cool<00:03:44.739> kind<00:03:45.310> of

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
so this is this is a pretty cool kind of

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.160 
so this is this is a pretty cool kind of
all-in-one<00:03:45.910> solution<00:03:46.120> if<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.660> got<00:03:46.810> multiple

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
all-in-one solution if you got multiple

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.900 
all-in-one solution if you got multiple
consoles<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.190> want<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.459> have<00:03:48.580> one

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
consoles that you want to have one

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.330 
consoles that you want to have one
controller<00:03:49.420> for<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.110> just<00:03:50.890> build<00:03:51.070> a<00:03:51.190> nice

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
controller for and just build a nice

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.729 
controller for and just build a nice
solid<00:03:51.850> one<00:03:52.030> for<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:53.050> let's<00:03:53.230> get<00:03:53.380> this<00:03:53.530> put

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
solid one for it so let's get this put

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.100 
solid one for it so let's get this put
in<00:03:53.800> our<00:03:53.920> controller

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
in our controller

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.560 
in our controller
alright<00:03:56.110> so<00:03:56.320> quickly<00:03:56.709> before<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:57.459> install<00:03:58.360> this

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
alright so quickly before I install this

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.270 
alright so quickly before I install this
and<00:03:58.810> show<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.080> guys<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.290> result<00:03:59.800> just<00:04:00.070> in

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
and show you guys the result just in

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.550 
and show you guys the result just in
case<00:04:00.459> any<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:01.060> are<00:04:01.180> wondering<00:04:01.390> about<00:04:01.720> the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
case any of you are wondering about the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.500 
case any of you are wondering about the
the<00:04:02.890> wiring<00:04:03.340> or<00:04:03.459> anything<00:04:03.670> I'm<00:04:03.940> assuming<00:04:04.330> most

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
the wiring or anything I'm assuming most

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.210 
the wiring or anything I'm assuming most
of<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:04.810> probably<00:04:05.290> understand<00:04:05.860> how<00:04:06.040> all<00:04:06.190> this

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
of you probably understand how all this

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.870 
of you probably understand how all this
works<00:04:06.640> but<00:04:06.940> I'm<00:04:07.060> going<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.300> just<00:04:07.510> give<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.690> very

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
works but I'm going to just give a very

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.610 
works but I'm going to just give a very
sort<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:09.940> quick<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.300> dirty<00:04:10.380> tutorial<00:04:11.380> for

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
sort of quick and dirty tutorial for

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.590 
sort of quick and dirty tutorial for
anyone<00:04:11.890> who<00:04:12.040> may<00:04:12.220> be<00:04:12.250> just<00:04:12.580> brand<00:04:13.060> new<00:04:13.209> at<00:04:13.480> all

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
anyone who may be just brand new at all

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.560 
anyone who may be just brand new at all
of<00:04:13.780> this<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:14.920> actually<00:04:15.340> have<00:04:15.700> your<00:04:15.970> arcade

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
of this so you actually have your arcade

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.770 
of this so you actually have your arcade
button<00:04:16.870> here<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.760> you'll<00:04:18.760> notice<00:04:19.270> that<00:04:19.540> there

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
button here and you'll notice that there

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.810 
button here and you'll notice that there
are<00:04:20.020> two<00:04:20.410> terminals<00:04:20.680> on<00:04:21.100> there<00:04:21.340> that<00:04:21.520> you<00:04:21.549> want

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
are two terminals on there that you want

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.540 
are two terminals on there that you want
to<00:04:21.910> connect<00:04:22.210> wires<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.900> now<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:23.890> recommend

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
to connect wires to now I recommend

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.909 
to connect wires to now I recommend
using<00:04:25.590> this<00:04:26.590> will<00:04:26.800> focus<00:04:27.160> here<00:04:28.410> these<00:04:29.410> quick

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
using this will focus here these quick

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.480 
using this will focus here these quick
release<00:04:30.510> connectors<00:04:31.510> here<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:33.070> can<00:04:33.220> find

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
release connectors here and you can find

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.880 
release connectors here and you can find
these<00:04:33.669> pretty<00:04:34.030> easily<00:04:34.240> pretty<00:04:34.780> cheaply<00:04:35.590> it

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
these pretty easily pretty cheaply it

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.350 
these pretty easily pretty cheaply it
like<00:04:36.010> a<00:04:36.040> Radio<00:04:36.400> Shack<00:04:36.460> or<00:04:36.880> something<00:04:37.210> like

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
like a Radio Shack or something like

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.530 
like a Radio Shack or something like
that<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:38.400> then<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.580> just<00:04:39.640> sort<00:04:40.180> of<00:04:40.240> slide

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
that and then you just sort of slide

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.140 
that and then you just sort of slide
them<00:04:40.750> on<00:04:40.900> like<00:04:41.169> that<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:42.280> it's<00:04:42.640> it's<00:04:42.910> really

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
them on like that and it's it's really

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.120 
them on like that and it's it's really
easy<00:04:43.480> to<00:04:43.750> sort<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:44.050> change<00:04:44.290> stuff<00:04:44.590> around<00:04:44.860> if

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
easy to sort of change stuff around if

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.830 
easy to sort of change stuff around if
you<00:04:45.220> did<00:04:45.370> something<00:04:45.729> wrong<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.000> can<00:04:46.360> fix<00:04:46.630> it

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
you did something wrong you can fix it

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.130 
you did something wrong you can fix it
that<00:04:47.050> sort<00:04:47.350> of<00:04:47.410> thing

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
that sort of thing

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.510 
that sort of thing
so<00:04:48.970> basically<00:04:49.970> what<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.300> want<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.630> do<00:04:50.810> is<00:04:51.520> your

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
so basically what you want to do is your

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.300 
so basically what you want to do is your
Cthulhu<00:04:53.120> will<00:04:53.360> have<00:04:53.540> several<00:04:54.380> ground<00:04:54.800> points

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
Cthulhu will have several ground points

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.270 
Cthulhu will have several ground points
on<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:56.450> they're<00:04:57.080> all<00:04:57.260> Commons<00:04:57.830> that<00:04:58.040> means

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
on it and they're all Commons that means

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.090 
on it and they're all Commons that means
they're<00:04:58.460> all<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.730> same<00:04:58.760> same<00:04:59.600> thing<00:05:00.100> so

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
they're all the same same thing so

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.310 
they're all the same same thing so
you'll<00:05:01.220> take<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.460> ground<00:05:01.760> and<00:05:02.320> you'll

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
you'll take the ground and you'll

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.280 
you'll take the ground and you'll
connect<00:05:03.800> your<00:05:04.370> ground<00:05:05.270> wires<00:05:05.600> into<00:05:06.110> the

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
connect your ground wires into the

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.310 
connect your ground wires into the
various<00:05:06.740> grounds<00:05:07.420> and<00:05:08.420> you<00:05:08.720> can<00:05:08.870> even<00:05:09.020> do<00:05:09.290> it

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
various grounds and you can even do it

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.920 
various grounds and you can even do it
if<00:05:09.710> you<00:05:09.950> if<00:05:10.220> you<00:05:10.370> have<00:05:10.610> one<00:05:10.640> of<00:05:10.880> these

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
if you if you have one of these

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.290 
if you if you have one of these
unfortunately<00:05:12.920> mine<00:05:13.100> only<00:05:13.340> has<00:05:13.460> two<00:05:13.850> ends<00:05:14.060> on

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
unfortunately mine only has two ends on

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.070 
unfortunately mine only has two ends on
it<00:05:14.330> but<00:05:15.110> as<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.440> can<00:05:15.560> see<00:05:15.860> here<00:05:16.720> this<00:05:17.720> these

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
it but as you can see here this these

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.990 
it but as you can see here this these
two<00:05:18.320> wires<00:05:18.560> are<00:05:18.860> actually<00:05:19.250> both<00:05:19.430> going<00:05:19.730> to<00:05:19.760> the

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
two wires are actually both going to the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000 
two wires are actually both going to the
same<00:05:20.210> thing<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.810> then<00:05:21.020> it<00:05:21.170> just<00:05:21.380> jumps<00:05:21.740> to<00:05:21.890> the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
same thing and then it just jumps to the

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.070 
same thing and then it just jumps to the
next<00:05:22.310> one<00:05:22.520> now<00:05:23.120> you<00:05:23.240> can<00:05:23.360> actually<00:05:23.480> buy<00:05:23.840> these

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
next one now you can actually buy these

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.900 
next one now you can actually buy these
two<00:05:24.290> where<00:05:24.410> they<00:05:24.530> jump<00:05:24.830> to<00:05:24.950> several<00:05:25.400> you<00:05:25.760> know

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
two where they jump to several you know

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.990 
two where they jump to several you know
several<00:05:26.510> in<00:05:26.780> a<00:05:26.870> row<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.620> you<00:05:28.310> can<00:05:28.460> actually<00:05:28.640> do

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
several in a row and you can actually do

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.850 
several in a row and you can actually do
that<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.450> just<00:05:29.630> hook<00:05:29.750> up<00:05:29.870> one<00:05:30.170> wire<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.740> the

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
that and just hook up one wire to the

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.070 
that and just hook up one wire to the
ground<00:05:31.130> and<00:05:31.490> then<00:05:31.790> you<00:05:31.970> send<00:05:32.300> send<00:05:32.810> it<00:05:32.930> to

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
ground and then you send send it to

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.040 
ground and then you send send it to
every<00:05:33.880> every<00:05:34.880> button<00:05:35.090> that<00:05:35.420> you<00:05:35.510> have<00:05:35.750> just

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
every every button that you have just

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.630 
every every button that you have just
one<00:05:36.290> of<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.500> terminals<00:05:36.920> doesn't<00:05:37.340> make<00:05:37.460> any

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
one of the terminals doesn't make any

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.320 
one of the terminals doesn't make any
difference<00:05:37.760> which<00:05:39.040> and<00:05:40.040> so<00:05:40.070> if<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.670> have<00:05:40.850> the

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
difference which and so if you have the

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.970 
difference which and so if you have the
ground<00:05:41.570> hooked<00:05:41.810> up<00:05:41.990> what<00:05:42.380> it<00:05:42.500> does<00:05:42.650> is<00:05:42.860> it

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
ground hooked up what it does is it

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.890 
ground hooked up what it does is it
sends<00:05:43.190> a<00:05:43.340> low-level<00:05:43.700> signal<00:05:44.270> to<00:05:44.480> all<00:05:44.630> of<00:05:44.780> your

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
sends a low-level signal to all of your

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.250 
sends a low-level signal to all of your
buttons<00:05:45.230> and<00:05:45.590> so<00:05:46.340> they're<00:05:46.490> all<00:05:46.610> there<00:05:46.850> and

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
buttons and so they're all there and

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.920 
buttons and so they're all there and
then<00:05:48.260> you<00:05:48.530> get<00:05:48.680> your<00:05:48.830> other<00:05:49.040> wire<00:05:49.370> and<00:05:49.870> say<00:05:50.870> you

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
then you get your other wire and say you

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.680 
then you get your other wire and say you
know<00:05:51.260> let's<00:05:51.530> just<00:05:51.620> pretend<00:05:51.920> for<00:05:52.490> you<00:05:53.360> know<00:05:53.450> for

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
know let's just pretend for you know for

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.230 
know let's just pretend for you know for
chuckles<00:05:54.050> that<00:05:54.230> this<00:05:54.380> is<00:05:54.560> button<00:05:55.070> one<00:05:55.280> so

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
chuckles that this is button one so

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.780 
chuckles that this is button one so
you'll<00:05:56.660> it'll<00:05:57.050> take<00:05:57.320> your<00:06:00.400> Quick<00:06:01.400> Connect

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
you'll it'll take your Quick Connect

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.780 
you'll it'll take your Quick Connect
here<00:06:02.150> and<00:06:03.010> you'll<00:06:04.010> hook<00:06:04.220> that<00:06:04.400> up<00:06:04.460> to<00:06:04.700> the

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
here and you'll hook that up to the

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.340 
here and you'll hook that up to the
other<00:06:04.940> side<00:06:05.240> we'll<00:06:05.540> pretend<00:06:05.900> that<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.140> ground

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
other side we'll pretend that the ground

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.590 
other side we'll pretend that the ground
is<00:06:06.530> coming<00:06:06.860> out<00:06:06.980> of<00:06:07.100> there<00:06:07.250> and<00:06:07.490> then<00:06:08.270> you'll

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
is coming out of there and then you'll

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.620 
is coming out of there and then you'll
put<00:06:08.930> this<00:06:09.080> into<00:06:09.410> the<00:06:09.800> button<00:06:10.190> one<00:06:10.630> terminal

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
put this into the button one terminal

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.120 
put this into the button one terminal
and<00:06:11.840> you'll<00:06:12.110> screw<00:06:12.410> it<00:06:12.500> down<00:06:12.650> make<00:06:12.950> sure<00:06:12.980> it's

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
and you'll screw it down make sure it's

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.580 
and you'll screw it down make sure it's
good<00:06:13.400> and<00:06:13.430> tight<00:06:13.550> and<00:06:14.210> then<00:06:14.960> your<00:06:15.110> ground<00:06:15.380> will

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
good and tight and then your ground will

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.460 
good and tight and then your ground will
actually<00:06:15.950> send<00:06:16.190> a<00:06:16.430> low<00:06:16.700> low<00:06:17.600> level<00:06:17.900> signal<00:06:18.320> to

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
actually send a low low level signal to

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.030 
actually send a low low level signal to
this<00:06:18.620> and<00:06:18.940> when<00:06:19.940> you<00:06:19.970> push<00:06:20.240> the<00:06:20.390> button<00:06:20.630> down

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
this and when you push the button down

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.470 
this and when you push the button down
it's<00:06:22.040> just<00:06:22.130> like<00:06:22.340> that<00:06:22.580> old<00:06:22.640> you<00:06:23.240> know<00:06:23.330> that

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
it's just like that old you know that

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.540 
it's just like that old you know that
old<00:06:23.630> experiment<00:06:24.530> in<00:06:24.650> science<00:06:25.040> class<00:06:25.310> with<00:06:25.520> a

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
old experiment in science class with a

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.170 
old experiment in science class with a
light<00:06:25.760> bulb

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
light bulb

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.090 
light bulb
you<00:06:26.360> just<00:06:26.570> complete<00:06:26.930> the<00:06:27.080> circuit<00:06:27.500> and<00:06:27.680> it'll

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
you just complete the circuit and it'll

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.320 
you just complete the circuit and it'll
send<00:06:28.880> the<00:06:29.030> signal<00:06:29.420> back<00:06:29.690> and<00:06:30.050> that's<00:06:30.710> how<00:06:31.330> you

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
send the signal back and that's how you

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.000 
send the signal back and that's how you
know<00:06:32.450> it'll<00:06:32.660> know<00:06:32.810> that<00:06:33.020> youth<00:06:33.200> you've<00:06:33.650> mashed

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
know it'll know that youth you've mashed

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.080 
know it'll know that youth you've mashed
the<00:06:34.280> button<00:06:34.610> so<00:06:36.220> all<00:06:37.220> you<00:06:37.370> have<00:06:37.490> to<00:06:37.580> do<00:06:37.730> is<00:06:37.850> send

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
the button so all you have to do is send

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.210 
the button so all you have to do is send
all<00:06:38.210> your<00:06:38.390> grounds<00:06:38.870> to<00:06:39.080> to<00:06:39.470> the<00:06:39.860> various

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
all your grounds to to the various

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.430 
all your grounds to to the various
buttons<00:06:40.490> and<00:06:40.940> then<00:06:41.630> of<00:06:41.720> course<00:06:41.960> you<00:06:42.200> have

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
buttons and then of course you have

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.440 
buttons and then of course you have
these<00:06:43.160> sorts<00:06:43.460> of<00:06:43.520> connectors<00:06:44.000> for<00:06:44.390> your

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
these sorts of connectors for your

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.300 
these sorts of connectors for your
joysticks<00:06:45.230> they're<00:06:45.470> all<00:06:45.620> a<00:06:45.650> little<00:06:45.800> different

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
joysticks they're all a little different

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.180 
joysticks they're all a little different
but<00:06:46.460> usually<00:06:46.880> the<00:06:47.030> black<00:06:47.240> is<00:06:47.480> the<00:06:47.510> ground<00:06:48.190> and

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
but usually the black is the ground and

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.010 
but usually the black is the ground and
then<00:06:49.340> you<00:06:49.460> can<00:06:49.610> work<00:06:49.790> your<00:06:50.000> way<00:06:50.180> over<00:06:50.540> from

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
then you can work your way over from

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.840 
then you can work your way over from
there<00:06:51.260> just<00:06:51.560> test<00:06:51.770> them<00:06:51.920> out<00:06:52.100> see<00:06:52.490> which<00:06:52.610> one

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
there just test them out see which one

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.090 
there just test them out see which one
does<00:06:53.750> what<00:06:54.050> so<00:06:54.290> let's<00:06:54.470> get<00:06:54.590> this<00:06:54.710> thing<00:06:54.920> wired

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
does what so let's get this thing wired

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.210 
does what so let's get this thing wired

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
I met at a very awkward angle here so

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.700 
I met at a very awkward angle here so
first<00:07:09.300> things<00:07:09.630> first<00:07:09.780> we'll<00:07:10.200> try<00:07:10.350> out<00:07:10.530> our

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710 
first things first we'll try out our

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:16.370 
first things first we'll try out our
coin<00:07:11.160> insert<00:07:11.490> button<00:07:11.730> and<00:07:14.900> that<00:07:15.900> seems<00:07:16.170> to<00:07:16.320> be

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 
coin insert button and that seems to be

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.450 
coin insert button and that seems to be
working<00:07:16.680> fine<00:07:16.860> and<00:07:19.070> there's<00:07:20.070> our<00:07:20.160> Start

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
working fine and there's our Start

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.120 
working fine and there's our Start
button<00:07:20.870> so<00:07:21.870> hopefully<00:07:22.320> you<00:07:22.410> can<00:07:22.500> see<00:07:22.890> all<00:07:23.100> of

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.130

button so hopefully you can see all of
this<00:07:23.510> so<00:07:24.510> we're<00:07:24.630> going<00:07:24.750> to<00:07:24.810> try<00:07:25.050> the<00:07:25.110> stick<00:07:25.500> out

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.130 
this so we're going to try the stick out

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.910 
this so we're going to try the stick out
seems<00:07:26.820> to<00:07:26.970> be<00:07:27.000> working<00:07:27.390> fine<00:07:27.660> fire<00:07:28.530> button
