want from a microphone without having to

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.170 
want from a microphone without having to
step<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> microphone<00:00:19.680> stand<00:00:19.970> we<00:00:20.970> soon

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
step up to the microphone stand we soon

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.460 
step up to the microphone stand we soon
found<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.540> it<00:00:21.630> worked<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> lot<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.260> other

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
found that it worked on a lot of other

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.920 
found that it worked on a lot of other
instruments<00:00:23.070> including<00:00:23.610> resonators<00:00:24.270> and<00:00:24.510> we

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
instruments including resonators and we

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.240 
instruments including resonators and we
have<00:00:25.020> a<00:00:25.050> guy<00:00:25.200> from<00:00:25.320> California<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.040> called

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
have a guy from California that called

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.920 
have a guy from California that called
and<00:00:26.490> suggested<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.120> he<00:00:27.210> had<00:00:27.330> used<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.720> his

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
and suggested that he had used it on his

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.410 
and suggested that he had used it on his
bass<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.220> sounded<00:00:29.520> incredible<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
bass and it sounded incredible the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.030 
bass and it sounded incredible the
meantime<00:00:30.630> we're<00:00:31.260> using<00:00:31.530> it<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
meantime we're using it on the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.530 
meantime we're using it on the
percussion<00:00:32.640> products<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> lot<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
percussion products and a lot of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.240 
percussion products and a lot of
different<00:00:33.870> things<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.559> definitely<00:00:34.950> gives<00:00:35.070> you

the freedom of not being strapped to

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.239 
the freedom of not being strapped to
that<00:00:36.839> microphone<00:00:37.230> stance<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.129> can

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249 
that microphone stance so that you can

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.040 
that microphone stance so that you can
move<00:00:38.399> around<00:00:38.519> freely<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.120> stage<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.780> still

move around freely on stage and still
have<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.440> pure<00:00:40.649> acoustic<00:00:40.890> tonality<00:00:41.249> that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
have that pure acoustic tonality that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.810 
have that pure acoustic tonality that
you're<00:00:41.789> looking<00:00:41.999> for<00:00:43.100> so<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.309> mentioned<00:00:44.670> we

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you're looking for so as I mentioned we

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000 
you're looking for so as I mentioned we
have<00:00:45.059> two<00:00:45.089> systems<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.839> first<00:00:45.989> being<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.530> ABS

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
have two systems the first being the ABS

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.889 
have two systems the first being the ABS
system<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.179> a<00:00:48.210> dynamic<00:00:48.420> microphone

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
system which is a dynamic microphone

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.829 
system which is a dynamic microphone
very<00:00:49.440> similar<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.980> sound<00:00:50.249> to<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> shure<00:00:51.269> sm57

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
very similar in sound to a shure sm57

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.660 
very similar in sound to a shure sm57
which<00:00:52.260> has<00:00:52.409> been<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> mic<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.249> choice<00:00:53.460> for

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
which has been the mic of choice for

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.360 
which has been the mic of choice for
acoustic<00:00:54.030> players<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.719> long<00:00:54.989> long<00:00:55.199> time<00:00:55.440> it

phantom power supply to accomplish that
the<00:01:44.789> phantom<00:01:45.090> power<00:01:45.210> supply<00:01:45.539> is<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:45.689> included

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the phantom power supply is not included

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.660 
the phantom power supply is not included
in<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> system<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.280> readily<00:01:47.520> available

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
in the system but it's readily available

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.999 
in the system but it's readily available
on<00:01:48.090> almost<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.719> acoustic<00:01:49.049> amplifiers<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
on almost all acoustic amplifiers and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340 
on almost all acoustic amplifiers and
professional<00:01:50.700> sound<00:01:50.909> systems<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.109> using

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
professional sound systems so it's using

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
professional sound systems so it's using
a<00:01:52.409> low<00:01:52.560> impedance<00:01:52.799> three<00:01:53.429> pin<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.880> connector

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
a low impedance three pin can connector

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.179 
a low impedance three pin can connector
output<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.170> any<00:01:55.560> other<00:01:55.679> microphone

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
output just like any other microphone

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.969 
output just like any other microphone
that<00:01:56.310> you'd<00:01:56.429> normally<00:01:56.579> use<00:01:56.789> and<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:58.619> sounds

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that you'd normally use and it sounds

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.830 
that you'd normally use and it sounds
incredible<00:01:59.460> both<00:01:59.670> systems<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.210> very<00:02:00.479> very

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
incredible both systems are very very

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.169 
incredible both systems are very very
very<00:02:01.320> good<00:02:01.619> sounding<00:02:02.159> systems<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.759> give<00:02:03.090> you

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
very good sounding systems and give you

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.669 
very good sounding systems and give you
that<00:02:03.359> natural<00:02:03.570> acoustic<00:02:04.140> sound<00:02:04.380> again

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
that natural acoustic sound again

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:05.959 
that natural acoustic sound again
without<00:02:04.859> having<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.340> strapped<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
without having to be strapped to a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.090 
without having to be strapped to a
microphone<00:02:06.390> stand

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
microphone stand

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.889 
microphone stand
okay<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:08.160> whether<00:02:08.520> you're<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> banjo<00:02:09.330> player<00:02:09.570> a

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
okay so whether you're a banjo player a

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.060 
okay so whether you're a banjo player a
resonant<00:02:10.649> guy

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
resonant guy

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.309 
resonant guy
upright<00:02:11.790> bass<00:02:11.970> player<00:02:12.270> hand<00:02:12.659> percussionist

upright bass player hand percussionist
there's<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.800> lot<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.099> uses<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:14.580> my

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
there's a lot of uses for this my

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.700 
there's a lot of uses for this my
and<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.780> strongly<00:02:16.050> suggest<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.620> you

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
and we strongly suggest that you

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.320 
and we strongly suggest that you
investigated<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.460> maybe<00:02:17.640> just<00:02:18.000> what<00:02:18.180> you've

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
investigated it maybe just what you've

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.750 
investigated it maybe just what you've
been<00:02:18.420> looking<00:02:18.570> for
