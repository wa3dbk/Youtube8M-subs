 today we are here in the studios of the vesticon group with selective process 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:20.410
 banks have been working in banks since 1978 if 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.970
 retired from the brazilian bank in 2005 to tell you a little more than it is 

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:27.140
 clerk wants to work 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.829
 packaged and mainly on the left foot 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.940
 as protection 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.930

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:38.670
 to pass more information 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.390
 those people interested in public tenders for Benedict XVI 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.250
 special this contest 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 the bank of brasilia 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.070
 I do what are the roles that couples decide 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.960
 the area within the banking activity both in the private bank and 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.159
 of the public bank 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.269
 it basically has the functions of serving people 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.159
 Customer Service 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.109
 and also always some internal tasks 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.080
 and cites the basic work 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.290
 two headlines 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.290
 and what are the benefits of working at Banco de Brasilia 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.820
 the bank of Brazil following a pattern that we observe in public banks 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.050
 both from the brazilian bank or from the savings bank 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.140
 the brazilian bank offers some additional benefits for your 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.820
 between them we can highlight the food aid 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.540
 aid to help those who are studying a portion a percentage of the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.109
 monthly payment 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.979
 of private universities 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.870
 an assistance plan 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.450
 health care 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.729
 a plan d after the complementary report 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.810
 to the end of growth for women who work there and who became pregnant 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.790
 and also 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.060
 the driver and a bit more maternity leave so that the mothers 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.750
 able to adequately meet their newborn 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.369
 profit sharing also 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.290
 and remembered 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.600
 half-yearly when it has a result of the bank not only 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.939
 the brazilian cube but the brazilian wind also has this practice 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.260
 employees have the participation called 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.249
 lr 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.499
 participation in profit and 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:14.199
 is the discipline that is thought to be the differential with the form that the student 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.429
 should give 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.359
 within this edict tries to stand out from others 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.569
 candidates not only in this edict but all edital 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.600
 for the public 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.859
 the matter that makes the difference 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.019
 that matter with the Turkish in Telavive 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.749
 bank knowledge without a shadow of a doubt 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.340
 so much so that we would have believed each other 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.750
 repeat what happened 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.919
 last year 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.790
 of the 70 specific knowledge issues 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.520
 we had 50 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.310
 afterwards Carlos 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.170
 and we had 20 math questions 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.070
 so I ask for a differential 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.100
 is one that dominates banking knowledge in search of knowledge 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.359
 bank that here 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.409
 usually channels of proposals 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.430
 in general not only to ct but all plants the foundation 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.379
 pro-closed cesgranrio 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.499
 there is a tendency there is no escape 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.460
 the content 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.680
 very broad but there is always some question or some questions 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.139
 involving national monetary council 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.860
 Brazilian central bank 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.260
 cvm securities commission this 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.120
 there is not 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.220
 escape in addition in the previous test we realized that the csp 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.200
 relationship with the Brazilian pib do not know if it was a request directed the bank 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.049
 from Brasilia 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.620
 but we are afraid 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.710
 an 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.900
 participation with a presence a very strong collection of several 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.639
 questions 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.219
 involving the foreign exchange market 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.859
 we represent all these endings that are posted in the salon in questions 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.839
 said in this interview 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:46.639
 I wanted to emphasize 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.890
 what is foreseen in the edict 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.209
 with the approval relation the candidate to be approved 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.919
 he will have to hit at least 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.689
 10 question 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.980
 basic knowledge 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.980
 it will have 50 questions and it will have to hit at least 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.809
 ten questions 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:08.650
 in addition he will have to hit at least 21 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.800
 one questions 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.320
 of specific knowledge it will have 70 questions of knowledge 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.310
 specific 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.299
 and you will need to hit at least 21 questions 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.259
 for those who have not been eliminated from the face 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.039
 very well but not correct 10 questions of basic knowledge and another twenty 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.470
 and one of knowledge 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.670
 specific 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.900
 the summation 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.950
 dark 31 hits and then he will no longer meet a third predicted condition 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.290
 in the edict is foreseen in the edict that to be approved the candidate will have home 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.250
 have guessed 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.449
 at least 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.169
 36 questions 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.300
 in general terms 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.890
 evolving specific knowledge and basic knowledge 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.440
 of 120 questions 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.599
 the candidate on which 36 seats to be approved and the next 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:55.820
 last year 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.640
 the rule also analyzes was predicted that the ucs that bdp can get 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.839
 to rank 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:04.889
 about one thousand two hundred people 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.219
 and only five hundred were classified in twenty-two persons 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.430
 and did the one who reached the minimum 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.680
 whoever gets about 36 issues was called and it would probably be done 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.900
 is today 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.729
 Working 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:19.889
 in the bank of brasilia 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.569
 then the big media box that the examining bank is the ctp is the candidate 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:30.169
 be very attentive that exactly marks only those questions that he judges 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.569
 and comes to the conclusion with conviction with certainty and that he is 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.120
 right or wrong 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.970
 why does he sign anything incorrectly other than not telling the 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.860
 punctuation of that question it will lose a point it will nullify a 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.180
 question that I had previously agreed on then I will try to be 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.930
 be properly prepared 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.990
 team in the sense of this with all teachers of all ages. 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.940

 we will be able to prepare you properly were not our 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.580
 costs but also in our video lessons

 of the community that keeps it on orkut 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.599
