00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.839
 laser young is familiar to most 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.380
 like a laser pointer portable 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.709
 monochromatic alternator 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.469
 electromagnetic waves apparently range 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:16.710
 seeing narrowly focused 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.419
 beam in most cases in cook 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.029
 metsos based on reddish 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.269
 audio data which studies in the range 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.039
 from 600 mexico five 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.320
 up to 617 nanometers lingual what awaits 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.050
 emitter directionality subsided 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.419
 start learning 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.039
 falls on the inner walls 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.909
 enclosures and absorbed in this regard as 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.430
 feed on the module is quite low 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.190
 for organizing the study of Russian 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.440
 credentials are generally used 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.230
 two supposedly coupe lenses with climate 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.680
 most often in the eyes of the mod used 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.260
 red laser diode tears 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.660
 and a small fee for power management 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.970
 for such laser pointers enough 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.300
 power from conventional tablet batteries 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.750
 cost at the moment 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.380
 just over one dollar 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.470
 green laser pointers started 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 sold only in 2006 is the most 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.950
 common type of solid-state 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.770
 lasers made pumped because without 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.180
 funds 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.550
 green laser diodes days 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.490
 be made therefore used 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.550
 another device scheme is much 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.010
 harder than usual kraz 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.920
 semiconductor lasers 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.640
 green color is pretty 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370
 bulky way 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.060
 At first, they usually put more power into the arch. 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.480
 infrared laser diode length 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.630
 waves of 808 nanometers pump up the crystal 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.720
 Photo Mandate Games 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.590
 seregin register during the study 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.690
 converted look for 4 nanometers 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.130
 then passing through the crystal 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.399
 potassium phosphate danil delivery project 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.780
 divided by two 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.060
 1004 at the time of termination 532 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.010
 ok, it turns out again apparently 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.690
 the green light about this circuit is just 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.240
 about twenty percent 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.750
 most of it falls on 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.500
 a combination of ask co-creators 2010 4 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.119
 percent 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.799
 on the helmet helmets 53 times more 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.549
 you need to stop the infrared filter 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.709
 to remove leftovers to study avoid 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.949
 eye damage 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.009
 let's take a look at the device of such 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.009
 module in your own eyes 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.399
 further outer body its origin 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.539
 but 3 can be seen 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:34.989
 typical laser mode 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.450
 here is this sdhc class acceptance competition here 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.680
 necessary because so the power given 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.730
 module is 52 year old 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.730
 they are quite noticeably heated 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:48.480
 vs 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.480
 scientific principles striking focus 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.129
 here we can find 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.169
 converter 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.679
 changed radiation 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.869
 on top of which 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.279
 Kalimat is located 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.409
 module 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.039
 emitting in infrared light 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:14.059
 and photo diode for feedback with his 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.169
 power board 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.979
 admitting no matter let's 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.309
 let's turn on and see how 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:24.309
 color he radiates 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.549
 so notice very hard 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.549
 as you can see a slightly red color 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.249
 the purity of the radiation is very close 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.249
 infrared spectrum 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.089
 let's try 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:48.839
 substitute the converter and 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.229
 see what happens 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.229
 here we get bright green radiation 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.599
 parsing designs looks about 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.599
 in the following way 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.219
 top down 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.219
 put climate 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.579
 all this beauty is hidden 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.199
 then focusing closes 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.199
 basically 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.390
 and placed in the body in Surgut matches 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.889
 driving 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.889
 in the end we get green this year 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.379
 superior magomed is produced 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:34.620
 evloev flowers 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.880
 for example green paint price is equal to 500 32 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.430
 nanometer good alternative red 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.610
 price you 635 on stamps since 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.850
 human eye 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.540
 about 6 thousand times 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.570
 more sensitive to the northern neighbor 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.979
 Soros opinion 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.099
 lately gaining 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.370
 popularity 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.659
 yellow orange vase 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.099
 length is 500 for us regrettable on 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.129
 wealth 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.340
 mission fall on 24 7 parking
