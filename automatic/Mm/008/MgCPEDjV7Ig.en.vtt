00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.710
 hello friends here we have everything prepared 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.740
 to make our shoulder of lamb 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.840
 based here you see we have this whole 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.370
 although it has some cuts here but the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.550
 The whole piece can also be made 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.410
 chopped this to taste and we will use 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.680
 here we have 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:35.600
 and water white wine pepper two leaves 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.950
 old thyme laurel with all with 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.460
 all these ingredients we are going to 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.460
 prepare our shoulder of lamb 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 grilled 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.340
 like this this particular day we're going 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.269
 to make in the wood oven 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.410
 let's use this this clay pot 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:00.710
 first step that we are going to make is going to be 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.710
 add a little water not much a little 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 rather than water we are going to take 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.430
 of white wine 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.310
 there we have it 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.490
 we add in the water the two leaves of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.490
 laurel 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.420
 a few sprigs of thyme this is going to give 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.420
 It will give you very good very good aroma 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.810
 and finally some cloves of garlic 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.140
 which we are going to do 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.140
 a few small cuts 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.710
 they are there 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.300
 with three or three or four 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.720
 they are enough 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.130
 but good to me how I like it 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.130
 very much down 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.190
 and it is and is very healthy that I recommend you 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.030
 take garlic 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.400
 here we have and now what we are going to 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.670
 do this is what we already have for 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.850
 place the meat now let's set aside and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.410
 let's pepper 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.410
 let's season the piece 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.020
 let's take salt for a side 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.129
 and we have and pepper 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.250
 to the same thing on the other side 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.209
 a little bit of salt 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.209
 the growth 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.840
 and we have it ready 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.990
 we take the source we present the part 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.600
 from outside the skin always below 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.890
 we present over 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.060
 and already with this without further 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.800
 we go to the oven to about 200 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.740
 degrees for you to calculate you already know that 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.550
 the wood oven is more difficult and is more 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:24.010
 difficult to calculate but more or less 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.970
 at about 200 degrees so we have it 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.970
 we are going to roll 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.020
 I just took our shoulder from 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.819
 oven takes 40 minutes and now what 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.500
 we're going to do is going to be turning it around 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.470
 we are going to turn it around 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.350
 so that it is done to us on this side that 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.120
 surely you will need something less than 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.630
 those 40 minutes he's had for the 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.990
 another side and we are going directly to the 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.990
 oven 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.790
 good that we have already taken our 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.730
 paletilla you see how it has been folded as 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.580
 had cuts on the other side now at 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.010
 be done here shrugs if I would not have 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.740
 cuts would come before it would come out more more 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.320
 straight but still just as good a lot 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.050
 easier to leave like this and you can see what 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.970
 it looks so fabulous we 're going to the 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.130
 table I hope you liked it and you see 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.169
 that super easy to do and even the 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.169
 next video goodbye
