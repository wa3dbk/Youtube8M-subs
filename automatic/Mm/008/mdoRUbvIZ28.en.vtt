your PHP dot ini to point to that file
this<00:02:39.739> should<00:02:40.040> work<00:02:40.220> if<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.819> doesn't<00:02:41.090> work<00:02:41.269> then

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
this should work if it doesn't work then

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.809 
this should work if it doesn't work then
I<00:02:42.019> check<00:02:42.950> you've<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.310> done<00:02:43.550> absolutely

Apache as well
so<00:02:48.470> inside<00:02:49.220> context<00:02:49.940> I'm<00:02:50.060> going<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.330> create<00:02:50.540> a

so inside context I'm going to create a
new<00:02:50.810> variable<00:02:51.049> called<00:02:51.590> browser<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.910> is

new variable called browser and this is

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.940 
new variable called browser and this is
going<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.269> be<00:02:53.360> equal<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.930> function<00:02:54.170> get

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
going to be equal to a function get

going to be equal to a function get
browser<00:02:56.769> now<00:02:57.769> this<00:02:58.069> function<00:02:58.430> takes<00:02:58.610> two

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
browser now this function takes two

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.420 
browser now this function takes two
arguments<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.750> first<00:02:59.930> argument<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.890> user

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
arguments the first argument is the user

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.340 
arguments the first argument is the user
agent<00:03:01.730> which<00:03:02.299> we<00:03:02.510> could<00:03:02.840> obtain<00:03:03.130> from<00:03:05.350> the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
agent which we could obtain from the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.670 
agent which we could obtain from the
dollar<00:03:06.860> underscore<00:03:07.280> server<00:03:10.239> HTTP<00:03:11.239> user<00:03:11.680> agent

dollar underscore server HTTP user agent

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.380 
dollar underscore server HTTP user agent
however<00:03:13.160> we're<00:03:13.489> not<00:03:13.640> going<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.910> do<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.209> we're

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
however we're not going to do that we're

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.599 
however we're not going to do that we're
just<00:03:14.420> going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.780> specify<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.859> value<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.340> null

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
just going to specify the value of null

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:22.870 
just going to specify the value of null
now<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.269> second<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:19.400> second<00:03:21.430> argument<00:03:22.430> that

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
now the second the second argument that

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.060 
now the second the second argument that
we<00:03:23.000> need<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.269> provide<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:24.170> whether<00:03:24.650> we<00:03:24.829> want

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
we need to provide is whether we want

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.430 
we need to provide is whether we want
this<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.340> be<00:03:25.370> returned<00:03:25.880> as<00:03:26.090> an<00:03:26.359> array<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:27.230> we

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
this to be returned as an array and we

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.440 
this to be returned as an array and we
do<00:03:27.590> want<00:03:27.799> this<00:03:27.859> to<00:03:28.010> be<00:03:28.100> 10<00:03:28.310> returned<00:03:29.209> as<00:03:29.329> an

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
do want this to be 10 returned as an

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.580 
do want this to be 10 returned as an
array<00:03:29.660> because<00:03:29.810> that's<00:03:30.140> how<00:03:30.290> we're<00:03:30.440> going<00:03:30.530> to

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
array because that's how we're going to

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.500 
array because that's how we're going to
use<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.890> later<00:03:31.010> on<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.790> just<00:03:32.000> simply<00:03:32.180> put

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
use it later on so you just simply put

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.720 
use it later on so you just simply put
true<00:03:32.810> here<00:03:33.079> can<00:03:33.500> put<00:03:33.620> 1<00:03:33.829> if<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.070> want<00:03:34.370> it's

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
true here can put 1 if you want it's

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.810 
true here can put 1 if you want it's
probably<00:03:34.970> just<00:03:35.060> better<00:03:35.329> to<00:03:35.600> put<00:03:35.780> true<00:03:36.130> so<00:03:37.130> how

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
probably just better to put true so how

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.520 
probably just better to put true so how
are<00:03:37.880> we<00:03:37.940> going<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.180> echo<00:03:38.510> out<00:03:38.540> all<00:03:39.109> of<00:03:39.350> the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
are we going to echo out all of the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.199 
are we going to echo out all of the
array<00:03:40.160> contents<00:03:40.760> well<00:03:40.880> we're<00:03:40.970> going<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.120> use

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
array contents well we're going to use

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.840 
array contents well we're going to use
the<00:03:41.420> print<00:03:41.750> off<00:03:41.959> this<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:43.370> we're<00:03:43.640> going<00:03:43.730> to

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
the print off this and we're going to

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.150 
the print off this and we're going to
obviously<00:03:43.970> put<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:45.470> browser<00:03:47.980> reference<00:03:48.980> to

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
obviously put the browser reference to

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.259 
obviously put the browser reference to
the<00:03:49.280> array<00:03:49.609> in<00:03:49.850> there

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
the array in there

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.059 
the array in there
so<00:03:50.720> now<00:03:50.840> let's<00:03:51.049> refresh<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.590> page<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:51.829> see

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
so now let's refresh the page and see

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.819 
so now let's refresh the page and see
what<00:03:52.310> happens<00:03:52.670> right<00:03:53.290> ok<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.350> you<00:03:54.530> can<00:03:54.590> see

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
what happens right ok so you can see

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.949 
what happens right ok so you can see

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
that it's returned quite a few bits of

we're going to look at how we can
extract<00:05:58.330> some<00:05:58.480> of<00:05:58.690> this<00:05:58.810> information<00:05:59.110> and

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
extract some of this information and

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.860 
extract some of this information and
detect<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.310> user's<00:06:00.580> browser<00:06:00.760> and<00:06:01.180> just<00:06:01.600> print

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
their browser is but we're not going to

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.390 
their browser is but we're not going to
give<00:06:05.620> them<00:06:05.710> any<00:06:05.860> of<00:06:05.980> this<00:06:06.100> rubbish

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
information we're basically going to

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.950 
information we're basically going to
give<00:06:08.260> them<00:06:08.440> it<00:06:08.620> a<00:06:09.010> single<00:06:09.820> a<00:06:10.150> single<00:06:12.690> string<00:06:13.690> so

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:30.729 
and we're going to use this some of this

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:33.330 
and we're going to use this some of this
information<00:06:31.330> to<00:06:31.810> detect<00:06:32.320> what<00:06:32.560> browser<00:06:32.830> the
