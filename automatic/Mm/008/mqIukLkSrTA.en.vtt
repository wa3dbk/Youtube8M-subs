want it to be kind of a thin bread
something<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.530> has<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> little<00:00:13.980> bit<00:00:14.160> of

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
something that has a little bit of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.700 
something that has a little bit of
sponges<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.109> don't<00:00:16.350> want<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> do<00:00:16.680> a

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
sponges to it so you don't want to do a

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.510 
sponges to it so you don't want to do a
rye<00:00:17.070> or<00:00:17.630> like<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> hard<00:00:18.990> bread<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.590> either<00:00:20.070> white

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
bread or I'm using a whole-wheat bread

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.620 
bread or I'm using a whole-wheat bread
would<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.090> fine

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
would be fine

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
would be fine
so<00:00:25.560> we're<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.189> cut<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.880> crusts<00:00:27.150> off<00:00:28.460> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
so we're going to cut the crusts off and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.620 
so we're going to cut the crusts off and
we're<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:29.910> set<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.240> off<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
we're going to just set them off to the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.690 
we're going to just set them off to the
side<00:00:30.740> we're<00:00:31.740> then<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> take<00:00:32.460> our

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
side we're then going to take our

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.400 
side we're then going to take our
rolling<00:00:32.969> pin<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> we're<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> roll<00:00:34.380> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
rolling pin and we're going to roll it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.979 
rolling pin and we're going to roll it
over<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.130> bread<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:36.300> squish<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.840> down

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
over the bread and just squish it down

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.940 
over the bread and just squish it down
as<00:00:37.320> loud<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.280> can

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
as loud as you can

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.030 
as loud as you can
we're<00:00:40.950> then<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> take<00:00:41.730> our<00:00:42.000> Nutella<00:00:42.480> or

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
we're then going to take our Nutella or

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.590 
we're then going to take our Nutella or
in<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.190> case<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.149> store-brand

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
in this case I just have the store-brand

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.650 
in this case I just have the store-brand
version<00:00:46.379> which<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.520> hazelnut<00:00:48.120> spread<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
version which is hazelnut spread and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.520 
version which is hazelnut spread and
we're<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.300> basically<00:00:51.300> spread<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
we're going to basically spread out a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.830 
we're going to basically spread out a
layer<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> way<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> piece<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> bread

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
layer all the way on the piece of bread

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.590 
layer all the way on the piece of bread
now<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.800> want<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> go<00:00:56.489> close<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.120> edge<00:00:57.360> but

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
now we want to go close to the edge but

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.510 
now we want to go close to the edge but
not<00:00:57.780> super<00:00:58.260> close<00:00:58.530> because<00:00:59.010> we're<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
not super close because we're going to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.479 
not super close because we're going to
have<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> little<00:01:00.510> bit<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.629> leakage<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.500> you

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
have a little bit of leakage and you

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.539 
have a little bit of leakage and you
want<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.439> thin<00:01:04.710> layer<00:01:05.010> kind<00:01:05.430> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
want to have the thin layer kind of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.570 
want to have the thin layer kind of
spread<00:01:05.820> throughout<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.960> don't<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.409> have

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
spread throughout you don't want to have

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.920 
spread throughout you don't want to have
super<00:01:08.580> thick<00:01:08.610> layer<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.479> again<00:01:09.720> it

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
super thick layer because again it

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.929 
super thick layer because again it
starts<00:01:10.290> once<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.130> start<00:01:11.340> rolling<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.760> up

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
starts once you start rolling this up

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.480 
starts once you start rolling this up
it's<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.570> come<00:01:12.869> out<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.369> just

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
it's going to all come out so it just

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.020 
it's going to all come out so it just
kind<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.760> as<00:01:15.509> close<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> edge<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.640> can

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
kind of as close to the edge as you can

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.630 
kind of as close to the edge as you can
just<00:01:18.869> something<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.460> we're

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
just something like that and then we're

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.410 
just something like that and then we're
going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.970> take<00:01:21.270> our<00:01:21.740> banana<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.030> prefer

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
going to take our banana and I do prefer

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.170 
going to take our banana and I do prefer
kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.780> riper<00:01:24.960> bananas<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:26.430> fresh<00:01:26.759> ones<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
kind of riper bananas then fresh ones I

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.480 
kind of riper bananas then fresh ones I
think<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.689> go<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> chocolate<00:01:29.070> taste

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
think they go with the chocolate taste

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.490 
think they go with the chocolate taste
much<00:01:29.729> better<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.750> wanted<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
much better and you wanted to kind of a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.069 
much better and you wanted to kind of a
smaller<00:01:31.860> banana<00:01:32.509> because<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.900> one

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
smaller banana because if you do one

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.039 
smaller banana because if you do one
that's<00:01:34.290> too<00:01:34.560> big<00:01:34.829> then<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.689> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that's too big then it's not going to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.410 
that's too big then it's not going to
fit<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.650> sandwich<00:01:37.950> very<00:01:38.159> well<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.270> we're

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
fit on the sandwich very well so we're

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.340 
fit on the sandwich very well so we're
going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:40.110> peel<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> entire<00:01:40.890> skin<00:01:41.280> off

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
going to just peel the entire skin off

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.469 
going to just peel the entire skin off
and<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:44.130> set<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.280> off<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> side<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
and just set that off to the side and

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.210 
and just set that off to the side and
we're<00:01:45.750> gonna<00:01:45.899> take<00:01:46.140> our<00:01:46.290> banana<00:01:46.590> literally

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
we're gonna take our banana literally

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.190 
we're gonna take our banana literally
just<00:01:47.430> stick<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:47.880> top<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.630> then

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
just stick it right on top and then

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
just stick it right on top and then
we're<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.860> start<00:01:50.640> rolling<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:53.119> as<00:01:54.119> I'm

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
we're going to start rolling and as I'm

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.200 
we're going to start rolling and as I'm

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
kind of sticks together nicely you'll

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.339 
kind of sticks together nicely you'll
notice<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.450> get<00:02:09.569> some<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> Nutella

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
notice you get some of the Nutella

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.570 
notice you get some of the Nutella
starting<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> come<00:02:11.220> out

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
starting to come out

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.000 
starting to come out
and<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.690> always<00:02:12.900> try<00:02:13.230> squishing<00:02:13.890> it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and you can always try squishing it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.370 
and you can always try squishing it
together<00:02:14.340> or<00:02:14.730> overlapping<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.810> as<00:02:15.990> best<00:02:16.260> as

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
together or overlapping it as best as

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.470 
together or overlapping it as best as
you<00:02:16.410> can<00:02:16.710> once<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.730> have<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> kind<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.270> press

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
you can once we have a kind of press

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.550 
you can once we have a kind of press
together<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:19.290> are<00:02:19.320> ready<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.100> start<00:02:20.340> cutting

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
together we are ready to start cutting

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.800 
together we are ready to start cutting
to<00:02:22.560> start<00:02:22.830> cutting<00:02:23.370> our<00:02:23.640> banana<00:02:24.120> roll<00:02:24.420> we're

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
to start cutting our banana roll we're

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.420 
to start cutting our banana roll we're
going<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.230> take<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> sharp<00:02:25.770> knife<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.220> we're

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
going to take a sharp knife and we're

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.910 
going to take a sharp knife and we're
going<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.640> saw<00:02:26.940> back<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.630> fourth<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.680> cut

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
going to saw back in the fourth to cut

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.100 
going to saw back in the fourth to cut
it<00:02:29.040> into<00:02:29.160> slices<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:30.450> don't<00:02:30.690> want<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.960> press

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
it into slices you don't want to press

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.720 
it into slices you don't want to press
down<00:02:31.380> because<00:02:31.710> if<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.980> press<00:02:32.220> down<00:02:32.250> it's

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
down because if you press down it's

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.730 
down because if you press down it's
going<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:32.970> squish<00:02:33.210> up<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.020> end<00:02:34.200> bit

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
going to squish up the end bit

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.990 
going to squish up the end bit
always<00:02:34.980> looks<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.220> little<00:02:35.280> funky<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:35.790> we're

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
always looks a little funky so we're

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.880 
always looks a little funky so we're
going<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.150> set<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.570> one<00:02:36.720> off<00:02:36.840> suicide<00:02:37.110> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
going to set that one off suicide and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.620 
going to set that one off suicide and
that<00:02:38.190> one<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.370> usually<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.880> eat<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.120> don't<00:02:39.270> even

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
that one I usually just eat I don't even

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.600 
that one I usually just eat I don't even
put<00:02:39.900> out<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.800> then<00:02:41.160> we're<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.280> going<00:02:41.550> to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
put out and then we're just going to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.580 
put out and then we're just going to
solve<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.120> entire<00:02:42.510> thing<00:02:43.460> into<00:02:44.480> nice<00:02:45.480> thin

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
solve this entire thing into nice thin

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.990 
solve this entire thing into nice thin
slices<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.830> would<00:02:47.070> say<00:02:47.280> anywhere<00:02:47.880> between

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
slices I would say anywhere between

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.880 
slices I would say anywhere between
about<00:02:48.570> 1/4<00:02:49.470> inch<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.070> half<00:02:50.340> inch<00:02:50.640> thick

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
about 1/4 inch to a half inch thick

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:12.930 
about 1/4 inch to a half inch thick
however<00:02:52.890> thick<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.400> want<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.700> fine

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.000 

and<00:03:13.030> then<00:03:13.690> again<00:03:13.990> when<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:14.350> get<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.800> end

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
and then again when we get to the end

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.630 
and then again when we get to the end
once<00:03:15.550> I've<00:03:15.760> cut<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.240> end<00:03:16.590> same<00:03:17.590> thing<00:03:17.920> because

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
once I've cut the end same thing because

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.960 
once I've cut the end same thing because
it's<00:03:18.880> kind<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.330> funky<00:03:19.930> shape<00:03:20.850> because<00:03:21.850> it

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
it's kind of a funky shape because it

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.880 
it's kind of a funky shape because it
has<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.240> end<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.600> banana<00:03:22.930> sticking<00:03:23.410> out

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
has the end of the banana sticking out

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.680 
has the end of the banana sticking out
I<00:03:23.920> usually<00:03:24.430> just<00:03:24.820> set<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.120> off<00:03:25.210> to<00:03:25.240> the<00:03:25.510> side

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
I usually just set that off to the side

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.380 
I usually just set that off to the side
I<00:03:25.720> won't<00:03:26.080> even<00:03:26.230> eat<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.650> one<00:03:26.940> all<00:03:27.940> right<00:03:27.970> so

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
I won't even eat that one all right so

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.610 
I won't even eat that one all right so
now<00:03:28.660> we're<00:03:28.780> going<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:28.960> start<00:03:29.170> putting<00:03:29.410> it<00:03:29.500> on

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
now we're going to start putting it on

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.030 
now we're going to start putting it on
to<00:03:29.830> our<00:03:29.980> plate<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:31.650> basically<00:03:32.650> when<00:03:32.920> you're

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
to our plate and basically when you're

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.590 
to our plate and basically when you're
putting<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.430> onto<00:03:33.730> your<00:03:33.850> plate<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.450> can

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
putting it onto your plate you can

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.630 
putting it onto your plate you can
arrange<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:34.990> however<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.500> want<00:03:35.710> I<00:03:35.920> tend<00:03:36.580> to

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
arrange it however you want I tend to

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.820 
arrange it however you want I tend to
like<00:03:36.850> arranging<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.600> kind<00:03:37.930> of<00:03:38.080> in<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.500> little

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
like arranging it kind of in a little

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.400 
like arranging it kind of in a little
flower<00:03:39.130> shape<00:03:39.670> but<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.480> also<00:03:40.630> depends<00:03:41.110> how

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
flower shape but it also depends how

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.620 
flower shape but it also depends how
many<00:03:41.740> of<00:03:41.920> these<00:03:42.070> you're<00:03:42.370> going<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.910> make<00:03:43.120> if

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
many of these you're going to make if

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.330 
many of these you're going to make if
you're<00:03:43.810> making<00:03:43.990> a<00:03:44.170> whole<00:03:44.320> bunch<00:03:44.350> you<00:03:44.980> might

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
you're making a whole bunch you might

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.010 
you're making a whole bunch you might
need<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.670> do<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.820> different<00:03:46.330> shape<00:03:46.540> or<00:03:46.810> just

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
need to do a different shape or just

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.410 
need to do a different shape or just
pile<00:03:47.200> them<00:03:47.470> kind<00:03:47.800> of<00:03:47.860> close<00:03:48.070> together<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:49.210> that

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
pile them kind of close together so that

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.960 
pile them kind of close together so that
they<00:03:49.570> all<00:03:49.720> fit<00:03:49.990> on<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.230> plate<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:51.640> part

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
they all fit on the plate so this part

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.170 
they all fit on the plate so this part
is<00:03:52.210> just<00:03:52.480> entirely<00:03:52.870> up<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.140> you<00:03:53.850> these<00:03:54.850> around

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
is just entirely up to you these around

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.180 
is just entirely up to you these around
a<00:03:55.420> little<00:03:55.540> bit

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
a little bit

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.880 
a little bit
so<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:57.220> have<00:03:57.490> room<00:03:57.820> for<00:03:58.090> one<00:03:58.330> more<00:04:00.810> all<00:04:01.810> right
