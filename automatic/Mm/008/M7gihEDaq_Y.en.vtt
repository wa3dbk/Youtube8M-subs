an<00:02:01.759> annotation<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.810> just<00:02:03.049> check<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.319> out

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
an annotation to just check it out

pointing toward me up it and you bring
it<00:02:14.690> out<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.600> like<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:18.319> try<00:02:18.500> to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
it out like this so like that but try to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.450 
it out like this so like that but try to
keep<00:02:18.740> it<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:21.130> don't<00:02:22.130> eat<00:02:22.280> like<00:02:22.430> go<00:02:23.830> too<00:02:24.830> fast

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
keep it in don't eat like go too fast

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.070 
keep it in don't eat like go too fast
and<00:02:27.460> that's<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.030> really<00:02:28.450> I'll<00:02:28.840> do<00:02:29.050> a

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
and that's it really I'll do a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.670 
and that's it really I'll do a
slow-motion<00:02:29.440> one<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.780> see<00:02:32.020> in<00:02:32.290> slow

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
slow-motion one so you can see in slow

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.980 
slow-motion one so you can see in slow
motion<00:02:32.860> where<00:02:33.580> looks<00:02:33.760> like<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.150> we<00:02:34.210> can<00:02:34.270> get<00:02:34.480> to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
motion where looks like so we can get to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.340 
motion where looks like so we can get to
keep<00:02:35.140> repeating<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.340> repeating<00:02:36.370> repeating<00:02:36.820> it

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
keep repeating it repeating repeating it

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.890 
keep repeating it repeating repeating it
and<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.590> get<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.830> hang<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.160> or<00:02:39.810> thanks<00:02:40.810> for
