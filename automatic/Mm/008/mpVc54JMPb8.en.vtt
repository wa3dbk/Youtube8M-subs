00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.780
 we always try to make the topics of the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.100
 pieces that we work I have a little bit in 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.210
 contact with current affairs and with 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.210
 context that is touching us live 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.940
 and in this case 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.579
 whose centrality of power in the degree of 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.860
 authority coming from society of age of 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.870
 vertical structure and like us without 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.970
 realize or realize we are 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.270
 eating part of a whole complex 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.270
 mechanism 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.120
 of his vision and what we do is 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.909
 catch this idea 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.640
 and take us far take you as far 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.390
 possible not to take us to Japan and see how 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.170
 this idea is related to japan not 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.049
 we're going to a japan in the second 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.070
 world war and from there 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.070
 we started to travel what 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.490
 we would not like to see a change 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.900
 we continue with our line with 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.510
 our way of working our 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.450
 true dance and the world of some 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.890
 way and the fact of being here in the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.440
 national dance company what gives us 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.930
 it's maybe more visibility but we try 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.180
 keep us as we are and keep 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.180
 our ideals our principles 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.790
 work with the dancers of the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.280
 national company that are not dances 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.710
 with which we usually work everything and that 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.000
 the background in the formation of 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.780
 us our dancers and these 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.060
 dancers may be similar to me 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.030
 it's always interesting where we try 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.250
 that they dance like us if not 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.550
 we try to convey to you what is our 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.910
 ideal what is our way of understanding 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.470
 the movement and from his and from his 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.140
 formation and from his way of understanding 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.910
 the movement how do we find that 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.470
 we like us is to give them the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.080
 tools for them from their 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.430
 personality and from his condition 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.430
 works in the movement and creating it 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.280
 our way to work is always a 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.830
 little the same has to doctors with the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.989
 theater and with the cinema and is that before 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.060
 get here to the studios we already have a 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.910
 little the clear piece that we have as a 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.470
 script not a script of steps but as a 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.690
 sequence structure script 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.480
 rhythm at the end carbon and then yes that 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.300
 we have no spatial idea an idea 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.640
 musical or aesthetic and bromatological idea 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.380
 all this is either cooked before 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.180
 get here and when we got here what 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.750
 what we do with them is to work 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.750
 language of movement 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.510
 what we are doing in this case is 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.640
 try to affect our movement of 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.480
 things of Japanese kabuki dance 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:36.500
 of lloyd the point perhaps also without 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.760
 try to do Japanese dance but with 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.319
 our language with our 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.660
 coding text in this way of 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.970
 understand the movement to affect it from 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.430
 some way that I was not that I 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.739
 what gives us the bunraku that gives us the 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.390
 kabuki that as working is the body 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.350
 how would your joints work how 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.350
 they work and from the gesture
