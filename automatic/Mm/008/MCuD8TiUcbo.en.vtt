00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 As you know, sometimes we use more 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.890
 screens not only our time of 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.629
 leisure but also for example in the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.670
 educational environment where tablets 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.860
 smartphones laptops are 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.750
 to the order of the day to be so long 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.280
 in front of the screens can cause 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.599
 damage to our eyes and we are with 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.890
 celia sanchez-ramos that the professor 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.539
 university researcher 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.609
 Complutense of Madrid that will talk to me 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.619
 a little bit of the theme or celia hello 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.660
 well I love being with you and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.519
 participate in this project first thing 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.119
 of all what are the risks of the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.309
 exposure to the screens well I 'm going to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.170
 direct to the camera to do it more 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.300
 near 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.190
 I always start saying no 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.170
 we can give up the screens of the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.450
 technology seems important to me because 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.860
 if it does not seem that we have an aversion to something 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 that really is part of our 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.050
 life that causes us less allows us 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.629
 have incredible information and that I 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.920
 I am very much in favor therefore starting 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.120
 from the premise that technology is 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.100
 something that has to be in our life 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.079
 we have as it happens with driving and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.699
 the cars as we put as many 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.289
 Sometimes as an example you have to protect yourself 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.120
 what to put is a security titles that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.100
 you put an airbag or you have to put a 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.750
 body that allows us to be 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.870
 protected then 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.360
 for anyone it is easy to understand that 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.300
 look at nearby objects we are forcing 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.590
 focusing accommodating in a way 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.810
 excessive but when those objects 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.560
 The issue is light emitting nearby 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.300
 it's a little bit and more important mesh 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.920
 because I would ask myself why, if 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.080
 really the light is necessary to see 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.420
 if the light without light we do not see we are in 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.160
 darkness let there be light, look at yourself if it is 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.720
 important I've spent my life 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.500
 studying light and the interaction between 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.690
 the light and the visual system and I think that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.340
 It must be considered that all 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.710
 things must be in their proper measure 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.240
 and we have to program a lot first 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.940
 time of use of any excess 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.100
 we speak in education that is to say 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.840
 It is very important that you live in low weight 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.310
 and consequently use the tablets 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.830
 but it is also very important that you 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.229
 know how they are composed and what kind of 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.619
 mission they have and issuing a tablet 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.250
 or from a mobile device that is used 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.850
 as the computer has a led emission 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.210
 the issuers have a high 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.100
 proportion of a more toxic light does not 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.750
 all but many the vast majority 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.580
 then simply what happens is 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.120
 that when you study and know what is 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.610
 the problem 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.410
 What we do is eliminate part of that 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.140
 problem very similar to what 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.910
 It happened when a child did not know 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.620
 that sunlight could cause 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.180
 skin problems we do not put it on 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.740
 over the majors that is closer 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.380
 of having problems series of pierre no 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.970
 we put it to prevent before with the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.160
 little children who have the most delicate skin 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.140
 because children have more delicate the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.910
 visual system of course make 20 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.280
 years because it 's like this without finishing 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.880
 evolve in second place because there 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.320
 six parts of the system like it can be 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.150
 the crystalline lens that is the one that 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.340
 interesting to note in this case that they are 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.080
 inside the eye so we can make a 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.360
 idea and we understand the system well 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.430
 optical of a human is only composed 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.320
 it is relatively simple it is composed 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.820
 by a single lens that is the cornea and 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.959
 another lens that is behind a 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.450
 determined distance which is the 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.430
 crystalline one lens have 40 diopters 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.890
 of crystalline 20 but this can 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.100
 change in its form this is never this 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.760
 well disposed 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.200
 and is the one that allows us to see objects 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.750
 close but at that time the camera 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.970
 with respect to the background scenario in 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.610
 the case of children with their computer 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.700
 is 50 centimeters or the tablets to 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.990
 less or the smartphone to much less 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.700
 first that first worrying the 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.710
 excess hours of use 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.500
 that must be controlled in some way 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.020
 secondly the emission and third 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.630
 instance the concentration that that 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.520
 requires they are not when they are 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.300
 studying when they are making a 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.820
 exercise are not seeing something that in the 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.100
 that they are spectators is something in which 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.750
 they are an active part and the active part 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.490
 requires a higher concentration than in 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.040
 the visual system also or in the 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.080
 ocular system also manifests and 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.250
 as manifested for example by saying 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.960
 data that everyone understands 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.060
 while you and I are talking about your 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.500
 blink we said that it's 26 for 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.600
 parents for minutes while if you 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.780
 you are doing an exercise of 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.940
 math on your tablet are you 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.190
 blinking only 12 times per minute or 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.049
 even nine times a minute all that 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.579
 makes a minor a minor 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.400
 freshness in the eye 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.949
 minor tear drop that results in 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.810
 Conjunctival or corneal conditions 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.909
 older therefore you have to have it 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.469
 in consideration if children are going to 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.479
 do they have to tear 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:32.909
 artificial or washed with water or 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.840
 physiological saline in the best way 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:38.400
 possible but already going further back is 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.629
 important also is that of effects that 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.719
 they can have as myopia 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:45.479
 hyperopia astigmatism those flaws 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:46.949
 that if not many of them 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.300
 manifest precisely in age 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.379
 school because it's when there is a greater 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.060
 eye spending the visual system that's going 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.740
 to require clear observation by 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.530
 part of the father and the teacher who should 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.090
 see if the position is correct is 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.710
 they detect almost 30 percent in the 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.690
 school 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.610
 and they should go immediately to a 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.590
 ophthalmologist if they are small children to 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.960
 that can be dilated the pupil or a 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.099
 optical if they are young that there is no longer 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.719
 lack of adaptation always 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.400
 taking into account that the professional 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:15.930
 sanitary expert in vision and 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.060
 Ophthalmologist expert in pathology of the 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.740
 vision are the right ones from there 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.919
 is now the references that seem to you 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.600
 timely therefore I want you 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.600
 understand that both parents and 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.930
 teachers must have in the 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.940
 head that is important rules or 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.190
 distribute the work hours in each 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.410
 one of the things to do breaks that is 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.420
 relatively rational we talked about the 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.150
 gyms or we talk about exercise 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.260
 physical with the breaks that's going to 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.790
 carry and that any teacher of 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.080
 physical education therefore understands the 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.940
 Math teacher has to understand 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.680
 also that it is very important that there 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.330
 a break that another activity is done 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.640
 on whiteboard that you do another 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.000
 activity 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.740
 in the device x and then hygiene 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.360
 We always talk about hygiene because I 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.540
 it seems that something jumps though 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.280
 fundamental we have to take the eyes 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.660
 they are mistreated in this sense not 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.930
 we understand that you have to wash them there 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.160
 than to put them the same creams that 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.540
 we put on our faces and wash them 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.580
 previously, we will have that 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.560
 do the same in the eyes the eyes should 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.110
 of being washed clean force the 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.420
 flicker and close them as much as possible and 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.510
 that and rest rest with your eyes 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.120
 closed and trying not to assume so much 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.130
 information considers a data 80 85 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.080
 percent of the information that reaches 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.500
 my brain at this moment arrives 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.409
 of sight then I'm overloading 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.569
 an organ from very early on and during a 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.520
 long life of the person therefore not 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:45.449
 only the emission and the damage that holds it 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.469
 it can be done but in the previous part 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:51.030
 of the eye and the responsibility of all 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:53.699
 without alarming with the use of technology 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.129
 but if my command and taking care of an organ 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.550
 that must last a lifetime because something 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:02.129
 what we should know is that this phrase so 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.289
 classic how it was said the eyes are 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:05.909
 for all life is a reality because 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:07.740
 they are prolongation of the brain in 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:10.199
 graphically speaking and consequently 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.849
 the neurons will be the same from the 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.979
 first day of birth until the day 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.900
 that this child now dies and then 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.639
 adult in addition to the measures that 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.620
 we commented rest your eyes 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:21.539
 clean them well can also be 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.610
 use other types of alternatives for 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:25.770
 example as these protectors of 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.779
 good sim screen is that it is also 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.969
 I want to say and I think that 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:32.430
 Screen savers are protective 

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:34.710
 eyepieces in addition to protecting the screen 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.690
 of the damages that you may suffer from 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.560
 scratches or what they do is 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.450
 absorb 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.940
 a part of the recognized one that goes to 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.980

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.910
 measure in which you can prevent the 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.010
 damage that in the end will cause it 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.740
 before or after in the bottom area of ​​the 

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:01.919
 eye therefore is not it is not just that 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.230
 I am comfortable that is very important but 

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:06.150
 what benefit can it make in the 

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.650
 prevention as we do with the cream 

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.840
