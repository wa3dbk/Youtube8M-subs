TV wanted to talk to you today about the

TV wanted to talk to you today about the
inconsistency<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.670> flares<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.570> battlefield<00:00:16.049> 4

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
inconsistency of flares in battlefield 4

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.820 
inconsistency of flares in battlefield 4
as<00:00:16.650> well<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.330> overpowered<00:00:19.140> mobile<00:00:19.650> AAA

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
as well as the overpowered mobile AAA

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.569 
as well as the overpowered mobile AAA
when<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.609> equipped<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.089> active<00:00:21.720> radar

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579 
when it is equipped with active radar

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.620 
when it is equipped with active radar
let's<00:00:23.579> go<00:00:23.699> ahead<00:00:23.759> and<00:00:23.849> touch<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.329> flares

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
let's go ahead and touch on the flares

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
let's go ahead and touch on the flares
really<00:00:25.079> quick<00:00:25.349> so<00:00:25.589> I've<00:00:25.710> been<00:00:25.829> flying<00:00:26.159> quite<00:00:26.460> a

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
really quick so I've been flying quite a

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
really quick so I've been flying quite a
bit<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.730> battlefield<00:00:27.390> 4<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.869> one<00:00:28.079> thing<00:00:28.289> that

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
bit in battlefield 4 and one thing that

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.810 
bit in battlefield 4 and one thing that
I've<00:00:28.529> noticed<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:29.249> flares<00:00:29.579> are

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
I've noticed is that the flares are

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.240 
I've noticed is that the flares are
really<00:00:30.179> inconsistent<00:00:30.869> more<00:00:31.439> often<00:00:31.739> than<00:00:32.189> not

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
really inconsistent more often than not

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.970 
really inconsistent more often than not
i'm<00:00:32.940> still<00:00:33.510> getting<00:00:33.660> hit<00:00:33.989> by<00:00:34.020> stingers<00:00:34.739> or

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
i'm still getting hit by stingers or

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.420 
i'm still getting hit by stingers or
heat<00:00:35.219> seekers<00:00:35.699> despite<00:00:36.270> dropping<00:00:37.199> flares<00:00:37.829> as

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
heat seekers despite dropping flares as

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.250 
heat seekers despite dropping flares as
you're<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.660> these<00:00:39.780> next<00:00:40.140> two

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
you're going to see in these next two

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.319 
you're going to see in these next two
clips<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> tone<00:00:41.609> that<00:00:41.640> something

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
clips I do get the tone that something

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.509 
clips I do get the tone that something
is<00:00:42.480> inbound<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.559> drop<00:00:43.829> flares<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
is inbound and I drop flares and it

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.099 
is inbound and I drop flares and it
doesn't<00:00:44.910> matter<00:00:45.059> they<00:00:45.300> still<00:00:45.600> hit<00:00:45.780> me<00:00:45.899> now<00:00:46.079> I

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
doesn't matter they still hit me now I

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.290 
doesn't matter they still hit me now I
believe<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:48.120> more

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
believe that this is just one more

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.020 
believe that this is just one more
example<00:00:48.359> of<00:00:49.019> the<00:00:49.530> netcode<00:00:49.769> being<00:00:50.280> way<00:00:50.550> off<00:00:50.789> in

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
example of the netcode being way off in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
example of the netcode being way off in
this<00:00:51.149> game<00:00:51.420> either<00:00:52.050> way<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.679> something

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
this game either way it is something

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.009 
this game either way it is something
that<00:00:53.070> needs<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.460> looked<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.300> resolved

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
that needs to be looked at and resolved

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.299 
that needs to be looked at and resolved
because<00:00:55.109> there's<00:00:55.469> nothing<00:00:55.620> more<00:00:55.980> unnerving

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
because there's nothing more unnerving

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.790 
because there's nothing more unnerving
than<00:00:56.640> getting<00:00:56.940> hit<00:00:57.120> by<00:00:57.149> missiles<00:00:57.649> when<00:00:58.649> your

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
than getting hit by missiles when your

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.770 
than getting hit by missiles when your
flares<00:00:59.129> don't<00:00:59.429> work<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.269> should<00:01:00.300> but

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
flares don't work as they should but

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.389 
flares don't work as they should but
let's<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.109> ahead<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.289> move<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> mobile

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
let's go ahead and move on to the mobile

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.750 
let's go ahead and move on to the mobile
AAA<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> active<00:01:03.329> radar<00:01:03.800> so<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:04.980> AAA<00:01:05.100> gun<00:01:05.550> has

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
AAA and active radar so the AAA gun has

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.789 
AAA and active radar so the AAA gun has
a<00:01:05.790> new<00:01:06.030> unlock<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.930> called<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> active

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
a new unlock and it is called the active

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.249 
a new unlock and it is called the active
radar<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.579> it<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.790> essentially<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.689> missile

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
radar and it is essentially a missile

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.469 
radar and it is essentially a missile
that<00:01:10.500> will<00:01:10.799> locate<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> track<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.119> nearest

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
that will locate and track the nearest

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.780 
that will locate and track the nearest
airborne<00:01:12.990> target<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.590> explode<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.369> next

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
airborne target and explode right next

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
airborne target and explode right next
to<00:01:14.939> them<00:01:15.060> these<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:15.840> unlike<00:01:16.500> any<00:01:16.890> other

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
to them these are unlike any other

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
to them these are unlike any other
missiles<00:01:17.579> in<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> game<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.899> do<00:01:19.079> not

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
missiles in the game and that you do not

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
missiles in the game and that you do not
have<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.950> lock<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.460> your<00:01:20.640> target<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
have to lock on your target for these to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.960 
have to lock on your target for these to
work<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:22.079> you<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.189> spam<00:01:23.640> them<00:01:23.880> in

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
work all you have to do is spam them in

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.639 
work all you have to do is spam them in
the<00:01:24.060> general<00:01:24.420> direction<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.899> a<00:01:25.020> helicopter<00:01:25.290> or

the general direction of a helicopter or

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.920 
the general direction of a helicopter or
plane<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.250> they<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.329> rest<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
plane and they do the the rest of the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.410 
plane and they do the the rest of the
work<00:01:28.220> now<00:01:29.220> you're<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:29.939> asking<00:01:30.210> why

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
work now you're going to be asking why

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
work now you're going to be asking why
is<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.750> Opie<00:01:31.200> well<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.009> couple

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
is this Opie well there are a couple

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.499 
is this Opie well there are a couple
reasons<00:01:32.340> why<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.090> extremely

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
reasons why this is extremely

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.510 
reasons why this is extremely
overpowered<00:01:34.110> first<00:01:34.469> it<00:01:34.799> does<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.189> give

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
overpowered first it does not give

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.850 
overpowered first it does not give
pilots<00:01:35.969> a<00:01:36.479> notification<00:01:36.899> that<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> missile<00:01:37.649> is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
pilots a notification that a missile is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.740 
pilots a notification that a missile is
inbound<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.820> there's<00:01:39.000> no<00:01:39.149> possible<00:01:39.600> way<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
inbound so there's no possible way to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.920 
inbound so there's no possible way to
drop<00:01:40.049> flares<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.680> last<00:01:40.860> second

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
drop flares in the last second

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.149 
drop flares in the last second
occasionally<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.110> will<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.500> notified<00:01:43.649> that

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
occasionally you will be notified that

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.859 
occasionally you will be notified that
one<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.399> these<00:01:44.460> missiles<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.060> inbound<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.780> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
one of these missiles is inbound but it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.920 
one of these missiles is inbound but it
happens<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.770> late<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:48.390> can't<00:01:48.659> deploy

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
happens so late that you can't deploy

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.139 
happens so late that you can't deploy
flares<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.130> saw<00:01:50.340> flares<00:01:50.850> are<00:01:51.030> so

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
flares and as we just saw flares are so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.580 
flares and as we just saw flares are so
inconsistent<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.110> doesn't<00:01:52.439> matter

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
inconsistent that it doesn't matter

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.370 
inconsistent that it doesn't matter
anyways<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.539> then<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.689> other<00:01:54.719> reason<00:01:55.259> why

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
anyways and then the other reason why

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.440 
anyways and then the other reason why
this<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.740> extremely<00:01:56.280> opie<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.329> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
this is extremely opie is that it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.800 
this is extremely opie is that it
reloads<00:01:57.990> these<00:01:58.380> rockets<00:01:58.950> reload<00:01:59.340> faster<00:01:59.810> or

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
reloads these rockets reload faster or

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.899 
reloads these rockets reload faster or
so<00:02:01.200> fast<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.950> can't<00:02:02.039> even<00:02:02.369> keep<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.850> with

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
so fast that you can't even keep up with

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.700 
so fast that you can't even keep up with
countermeasures<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.689> either<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.109> plane<00:02:04.439> or<00:02:04.680> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
countermeasures in either a plane or a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
countermeasures in either a plane or a
helicopter<00:02:04.799> there's<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:05.939> no<00:02:06.329> possible

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
helicopter there's really no possible

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.070 
helicopter there's really no possible
way<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.170> combat<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.600> as<00:02:09.600> you're<00:02:09.780> seeing

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
way to combat this and as you're seeing

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.199 
way to combat this and as you're seeing
here<00:02:10.319> are<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.979> map<00:02:11.039> we<00:02:11.610> are<00:02:11.700> playing<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
here are on this map we are playing the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.190 
here are on this map we are playing the
damn<00:02:12.420> map

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
damn map

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.100 
damn map
and<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.890> did<00:02:14.099> not<00:02:14.280> let<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.819> single<00:02:15.239> helicopter

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and I did not let a single helicopter

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.140 
and I did not let a single helicopter
leave<00:02:16.349> their<00:02:16.800> base<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.459> if<00:02:17.580> they<00:02:17.760> did<00:02:17.970> leave

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
leave their base and if they did leave

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.910 
leave their base and if they did leave
the<00:02:18.360> base<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:18.900> weren't<00:02:19.140> around<00:02:19.410> for<00:02:19.620> very

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the base they weren't around for very

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.670 
the base they weren't around for very
long<00:02:20.099> because<00:02:20.430> all<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.790> had<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.120> do<00:02:21.420> was<00:02:22.349> spam

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
long because all I had to do was spam

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.759 
long because all I had to do was spam
these<00:02:22.950> Rockets<00:02:23.489> towards<00:02:23.910> them<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:25.739> was

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
these Rockets towards them and that was

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.160 
these Rockets towards them and that was
it<00:02:26.010> they're<00:02:26.370> basically<00:02:26.519> dead<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.209> felt<00:02:27.810> so

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
these maps in battlefield 4 are so small

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.809 
these maps in battlefield 4 are so small
as<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:58.049> you<00:02:58.890> can<00:02:59.099> literally<00:02:59.370> camp

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
as it is that you can literally camp

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
the only way that I've seen or been able

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.729 
the only way that I've seen or been able
to<00:03:10.980> take<00:03:11.940> down<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.209> mobile<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.870> with<00:03:13.290> active

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.650 
radar on my own is in the attack jet
essentially<00:03:17.609> what<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.760> had<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:17.970> do<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.359> come

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
essentially what I had to do is come

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.559 
essentially what I had to do is come
down<00:03:18.930> from<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.769> very<00:03:20.100> high<00:03:20.370> altitude<00:03:20.970> right<00:03:21.420> on

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
down from a very high altitude right on

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.720 
down from a very high altitude right on
top<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.840> them<00:03:22.139> spam<00:03:22.530> rocket<00:03:23.040> pods<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.609> then

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
top of them spam rocket pods and then

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.580 
top of them spam rocket pods and then
finish<00:03:24.000> them<00:03:24.030> off<00:03:24.329> with<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.109> 30-millimeter

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
finish them off with the 30-millimeter

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.370 
finish them off with the 30-millimeter
but<00:03:26.130> other<00:03:26.400> than<00:03:26.639> that<00:03:26.730> it's<00:03:27.350> near<00:03:28.350> impossible

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
but other than that it's near impossible

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.890 
but other than that it's near impossible
to<00:03:29.040> take<00:03:29.280> down<00:03:29.430> again<00:03:29.730> mobile<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.120> pilot<00:03:30.690> or

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
to take down again mobile a pilot or

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.110 
to take down again mobile a pilot or
excuse<00:03:31.290> me<00:03:31.319> mobile<00:03:31.650> AAA<00:03:31.859> operator<00:03:32.519> if<00:03:32.730> he<00:03:32.910> has

excuse me mobile AAA operator if he has

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.930 
excuse me mobile AAA operator if he has
these<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:34.470> hopefully<00:03:35.190> something<00:03:35.519> can<00:03:35.819> be

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
these so hopefully something can be

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.610 
these so hopefully something can be
adjusted<00:03:36.030> whether<00:03:36.600> or<00:03:36.810> not<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.260> range

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
adjusted whether or not it's the range
