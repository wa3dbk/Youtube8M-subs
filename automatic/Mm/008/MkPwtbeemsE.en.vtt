00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.929
 The situation will then be outside 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.940
 but not enough 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 Hello and welcome today 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.390
 it is about the physalis that we then ourselves 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.400
 had sown from a fruit out 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.810
 had bought and that has good 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.279
 but now it has to work 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.660
 the good ones are really transplanted 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.760
 and we'll do that for now 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.579
 we now bale the whole time 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.040
 Out of here the roots are outstanding 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.660
 grown meanwhile and now if 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.559
 We carefully examine the individual plants 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.890
 take out a bit of earth there 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.300
 it stays that way 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.690
 The roots are too short 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.690
 immediately 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.480
 will be around a little earlier 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.400
 I could, however, plant 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.330
 somehow temporally then whole missed 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.200
 but not to the picture 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:19.450
 then we do that just now what 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.560
 at small here the straggler this 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.310
 subsequently come up again 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.310
 germinated 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.689
 the hits prepare the 900 pots 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.920
 and we have coco earth in it 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.420
 we take our plants and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.420
 cut the root a bit 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.649
 it's just enough and we 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.549
 Plant now about 23 inches deeper 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:52.320
 as before just a hollow in the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.810
 earth press because the little plant 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.140
 Carefully and lead something else 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.140
 out 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.690
 We do that at all 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.690
 as I said, a cut short 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.500
 that earth fill press lightly 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.420
 There's not quite that much emotion you 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.350
 Here something cut one with itself 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.350
 better branch on a birthday 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.660
 the others would be the physalis, then 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.970
 grown very slowly now 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.650
 That was also because of the spring 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.940
 It was cold and therefore they are now 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.280
 but not so big the plants yet 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.020
 not the least, we are planting now 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.520
 can see a mensa like those in the 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.520
 course of the year to develop 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.120
 Realize that from a fruit 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.240
 attract yourself fans here 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.240
 can 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.500
 if you start with it almost sooner then 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.940
 are the plant with it already 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.230
 a bit bigger, however, as I said 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.099
 they do not like to grow cold like that 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.099
 but hesitantly 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.310
 so that's enough now one time 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.310
 good still on 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.680
 the cocoons he how should you do that 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.930
 really good at wet I have it 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.329
 now also not used the wet 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.549
 copy but not dry but 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.269
 Hold slightly damp only then can be 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.670
 process the substrate better 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.190
 make sure that all up too 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.470
 downwardly diameter and head 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:28.680
 right down out so again until after 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:30.360
 then pour demonstration from it 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.000
 is now too mini and stormier 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.280
 there is no more word 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.139
 they're doing spicy things right now 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.460
 Kilian is sleepy and she gets 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.010
 meanwhile, new leaves of this 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.419
 clearly driven out the one chosen 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.010
 So the plant is after good me 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.350
 will try over the course of the next 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.639
 weeks that I send geb 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.639
 We promise 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:02.290
 How do you not want it? 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.850
 yes to the other normal 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.170
 we had fulfilled as we did the 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.750
 germinating had seen 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.070
 had and so and in film or the company 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.190
 It was easy on the train now 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.389
 individual programs still isolated 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.460
 actually good description rainer 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.350
 Winter interest is like getting out of it 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.690
 a fruit of these poor wins and 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.530
 one plants that plants too 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.889
 just too cold 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.100
 You can feel it there then 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.690
 look at 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.730
 we are still putting the plants up now 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.139
 not expected for a few days 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.200
 for a week and fertilize now 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.060
 of course not yet and will be the 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.740
 plants are observed in growth 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.630
 So you see that in front of a leaflet 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.370
 Grown vigorously are growing 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.620
 not all then we have ten years 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.700
 the plants have fun regularly and 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.900
 I have it now has the small space 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.520
 plants for the sake of it because I still 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.450
 I do not know where to find this later 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.100
 want to place 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.260
 from so could then then 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.280
 if necessary, to plant that 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.810
 advantage of it you can now 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.060
 of course directly in the garden 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.250
 plant or plant in larger pots 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.110
 that also quite conceivable 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.010
 yes I think what did I say everything 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.240
 to the other more money 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.800
 I hope you liked a little movie 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.419
 and see you in one of the next 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.000
 movies was again in the sense of 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:17.570
 ketteler am looking forward to thank you and look 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.470
 what do you mean with the grape I 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.470
 Do not want to eat now 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.620
 8th 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.400
 the hosta soon starts to bloom 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.780
 Buds are really nice and thick 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.479
 is a dwarf costa then act 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.090
 We really pineapple here ourselves 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.650
 splendid and the other as soon as she 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.810
 so it has different growth now 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.479
 oblong leaves these here and these 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.110
 the broad leaves but that me 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.800
 probably because of that 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.870
 Different roots have the one 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.550
 this was in the water we have 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.550
 directly in the birthday wheel
