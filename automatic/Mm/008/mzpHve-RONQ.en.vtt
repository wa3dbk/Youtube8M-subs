00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello germany welcome to one 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:07.440
 new folksheet in career mode today 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.260
 stands for west ham united and everton 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.040
 two away games even we want each other 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.440
 of course continue in the table 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.320
 improve and in between too 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.500
 taiga list should be a bit better 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.970
 run as the last games though 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.789
 you have to say that right now the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.670
 last episode speaks very well 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.099
 With the game, among other things, it went 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 on land and against manchester city though 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.120
 I like to say something against the west 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.870
 ham as soon as jumps out completely 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.940
 very hard 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.530
 So let's see that's something 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.390
 right in the first scene for west ham 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.219
 united he goes into the punishment room 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 hits the flank very far 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.140
 Ronny promise the ball very briefly 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.149
 but come with brisker and the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.600
 shot because he only because of the cavaliere 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.680
 dangerous from next scene like westbam 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.260
 The pressure is very high 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.699
 Same initial phase 13 minute again 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.079
 without hitting the right side 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.570
 again a flank into envious 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.910
 attempted to defend ball in the ball 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.530
 middle and there comes the shows and posts 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.020
 good luck for newcastle in the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.270
 the initial phase would have the body the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.689
 I did not have it, but I got it in return 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.680
 the counterpart pretty much at 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.479
 jubilant running and running sees the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.450
 Gap tries to pass by 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.939
 and shoots and unfortunately unhappy in the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.960
 finish next in newcastle 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.420
 they have a little blood now 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.770
 licked after this attack too determined 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.650
 Tried to try banafair 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.810
 comes to the ball shoots away form 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.030
 mostly initiated keeper and ultimately 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.939
 you still in a direction offender due 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.409
 its the inside attracts inward 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.170
 try a strong right foot 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.670
 to insert and again is the kiba turn 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.040
 the shot is not placed enough 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.390
 it will continue to be pressurized as you pick up 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.189
 get the ball out of midfield again 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.270
 triebel storm just try it 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.430
 fabio has the ball loose and that's it 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.320
 also already to the end with the 45 minutes in 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.869
 the first half west ham against 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.210
 newcastle 0 to 0 and equal in time 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.430
 in the first 15 minutes of the second 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.969
 half past time not so busy then 160 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.110
 mio 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.129
 the laves alone in front of the gate would 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.739
 braked comes ran again 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.110
 the shot of Myra is fortunately 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.670
 parried by Canada from the box itself 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.170
 seen and then the time had come 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.360
 mixtures goes out again I see 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.830
 the child more unfortunately only too good ben arfa 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.050
 in the next scene to 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.730
 substitute csd he will be a bit 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.319
 blocked a bit but pushed 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.819
 that's no use because he puts the ball 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.580
 very good for the obertan in the middle and 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:35.970
 then in the 84 minute the 1 0 is the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.769
 but also a deserved goal 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.769
 submission and then through both 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.680
 the French performer builds 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.030
 from newcastle and so on 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.629
 Newcastle thinks the same way 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.910
 next attack right after the gate cc 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.440
 tries a distance shot but the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.980
 is not as finished and that 's how it is 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.709
 once the last attack 91 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.989
 he goes past me now is the 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.370
 he still comes over well still 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.050
 on the ball puts the ball on his 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.250
 strong left foot and shoot and what 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.650
 was a fancy goal 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.959
 nice dribbling and then with the 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.840
 strong left foot purely geballert 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.810
 nice trick before and fabio in goal 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.659
 from west ham united without a chance and 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.400
 head sister united 2 to 0 of 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:23.099
 Newcastle went to lafer and yesterday 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.190
 Obertan the two French make as 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.849
 hire a bad game of 262, a note 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.519
 but you had a few goal attempts 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.640
 actually, at best, you know that 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:39.209
 better from Siebel storm but let's see 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.790
 we have another game this time of the yen 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.500
 expect the pretty much in expectation 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.129
 back left eleventh place you can 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.170
 actually better but good i mean 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.390
 every game is hard in the premier 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.129
 league and so many points difference 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.319
 are not now from 11 to 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:59.280
 seventh place where lukas just think so 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:02.129
 so each game is difficult and we 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.590
 look to expect pure against newcastle 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.269
 his first in japan is changing six of ours 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.330
 after a corner very good header 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.060
 but that is clear on the line 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.010
 You can not do the crisis very well 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.900
 and then another mistake in the 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.470
 then build up good but then build up 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.269
 from newcastle 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.590
 theres he runs and runs too 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.100
 outlines so that everything is free for 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.170
 Zurich already flank comes perfect and 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.990
 siebel current per head to the next song 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.870
 gate wonderful flank of good and yes 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.910
 in the middle saales grab Zurich storm 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.620
 easiest next scene to tenants 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.770
 the outside puts in the middle to onion 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.810
 stream of addiction tiotÃ© good passing game 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.130
 very good example and then comes 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.630
 Unfortunately shot not precise in the team 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.790
 creating for the subsequent corner becomes 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.550
 dangerous thanks to anita the southbridge 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.820
 distance tried but also there is tim 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.740
 howard sure synpson again 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.740
 from the distance and he comes to the 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.420
 posts but after that there was no danger 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.950
 more good just before the break yet 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.660
 out djuric and passes 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.030
 shot was blocked still shoots 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.590
 times and if it does not work with links 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.650
 then of course it has to work with the right 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.930
 and so to double in newcastle 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.460
 cheers storm in the 5 minute already 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.470
 for the second time successful in this 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.270
 game but the first half was still 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.640
 not his after this gate what else 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.560
 take a quick look 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.480
 because had to expect right after the gate 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.100
 another chance that it gibson on 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.860
 the right outside puts the ball in 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.910
 the middle by flank to the header but 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.400
 Cavaliere had to intervene 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.860
 very good opportunity unfortunately lost for 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.970
 Nick Smith and expect good and happy 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.580
 actually the gate jump out 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.890
 but only good so stays 220 for 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.180
 newcastle and yes we came the 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:49.840
 Substitution shortly after the half-time break 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.790
 but only set a good 60 minutes 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.280
 was every since coming to the obertal 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.710
 ball shot from berner was then again 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.650
 put the middle and has cock behind 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.500
 cordon in the penalty area after 68 minutes to 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.870
 3 2 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.890
 and again meets the French 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.130
 outfielder as in the game 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:12.250
 previously according to the template of karl holz 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.780
 gypsum really to the reward for the gate 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.220
 Substitution and here is the coach 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.380
 Apparently he is in a good mood 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.390
 The scorers always down immediately 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.180
 a well so what next situation 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.979
 maze comes with flank of fellaini 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.500
 over the ball tries surplus but 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.409
 even that is not precise as well as 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.509
 the purchase at 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:32.089
 in the final phase of the first half 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.399
 long flank say the very dangerous 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:37.069
 but the shot is good 

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:39.289
 made and at the post but there 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:41.059
 can not really be dangerous 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.489
 if tim howard the istanbul on one 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:46.369
 90 minute I can, I already 

00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:49.249
 from the last game tries his trick 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:50.809
 tried again with the trick looks 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:53.029
 that the ball is on the left too 

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:58.029
 if ever blocked yes and do that 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:58.029
 crew is tough and astor by ben arfa 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:07.579
 a little bit with a lot of luck 

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:09.860
 by bains i hold one 

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:13.189
 attempted clarification os 4.0 beta of 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.110
 Obertraun and to double the 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:16.789
 is actually quite good 81 note 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.379
 can better say two gates 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:20.329
 But it is good 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:23.119
 yes and now it's the next one 

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:24.379
 follow thanks in birmingham and queens park 

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:26.419
 the two pretty far down in the 

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:27.619
 table have but that's only once 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:28.849
 for today and I would say 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:29.929
 at the next episode again and 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.949
 see if it will be back then 

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:32.949
 successful is so far
