ways to do all of these some you don't

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.699 
ways to do all of these some you don't
need<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.430> mavs<00:03:59.610> you<00:03:59.730> could<00:03:59.880> see<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.530> was<00:04:01.530> just

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
need the mavs you could see I was just

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.000 
need the mavs you could see I was just
not<00:04:02.550> every<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.390> best<00:04:03.780> days<00:04:04.020> so<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.709> just

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
decided to UM did the jumps off the map

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.309 
decided to UM did the jumps off the map
and<00:04:08.040> then<00:04:08.280> just<00:04:08.459> fly<00:04:08.670> it<00:04:08.730> back<00:04:08.819> to<00:04:09.090> me<00:04:09.319> I'm

actually get on this building and this

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.740 
actually get on this building and this
whole<00:04:29.460> system<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.000> i<00:04:30.030> just<00:04:30.120> did<00:04:30.450> from<00:04:30.660> the

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
whole system that i just did from the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.180 
whole system that i just did from the
air<00:04:30.870> conditioning<00:04:31.260> unit<00:04:31.530> in<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.800> previous

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
air conditioning unit in the previous

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.129 
air conditioning unit in the previous
shot<00:04:32.790> at<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.030> start<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.419> this<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.960> the

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
shot at the start of this the the

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.780 
shot at the start of this the the
building<00:04:34.500> but<00:04:34.590> it's<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.830> very<00:04:34.860> hard<00:04:35.370> set<00:04:35.639> up

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
building but it's a very hard set up

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.820 
building but it's a very hard set up
jumping<00:04:36.270> off<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.479> map<00:04:36.690> which<00:04:37.380> is<00:04:37.530> sitting<00:04:37.770> on

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
jumping off the map which is sitting on

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.230 
jumping off the map which is sitting on
the<00:04:37.919> air<00:04:38.070> conditioning<00:04:38.400> unit<00:04:38.700> so<00:04:38.850> just<00:04:39.030> do<00:04:39.120> the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
the air conditioning unit so just do the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
the air conditioning unit so just do the
way<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.360> showed<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:39.960> there's<00:04:40.080> less<00:04:40.229> chance

of you dying let's chance of your being
spotted<00:04:42.720> by<00:04:42.840> people<00:04:43.850> so<00:04:44.850> with<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.030> kind<00:04:45.419> of

spotted by people so with this kind of

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.670 
spotted by people so with this kind of
jump<00:04:45.720> this<00:04:45.960> is<00:04:46.080> where<00:04:46.200> you<00:04:46.260> can<00:04:46.350> do<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.470> lot<00:04:46.620> of

jump this is where you can do a lot of
jobs<00:04:46.919> like<00:04:47.130> this<00:04:47.160> just<00:04:47.610> depends<00:04:47.910> on<00:04:47.970> how

flying the mouth back this is just

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.999 
flying the mouth back this is just
purely<00:05:20.669> for<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:20.970> cinematics<00:05:21.690> of<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:21.900> all

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.570 

and<00:05:26.129> yeah<00:05:27.119> epicenters<00:05:27.599> a<00:05:27.629> pretty<00:05:28.580> vulnerable

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
and yeah epicenters a pretty vulnerable

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.129 
and yeah epicenters a pretty vulnerable
Matt<00:05:30.119> like<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:30.419> guess<00:05:30.659> because<00:05:30.779> there's<00:05:30.990> a<00:05:31.110> lot

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
Matt like I guess because there's a lot

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.679 
Matt like I guess because there's a lot
of<00:05:31.349> clusters<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:31.889> buildings<00:05:32.369> and<00:05:32.639> it<00:05:33.449> lends

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689 
of clusters of buildings and it lends

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:35.570 
of clusters of buildings and it lends
itself<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.080> this<00:05:34.229> kind<00:05:34.409> of<00:05:34.499> activity<00:05:34.680> but<00:05:35.189> it's

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
itself to this kind of activity but it's

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.879 
itself to this kind of activity but it's
a<00:05:35.669> sleeper<00:05:36.059> because<00:05:36.149> of<00:05:36.389> people<00:05:36.749> I<00:05:36.960> haven't

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
a sleeper because of people I haven't

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.339 
a sleeper because of people I haven't
seen<00:05:38.009> anyone<00:05:38.219> post<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.909> I'm<00:05:39.899> going<00:05:40.020> to<00:05:40.080> claim

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
seen anyone post this I'm going to claim

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.290 
seen anyone post this I'm going to claim
it<00:05:40.379> maybe<00:05:41.039> people<00:05:41.399> just<00:05:41.430> bored<00:05:41.849> with<00:05:42.059> it<00:05:42.089> by

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
it maybe people just bored with it by

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.219 
it maybe people just bored with it by
now<00:05:42.509> and<00:05:43.849> the<00:05:44.849> thing<00:05:45.210> about<00:05:45.240> this<00:05:45.629> which<00:05:45.990> is<00:05:46.110> an

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
now and the thing about this which is an

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.200 
now and the thing about this which is an
advantage<00:05:46.319> is<00:05:46.710> its<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:46.979> solo<00:05:47.219> glitch<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:48.119> as

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
advantage is its a solo glitch so as

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.459 
advantage is its a solo glitch so as
long<00:05:48.330> as<00:05:48.389> your<00:05:48.569> sniper<00:05:48.779> class<00:05:49.020> and<00:05:49.289> you<00:05:49.349> can

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
long as your sniper class and you can

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.619 
long as your sniper class and you can
change<00:05:49.680> you've<00:05:49.889> got<00:05:49.979> a<00:05:50.009> bit<00:05:50.159> of<00:05:50.189> time<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:51.389> can

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629 
change you've got a bit of time you can

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.119 
change you've got a bit of time you can
do<00:05:51.839> this<00:05:51.990> by<00:05:52.199> yourself<00:05:52.229> it's<00:05:52.740> cool<00:05:52.919> in<00:05:53.069> the

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129 
do this by yourself it's cool in the

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.920 
do this by yourself it's cool in the
sequence<00:05:54.319> and<00:05:56.089> it's<00:05:57.089> not<00:05:57.360> really<00:05:57.599> going<00:05:57.809> to

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
sequence and it's not really going to

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.239 
sequence and it's not really going to
give<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:58.229> unless<00:05:58.499> you're<00:05:58.680> an<00:05:58.740> expert<00:05:59.069> sniper

00:05:59.239 --> 00:05:59.249 
give you unless you're an expert sniper

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:01.969 
give you unless you're an expert sniper
it's<00:05:59.550> going<00:05:59.729> to<00:05:59.819> give<00:05:59.909> you<00:05:59.969> a<00:06:00.029> lot<00:06:00.210> of<00:06:00.979> points

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
it's going to give you a lot of points

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.040 
it's going to give you a lot of points
but<00:06:02.550> it<00:06:02.699> will<00:06:02.969> give<00:06:03.180> you<00:06:03.330> an<00:06:03.419> overwhelming

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
but it will give you an overwhelming

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.309 
but it will give you an overwhelming
sense<00:06:04.229> of<00:06:04.409> smugness<00:06:04.740> which<00:06:05.099> I<00:06:05.219> can't<00:06:05.460> enjoy

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
sense of smugness which I can't enjoy

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.350 
sense of smugness which I can't enjoy
here<00:06:07.319> we<00:06:07.680> have<00:06:07.860> me<00:06:08.069> jumping<00:06:08.610> on<00:06:08.729> the<00:06:08.819> map<00:06:09.029> yet

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
here we have me jumping on the map yet

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.719 
here we have me jumping on the map yet
again<00:06:09.749> just<00:06:10.379> to<00:06:10.439> get<00:06:10.649> bit<00:06:10.889> more<00:06:11.039> elevation<00:06:11.370> and

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
again just to get bit more elevation and

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.309 
again just to get bit more elevation and
to<00:06:12.029> get<00:06:12.180> across<00:06:12.360> to<00:06:12.569> this<00:06:12.659> higher<00:06:12.930> level<00:06:12.960> in

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
to get across to this higher level in

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.010 
to get across to this higher level in
this<00:06:13.469> building<00:06:13.800> but<00:06:14.580> as<00:06:14.819> I<00:06:15.029> stated<00:06:15.360> before<00:06:15.509> you

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
this building but as I stated before you

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.209 
this building but as I stated before you
could<00:06:16.169> probably<00:06:16.319> just<00:06:16.499> run<00:06:16.770> off<00:06:16.889> this<00:06:17.009> balcony

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
could probably just run off this balcony

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:20.209 
could probably just run off this balcony
in<00:06:17.520> fact<00:06:17.729> I<00:06:17.909> think<00:06:18.180> I've<00:06:18.389> done<00:06:18.539> it<00:06:18.659> and<00:06:19.219> run

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
in fact I think I've done it and run

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.179 
in fact I think I've done it and run
straight<00:06:20.520> over<00:06:20.699> to<00:06:20.849> the<00:06:20.939> next<00:06:21.059> building<00:06:22.189> but

00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:23.189 
straight over to the next building but

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:24.529 
straight over to the next building but
the<00:06:23.430> times<00:06:23.639> you<00:06:23.789> don't<00:06:23.999> and<00:06:24.240> if<00:06:24.300> you<00:06:24.360> don't

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
the times you don't and if you don't

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.059 
the times you don't and if you don't
have<00:06:24.689> your<00:06:24.779> spawn<00:06:25.139> beacon<00:06:25.289> out<00:06:25.589> then<00:06:25.800> you<00:06:25.919> just
