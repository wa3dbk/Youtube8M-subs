00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.250 

so<00:03:13.609> that's<00:03:13.849> what<00:03:14.000> my<00:03:14.120> hair<00:03:14.359> looks<00:03:14.540> like<00:03:14.629> so<00:03:15.019> one

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
so that's what my hair looks like so one

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.140 
so that's what my hair looks like so one
side<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.680> lot<00:03:16.069> shorter<00:03:16.099> than<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.790> other<00:03:16.819> and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
side is a lot shorter than the other and

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.179 
side is a lot shorter than the other and
that's<00:03:17.689> because<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.230> nape<00:03:18.469> area<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:19.069> your

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
that's because of the nape area so your

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.640 
that's because of the nape area so your
name<00:03:19.340> Aereo's<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> little<00:03:20.060> bit<00:03:20.180> shorter<00:03:20.569> so<00:03:21.140> um

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
name Aereo's a little bit shorter so um

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.670 
name Aereo's a little bit shorter so um
