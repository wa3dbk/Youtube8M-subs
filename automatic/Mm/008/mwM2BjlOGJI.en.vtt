00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.599
 I am going to tell about fruit I was looking for 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.150
 very long with his name so with me 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.210
 fit personally and because I am very sorry 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.330
 fan of love and I always free 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.430
 house so I thought maybe I should 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.029
 fruit leper again and then I have 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.430
 done and work very well for me 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.400
 That means you spend two days alone 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.160
 eat fruit and then eat normally one day 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.680
 then ask for minus 2 days again in day 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.840
 normal and so on 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.870
 the only disadvantage of a sweater is that you are allowed 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.460
 do not last for 2 to 3 weeks 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.070
 maximum 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.489
 and after that you have to pause man 2 and 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.270
 3 and then you can leave that me again 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.789
 follow and I will therefore make variations 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.260
 of fruit react that such a you a little longer 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.850
 can follow and I think so 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.250
 found it 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.140
 For example, one of variations you choose 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.570
 one day or a maximum of two days a week 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.479
 Friday or profit and then you eat alone 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.820
 but freedom on those days that works 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.750
 very good for the line but also good 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.260
 for your health 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.380
 it cleanses your body one more variation 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:23.479
 from freedom you choose breakfast or lunch or 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:26.390
 dinner and you replace i now from 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.759
 for example, today an I child 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.799
 breakfast and meal was thrown 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.159
 tomorrow platform lunch the day after tomorrow 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.439
 place of dinner and so for that can 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.869
 so decide yourself 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.020
 very good to combine fruit jake 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.560
 with other gate 'is called in english 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.690
 foot comes almost and that means that 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.360
 carbohydrates and proteins 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.450
 never eat together in one meal 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.550
 for example during lunchtime you are alone 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.590
 but carbohydrate bread or other grains 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.250
 you have to look carefully everywhere with siege 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.420
 contains carbohydrates and then my poor food 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.510
 for example meat or fish with vegetables 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:17.010
 in the barrels of proteins or 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.250
 after which a cup of wire or salad 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.470
 The only drawback to this is that you 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.380
 difficult 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.660
 put together a meal because you can 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.400
 for example meat not with potatoes 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.250
 or eat sanne 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.270
 don't travel with fish together but if you like that 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.120
 well studied 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.870
 which product is containing carbohydrates 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.170
 proteins then it really is 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.770
 easier to put the menu together 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:51.330
 set what is still useful as your item 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.900
 is also occasionally a pill ritalin 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.290
 or take minerals and I take 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.989
 for example as a natural eel 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.010
 Tinker series Judy is very good too 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.610
 for your hair and for your skin and if 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.080
 I use a vitamin source 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.290
 pollen grains that is by-products 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.480
 contains a lot of healthy vitamin and 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.760
 minerals 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.110
 so if you are very fast in short term 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.010
 must lose weight than fruitti 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.010
 is really recommended
