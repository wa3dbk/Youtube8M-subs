00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.350
 red sox of the matador played the game 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 that especially in the early access version 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.740
 came out and how they are me 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.710
 but think it's promising 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.730
 actually passable from the graphic 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.470
 looks like one 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.690
 I find it real-time strategy game 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.980
 controls are also similar 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.619
 a little bit difficult to recognize, I am the one 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.380
 this space marine's sister 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.730
 slimmed down and you almost stand 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.050
 I would have gone beyond the whole game 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.669
 just this one and enjoy 7 with it 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.160
 caught seven other players beside 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.420
 defend against waves of monsters 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.820
 and there are some random ones 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.910
 mission goals must be a power plant 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.469
 to be started so something so small 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.809
 and you always have munitions 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.180
 lack of fighting 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.300
 that sounds almost like a kind of so so where 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.760
 was real-time strategy mix with one 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 Heroes and the lack of time actual 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.270
 Traditional brand case should be 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.500
 you have to bridge in this mode 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.710
 Example survive an hour 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.850
 I never did it for more than 20 years 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.549
 minutes with my troupe on the way 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.409
 to be then when the waves are back 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.430
 is that we of course always coffee and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.869
 Tobacco and yes the problem for me now 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.350
 I am almost correct 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.040
 Two hours invested only one easy 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.290
 to have a look 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.630
 that's one climbs up there and bumps 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.520
 then you can also others 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.920
 character classes then lack food 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.619
 I had eight pieces in the game 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.540
 only the choice between east and medic 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.360
 there are still times 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.950
 June can not and so this standard classes 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.240
 which one can imagine 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.490
 and if so how many people can you do that 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.780
 then play together a maximum of eight 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.939
 Finally, with eight people too 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.369
 play because the waves is right 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.929
 and then also the people to 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.210
 example towers can set up 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.070
 We, for example, see it that way 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.079
 machine gun with this very 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.110
 helpful of course, but also go 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.200
 again therefore time broken so well so 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.329
 it's just a horse I played 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.340
 think it's so know 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:15.489
 Not so much for that kids 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.200
 from the people that only exists in 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.630
 small this map or are there several 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.989
 male, there it is later made me 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.190
 give 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.069
 but this one wallet is already 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.420
 huge thats why you look at the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.880
 Map is actually only when 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.130
 these random mission goals are or 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.310
 somehow you have no ammo 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.560
 will have to go search then 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.730
 and then you can just go again 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.200
 very much in the game just do it 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.430
 little things like lying down and everything 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.549
 possible to get better 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.500
 So the question can be defended 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.100
 but as fast as africa 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.190
 carried 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.870
 I would wait a bit longer 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.870
 game is to expect in the course of the year
