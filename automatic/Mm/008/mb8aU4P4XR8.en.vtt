standing for patented overflow and you
touch<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> basin<00:00:10.530> three<00:00:13.130> simple

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
touch this to the basin three simple

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
touch this to the basin three simple
procedure<00:00:14.730> that's<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.780> moment<00:00:27.050> they<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.199> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
procedure that's a moment they have a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
procedure that's a moment they have a
great<00:00:28.500> product<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.099> you're<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.060> take

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
great product so you're going to take

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.810 
great product so you're going to take
your<00:00:30.420> Pio<00:00:31.070> slide<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.250> through<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.520> center

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
your Pio slide it through the center

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.420 
your Pio slide it through the center
just<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:36.140> relatively<00:00:37.140> straight<00:00:37.430> just

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
just like so relatively straight just

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.389 
just like so relatively straight just
put<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> mark<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.059> there<00:00:39.890> take<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.950> out

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.720 

there's<00:00:44.399> no<00:00:44.550> three<00:00:45.120> threads<00:00:46.610> that's<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
there's no three threads that's the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.369 
there's no three threads that's the
marker<00:00:48.090> didn't<00:00:49.460> go<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.230> actually<00:00:52.230> want<00:00:52.350> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
marker didn't go on so actually want to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.380 
marker didn't go on so actually want to
take<00:00:52.530> Teflon<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.660> put<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.750> around<00:00:54.840> there<00:00:56.390> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
take Teflon and put it around there and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.139 
take Teflon and put it around there and
the<00:00:57.570> reason<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.079> Teflon<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.100> fill<00:00:59.940> in

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the reason for the Teflon is to fill in

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.200 
the reason for the Teflon is to fill in
the<00:01:00.770> space<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:02.100> because<00:01:02.399> your<00:01:02.520> gasket<00:01:03.030> will

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the space there because your gasket will

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.530 
the space there because your gasket will
take<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.930> much<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.820> thread

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
take up so much of this of the thread

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.630 
take up so much of this of the thread
itself<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> doesn't<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> finer

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
itself but it doesn't get into the finer

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.109 
itself but it doesn't get into the finer
part<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> thread<00:01:10.490> I've<00:01:11.490> needed<00:01:11.790> some

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
part of the thread I've needed some

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.710 
part of the thread I've needed some
putty<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> use<00:01:15.390> plumber's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
putty and you have to use plumber's

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.600 
putty and you have to use plumber's
putty<00:01:17.060> that's<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.180> must

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.840 

like<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:26.310> taking<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:29.430> slide<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.610> through<00:01:30.640> the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
like so taking it slide it through the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:41.850 
like so taking it slide it through the
sink<00:01:33.120> put<00:01:34.120> our<00:01:34.240> gas<00:01:34.480> in<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.840> place<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:41.620> some

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
sink put our gas in the place and some

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.690 
sink put our gas in the place and some
of<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:41.980> gaskets<00:01:42.400> can<00:01:42.580> be<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> little<00:01:42.940> bit<00:01:43.060> tight

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of the gaskets can be a little bit tight

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.870 
of the gaskets can be a little bit tight
you<00:01:45.700> just<00:01:45.940> have<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.330> work<00:01:46.480> with<00:01:46.690> it<00:01:47.670> that's<00:01:48.670> a

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
you just have to work with it that's a

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.540 
you just have to work with it that's a
slip<00:01:49.540> washer<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.260> prevents<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.920> nut

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
slip washer and that prevents the nut

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:20.970 
slip washer and that prevents the nut
from<00:01:52.510> actually<00:01:55.020> hooking<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.460> rubber<00:02:19.980> and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
from actually hooking the rubber and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
from actually hooking the rubber and
that's<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.370> that's<00:02:22.300> how<00:02:22.480> easy<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:24.000> hook

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
that's it that's how easy it is to hook

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.030 
that's it that's how easy it is to hook
up<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.240> PL<00:02:25.510> plug<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:26.170> just<00:02:26.380> remove<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.830> putty

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
up a PL plug you just remove the putty

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.330 
up a PL plug you just remove the putty
now<00:02:27.280> from<00:02:27.520> this<00:02:27.640> side<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:30.010> then<00:02:30.130> we're<00:02:30.250> all

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
now from this side and then we're all

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.990 
now from this side and then we're all
set

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.470 

that's<00:02:34.000> it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that's it

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.739
