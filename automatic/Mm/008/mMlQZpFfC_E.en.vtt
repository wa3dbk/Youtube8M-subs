00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.690
 talk on the program from today we'll talk about the charisma case and 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:08.400
 parks 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.880
 ex-inmate very appreciated 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.830
 which in part of these pet partners the trend is a 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.310
 Easter Mass there are many asteroids too 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.010
 Some Parrot Masses Succeed This Decision 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.380
 it is not the case of an accident 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.990
 in any way the creation of them in captivity 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.960
 is forbidden with rare exceptions what are they to take 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.300
 for you to have a fun you need to have a breeder has to be 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.050
 legalized by imama and sat 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.660
 in the school environment in the woods she should be 80 years old 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.650
 this life expectancy 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.100
 in captivity she survived from 15 to 20 years ago because people 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.520
 handling in the wrong way 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.619
 this is an area that needs sunbathing etá water baths 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.210
 these sunbathing 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.650
 head until 10 in the morning and after four in the afternoon the water bath him 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.410
 Can be 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.750
 through sprinkling dialogue or 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.430
 a house partnership 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.520
 dialogue even though it can not 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 because otherwise I get hypothermia 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.399
 and die 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.959
 The direct relationship is the people who 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.840
 food and overnight this makes the room vip 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.140
 life expectancy is lower 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.180
 so you have not reached the age of 15 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.310
 why can not you give to commit to create empathy what can not give 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.360
 It is the one that they foods that are 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.190
 because I'm not their day to day 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.850
 It was a surprise for example the coffee 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.960
 cornmeal porridge 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.770
 pure sunflower 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.510
 the borges went all up or down 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.840
 There are people who look just like sunflowers. 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.779
 wants to give particular problems 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.179
 problem in her liver and she dies 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:17.400
 so with regard to food she needs a variety of fruits 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.649
 mars fact 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:21.649
 orange 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.840
 the correlation of seeds 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.770
 pre-cooked food 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.040
 corn and lentil pea 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.189
 in relation to the seeds she can by means of our im man 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.439
 in balanced amounts 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.599
 so that it does not harm her 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.409
 It's an afternoon she's not going to be an easy game. 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:48.479
 she has her companions her whole life if one of these trees die 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.989
 she does not speak but not as another companion she will live alone 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.029
 rest of life 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:57.269
 traffickers because I set a 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.640
 commercialization 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.269
 it's a risk 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.269
 prade because most of them die 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:09.999
 and risk a person who wants to create because he is also a transmitter of 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.069
 zoonoses 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.549
 they are diseases that she transmits to us 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.659
 one of them 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.619
 and it went very wrong 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:23.089
 muscle sectors fever headache 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.720
 have a disease that causes appendicitis 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.429
 for doctors 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:29.930
 fused with appendicitis 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.699
 so you have to be very careful 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.000
 with these animals 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.599
 because they are punished 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.599
 but can be a source of disease transmission 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.489
 I went like this 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.989
 look here 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.019
 That afternoon at the company, it's a good treat. 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.579
 so that it can have a greater survival 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.759
 so folks 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.219
 if you have a picture of this at home 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.159
 without letting it happen when you take 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.590
 sergeant and his family and also look for ibama to 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:00.729
 legalize 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.800
 is the creation of this pet you like so much 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.330
 for them too but still be careful with care 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.860
 what a mother not so important to talk about if the psd should have 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.989
 leave the living quarters of wild animals 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.180
 every day artificial play 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 dental treatment other action 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.949
 last year 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.309
 beneficiaries 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.699
