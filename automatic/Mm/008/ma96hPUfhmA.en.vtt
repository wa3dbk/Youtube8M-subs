00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.300
 what is there more beautiful wiesmann mf5 and 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.590
 that with the new engine and one 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.020
 race track in belgium 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.640
 how to save on the name spar trankow show 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.449
 That's another of the dinosaurs 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.269
 under the race tracks just under seven 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.630
 kilometers through the Ardennes and with 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.240
 really horny curves but the wiesmann 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.330
 mf5 it's about new engine today 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.730
 bmw has the ten cylinder with 507 ps 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.010
 set and therefore must also the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.850
 Both wiesmann brothers hummed 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.610
 to change the aggregate in the top model 555 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.390
 ps from the eight-cylinder stand to 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.850
 disposal 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.350
 a whole lot more than in the predecessor 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.350
 and that goes forward 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.100
 so much power out on the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.290
 race track and is still helmet today 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.490
 but have the roof to us anyway 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.550
 let go on 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.500
 the sticks on the street that you me 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.380
 all the car is known by the wiesmann 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.970
 has a road situation there can 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.120
 others cut off a slice of it though 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.650
 There is nothing to do with vehicle weight 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.370
 the performance that it is a combination 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.990
 this one fits 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.720
 the beautiful is my wiesmann brothers 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.120
 there you are very close to the customer you hear 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 what does not fit where we are not 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.630
 So happy because I last 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.760
 model a bit at the last test 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.830
 So this time faulted complain that the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.630
 steering tell me just escalate 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.980
 you just looked at the steering and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.260
 already the thing is in the corner 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.400
 stabbed as first bus drivers 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.620
 I had to turn right 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.410
 that has become much better a lot 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.540
 and the car has just the right thing 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.240
 ratio of grip on the front axle 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.550
 and souvenir occupation so the command 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.590
 to turn the car drives exactly there 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.040
 and then it comes straight and then 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.870
 can the 555 ps times right 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.780
 marching 680 newton meters 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.440
 torque 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.740
 So where are two turbochargers loading this 4.4 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.360
 liter engine from home bmw on 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.980
 gear since I am actually me 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.690
 honestly glad we did not anymore 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.560
 the smg gear relies on that 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.420
 It was a bit over the years 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.550
 now come one or the other says 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.710
 yes there is now an automatic transmission 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.350
 but that's not really true 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.040
 exciting but it just drives 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.739
 Super great 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.930
 it has been programmed nicely with the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.360
 Rocker switch on the steering wheel and that's one 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.430
 perfect combination so i need 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.070
 no smg whatever shakes whatever 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.570
 beats but that goes without problems 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.090
 also with a conventional automatic 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.489
 gear shift paddles on the steering wheel or 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.840
 If I want the lever to the right 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.480
 then automatically switched to everything 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.030
 but we are on the way in the spar 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.580
 down orange one of the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.860
 first curves are in these links 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.069
 pure and on compression and then in the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.409
 look in the sky but it lies on 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.730
 the street so chassis technology allowed 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.459
 We really do not complain 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.680
 this is quite a big sport 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.200
 viessmann brothers on the wheels 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.360
 put and it is a pleasure and the 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.519
 one or the other from the sports car 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.610
 Group of rubs his eyes what 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.849
 because convertible with theoretically up to 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.099
 311 km / h top served there 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.680
 the engine works in the home bmw im 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.810
 large 5 m and x6 m 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.940
 it has a lot of room to move 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.930
 a ton less that today 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.030
 in wiesmann roadster once with 514 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.890
 your weight that is an announcement that 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.200
 you can actually feel in every meter 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.209
 no matter if it's about braking it's about 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.519
 turn in or, of course, turn 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.489
 accelerate 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.319
 that's incredible about the curve and 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.390
 then comes the next corner in spa 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.900
 franco already nice on the brake 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.730
 turn on car stable 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.660
 That's what makes the sports car 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.620
 Everything hand made everything made in germany 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.919
 I can not think more individually 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.489
 sporty driving and about that 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.720
 design 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.269
 I think we need that at all 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.819
 do not argue the thing just looks 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.660
 times mega moderate even if you are inside 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.430
 seated 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.930
 when boarding the first place, so the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.090
 moment was saying because I never'm coming 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.370
 but then you are in and then 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.720
 Do you really feel like you're in the race? 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.720
 cockpit of a formula 1 car 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.220
 fittingly also enters immediately 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.180
 Formula 1 car over how cool it is 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.180
 please this number here 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.270
 one also stays with the wiesmann brothers 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.420
 not really exist meanwhile 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.970
 It's a digital speed gauge 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.350
 in the display otherwise must always be after 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.900
 look right at the imposing 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.420
 The instruments are all really affectionate 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.010
 Placed are all compact display 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.410
 speed i see my speed 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.730
 neon sign lamps 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.580
 I see old lamps as the right one 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.740
 sports racing car and in addition the 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.750
 rear spoiler automatically drives out 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.820
 But it can also be regulated by hand so 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.360
 clear and otherwise you are 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.830
 simply remained true to tradition and 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.840
 tradition that also means the viessmann 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.720
 start button from the first model on the same 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.910
 installed 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.470
 the beautiful is not only me 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.320
 I have fun but we have to 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.000
 of course, because of the helms one ton 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.520
 take that with you all over 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.960
 comes and also teachers wide grin 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.660
 to recognize under the helmet 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.130
 I think we just keep it that way 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.790
 a bit back and we have one 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.790
 a little fun or
