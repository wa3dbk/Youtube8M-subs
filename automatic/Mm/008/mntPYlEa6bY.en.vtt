00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.160
 hello so today I'm doing a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.710
 small video demonstration on command 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.150
 burned legs 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.980
 if I do not write a double the tape and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 white chocolate I prepared ya two 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.490
 days she's still good everything 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.980
 what remains to be done is to create the rating 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.829
 of this sugar road pack on top 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.210
 so I have the white sugar here granules on 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.680
 can also use a questionnaire 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.770
 doubt what I like to use 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.149
 this one for what is waiting for it 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.070
 obviously depends on the surface we 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.450
 wants to cover over a year that she is pretty 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.309
 serious we believe need a good 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.660
 constitution 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.700
 the idea is to cover the cream 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.629
 burned to make us a layer 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.039
 sugar all over the surface and we have 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.199
 tendency to want to equalize 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.789
 sugar in this corner ramekins it's not 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.980
 a good idea because sugar has 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.539
 tend to settle in the corners so 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.939
 just go gradually we can 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.670
 correct a little like that with the tip 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.799
 fingers something you can do 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.189
 also when we feel that we have 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.729
 covered the surface is the clean the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.950
 around the cape with an ounce 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.780
 sees clean obviously because it's 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.740
 so it will burn when we are 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.299
 returned to the step of burning not calibrated 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.159
 as I explained in my article we 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.780
 can not do this step in advance 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.850
 because the sugar gets very wet 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
 quickly because of content 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.549
 the team of rice cream and sugar 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.229
 liquid does not channel well so I 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.680
 think that for now we have pretty much 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.820
 the good cover of this desire is therefore 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.720
 here we can do a close up 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.850
 here we will see what it gives 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.899
 we can still see the criminal in 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.579
 under the same time a beautiful cover 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.060
 sugar 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.979
 when you are ready to burn the cream 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.450
 we make sure we miss 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.790
 in his left hand on the end of 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.909
 fingers by able to handle it like 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.440
 this one and then in 14 years my hand 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.910
 right this one is a butane torch 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.440
 already in charge of the Eastern and 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.319
 that's where the technique that makes fine 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.620
 degrees are taken into account 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.690
 so you raise your hand at about 45 degrees 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.180
 while turning your fingers quickly 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.380
 we are talking about the burns center and 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.319
 then we go back and forth 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.290
 scoring with the guy it's the torch 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.880
 so we talk about the center and then we go 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.230
 directs in which flap outside 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.360
 it's important to have a movement that 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.940
 was so constant and not stay too 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.310
 for a long time in the same place without which 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.049
 creamery the risks of becoming a little 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.720
 too burned even for people who 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.730
 appreciate the mother according to what 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.890
 realized 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.590
 and then from the inside we 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.760
 gradually directs outward 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.739
 a thing I like to do too 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.870
 it's calling I either roll the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.750
 sugar so these two platforms quinson 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.030
 sugar epinal your bill but to the 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.660
 center as she continues to 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.609
 caramelize 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.000
 this technique allows us to have a 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.940
 surface that is still 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.580
 although classified open also equal to the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.910
 end so after taking a little bit of 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.890
 perseverance 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.690
 once we've done a first round of 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.320
 track if you want is the time to do 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:35.120
 adjustments or modifications 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:38.860
 to get the surface that we're going 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.860
 want to introduce to his guests 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.010
 we can slow down a bit the rate is 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.390
 really a development work 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.100
 a finish still missed 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.700
 two sides of the mic that is the torch 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:58.100
 massacre really does not have much for 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.750
 too fabre and sugar is good when 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.280
 we had right also it takes the thumb of 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.360
 then go back and see them see well 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.360
 and welding and kate 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.800
 I have almost 7,700 result it's the end 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.910
 of whatever so now 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.910
 provide the tax is handed 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.169
 the surface no case can be done 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.460
 I think that's still there 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.840
 good results in the first 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.670
 seconds we can not serve the cream 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.040
 burned because sugar is always 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:41.350
 been going out on the surface so 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:44.110
 finally before presenting the plate 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.610
 to the guests that said it's really the 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.170
 bearing to remember that the what's going 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.640
 also bring back afterwards so without 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.800
 wait two or three hours the what 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.200
 will not be his best yet so that's 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.620
 a window small enough to present 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.700
 the cream of our customers ideally 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.160
 pending the crème brûlée is still 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.950
 cold but all that is still hot 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.140
 that's what's the end result the 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.090
 well appointed leather embarrassment to break the 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:13.600
 crust in front of you to show that everything 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:17.670
 worked well is still an aspect 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.670
 too high too hot 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:34.110
 we can center what a good heat 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.110
 still that emerges from the sugar 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:51.270
 so here we go there that the secret well 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.270
 well cassin and the final act 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.960
 delicious
