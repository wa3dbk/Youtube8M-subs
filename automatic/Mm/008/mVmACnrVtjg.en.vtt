for your mouse it's basically hacking
and<00:02:08.670> slashing<00:02:08.729> especially<00:02:09.689> I<00:02:09.720> don't<00:02:09.959> know<00:02:10.019> if

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and slashing especially I don't know if

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.780 
and slashing especially I don't know if
you<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.379> here<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:11.009> might<00:02:11.159> see<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> minute<00:02:11.640> if

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
you see here you might see a minute if

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.089 
you see here you might see a minute if
you<00:02:11.909> jump<00:02:12.299> and<00:02:12.510> attack<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:13.140> doesn't<00:02:13.830> do<00:02:13.890> any

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
you jump and attack it doesn't do any

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.800 
you jump and attack it doesn't do any
special<00:02:14.489> attack<00:02:14.760> or<00:02:14.939> anything<00:02:15.209> it's<00:02:15.330> sort<00:02:15.720> of

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
special attack or anything it's sort of

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.550 
special attack or anything it's sort of
a<00:02:15.870> stilted<00:02:16.349> like<00:02:16.980> move<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.730> not<00:02:17.939> that<00:02:18.120> great

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
a stilted like move it's not that great

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.089 
a stilted like move it's not that great
but<00:02:19.819> yeah<00:02:20.819> it's<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.959> pretty<00:02:22.230> good<00:02:22.349> like<00:02:22.739> as<00:02:23.069> a

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
but yeah it's it's pretty good like as a

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.760 
but yeah it's it's pretty good like as a
game<00:02:24.469> like<00:02:25.469> hopefully

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
game like hopefully

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.060 
game like hopefully
like<00:02:27.550> when<00:02:27.850> um<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.360> think<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.140> are<00:02:29.320> dead<00:02:30.040> to

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
like when um I think that are dead to

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.710 
like when um I think that are dead to
making<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.940> other<00:02:31.000> people<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.390> make<00:02:31.420> this

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
making the other people to make this

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.990 
making the other people to make this
game<00:02:31.990> it's<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.830> first<00:02:33.010> game<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.610> think<00:02:33.700> if

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
game it's the first game so I think if

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.110 
game it's the first game so I think if
they<00:02:34.240> had<00:02:34.630> some<00:02:34.840> more<00:02:34.990> resources<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.970> know

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
they had some more resources of you know

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.150 
they had some more resources of you know
this<00:02:37.360> game<00:02:37.540> does<00:02:37.840> fairly<00:02:38.290> well<00:02:38.500> as<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.890> think<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
this game does fairly well as I think it

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.860 
this game does fairly well as I think it
is<00:02:39.220> doing<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.640> they<00:02:40.300> could<00:02:40.570> actually

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
is doing that they could actually

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.860 
is doing that they could actually
produce<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.620> fairly<00:02:41.920> nice<00:02:42.040> game<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.210> so<00:02:43.600> far

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
produce a fairly nice game but I so far

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.930 
produce a fairly nice game but I so far
this<00:02:44.050> feels<00:02:44.380> basically<00:02:44.980> like<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> prince<00:02:45.820> of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
this feels basically like a prince of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.140 
this feels basically like a prince of
persia<00:02:46.090> rip<00:02:46.540> off<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.680> game<00:02:48.640> similar<00:02:48.880> I've

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
persia rip off for a game similar I've

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.110 
persia rip off for a game similar I've
got<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> war<00:02:49.540> maybe<00:02:49.780> but<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.980> know<00:02:51.100> but<00:02:51.850> doesn't

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
got a war maybe but you know but doesn't

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.750 
got a war maybe but you know but doesn't
indie<00:02:52.270> game<00:02:52.450> it's<00:02:52.660> fairly<00:02:52.900> good<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:54.520> graphics

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
indie game it's fairly good the graphics

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.900 
indie game it's fairly good the graphics
are<00:02:55.030> definitely<00:02:55.420> good<00:02:55.710> he<00:02:56.710> here<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.490> see<00:02:57.700> me

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
are definitely good he here you see me

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.240 
are definitely good he here you see me
doing<00:02:58.510> pulling<00:02:59.410> this<00:02:59.560> thing<00:02:59.620> open<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.220> this

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
doing pulling this thing open like this

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.520 
doing pulling this thing open like this
or<00:03:00.580> but<00:03:00.820> I<00:03:00.850> think<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.180> are<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.420> get<00:03:01.720> four<00:03:02.500> of

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
or but I think it are you get four of

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.910 
or but I think it are you get four of
these<00:03:02.740> and<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:03.100> get<00:03:03.280> on<00:03:03.430> some<00:03:04.180> extra<00:03:04.510> health

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
these and you get on some extra health

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.890 
these and you get on some extra health

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.729 

dodge<00:03:38.969> like<00:03:39.719> your<00:03:39.870> first<00:03:40.019> shift<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.530> dodge<00:03:40.709> out

which ye dodge it just be me I today
you've<00:03:53.400> actually<00:03:53.549> got<00:03:53.849> a<00:03:53.879> run<00:03:54.090> into<00:03:54.390> him<00:03:54.510> a

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
you've actually got a run into him a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.240 
you've actually got a run into him a
king<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.200> hopefully<00:03:55.560> if<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.859> get<00:03:56.099> hit

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
king and hopefully if you get hit

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.869 
king and hopefully if you get hit
something<00:03:56.639> terribly<00:03:56.909> its<00:03:57.389> water<00:03:58.579> which<00:03:59.579> are

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
something terribly its water which are

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.770 
something terribly its water which are
you<00:04:00.750> know<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.409> isn't<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.769> engaging<00:04:02.099> or<00:04:02.430> great

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
you know it isn't that engaging or great

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.910 
you know it isn't that engaging or great
but<00:04:03.780> yeah<00:04:04.530> that's<00:04:04.769> way<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.099> is<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:06.739> think<00:04:07.739> with<00:04:07.889> a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
but yeah that's way it is I think with a

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.479 
but yeah that's way it is I think with a
few<00:04:08.400> patches<00:04:08.939> now<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.540> game<00:04:09.719> could<00:04:09.959> be<00:04:10.079> good

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
few patches now this game could be good

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.530 
few patches now this game could be good
it's<00:04:11.489> definitely<00:04:11.879> good<00:04:12.030> for<00:04:12.060> their<00:04:12.329> first

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
it's definitely good for their first

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.440 
it's definitely good for their first
game<00:04:13.250> but<00:04:14.250> yeah<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.879> just<00:04:14.939> needs<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.269> bit<00:04:15.299> of

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
game but yeah it just needs a bit of

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.479 
game but yeah it just needs a bit of
Polish<00:04:15.870> there's<00:04:16.289> are<00:04:16.500> definitely<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.310> few

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
Polish there's are definitely a few

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.789 
Polish there's are definitely a few
annoyances<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:18.329> will<00:04:18.989> try<00:04:19.259> and<00:04:19.380> finish<00:04:19.590> this
