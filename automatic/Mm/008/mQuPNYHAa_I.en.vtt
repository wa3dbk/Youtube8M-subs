slightly<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.119> babies<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> bit<00:01:42.869> worse<00:01:43.320> than

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
slightly to babies get a bit worse than

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.649 
slightly to babies get a bit worse than
I<00:01:43.829> thought<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.040> would<00:01:44.220> actually<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.329> in

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
I thought it would actually be going in

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.319 
I thought it would actually be going in
the<00:01:46.409> first<00:01:46.560> place<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.220> maybe<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> bright

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the first place but maybe in the bright

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
the first place but maybe in the bright
side<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.630> things<00:01:48.750> maybe<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> actually<00:01:49.799> get

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
side of things maybe we can actually get

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.789 
side of things maybe we can actually get
this<00:01:50.369> done<00:01:50.579> maybe<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.350> point<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.530> where<00:01:52.710> we

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
this done maybe we can point a where we

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.139 
this done maybe we can point a where we
need<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.520> then<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:53.970> do
