00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.939
 he proves how to fight second 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:37.830
 training session with footballers 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:39.089
 thirties on one side 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.540
 Of course, the boys say they have a side 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:45.899
 all are free, they are not the only ones 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.460
 currently training and told her yes 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.800
 then let us do it directly 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.739
 do our training because that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.899
 goes well with the care we have 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.129
 made a lot of fun and got it 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.079
 I stay the wish very much 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.469
 made fun what your first meeting 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.399
 with a disability or had it there 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.199
 already experience 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.600
 No, I have my experience 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.880
 Among other things, they are not allowed to do much 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.210
 and so far that was 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.060
 no new territory for me now and that is 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.610
 normal for me , too 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.700
 is so that one excludes that there and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.250
 and and has reservations or 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.380
 other but as I said that it is 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.369
 most normal in the world and I believe 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.979
 we have again 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.380
 impressively proved that we on the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.549
 field are all the same again 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.170
 in the coming week find only the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.180
 Player with people I the special 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.380
 olympics is going to be held on 2014 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.119
 stop by once 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.340
 I think that I will stop by 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.259
 We then have the exceptions in ours 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 the cabin will be the most 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.799
 his holiday but I will anyway still 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.450
 lose a bit further here and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.820
 will certainly synonymous examples 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.829
 we have four 1800 athletes here 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.290
 what do you want the brand up to 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.570
 I want to be thrown in the first place 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.729
 a lot of fun that you 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.350
 you are with as much heart and soul as you are 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.290
 the guys were here today too 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.570
 and that they can just enjoy it 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.519
 the time they have we have great 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.320
 Competitions, of course, also a lot of success 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.110
 but first and foremost, of course 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.910
 then the health that we each from 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.500
 the competitions also come out healthy 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.500
 and yes, still weak
