runs at a 5.9 right now and you can see

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.260 
runs at a 5.9 right now and you can see
but<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> same<00:01:43.909> processor<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:44.970> yours

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
but it's the same processor is yours

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.990 
but it's the same processor is yours
just<00:01:46.170> different<00:01:46.560> memory<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.250> graphics<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
Razer Naga back to put epic right now

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.900 
Razer Naga back to put epic right now
it's<00:02:19.600> kind<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:20.500> sold<00:02:20.710> out<00:02:20.860> when<00:02:21.520> they<00:02:21.640> get<00:02:21.790> that

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
it's kind of sold out when they get that

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.430 
it's kind of sold out when they get that
website<00:02:22.330> for<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.540> long<00:02:22.690> time<00:02:22.990> but<00:02:23.430> I'm<00:02:24.430> really

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
website for a long time but I'm really

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.750 
website for a long time but I'm really
would<00:02:26.440> be<00:02:26.530> really<00:02:26.710> happy<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.250> get<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.400> Intel

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
so we can run my computer as well too

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.930 
so we can run my computer as well too
and<00:02:30.100> probably<00:02:30.610> be<00:02:30.790> gaining<00:02:31.000> much<00:02:31.690> better
