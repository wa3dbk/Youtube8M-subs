00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.120
 well, I really enjoyed what 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.070
 what comes next careful 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.590
 careful because the truth is that it is 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.230
 incredible that of a reflected when 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:29.029
 we started since you find it more difficult 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.949
 put the biggest ones to the little ones 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.770
 I think the older ones look if you do not 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.770
 yes to the elderly because good maybe 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.680
 they have so much way to go 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.020
 still that the older ones had 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.280
 some who were older and are 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.920

 then they do not have him left 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.960
 very much and also that what they have to 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.700
 to do is to focus on learning 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.530
 in enjoying and 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.910
