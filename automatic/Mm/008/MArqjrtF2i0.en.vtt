I<00:00:06.859> had<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.099> motor<00:00:08.809> which<00:00:09.809> are<00:00:09.929> used<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.260> my

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
I had a motor which are used in my

I had a motor which are used in my
electrical<00:00:11.179> I've<00:00:12.179> decided<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.809> increase<00:00:13.320> its

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
electrical I've decided to increase its

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.880 
electrical I've decided to increase its
power<00:00:13.650> by<00:00:14.250> rewinding<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.500> beginning

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890

mr.<00:00:23.369> Avila<00:00:23.779> in<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.930> beginning<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.380> had<00:00:25.760> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
mr. Avila in the beginning I had the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.529 
mr. Avila in the beginning I had the
coils<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.480> contained<00:00:27.990> about<00:00:28.369> 23<00:00:29.369> turns<00:00:29.609> now

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
coils it contained about 23 turns now

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.780 
coils it contained about 23 turns now
I'm<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.289> try<00:00:31.529> out<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.099> increase<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
I'm going to try out and increase the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.600 
I'm going to try out and increase the
number<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.090> turns<00:00:33.390> 30<00:00:34.140> turns<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.430> see

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
number of turns 30 turns as you can see

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.940 
number of turns 30 turns as you can see
it<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.910> very<00:00:35.940> difficult<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.809> incorporate<00:00:37.290> more

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it is very difficult to incorporate more

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.130 
it is very difficult to incorporate more
wire<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.790> I'm<00:00:38.910> trying<00:00:39.210> my<00:00:39.300> level<00:00:39.540> best<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
wire but I'm trying my level best to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.560 
wire but I'm trying my level best to
just<00:00:40.590> put<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.920> put<00:00:41.250> more<00:00:41.489> wire<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.510> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
just put it put more wire in so that I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.209 
just put it put more wire in so that I
could<00:00:42.870> increase<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.290> power<00:00:43.710> doshaka<00:00:44.700> shall<00:00:45.000> go

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
could increase my power doshaka shall go

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.270 
could increase my power doshaka shall go
I<00:00:47.480> do<00:00:48.480> not<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.840> any<00:00:49.110> specialized<00:00:49.620> tools<00:00:49.980> then

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
I do not have any specialized tools then

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.990 
I do not have any specialized tools then
most<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> tools<00:00:51.000> I'm<00:00:51.210> using<00:00:51.239> our<00:00:51.690> simple

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000

very<00:01:00.410> simple<00:01:01.410> gadgets<00:01:01.949> I'm<00:01:02.460> trying<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.000> my

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
very simple gadgets I'm trying to do my

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.240 
very simple gadgets I'm trying to do my
level<00:01:03.480> best<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.930> make<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.769> more<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.189> more

efficient and powerful right now
a<00:01:09.450> day<00:01:09.960> back<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.619> tried<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.400> notice<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
a day back I tried to notice that it is

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.310 
a day back I tried to notice that it is
drying<00:01:12.810> about<00:01:13.350> 4<00:01:14.070> impaired<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:15.540> impairs<00:01:16.080> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
drying about 4 impaired for impairs of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.380 
drying about 4 impaired for impairs of
current<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.729> 40th<00:01:18.270> works<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.140> about

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
current on 40th works so that is about

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.130 
current on 40th works so that is about
192<00:01:21.390> watts<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:22.110> power<00:01:23.420> when<00:01:24.420> I'm<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
192 watts of power when I'm going to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.020 
192 watts of power when I'm going to
increase<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.680> number<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.009> turns<00:01:26.310> I'm<00:01:26.670> also

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
increase the number of turns I'm also

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
increase the number of turns I'm also
going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> increase<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.110> number<00:01:29.009> of

going to increase the number of
batteries<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.670> using<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.689> jump

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
batteries on using and I'm going to jump

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.520 
batteries on using and I'm going to jump
to<00:01:31.310> from<00:01:32.310> 48<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.790> 60<00:01:33.509> volt<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> means

to from 48 to 60 volt that if that means

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.130 
to from 48 to 60 volt that if that means
that<00:01:34.740> I'm<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.340> using<00:01:35.670> about<00:01:35.930> five<00:01:36.930> of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
that I'm going to be using about five of

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.170 
that I'm going to be using about five of
the<00:01:37.259> batteries<00:01:37.650> five<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> 12<00:01:38.549> volt<00:01:38.850> let's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the batteries five of the 12 volt let's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.929 
the batteries five of the 12 volt let's
you<00:01:39.479> let<00:01:39.869> us<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> batteries<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.920> I'm<00:01:41.759> just

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you let us it batteries and I'm just

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.480 
you let us it batteries and I'm just
only<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.659> more<00:01:43.140> power<00:01:43.490> suppose

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
only going to get more power suppose

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.450 
only going to get more power suppose
every<00:01:45.180> with<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.930> setup<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.770> once<00:01:47.340> again

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
every with this setup it's once again

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.480 
every with this setup it's once again
draining<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.899> pairs<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> currents

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
draining for in pairs of the currents

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.550 
draining for in pairs of the currents
and<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:51.270> pouring<00:01:51.630> pairs<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.049> currents<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.470> it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and with pouring pairs of currents if it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.289 
and with pouring pairs of currents if it
is<00:01:52.680> multiplied<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.340> 16<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
is multiplied with the 16 I'm going to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.130 
is multiplied with the 16 I'm going to
get<00:01:54.540> it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
get it

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.420 
get it
141<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:57.060> let's<00:01:57.510> hope<00:01:57.720> for<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:57.990> best

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
141 so let's hope for the best

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.740 
141 so let's hope for the best
actually<00:01:59.430> what<00:01:59.550> happened<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.060> everybody

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
actually what happened out in everybody

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.300 
actually what happened out in everybody
