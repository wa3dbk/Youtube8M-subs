enclosure<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.109> filled<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:22.830> there's<00:00:23.250> about

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
enclosure I filled with there's about

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.340 
enclosure I filled with there's about
three<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.820> half<00:00:23.850> inches<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.420> substrate<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
three and a half inches of substrate to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.960 
three and a half inches of substrate to
the<00:00:25.439> deep<00:00:25.590> end<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.920> then<00:00:26.550> he<00:00:26.609> dropped<00:00:26.820> to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the deep end and then he dropped to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.060 
the deep end and then he dropped to
about<00:00:27.210> three<00:00:28.279> down<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.119> shallow<00:00:30.390> part<00:00:31.070> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
about three down in the shallow part and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.740 
about three down in the shallow part and
that's<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.369> DAF<00:00:32.610> stiff<00:00:32.850> he<00:00:33.000> wants<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.270> dig<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
that's so DAF stiff he wants to dig and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.690 
that's so DAF stiff he wants to dig and
whatever<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.649> although<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.520> know<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
whatever it can although I know that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
whatever it can although I know that
these<00:00:35.880> usually<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.960> stay<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.200> from<00:00:37.500> this

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
these usually like to stay out from this

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.500 
these usually like to stay out from this
place<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.840> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.320> substrate<00:00:40.920> there

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
place so you can see it substrate there

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.049 
place so you can see it substrate there
nice<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.540> deep<00:00:42.899> all<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.379> way<00:00:44.059> although

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
nice and deep all the way although

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.869 
nice and deep all the way although
through<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.789> do

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
through it and what I was going to do

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:48.889 
through it and what I was going to do
someone<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.270> put<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> couple<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.780> little

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
someone just put a couple of little

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.830 
someone just put a couple of little
decorations<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:51.210> tube<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.809> I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
decorations in this little tube is on I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.860 
decorations in this little tube is on I
like<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> can

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
like because it's a you can see it can

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.220 
like because it's a you can see it can
nicely<00:00:55.289> tunnel<00:00:55.649> down<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.020> under

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
nicely tunnel down and you can get under

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.479 
nicely tunnel down and you can get under
there<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.530> did<00:00:58.680> imagine<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.129> come<00:00:59.280> be

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
there I did imagine it will come be

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.910 
there I did imagine it will come be
quite<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> popular<00:01:00.030> or<00:01:00.390> high<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.780> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
quite a popular or high for it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.550 
quite a popular or high for it
I'm<00:01:02.820> also<00:01:03.000> got<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> artificial<00:01:04.290> leaf<00:01:05.570> I<00:01:06.570> like

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
I'm also got a artificial leaf I like

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.219 
I'm also got a artificial leaf I like
the<00:01:07.770> artificial<00:01:08.220> leaves<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.900> much<00:01:10.049> for

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the artificial leaves not be so much for

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.969 
the artificial leaves not be so much for
decoration<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:11.549> more<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.590> put<00:01:13.830> light

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
decoration but more for if you put light

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.410 
decoration but more for if you put light
little<00:01:14.159> bits<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.430> water<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.060> droplets

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
little bits of water on little droplets

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
little bits of water on little droplets
of<00:01:15.509> water<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:16.439> hold<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.070> nicely

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of water they hold that in nicely

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.890 
of water they hold that in nicely
rather<00:01:17.820> than<00:01:17.939> using<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.270> water<00:01:18.479> dish<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
rather than using a water dish with a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.749 
rather than using a water dish with a
smaller<00:01:19.200> inverts<00:01:21.590> yeah<00:01:22.590> obviously<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.640> is

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
smaller inverts yeah obviously this is

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.270 
smaller inverts yeah obviously this is
just<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> think<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:26.159> little<00:01:27.030> fake<00:01:27.270> plant

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
just what I think so a little fake plant

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.649 
just what I think so a little fake plant
this<00:01:29.280> down<00:01:29.610> here

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.989 

what<00:01:35.560> we<00:01:35.859> do<00:01:36.039> anything<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.399> be<00:01:36.609> honest<00:01:36.819> but<00:01:36.880> you

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
what we do anything to be honest but you

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.510 
what we do anything to be honest but you
know<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.659> then<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.469> here<00:01:38.890> just<00:01:39.189> another

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
know and then this here just another

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.529 
know and then this here just another
little<00:01:40.109> piece<00:01:41.109> of<00:01:41.490> substrate<00:01:42.490> called<00:01:43.299> block

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
little piece of substrate called block

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.620 
little piece of substrate called block
and<00:01:44.140> then<00:01:44.619> here<00:01:44.859> I've<00:01:45.069> got<00:01:45.250> some<00:01:45.490> fresh<00:01:45.850> moss

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
and then here I've got some fresh moss

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.440 
and then here I've got some fresh moss
this<00:01:46.929> is<00:01:47.079> stuff<00:01:47.229> I've<00:01:47.409> been<00:01:47.500> growing<00:01:47.770> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
this is stuff I've been growing this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.330 
this is stuff I've been growing this
that<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.539> can<00:01:49.659> hear<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:52.619> squelching<00:01:53.619> this

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
that you can hear that squelching this

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.999 
that you can hear that squelching this
is<00:01:54.490> really<00:01:54.849> really<00:01:54.969> damp<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.740> what<00:01:56.859> I'm<00:01:56.920> gonna

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
is really really damp so what I'm gonna

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.589 
is really really damp so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:57.130> is<00:01:57.219> I'm<00:01:57.310> gonna<00:01:57.399> take<00:01:57.459> just<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.359> little<00:01:58.450> bit

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
do is I'm gonna take just a little bit

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.779 
do is I'm gonna take just a little bit
of<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:58.929> don't<00:01:59.079> want<00:01:59.200> loads<00:01:59.409> in<00:01:59.649> there<00:01:59.799> and

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
of this I don't want loads in there and

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.779 
of this I don't want loads in there and
I'm<00:02:01.209> gonna<00:02:01.329> put<00:02:02.109> this<00:02:02.319> probably<00:02:03.250> just<00:02:03.490> around

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
I'm gonna put this probably just around

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.979 
I'm gonna put this probably just around
its<00:02:04.950> enclosure<00:02:05.969> around<00:02:06.969> this<00:02:07.299> high<00:02:07.450> side<00:02:07.950> so

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
its enclosure around this high side so

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.240 
its enclosure around this high side so
I'll<00:02:10.989> try<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.349> break<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.709> up<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:11.829> bit<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:11.980> it's

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
I'll try and break it up a bit so it's

I'm sure they'll be able to give me some

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.000 
I'm sure they'll be able to give me some
some<00:02:51.310> advice<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:52.019> then<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> little<00:02:53.919> bit

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
some advice and then have a little bit

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.400 
some advice and then have a little bit
more<00:02:55.319> just<00:02:56.319> sort<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.889> round<00:02:57.579> here<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.410> don't

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
more just sort of round here and don't

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.140 
more just sort of round here and don't
keep<00:02:59.709> this<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.900> humidity<00:03:01.900> enclosure<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.760> I

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
keep this to humidity enclosure but I

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.210 
keep this to humidity enclosure but I
think<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.660> really<00:03:05.109> does<00:03:05.349> look<00:03:05.410> quite<00:03:05.829> nice

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
think it really does look quite nice

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.309 
think it really does look quite nice
when<00:03:07.030> you've<00:03:07.180> actually<00:03:07.299> got<00:03:07.599> some<00:03:07.810> growth<00:03:08.169> in

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
when you've actually got some growth in

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.909 
when you've actually got some growth in
there<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.930> not<00:03:11.049> enough<00:03:11.109> obviously<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.709> don't

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
there but not enough obviously I don't

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.610 
there but not enough obviously I don't
to<00:03:12.130> go<00:03:12.280> mouldy<00:03:12.940> or<00:03:13.030> anything<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.389> and<00:03:14.019> this

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
to go mouldy or anything that and this

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.050 
to go mouldy or anything that and this
will<00:03:14.739> probably<00:03:15.010> drop<00:03:15.160> quite<00:03:15.549> quick<00:03:15.790> but

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
will probably drop quite quick but

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.520 
will probably drop quite quick but
thankfully<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.569> have<00:03:16.840> all<00:03:16.989> hoods<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.380> this
