00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.790
 this is our drinking water pipeline 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.960
 water 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.420
 worth the preliminary 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.659
 cleaning and 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.479
 percentage with direct feed system wall 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.079
 to end 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.969
 vodka 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.340
 at the same time by force 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.179
 as it is 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.609
 recall 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.159
 our salute to history 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.159
 boars will not expect from him 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.269
 why he was not explicit 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.689
 as I recall it 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.810
 world's first 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.250
 received 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.540
 mother carbon 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.240
 sorbent 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.240
 possessing according to the conclusion 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.910
 american custody 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.060
 Sumtsova ability to 350 times greater than 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.750
 father on ability 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.500
 coconut shoulder fracture percentage 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.150
 walnut 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.200
 which are filled with the rest of the films 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.380
 gain experience 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.440
 see if we can visually 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.440
 see from Uralsk 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.520
 most striking phenomenon 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.760
 obviously observed consumption growth in 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.870
 teaching areas in April 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.000
 this is what brings eesu water filtration 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.130
 our filler 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.230
 that is, with piles 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.620
 no time required 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.970
 no special calendars for which 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.580
 need to conclude 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.590
 travel cards to represent for yourself 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.890
 the time when he finished 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.090
 salt and matched ability 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.280
 as a rule, they are not originally there 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.419
 no, I mean other filters 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.419
 because 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.129
 he himself locked up 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.179
 once 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.309
 about 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.269
 considering the fact that the processes are actually going 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.819
 sorption 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.139
 if we took something on this segment 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.629
 that it is clear that it was compacted clear 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.559
 that water will eventually go a little 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.339
 implementations 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.559
 and the further the more and at the end 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.069
 of all 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.549
 archaeologists wait until it falls to 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:39.659
 charters 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.279
 water so sorry and fsin part and finally 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.859
 he himself is going to 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.269
 he no longer miss your year 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.969
 it is unique absolutely 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.229
 fantastic expected phenomenon 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.379
 because if we have another new 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.789
 activated carbon 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.069
 in and passes by she clears nothing 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.930
 activated carbon is definitely a substance 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.189
 perfectly distinguishing gas 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.779
 but practically 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.919
 having a conflict of insignificant percents 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.009
 relation to water treatment 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:13.429
 and the battalion first created materials 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.429
 which we can already talk about 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.979
 a new era has come 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.929
 input will be asked 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:23.189
 cleaning 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.059
 drinking water 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:27.039
 my water 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.769
 from the first wind 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.019
 that is, the water that was cleaned it 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.019
 base price 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.539
 this is a wonderful highlight 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.319
 so they are somewhere perfect 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.509
 same but more of this filter 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.289
 maybe she will get more 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.289
 let's also find her 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.949
 at this distance we will see equality 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.819
 this single glass 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.019
 in which you see 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.009
 unprecedented water with a blue tint 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:16.909
 compared to all the others 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.849
 here I am with the same effects 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.389
 move 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.389
 t 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.340
 curious what question about po 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.370
 here are three filters by forum 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.650
 none of them 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.650
 absolutely nothing 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.679
 I stirred these glasses curious 

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:55.069
 is it possible unconditionally 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.069
 recognize where is the donkey here 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.550
 and can I find out 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.550
 even died because of cloud filters 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.479
 different from the other 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.530
 I would like to demonstrate 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.879
 once again dry 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.639
 properties 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.889
 sorbent machine 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:29.809
 on one 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:32.249
 very clear example 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:33.939
 when laboratory is not required 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.249
 trials 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:36.969
 certificates 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.550
 to such depth 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.389
 cleaned up in may 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:41.620
 liquid 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.009
 in hand 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.009
 famous drink all over 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.860
 from our filter 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.860
 now we can really 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.270
 without laboratory without certificate 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.130
 see that there is only one in the world 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:20.569
 sorbent 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.919
 which is real 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.550
 clear 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.550
 even such a true solution as 

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:30.089
 coca cola 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.539
 there is no coca precipitation to the near post 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:33.680
 Cole is true 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.210
 this experiment we once again showed 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.330
 confirmed 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.690
 premium created a unique substance 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.999
 able to clean 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:43.889
 drinking water 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.419
 to the depth of cleaning that is unattainable 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:47.319
 was earlier 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.210
 copper with any technology
