00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 I bathe the health of his music lovers 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.680
 who opposes the axÃ© but in wintzenheim 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.160
 czapnik mertian that mike to cerium his 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.660
 jokes 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.530
 judging these fatwas 80 guests I hope 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.969
 that you're fine 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.170
 so today we finally find ourselves 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.010
 for the custody cost review it's 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.670
 true that it's been a long time since I 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.890
 say that I have to do 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.599
 it is finally available at the level of 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.950
 the low team and the boom destruction 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.630
 I simply did not change 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.189
 the team I'm the four hunters for 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.090
 increase his entire stats because that 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.619
 that you draw from it I thought it 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.000
 was not going so since that makes 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.260
 super long time I've done this 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.180
 mustoir magazine bombarded the bar of 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.559
 gems there because ben she's finally 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.420
 available this review I put time 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.710
 to do that's true so to you have some 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.390
 statins that parade very very 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.949
 quickly I invite you to do so 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.149
 start so low a lot of glass when 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.940
 even you will not see much yellow 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.989
 but of the young who plays a lot so our 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.850
 ranges what can we say about him 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.079
 so already on fifa 13 it's a player 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.149
 that I really had a lot 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.920
 liked I had tried all versions 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.989
 so the regular who was at 500 credits 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.770
 which was that most people 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.039
 by the way used as a medium 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.870
 recuperator on the ground floor 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.510
 in a word, it is the version version 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.620
 boost and then after I had never 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.050
 to have a review on the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.390
 man of the match version of ica iguana 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.470
 dogan so the man of the match for me 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.490
 if I have to do something he is 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.080
 stronger than the man of the match of 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.940
 last year so already it feels 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.069
 at the stats level with 1.84 in general 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.509
 this year it is exceptional 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.340
 it's just exceptional so I 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.750
 let the mcg left a word so it's 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.849
 finally most clips on a word 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.619
 it's because the clips omc the effects 

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:28.220
 is really too long ago and suddenly 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.569
 Well, there's no such thing as just I 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.550
 read more wto team 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.649
 but most of the clips at the 100th at 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.970
 these but I tried in the east so its 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.929
 basic version and mcm and I I the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.420
 pushing even daring because simply 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.250
 jury that blunt in a 3 5 2 and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.390
 here it is in both cases you 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.069
 do not worry about it exceptional so 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.619
 in mc but we like it is as 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.660
 commander mc as a playmaker 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.729
 so in a layout of the drawing mc 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.289
 Here is the 4-3-3 rise and the MC the leader 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.000
 it was in the game I had it 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.979
 use that so gounod win 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.050
 technically perfect technically 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.849
 perfect 4 and technical gestures after 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.039
 tons bad foot hylas 1 90 in 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.690
 so dribble necessarily with 1.90 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.009
 sandrine you're having fun you're having fun 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.500
 much more than a day at 4 stars 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.030
 but because 1.82 in dribbling here is a 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.770
 agility of sick so what does this 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.489
 which makes gounod win me I had 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.750
 the impression that I had fifteen days 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.030
 five stars except that you can not do 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.830
 the gestures 5 stars 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.970
 it is just exceptional in dribbling 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.080
 I just really took 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.910
 a lot of fun playing with 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.290
 I 'm still having fun because I 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.380
 will keep it I will not sell it will not 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.700
 do not worry about the price the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.520
 price I put them in the most because 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.910
 it's true that this is a detail that 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.620
 not bad 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.270
 so at first I bought it 3000 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.010
 credit is I bought it a lot of 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.900
 time already and I had bought thirty 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.610
 thousand credit he went down I checked 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.780
 just now it is selling at 20000 to 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.790
 20000 credit honestly I'm not going 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.860
 lie to you it's really a beautiful 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.140
 deal because ben simply has 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.820
 he's a player of a very big 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.650
 quality you will see the note at the end 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.330
 I consider it the first 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.620
 players of the game so there are many 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.540
 also that I consider them all 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.800
 best players in the game but the 20000 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.350
 credit honestly they are not lost 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.519
 they are really reinvested it's the 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.959
 kind of joy actually who can do the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.040
 diff for an offensive midfielder 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.780
 honestly usually I do not mark 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.069
 many and the cities and offensive and I 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.870
 do more I mark more than I do 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.160
 assists then after and something 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.220
 with windows wins which is interesting 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.769
 it's not a day instat in 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.630
 the sense that he is going to get you back pretty well 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.010
 balloons and balloons that can 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.269
 to prove decisive that is to say before 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.260
 the cages have you recovered a balloon 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.299
 because he still has a stat of 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.790
 defenses really very interesting a 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.930
 good stat age in tackles and so he goes 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.160
 you recover balloons really 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.690
 important that can be transformed into 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.220
 goal so it's in the clippers and in 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.110
 the clips at the beginning of the beginning of this 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.489
 video there are a lot of low goals so 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.350
 you look good you come back in 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.880
 back you actually see segundo ghana 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.260
 the goal recovery it is he who puts 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.030
 the heap so who sets foot so who 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.530
 get the ball back so com com com 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.799
 people to do so little clip fast done 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.269
 see bar he is present defensively 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.410
 that with the fact that ben at the base 100 m 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.910
 it is still a good 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.989
 defensive skills but I do it 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.430
 really prefer in an offensive role 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.850
 because he has an offensive contribution 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.560
 simply strong 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.540
 to improve that the operator is 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.260
 for me it's not playable even if after 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.370
 it's true that there are people who 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.510
 come to play the shots at rhisnes who 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.970
 is exactly in this hall in this 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.840
 case there and I prefer it to amos and I 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.660
 find that the master in the middle 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.440
 recuperator for example is messing up the 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.180
 offensive potential of the guy 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.680
 so that's a quality of pass to her at 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.430
 make you go just monstrous zdar 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.140
 its pass quality 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.240
 there you will have a small example 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.790
 so on the corners I make him shoot 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.410
 the corners by far to center I'm going 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.580
 not shoot the corners to shoot because 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.970
 that already geismar runners in my 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.500
 team 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.590
 I did not have too I did not have any 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.140
 to help corner closely and well everything 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.850
 simply he has a correct stat but I 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.550
 prefers to shoot with marco reus who has 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.220
 even better at the stage he took 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.600
 1.90 and that it can be understood but 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.580
 it is true that gounod ghana he has 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.710
 good stats he has full stats on 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.750
 the free kicks on the penalties even 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.200
 acronym 1.76 a penalty but good the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.510
 penaltys with a player at 38 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.310
 marckois it's his canvas to shoot it's up to 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.290
 you his offensive assets of the summits 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.880
 do not get them out what and that's it 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.500
 so quality of typing quality passes 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.180
 that you could see he's in finish 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.340
 really not good and yet bab 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.450
 I scored a lot of goals but I 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.980
 put in the negative points anyway 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.720
 because I want to clarify what 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.490
 so that's where it's the last clip 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.900
 it's a clip of this review 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.400
 I sorted because I had 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.750
 certainly had an old-fashioned clip that 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.190
 I had more and so I had to do 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.930
 new ones his voice that I have not marked 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.390
 bad goals so that's goundo 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.980
 win the balance sheet so at the level of the most 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.300
 I put the price because 20000 credit 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.670
 for me with one day this quality there 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.500
 it's really affordable and it's a gift 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.790
 the kicks stopped the shots of 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.230
 foot stopped because on the corners 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.660
 as you could see a very very 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.910
 beautiful pass quality 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:29.840
 the effects so goes the effects when he 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.490
 strikes his strength he has almost 1 81 76 77 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.020
 in force I say no nonsense for 1 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.169
 meter 80 names that holds good on his 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.120
 legs his stats soaring tackles 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.199
 I said these defensive skills the 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.729
 vision of the game that is right 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.229
 exceptional his agility so you 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.120
 combine his strength his agility to his 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.289
 small meter eighty ito it holds 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.360
 really very very good on his legs 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.499
 his speed so also I 'm quarter 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.789
 hunters so that at the level of the 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:52.069
 speed he calls a big head in 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.629
 acceleration the ball checks the 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.120
 long shot you've seen typing from very 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:57.590
 very far the interception positioning 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.789
 the four canvases bad foot the 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.990
 quality you it's the power of 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.060
 strikes and the four floors and 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.469
 techniques at the level of finishing so 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.819
 I put that in my teeth the stats 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.409
 negative but the goethe finish is 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.050
 tight that lets 80 she's a 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:10.999
 true manna stage you are that health and 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.520
 I could not seem to have taken 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:15.319
 really a lot of head balloons 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.569
 with so I put the rating of 20 out of 20 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.870
 despite his finishing stats and his game 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:19.430
 of head 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.659
 simply because the stat in finishing 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.610
 I held to the maiden but as you have 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:25.490
 could see I mark a lot with I put 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.900
 the stats with him so down right 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.060
 I was going to say left but who knows 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.189
 less his right and his left so at 16 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.969
 games played with 13 goals and six 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.169
 assists 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:35.300
 it's really a very good ratio 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.009
 for an empty and offensive and so that's it 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.509
 so it was late 80 hd I hope 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.069
 that you liked this review you saw the 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:41.389
 little review the end because you do not 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.490
 I had asked like that on me 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:46.189
 did not ask anything either 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.180
 so title so this review no more for 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:47.569

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.159

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:55.039
