00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.300
 the number 8 in the world Agnieszka Radwanska against the number 20 charm 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.300
 Appeal 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.940
 a knockout at the porsche-tennis-grand-prix 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.940
 sounds promising 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.119
 and thereby caught the supposed outsider 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.119
 a better start 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.980
 although the last clash of the two already three years back points 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.169
 clear that their tactical orientation as much as possible to vary 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.040
 today was exactly right 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.720
 with 6 3 set 1 to these rules much to the delight of their boat hat-trick 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 can create under contract 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.590
 Agnieszka Radwanska in turn was unimpressed by the fact that she 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.800
 also early in the second round 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.609
 with controlled offensive 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.609
 she fought back 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.940
 and after he even gets the defense of a matchball at 5 to 6 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.940
 Election victory definitely back in the match 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.540
 the set compensation in the tiebreak quasi just formality 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.570
 the Philips gave Fischer warb he would break looked deceived 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.490
 consistently they continue their route 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 successfully 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.940
 6 to 3 6 to 7 and six to two 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.940
 Premiere Apple loses 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.409
 all successions Zeitgeist then once the same as here actually to the first 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.769
 Clash in the trap and at one of the best tournaments in the world 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.980
 I try everything as much as possible to enjoy the arena is the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.260
 Let organizers and they almost make you feel at home and that's easy 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.499
 great he's going to ride the tenth race 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.909
 to work their statements 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.650
 the omens were clearly the one Flavia Pennetta came with two 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.980
 Single wins cost fed-cup to Stuttgart the other Viktoria Azarenka 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.499
 Euro back after a longer injury break 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:52.349
 but the pause seemed to have done the Belorussian no good 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.119
 Training backlog or lack of match practice 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.119
 on the contrary 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.580
 It was soon like this with six to one under the roof 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.370
 and Azarenka on the way there first meeting of the two at all 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.370
 to decide for oneself 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.949
 The Italian, however, did not want to be beaten so easily and led 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.849
 in the meantime even 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.849
 Paiva hits again but gets burned 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:51.689
 after one hour and 27 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:55.259
 now it was said 6 1 and 6 to 4 for the number nine in the world 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.549
 who is recovering from her thigh injury 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.549
 seems to have 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.029
 it is finished 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.499
 yes I feel much better again with a safe defense and 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:13.890
 also give up in Charleston 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.530
 but now i am happy and i am trying my shape for that 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.809
 To get French Open we pull 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.739
 we reported 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.680
 Munich 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.980
 be the last
