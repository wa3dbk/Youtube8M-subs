00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.230

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.449

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.670
 nor to make this recipe we go 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.780
 need an eggplant like this 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.940
 average 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.730
 We will also need sauce 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.649
 This tomato is the ready sauce that the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.110
 people already bought it ready but you 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:00.399

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.829

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.500
 the tomato cooked it is very rich in 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.330
 lycopene that is a powerful cancer 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.259
 We will also need a little bit of 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.750
 extra virgin olive oil of course a little 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.700
 of white cheese and a little bit of 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.840
 olive that will give all the charm to 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.350
 our revenue 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:26.820
 I had this part that comes with more 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:30.450
 peel and then you beat the eggplant like that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.450
 very thin 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.620
 It's the eggplant she has a lot of calcium. 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.140
 It has a lot of fiber and it has a kind of 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.760
 soluble fiber that she'll give you the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.180
 society, but it will not be long either. 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.020
 so much to protect the organism 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.869
 illegal consumption of eggplant is that it 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.840
 low pressure it lowers your cholesterol 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:09.080
 Look how cool and the recipe is just that. 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:13.430
 people you put the tomato sauce and 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:18.709
 raw eggplant spreads so well 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:23.540
 This cute sauce is going to help 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:26.030
 eggplant cooking is just you spreads 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.270
 enough 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.510
 I've already ridden here on my way. 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.239
 but it does not stick 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.130
 you can be with the same one 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:43.880
 a little you can put butter 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:45.310
 is at your discretion a quantity in your 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.959

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.970
 There you go and put it here. 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.079
 delight that stays then you can not 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.920
 to place black olives is also a 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:03.739
 easy and healthy option 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.570
 all of a sudden for you to replace a 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:12.110
 lasagna a mass is even 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.880
 Here it is possible to make the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.280
 eggplant is very common and there is a 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.440
 Delicious and she's very thin and goes 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.850
 interspersing the layers there with ham 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:28.760
 mozzarella or just with cheese on top 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:32.049
 we put a little cookie to give that 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.049
 italian touch 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.680
 and you will put the amount that you 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.210
 want to 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.590
 the oil is here but I'm going to put 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.970
 He is not going to put me in the moment that 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.740
 because extra-virgin olive oil is a 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.950
 powerful antioxidant foods but 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.900
 when you warm up you play outside and 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.310
 all these properties 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:04.080

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.620
 with cheese and tomato sauce is already 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.990

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:42.330
 That toast is very good now. 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:46.270
 let's try it and the cd tip is 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.680
 is it really you consume to look for 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.690
 consume on time 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:56.740
 5 you take out of the oven because then she 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.140
 It's a dry practice so it's cool. 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.940
 you eat at the time 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.330
 who had that cheese and retaining the 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.620
 show like i said the olive oil comes 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:14.160
 then play a little bit over to 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.160
 give that chan that special flavor 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.950
 and this is now experience so I lost 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:36.340
 very good like I said is a 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.590
 alternative and mass like a 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.010
 mass of ice melting a form of 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.480
 You and I would be one more food plus one. 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.480
 family feeding error 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:55.300
 now let's tip the book of today we 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.080
 We are talking about mass here and now. 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:02.110
 william wheat tummy this time 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.540
 It's a very controversial book but for those who 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.010
 likes healthy eating for those who 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.360
 is in love with this subject and I 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.110
 I advise you because it is a very 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.110
 rich is free if free wheat if 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.810
 pounds and find your way to 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.360
 back to health because this book 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.540
 controversial precisely because the author who is 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.690
 a cardiologist he puts the 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.220
 guilt of various diseases in the 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.440
 wheat that white flour that people 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.110
 I eat so much right 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.920
 I'm not here preaching retreat, huh? 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.570
 the exclusion of wheat from its food 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.150
 I think it's a really cool read. 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.310
 have some truths have some things 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.650
 which draws our attention because there are 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.000
 actually an excess of consumption of 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.700
 white flour 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.320
 but I think you should just take it or 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.460
 insert anything of your 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.250
 food 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.230
 with the opinion of his or her 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.190
 nutritionist he who really goes 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:02.890
 power is to indicate and one 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.240
 ideal menu for your lifestyle 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.340
 for your profile 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.450
 but it 's a nice read that I 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.700
 challenge there 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.520
 the law is very thought-provoking I keep getting 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.060
 here until our next meeting a 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.060
 A kiss for you
