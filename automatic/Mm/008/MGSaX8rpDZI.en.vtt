00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.480
 9825 and represents more 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.660
 the technology in terms of straight 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.440
 electronics on the market 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.990
 operations of the brc 9825 and is integrated 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.330
 to the head of the brand besides having a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.820
 flash-resistant and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.880
 breaks avoiding the early burning of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.279
 even allows the seams to be programmed 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.330
 with agility and ease 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.059
 brc 9825 and has all the functions 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.090
 such as line cutting 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.420
 initial and final backtacks clean wires and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.969
 presser lifter's technology 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.430
 series system and it is 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.489
 innovative and unique market 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 the system has a device 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.329
 electromagnetic impedance that prevents the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.579
 of the seam line and apparent in the part 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.469
 in addition to providing a more 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 clean at the end of the process 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.060
 this innovative system eliminates 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.729
 need of the old beautiful system 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.009
 view exists in the fisherman thus avoiding 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.680
 inconvenient for operators 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.680
 the presser foot lifter system is 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.060
 another extremely innovative point in 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.459
 prc 9825 and the presser solenoid is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.520
 completely embedded in the 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:29.179
 brand generating 30% more efficiency 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.890
 because it increases your longevity time 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.860
 avoiding the early burning of the rubber of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.840
 solenoid as well as being quieter than 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.510
 conventional systems 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.060
 the series and even has a 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.850
 indicated helps the finishing of the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.040
 seam in addition to LED light coupled 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.870
 with the adjustment knob 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.060
 intensity to facilitate the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.160
 operations visualization 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.320
 It also has a security system 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.340
 to catch the point in greeting 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.090
 selected 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.160
 brc 9825 and features numerous 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.590
 technological differentials that 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.290
 definitely changed the concepts of 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.290
 straight electronic machines on the market
