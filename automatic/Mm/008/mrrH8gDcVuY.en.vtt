00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
in the mirror and I try to gauge my

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.990 
in the mirror and I try to gauge my
artwork<00:02:28.680> based<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.459> shapes<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.790> my

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
artwork based on the shapes that my

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.520 
artwork based on the shapes that my
mouth<00:02:30.209> makes<00:02:30.540> when<00:02:30.780> I'm<00:02:30.900> making<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.319> mouth

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
mouth makes when I'm making it mouth

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.309 
mouth makes when I'm making it mouth
shapes<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.730> once<00:02:32.970> again<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.599> go<00:02:33.810> very

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
shapes so once again you can go very

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.740 
shapes so once again you can go very
detailed<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.950> have<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.760> highly<00:02:36.569> detailed

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
here they have simple lines for the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.530 
here they have simple lines for the
mouth<00:02:43.650> shapes<00:02:43.950> there's<00:02:44.310> no<00:02:44.430> lips<00:02:44.730> really<00:02:44.909> or

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
you can do a combination of both like

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.430 
you can do a combination of both like
I've<00:02:47.370> done<00:02:47.519> here<00:02:47.819> they're<00:02:48.120> very<00:02:48.329> simple<00:02:48.870> but

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
I've done here they're very simple but

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.680 
I've done here they're very simple but
they<00:02:49.680> still<00:02:49.890> have<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.099> lip<00:02:50.519> set<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.390> teeth

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
and everything so once again try to name

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.690 
and everything so once again try to name
your<00:02:54.329> mouth<00:02:54.859> based<00:02:55.859> on<00:02:56.069> what<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.340> see<00:02:56.489> here
