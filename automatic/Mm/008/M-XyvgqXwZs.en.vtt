Mini Maglite flashlight you can either

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.700 
Mini Maglite flashlight you can either
find<00:00:08.910> one<00:00:09.179> or<00:00:09.389> if<00:00:09.660> you're<00:00:09.840> lucky<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.469> start

find one or if you're lucky you start

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.350 
find one or if you're lucky you start
out<00:00:10.830> with<00:00:10.860> one<00:00:11.040> you'll<00:00:11.820> occasionally

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
out with one you'll occasionally

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.910 
out with one you'll occasionally
encounter<00:00:12.599> rooms<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.290> are<00:00:13.410> almost<00:00:13.710> pitch

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
encounter rooms that are almost pitch

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.039 
encounter rooms that are almost pitch
black<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.730> need<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> flashlight<00:00:15.269> before

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
black so you need a flashlight before

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.750 
black so you need a flashlight before
you<00:00:16.139> can<00:00:16.260> explore<00:00:16.560> those<00:00:16.770> rooms<00:00:17.070> properly<00:00:17.580> I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
you can explore those rooms properly I

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.000 
you can explore those rooms properly I
did<00:00:18.480> some<00:00:18.660> research<00:00:18.990> about<00:00:19.020> how<00:00:19.380> flashlights

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
did some research about how flashlights

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.859 
did some research about how flashlights
are<00:00:20.189> really<00:00:20.430> used<00:00:20.609> with<00:00:20.820> guns<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.689> most

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
are really used with guns and the most

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.630 
are really used with guns and the most
practical<00:00:22.260> method<00:00:22.680> here<00:00:22.920> seems<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
practical method here seems to be the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.849 
practical method here seems to be the
hairiest<00:00:23.970> technique<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:25.380> how<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.680> works

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
hairiest technique to see how that works

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.470 
hairiest technique to see how that works
in<00:00:26.070> real<00:00:26.220> life<00:00:26.460> pretend<00:00:27.029> you're<00:00:27.150> holding<00:00:27.240> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
in real life pretend you're holding a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.450 
in real life pretend you're holding a
gun<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:27.840> hand<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.710> flashlight<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.340> the

gun in one hand and a flashlight in the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.310 
gun in one hand and a flashlight in the
other<00:00:29.580> then<00:00:30.330> bring<00:00:30.539> your<00:00:30.660> flashlight<00:00:30.779> hand

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
other then bring your flashlight hand

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
other then bring your flashlight hand
under<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> gun<00:00:31.980> hand<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.489> press<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.969> backs

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
under the gun hand and press the backs

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.299 
under the gun hand and press the backs
of<00:00:33.360> your<00:00:33.480> hands<00:00:33.660> together<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.800> way<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.160> gun

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
of your hands together this way the gun

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.979 
of your hands together this way the gun
is<00:00:35.460> stable<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> flashlight<00:00:36.510> always

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
is stable and the flashlight always

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.209 
is stable and the flashlight always
points<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> direction<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.040> you're

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
points in the direction that you're

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.549 
points in the direction that you're
aiming<00:00:38.550> we're<00:00:39.360> not<00:00:39.510> aiming<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.260> pull<00:00:40.469> the

aiming we're not aiming to pull the
light<00:00:40.739> back<00:00:40.950> next<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.340> your<00:00:41.460> head<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.239> need

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
light back next to your head if you need

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.569 
light back next to your head if you need
both<00:00:42.629> hands-free<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.739> reloading<00:00:44.190> then

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
both hands-free like for reloading then

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.860 
both hands-free like for reloading then
you<00:00:44.670> hold<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> flashlight<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.570> teeth

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you hold the flashlight in your teeth

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.930 
you hold the flashlight in your teeth
the<00:00:46.500> flashlight<00:00:46.950> does<00:00:47.129> run<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> batteries

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the flashlight does run out of batteries

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.000 
the flashlight does run out of batteries
eventually<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.200> usually<00:00:49.530> lasts<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
eventually but it usually lasts for a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
eventually but it usually lasts for a
few<00:00:50.070> hours<00:00:50.360> depending<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.449> how<00:00:51.510> much<00:00:51.780> charge

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
few hours depending on how much charge

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.260 
few hours depending on how much charge
it<00:00:52.260> has<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.680> find<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.280> should<00:00:54.059> still

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it has when you find it you should still

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.369 
it has when you find it you should still
put<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> light<00:00:54.719> away<00:00:54.840> when<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> don't<00:00:55.260> need

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
put the light away when you don't need

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.260 
put the light away when you don't need
it<00:00:55.649> because<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.550> make<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> harder<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.120> see

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
it because it can make it harder to see

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.959 
it because it can make it harder to see
the<00:00:57.539> light<00:00:57.690> coming<00:00:58.109> from<00:00:58.140> enemies<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:59.699> next

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969
