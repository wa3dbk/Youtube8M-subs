lustre<00:00:40.250> charger<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.570> on<00:00:41.900> the<00:00:42.110> top<00:00:42.290> of<00:00:42.559> the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
lustre charger so on the top of the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.610 
lustre charger so on the top of the
charger<00:00:43.550> there<00:00:44.059> is<00:00:44.390> a<00:00:44.629> couple<00:00:45.050> ports<00:00:45.440> and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
charger there is a couple ports and

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.970 
charger there is a couple ports and
buttons<00:00:45.650> I<00:00:46.339> guess<00:00:47.170> first<00:00:48.170> as<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.379> USB<00:00:48.949> port

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
buttons I guess first as the USB port

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.100 
buttons I guess first as the USB port
that<00:00:49.370> is<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.610> charge<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.120> device<00:00:50.269> itself<00:00:50.629> a

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
that is to charge the device itself a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.270 
that is to charge the device itself a
micro<00:00:51.860> USB<00:00:52.120> input<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.329> charge<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:54.280> raft

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
micro USB input to charge the raft

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.770 
micro USB input to charge the raft
powered<00:00:55.640> charger<00:00:55.820> itself<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:56.510> then<00:00:56.660> you'll

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
powered charger itself and then you'll
