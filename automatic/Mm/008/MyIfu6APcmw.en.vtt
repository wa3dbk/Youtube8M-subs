you<00:00:33.300> could<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.719> create<00:00:33.870> something<00:00:34.290> feels

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
you could really create something feels

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.049 
you could really create something feels
devoid<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.820> life<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:37.129> devoid<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.399> any<00:00:38.640> sort<00:00:39.000> of

devoid of life and devoid of any sort of
existence<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.320> really<00:00:40.649> cool

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
existence now this would be really cool

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.910 
existence now this would be really cool
in<00:00:41.309> doing<00:00:42.000> adventure<00:00:42.809> maps<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.500> go

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
in doing adventure maps you know you go

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.290 
in doing adventure maps you know you go
you<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.430> change<00:00:44.670> around<00:00:44.940> different

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
you can change around different

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.090 
you can change around different
environments<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.440> into<00:00:46.649> different<00:00:46.920> areas

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
environments you go into different areas

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.250 
environments you go into different areas
or<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.149> whole<00:00:48.329> thing<00:00:48.600> could<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.870> based<00:00:49.110> here

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
or the whole thing could be based here

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.420 
or the whole thing could be based here
in<00:00:49.440> such<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.250> void<00:00:50.940> area<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.870> mean<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:53.190> one

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
in such a a void area I mean on this one

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
in such a a void area I mean on this one
we<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> trees<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.600> quite<00:00:54.989> fit<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
we can see the trees don't quite fit you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.770 
we can see the trees don't quite fit you
feel<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.190> should<00:00:56.219> be<00:00:56.430> kept<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.850> snow<00:00:57.390> or

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
feel they should be kept in snow or

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.349 
feel they should be kept in snow or
dying<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.460> currently<00:00:59.879> isn't<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
dying but that currently isn't in the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.720 
dying but that currently isn't in the
game<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.289> current<00:01:01.620> limitations<00:01:02.460> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
game so going on current limitations I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.539 
game so going on current limitations I
think<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.420> pretty<00:01:03.629> awesome<00:01:04.220> also<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.400> this

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
think it's pretty awesome also on this

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.250 
think it's pretty awesome also on this
thing<00:01:05.790> we've<00:01:05.939> sort<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.240> got<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> tech<00:01:06.720> demo<00:01:06.930> for

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
thing we've sort of got a tech demo for

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.960 
thing we've sort of got a tech demo for
what<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.070> cable<00:01:08.549> car<00:01:08.729> which

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
what you can do for a cable car which

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.880 
what you can do for a cable car which
obviously<00:01:09.659> isn't<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> cable<00:01:10.500> car<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
obviously isn't just a cable car this is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620 
obviously isn't just a cable car this is
a<00:01:10.920> moving<00:01:11.369> object<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.240> looks<00:01:12.450> like

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
a moving object that that looks like

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.810 
a moving object that that looks like
something<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.990> real<00:01:13.170> world<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.070> we've<00:01:14.460> got<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
something in real world so we've got a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.510 
something in real world so we've got a
few<00:01:15.060> props<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:16.020> building<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> car<00:01:16.920> gliding

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
few props here building the car gliding

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.320 
few props here building the car gliding
along<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.150> rope<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.409> air<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.850> perfect

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
along a rope in the air it's not perfect

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.320 
along a rope in the air it's not perfect
but<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.680> don't<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.790> moment<00:01:23.820> while

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
but I don't think at the moment while

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.179 
but I don't think at the moment while
room<00:01:24.540> BTW<00:01:24.720> you'll<00:01:24.960> ever<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.320> perfect<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.040> is

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
room BTW you'll ever get perfect so is

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.460 
room BTW you'll ever get perfect so is
pretty<00:01:26.430> close<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:26.970> I've<00:01:27.720> jumped<00:01:28.049> down<00:01:28.229> now

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
pretty close to it I've jumped down now

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.440 
pretty close to it I've jumped down now
to<00:01:28.530> take<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> look<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> area<00:01:29.579> itself<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
to take a look at the area itself and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
to take a look at the area itself and
again<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.350> saw<00:01:31.530> from<00:01:31.650> above<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.159> very

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
again as we saw from above it's very

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.539 
again as we saw from above it's very
barren<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.180> void<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.720> any<00:01:33.930> kind<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.590> life<00:01:34.979> or

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
barren and void of any kind of life or

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.450 
barren and void of any kind of life or
or<00:01:36.509> anything<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.650> barren<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
or anything really it's just barren and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.840 
or anything really it's just barren and
void<00:01:38.869> that<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.409> good<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.579> kind

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
void that is really good for that kind

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.340 
void that is really good for that kind
of<00:01:41.939> environment<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.840> shows<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.200> can

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
of environment I just shows you can

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.200 
of environment I just shows you can
create<00:01:43.619> sort<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.159> anything<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:44.790> we'll<00:01:45.000> see

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
create sort of anything as we'll see

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
create sort of anything as we'll see
later<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> upper<00:01:46.049> creations<00:01:46.590> got<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
later on in the upper creations got a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.940 
later on in the upper creations got a
waterfall<00:01:47.490> there<00:01:47.880> some<00:01:48.509> water<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.290> swimming

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
waterfall there some water and swimming

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.399 
waterfall there some water and swimming
off<00:01:50.159> into<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> sunset<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.780> move<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
off into the sunset as we move on to the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.179 
off into the sunset as we move on to the
next<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.720> beanstalk<00:01:55.229> idea

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
next one this one is a beanstalk idea

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.789 
next one this one is a beanstalk idea
and<00:01:56.520> I've<00:01:57.450> spent<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.320> quite<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> bit

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and I've spent this one up quite a bit

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.859 
and I've spent this one up quite a bit
actually<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.399> fit<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.729> all<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.090> because<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
actually to fit it all in because it's a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.889 
actually to fit it all in because it's a
big<00:02:01.170> map<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:02.640> premise<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.299> map<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.570> sort

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
big map the premise of this map is sort

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.240 
big map the premise of this map is sort
of<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.049> got<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> big<00:02:04.439> Beanstalk<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.130> got

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
of you got a big Beanstalk and you got

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.679 
of you got a big Beanstalk and you got
to<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.520> kill<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> giant<00:02:05.969> at<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> top<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
to go and kill the giant at the top so a

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.999 
to go and kill the giant at the top so a
bit<00:02:06.869> different<00:02:07.140> there's<00:02:07.290> actually<00:02:07.560> an<00:02:07.649> object

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
bit different there's actually an object

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.800 
bit different there's actually an object
behind

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
behind

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.779 
behind
and<00:02:08.899> it's<00:02:09.020> not<00:02:09.170> just<00:02:09.349> a<00:02:09.500> scene<00:02:09.770> or<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.099> demo<00:02:10.369> it's

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
and it's not just a scene or a demo it's

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.420 
and it's not just a scene or a demo it's
it's<00:02:11.180> actually<00:02:11.510> something<00:02:11.810> but<00:02:12.530> we<00:02:13.069> can<00:02:13.220> use

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
it's actually something but we can use

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.339 
it's actually something but we can use
it<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.730> look<00:02:13.880> at<00:02:14.030> kind<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.330> how<00:02:14.510> big<00:02:14.989> and

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
it to look at kind of how big and

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.530 
it to look at kind of how big and
complex<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:16.340> can<00:02:16.370> create<00:02:16.790> something<00:02:17.239> with

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
complex you can create something with

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.380 
complex you can create something with
all<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.780> different<00:02:18.020> props<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.790> just<00:02:20.270> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
all the different props and and just the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.240 
all the different props and and just the
other<00:02:20.420> general<00:02:21.140> idea<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.560> them<00:02:21.830> you've<00:02:22.010> got<00:02:22.220> a

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
other general idea of them you've got a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.100 
other general idea of them you've got a
house<00:02:22.459> there<00:02:22.880> on<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.480> branch<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:24.080> tree

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
house there on like a branch of a tree

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.190 
house there on like a branch of a tree
with<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.680> lost<00:02:25.099> sheep<00:02:25.370> ranch<00:02:25.670> that's<00:02:25.910> prop<00:02:26.420> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
with a lost sheep ranch that's prop the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.080 
with a lost sheep ranch that's prop the
ground<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.800> tree<00:02:28.040> here<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.430> actually<00:02:28.910> made

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
ground the tree here is actually made

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.970 
ground the tree here is actually made
from<00:02:29.140> standard<00:02:30.140> ground<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.680> know<00:02:30.709> that

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
from standard ground you know that

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.890 
from standard ground you know that
you've<00:02:31.099> built<00:02:31.370> up<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.970> then<00:02:32.150> he's<00:02:32.690> obviously

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
you've built up and then he's obviously

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.890 
you've built up and then he's obviously
painted<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.640> terrain<00:02:34.970> which<00:02:35.300> fits

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
painted in this terrain which fits

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.620 
painted in this terrain which fits
brilliantly<00:02:36.739> for<00:02:37.099> what<00:02:37.340> he's<00:02:37.940> actually<00:02:38.150> built

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
brilliantly for what he's actually built

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.380 
brilliantly for what he's actually built
it<00:02:38.870> up<00:02:39.050> here<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:39.860> got<00:02:40.519> a<00:02:40.550> bit<00:02:40.700> annoyed<00:02:41.030> aptly

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
it up here I got a bit annoyed aptly

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.630 
it up here I got a bit annoyed aptly
because<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.690> fell<00:02:41.989> off<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.980> I've<00:02:43.220> spread<00:02:43.580> the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
because I fell off so I've spread the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.940 
because I fell off so I've spread the
video<00:02:43.850> I've<00:02:43.970> even<00:02:44.360> quicker<00:02:44.660> now<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.650> try<00:02:45.830> and

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
video I've even quicker now to try and

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.860 
video I've even quicker now to try and
get<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.580> top<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.299> can<00:02:47.420> actually

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
get the top so that I can actually

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.229 
get the top so that I can actually
finish<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.860> level<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.519> know<00:02:49.640> it's<00:02:49.850> no<00:02:50.030> fun

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
finish the level you know it's no fun

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.570 
finish the level you know it's no fun
not<00:02:50.450> finishing<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.930> level<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.380> what<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.190> really

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
not finishing the level I what I really

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.710 
not finishing the level I what I really
like<00:02:52.760> about<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:53.120> one<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.299> just<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
like about this one is just the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.289 
like about this one is just the
complexity<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.010> really<00:02:55.280> does<00:02:55.519> fit<00:02:55.790> it's

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
complexity and it really does fit it's

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.570 
complexity and it really does fit it's
not<00:02:56.480> perfect<00:02:57.049> again<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:58.040> don't<00:02:58.160> feel<00:02:58.459> we're

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
not perfect again I don't feel we're

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.520 
not perfect again I don't feel we're
going<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.790> see<00:02:58.940> perfect<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.780> beta<00:02:59.989> there's

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
going to see perfect in the beta there's

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.009 
going to see perfect in the beta there's
no<00:03:00.680> branch<00:03:01.069> texture<00:03:01.849> or<00:03:02.060> there's<00:03:02.239> no<00:03:02.360> ability

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
no branch texture or there's no ability

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.900 
no branch texture or there's no ability
to<00:03:03.170> create<00:03:03.380> your<00:03:03.470> own<00:03:03.530> texture<00:03:04.310> which<00:03:04.760> is

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
to create your own texture which is

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.309 
to create your own texture which is
really<00:03:05.150> unfortunate<00:03:05.540> because<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:06.080> would<00:03:06.170> be

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
really unfortunate because it would be

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.320 
really unfortunate because it would be
really<00:03:06.560> cool<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:06.830> see<00:03:06.950> like<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.190> branch<00:03:07.549> texture

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
really cool to see like a branch texture

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.690 
really cool to see like a branch texture
mixed<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.830> kind<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.340> thing<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:10.640> would

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
mixed in that kind of thing it would

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.160 
mixed in that kind of thing it would
have<00:03:10.819> been<00:03:10.880> even<00:03:11.030> more<00:03:11.180> awesome<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.019> it<00:03:12.080> would

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
have been even more awesome and it would

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.560 
have been even more awesome and it would
have<00:03:12.260> added<00:03:12.410> as<00:03:12.739> well<00:03:12.920> as<00:03:13.070> maybe<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.609> branches

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
have added as well as maybe of branches

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.449 
have added as well as maybe of branches
smaller<00:03:14.959> branches<00:03:15.410> made<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.799> Earth<00:03:16.040> with

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
smaller branches made of Earth with

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.430 
smaller branches made of Earth with
these<00:03:16.730> textures<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.600> would<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.320> been

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
these textures that would have been

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.080 
these textures that would have been
awesome<00:03:18.590> but<00:03:18.799> going<00:03:19.130> on<00:03:19.220> current<00:03:19.519> limitations

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
awesome but going on current limitations

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.880 
awesome but going on current limitations
that's<00:03:20.359> what<00:03:20.480> we<00:03:20.570> can<00:03:20.720> do<00:03:20.840> there's<00:03:21.380> two<00:03:21.560> giant

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
that's what we can do there's two giant

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.740 
that's what we can do there's two giant
himself<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.489> he's<00:03:22.850> just<00:03:23.209> falling<00:03:23.630> off

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
himself and he's just falling off

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.740 
himself and he's just falling off
absolutely<00:03:24.709> perfect<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.819> I'd<00:03:26.030> take<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.540> look

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
absolutely perfect so I'd take a look

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.360 
absolutely perfect so I'd take a look
around<00:03:26.870> at<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.230> top<00:03:27.410> it's<00:03:27.650> quite<00:03:27.859> nice<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.250> I

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
around at the top it's quite nice and I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.130 
around at the top it's quite nice and I
follow<00:03:28.760> him<00:03:29.000> down<00:03:29.209> obviously<00:03:29.870> there's<00:03:30.019> no

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
follow him down obviously there's no

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.750 
follow him down obviously there's no
fall<00:03:30.380> damage<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.010> can<00:03:31.190> just<00:03:31.220> follow<00:03:31.489> him

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
fall damage so I can just follow him

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.030 
fall damage so I can just follow him
wherever<00:03:32.060> he<00:03:32.299> goes<00:03:32.530> having<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.590> look<00:03:33.739> there<00:03:33.890> is

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
wherever he goes having a look there is

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.710 
wherever he goes having a look there is
a<00:03:34.069> bit<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.370> rock<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:34.819> some<00:03:34.970> flowers<00:03:35.480> on<00:03:35.600> the

we've<00:04:55.039> got<00:04:55.159> a<00:04:55.189> bit<00:04:55.370> of<00:04:55.460> an<00:04:55.580> issue<00:04:55.699> with<00:04:55.939> this

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
we've got a bit of an issue with this

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.230 
we've got a bit of an issue with this
bridge<00:04:56.389> I<00:04:56.719> mean<00:04:57.529> that's<00:04:58.219> not<00:04:58.639> really<00:04:59.060> how

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
bridge I mean that's not really how

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.689 
bridge I mean that's not really how
ridges<00:04:59.719> work<00:04:59.930> but<00:05:00.379> that's<00:05:00.560> not<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:01.099> creator's

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
ridges work but that's not the creator's

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.700 
ridges work but that's not the creator's
problem<00:05:02.240> that<00:05:02.449> is<00:05:02.629> in<00:05:02.779> fact<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.229> developer

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
problem that is in fact the developer

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.019 
problem that is in fact the developer
and<00:05:03.830> we<00:05:03.889> can<00:05:04.039> put<00:05:04.189> that<00:05:04.310> down<00:05:04.520> to<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:04.819> game

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:05.029 
and we can put that down to the game

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:07.480 
and we can put that down to the game
being<00:05:05.270> a<00:05:05.449> beta<00:05:05.719> I<00:05:06.110> think<00:05:06.860> this<00:05:07.009> map<00:05:07.279> just

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
being a beta I think this map just

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.309 
being a beta I think this map just
really<00:05:07.819> shows<00:05:08.060> what<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.449> can<00:05:08.599> do<00:05:09.080> with

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
really shows what you can do with

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.200 
really shows what you can do with
project<00:05:09.800> spark<00:05:10.099> and<00:05:10.310> how<00:05:10.490> beautiful<00:05:11.089> the

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
project spark and how beautiful the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.010 
project spark and how beautiful the
world<00:05:11.680> we<00:05:12.680> can<00:05:12.830> create<00:05:13.159> our<00:05:13.430> in<00:05:13.909> project<00:05:14.629> spark

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
world we can create our in project spark

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.709 
world we can create our in project spark
it's<00:05:15.740> just<00:05:16.129> amazing<00:05:16.460> I<00:05:16.819> really<00:05:17.539> recommend

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
it's just amazing I really recommend

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.200 
it's just amazing I really recommend
going<00:05:18.319> on<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.830> this<00:05:18.949> map<00:05:19.249> and<00:05:19.460> just<00:05:19.759> checking

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
going on to this map and just checking

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.540 
going on to this map and just checking
it<00:05:20.389> out<00:05:20.539> listening<00:05:21.469> to<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.710> sounds<00:05:22.009> or<00:05:22.279> maybe

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
it out listening to the sounds or maybe

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.450 
it out listening to the sounds or maybe
even<00:05:22.669> editing<00:05:23.539> it<00:05:23.659> yourself<00:05:24.139> and<00:05:24.349> adding<00:05:24.979> on<00:05:25.219> a

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
even editing it yourself and adding on a

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.600 
even editing it yourself and adding on a
story<00:05:26.029> or<00:05:26.589> adding<00:05:27.589> extra<00:05:28.129> to<00:05:28.250> make<00:05:28.279> it<00:05:28.490> look

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
story or adding extra to make it look

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.420 
story or adding extra to make it look
even<00:05:28.789> better<00:05:29.240> than<00:05:29.449> it<00:05:29.750> already<00:05:29.930> is<00:05:30.199> it's<00:05:31.099> just

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
even better than it already is it's just

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.369 
even better than it already is it's just
amazing<00:05:31.639> here<00:05:32.089> we<00:05:32.180> see<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.449> waterfall<00:05:32.839> we've

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
amazing here we see the waterfall we've

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.110 
amazing here we see the waterfall we've
got<00:05:33.529> the<00:05:33.620> sound<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.370> so<00:05:34.610> of<00:05:34.669> the<00:05:34.789> waterfall

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
doesn't look great again that will go in

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.980 
doesn't look great again that will go in
development<00:05:38.089> I<00:05:38.180> just<00:05:38.389> think<00:05:38.569> the<00:05:38.629> Boston
