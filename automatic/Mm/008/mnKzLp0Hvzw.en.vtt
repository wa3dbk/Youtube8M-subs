00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
with HIV which again it's not really

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.510 
with HIV which again it's not really
related<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:31.050> it<00:01:31.950> makes<00:01:32.220> people<00:01:32.369> think

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
related to but it makes people think

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.950 
related to but it makes people think
that<00:01:32.820> they're<00:01:32.940> going<00:01:33.179> to<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> sick<00:01:33.720> animal
