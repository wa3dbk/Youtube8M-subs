Final<00:03:24.180> Cut<00:03:24.209> Pro<00:03:24.750> 10<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.730> it's<00:03:26.730> kind<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.299> like<00:03:27.570> a

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
Final Cut Pro 10 and it's kind of like a

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.870 
Final Cut Pro 10 and it's kind of like a
slightly<00:03:28.230> more<00:03:28.500> advanced<00:03:28.950> version<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.370> iMovie

going to take the longest I have a
perfectionist<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.070> editing<00:04:05.880> can<00:04:06.720> sometimes

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
perfectionist so editing can sometimes

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.979

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
way and of course the processing time if

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.849 
way and of course the processing time if
you<00:04:15.120> have<00:04:15.269> like<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.480> slower<00:04:15.810> computer<00:04:16.470> or

process and upload

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.220 
process and upload
time<00:04:20.280> takes<00:04:20.520> forever<00:04:20.850> so<00:04:21.300> you<00:04:21.900> had<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.140> be

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
time takes forever so you had to be

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.470 
time takes forever so you had to be
patient<00:04:22.440> with<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.130> whole<00:04:23.310> editing<00:04:23.850> process

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
patient with the whole editing process

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.470

my<00:04:27.660> video<00:04:28.260> arsenal<00:04:28.950> of<00:04:29.220> tools<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.940> really

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
my video arsenal of tools that really

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.410 
my video arsenal of tools that really
helped<00:04:30.420> me<00:04:31.010> one<00:04:32.010> thing<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.940> microphone

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
helped me one thing is a microphone

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.900 
helped me one thing is a microphone
which<00:04:34.230> is<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:34.890> like<00:04:35.220> hooks<00:04:35.460> on<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.790> the

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
which is this like hooks on to the

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.090 
which is this like hooks on to the
camera<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:37.020> just<00:04:37.230> got<00:04:37.380> this<00:04:37.530> recently<00:04:38.010> and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
camera and I just got this recently and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.390 
camera and I just got this recently and
it's<00:04:38.520> been<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:38.910> huge<00:04:39.450> improvement<00:04:40.020> my<00:04:40.740> house<00:04:41.040> is

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
it's been a huge improvement my house is

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.970 
it's been a huge improvement my house is
very<00:04:41.640> like<00:04:41.940> Bumi<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.600> echoey<00:04:43.200> so<00:04:43.680> when<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:43.890> was

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
very like Bumi and echoey so when I was

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.980 
very like Bumi and echoey so when I was
filled<00:04:44.220> my<00:04:44.310> videos<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:45.090> was<00:04:45.570> like<00:04:45.690> have<00:04:45.870> to

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
filled my videos I was like have to

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.870 
filled my videos I was like have to
tweak<00:04:46.290> all<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.590> audio<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.520> would<00:04:47.610> take<00:04:47.760> me

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
tweak all the audio and it would take me

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.610 
tweak all the audio and it would take me
so<00:04:48.120> long<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.690> get<00:04:48.810> anything<00:04:49.080> that<00:04:49.320> sounded

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
so long to get anything that sounded

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.710 
so long to get anything that sounded
decent<00:04:49.830> but<00:04:50.430> this<00:04:50.610> microphone<00:04:51.150> has<00:04:51.540> been

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
decent but this microphone has been

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.110 
decent but this microphone has been
amazing<00:04:52.230> and<00:04:52.530> they're<00:04:53.310> not<00:04:53.670> very<00:04:53.970> expensive

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
amazing and they're not very expensive

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.180 
amazing and they're not very expensive
it's<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:54.930> really<00:04:55.110> good<00:04:55.170> improvement<00:04:55.800> if<00:04:56.010> you're

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
it's a really good improvement if you're

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.800 
it's a really good improvement if you're
filming<00:04:56.610> especially<00:04:57.180> like<00:04:57.270> talking<00:04:57.720> or
