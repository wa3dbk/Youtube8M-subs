00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.610

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.900
 eric we look at it right in the usa 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.820
 if you go from fine it is yes then 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.980
 let's say right away that we will have problems with 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.900
 lighting from this door and from 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.960
 that window then the face of the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:40.680
 today will be a little dark no we see the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:44.070
 phone opens the box to be able to see 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.710
 feel like there's only 33 for us 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:53.250
 others then here it is galaxy note 2 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:01:01.760
 look at that big of the games channel 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:04.290
 my feeling at all from the speakerphone 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 then before analyzing the phone 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.200
 let's check what's in the box if 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.799
 there is everything we drive by 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.380
 quick reference usual handbook le 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.110
 headphones we have the charger there 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.320
 remember something 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.790
 it's a cable that reminds us of something 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.710
 and the battery and a battery via why 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.270
 the battery must be placed inside no 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 no battery on the phone, yes 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.920
 turn on chorals that big battery 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.470
 we get back in the box 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.180
 otherwise eric rugna now let's see 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:53.009
 put the battery is to turn on the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:55.540
 phone behind her head 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.810
 the alessia white stuff 3 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.410
 and now everything was never anything to 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.420
 disconnect and now let's see 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.660
 let me open the battery for a moment 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.110
 opened the battery while I opened one 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.110
 moment 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.140
 here it is seen that pops off watch 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:25.570
 look look who opens with one 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.880
 battery goes into that hole then you here 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.990
 goes the micro sd and here goes the sim 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:36.550
 we have nothing and see 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:41.100
 we close beta that I close it is e 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.100
 let's make everyone enrolled age latch 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.030
 so now let's pull the film away 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.800
 and we can turn it on to turn it on yes 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.350
 crush that button here on the side 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.610
 here now turns on galaxy note 2 gtn 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.940
 7.100 I don't have and it makes sense now yes 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:15.790
 turns on and sees that an inscription arrives 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:19.170
 what she is written nor what she is 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.530
 written where there is food and jenny 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.130
 sensors and me free to see with the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:32.340
 great white writing what writing 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:35.500
 gall to samsung galaxy ace i gay or la 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.180
 then aunt looks at the beauty of this 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.560
 phone down here we have a 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.330
 pen thinks we close well here 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.580
 this is a pen you can use 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.709
 on the phone 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.540
 now we crush here we do 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.360
 all settings not with the pen 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.940
 we can use if on the fingers than the pen 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.560
 what you prefer 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.380
 whereas much was because they go 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.600
 much to the project again for 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.220
 give the phone should apply 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:10.000
 you six months earlier for holding in the 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.760
 tribute back to know why it was so much 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.870
 so it changed so what this 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:21.459
 phone has a super 5.5 hd display 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.800
 amoled is a 1 gb quad core processor 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.050
 6 the pen 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.700
 the 8 megapixel camera with 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:37.050
 autofocus that phone here how much 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:40.630
 that costs eric he paid 579 euros badly 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.690
 even with compasses and avoiding species 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.510
 because out of the judges sally bigham 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.910
 that misery miseries for people come 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.670
 to the same want that the money to 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.650
 charlie chan to the knight 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.090
 so it is useless to complain that there 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.580
 they come to mind they make us shine 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.610
 you know these are are as he tells us 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.650
 I do n't know what expenses I need 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:11.730
 certainly the whims those good whims 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:16.140
 andrea to gps and bluetooth wifi dvx 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:20.020
 android is forbidden in the shadows she why 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:23.440
 fraterne teacher mav and abundant means 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.820
 challenging for guys who do 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.820
 see that it's a phone 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.720
 then afterwards the beauty of this 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.690
 phone aunt who will be great all but 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.880
 a beautiful battery of 3,100 million per 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.560
 so the battery lasts a lot in this 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:45.490
 phone let's make a video comparison 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:48.750
 galaxy note 2 by eric and cordless by 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.360
 wilma here it is 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:55.200
 the problem by asking that the press 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.660
 so you know he had then we leave 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.680
 with features 1 a display from 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:05.220
 5.5 inches thief a display that maybe 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.530
 here comes a quarter of an inch 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.600
 all the colors of the world we only 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.230
 black and white 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.210
 here is touchscreen here is only key 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.250
 camera we have nothing we have 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.980
 everything possible and imaginary with 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.669
 android operating system to buy 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.760
 taking them out that you think of features here 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.919
 extra we have the alarm is the date and time 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.490
 on the display 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:34.410
 we just need the address book that connects 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.280
 to facebook twitter and all the various social networks 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.350
 network 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.150
 here we have an address book that must be accepted 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:44.070
 by hand the battery lasts so long here 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:55.110
 when de battery is the battery life of the 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:59.000
 mobile phone to maintain so this is 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:01.320
 white and this and blue this weighs little 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.810
 this weighs perhaps less 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.120
 the only advantage maybe the weight is already 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.940
 so much at the club already 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:16.280
 brands must pay because part of it has 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:20.160
 wrong because then between the two phones 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.229
 report card as they do on telefonino.net you 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.940
 you have to choose between these two phones 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:30.390
 for your use which is better in your opinion 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:35.610
 so he wins the phone with flying colors 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:43.650
 branded b but here's no galaxy for 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:46.890
 no one and sieve greenhouse for la la la 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:50.420
 line but I have to go back fragaled I go on 

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:52.550
 at the same time I like it 

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:57.520
 now we reject the phone then 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:08:00.560
 we bring him eric ciao 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.790
 now we eat the rabbit era 

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.790
 socially one hundred
