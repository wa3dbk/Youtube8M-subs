00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.160
 yeah everybody secret that I'm coming 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.389
 especially for bugs and news 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.360
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.520
 little information about windows 9 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.619
 I do not know if you must have heard 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.420
 talk a little bit about it on the radio one 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.810
 will say by the media stuff like 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.000
 that since we will have from here we will say 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.220
 very little time we'll say a little 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 formalization I do not like it says 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.300
 finally we'll actually have microsoft 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.640
 necessarily it's microsoft that go 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.980
 confirm we will say this new system 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.750
 of exploitation I had a little trouble 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.040
 still tell you and in this 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.510
 video the hall will be pretty fast because 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.700
 that I'm really trying to explain to you 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.680
 in a while we'll say pretty fast to 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.450
 pretty much so what makes it 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.640
 on something they will really get 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.260
 point to microsoft because there is when 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.370
 even change and fortunately 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.590
 by the way so first thing to know 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.620
 is that on September 30 a year 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.719
 microsoft will unveil windows 9 so 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.530
 in a conference it will be for 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.570
 the public 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.670
 finally to the public makes it a conference 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.439
 so not between professionals so this 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.049
 will be a conference that everyone is going 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.490
 to be able to watch and we will say squatter 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.229
 a little bit all the information of this 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.700
 new operating system 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.590
 second thing to know is that the name 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 of code so windows 9 for them 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.939
 interests would be between people who are 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.439
 interested in it in loot shit 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.000
 what I do is because I do not have 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.229
 made videos for 2 to 3 days it's 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.110
 for that I have a little chopped a little 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.420
 derailed repression continued the name of 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.380
 so windows 9 code is then it's 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.360
 thr hot shl des I do not even know 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.560
 how is it pronounced like this 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.729
 might be fruit scholts but 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.740
 Norman he should have two hours 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.049
 so that's so it's kind of the name of 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.399
 code that was installed that was given 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.740
 in any case for this new system 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.850
 operating 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.049
 so there is still if we look good 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.710
 a fairly rapid development since 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.590
 2012 we had the lot s actually basis 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.840
 windows 8 which is simply one 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.159
 will say a rather special bone since it has 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.750
 been considered a bit more for the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.360
 tablets at not if you have a 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.890
 computer with windows 8 on it and there 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.329
 many who have criticized a little 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.810
 operating system because 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.000
 finally we will say this system 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.230
 she a little more dedicated down all that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.720
 is going to be the tablets the stuff like that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.280
 that necessarily a computer we see the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.680
 thur with the hercules galÃ¨re a little more 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.270
 with especially the menu all go the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.280
 these are the keys of the little things at the beginning 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.380
 when you start the computer down 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.970
 it's a bit more complicated but 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.190
 usual moment here I have a windows 7 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.060
 and windows 8 shooting and that's it I 'm going 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.769
 not start criticizing windows 8 or 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.900
 saas and it's different and we get there 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.840
 used all that but it misses a little 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.400
 little button start and well this button 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.110
 start people will show this 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.989
 windows 9 in fact the windows 9 it will be 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.640
 a bit of a return to windows 7 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.799
 let's say Windows 7 finally has a little 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.959
 Here as with correcting patterns 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.000
 all this so it will be windows 9 it will be 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.700
 do you say that in fact windows 9 it will be 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.110
 not following the windows 8 but it will be 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.019
 following the window 7 because microsoft 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.599
 have noticed that this windows 8 has pleased 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.489
 a big category displeased me at the 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.049
 most of the people actually 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.750
 that they are fans of microsoft the 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.819
 Most people are on about 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.930
 microsoft and basel actually it's okay 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.940
 really could not because like I 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.950
 wanted to say roughly this is it 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.000
 that it was dedicated more to tablets 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.980
 and inevitably as soon as you are on your 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.750
 computer like there and you say fucking 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.400
 shit what there are plenty of icons everywhere 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.200
 all that well it's the galley I 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.880
 understand it's a hassle but here we go 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.840
 that's how it will be 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.310
 other things that will be added 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.660
 on his windows 9 the two big ones 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.190
 things that are going to be added this is it 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.150
 start menu and so people who are going 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.350
 buy windows nasa will be 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.989
 basically for bathing started 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.850
 this is an exceptional thing that we 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.130
 find that microsoft us to us at 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.510
 develop and with a second thing 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.829
 it is a voice assistance 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.030
 a bit like what we find 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.920
 usually with google 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.910
 mainly when you type a 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.319
 search you do not have to 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.310
 now you can talk to google 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.989
 like that he will launch the search 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.880
 automatic and e 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.100
 here you have a help 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.350
 voice called cortana sarr title 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.150
 which will be integrated directly so in 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.530
 windows 9 a little to the strap game not 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.510
 if you know the dryden app 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.889
 who broke known actually who you 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.829
 actually allows just to save 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:09.260
 your wood and transmit it under 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.819
 written form and it's not bad that kind 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.120
 of things so after that it remains to be seen if 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:17.209
 their voice assistance 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.650
 of a quality or not submitted of 2.9 will be 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.900
 really we will say windows 7 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.520
 much improved so that's going to be I 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.960
 think of a care system that 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.449
 risk to please most 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.949
 people and legs that are going to have 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.050
 tablets where that in my opinion actually 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.780
 microsoft will dedicate this platform 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.220
 windows 8 only for tablets and 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.870
 after windows 9 it will be for people 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.970
 who have a computer stuff like that 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.290
 and here I think people are going 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.389
 a little less warm up it can 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.770
 to be a good a good end system 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.729
 afterwards it's up to you to see thank you for me 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.130
 say what you think of any sense 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.020
 of a bard comments m if 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.820
 never video do as you want 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.470
 and then I also wanted to tell you 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.240
 finally to tell you that here I am you 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.070
 offer mons does not have my personal page 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.830

 and then if you also said that I 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.100
 do other videos on windows 9 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.240
 because for now it is thin I 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.030
 were really giving information 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.660
 official and well tell the self in the 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.660
