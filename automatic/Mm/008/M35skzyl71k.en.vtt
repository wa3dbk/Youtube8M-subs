00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.450
 I want to be 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.200
 big hello to all i just 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.060
 returned from the store and bought myself 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.779
 various school things that is 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.369
 stationery 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.260
 and since I know how you love 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.390
 watch these videos today I decided 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.340
 show you what I bought at the very 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.200
 really just hate school we just 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.090
 I love to buy a different office 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.070
 maybe it's weird but i hope i 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.780
 Iâ€™m not like this again 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.030
 the hashtag with which you can just 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.559
 make up for example shopping or just 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.030
 how are you preparing for school 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.770
 I want to say many thanks to those 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.720
 girls who have already put their 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.670
 publications generally let's move on to 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.739
 by shopping and I was your tradition 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.330
 I don't have an assortment there 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.129
 and just like there to buy all sorts 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.320
 crafting work school this time with me 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.780
 It turned out 2 bags and now I will give you 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.180
 I'll show you what's inside there so we start 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.860
 still start to suffer the first mc straight 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.650
 which I come across looks like 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.500
 in this way and in me we are somewhere else 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.510
 there is such a look like these two 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.060
 notebooks I liked I did not have from 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.860
 travel series and in this series of degrees 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.659
 connected with europe and most of all to me 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.799
 liked these waters and notebooks though 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.380
 To be honest, I do n't like it here . 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.800
 more than this notebook but they don't care 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.610
 both are quite good so yes I like 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.550
 The next notebook should not be very 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.020
 I liked my design and here I am 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.790
 don't know i really like school 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.440
 accessories bright and rich colors 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.830
 so I try to take something 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.540
 more or less deviating to this 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.250
 the next notebook is this one I already have 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.380
 bought once only this completely 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.270
 red on, too, with this cat I their 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.770
 usually use for algebra I don't know 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.120
 why but maybe this year I 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.970
 take this notebook for some 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.700
 another subject the following is briefly mine 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.440
 it seems to be before 0 2 it seems in fear of these 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.690
 two notebooks completely contrary to that 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.280
 that i like bright juicy colors but 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.070
 something me these help anyway 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.629
 hooked and I took as many as 2 they are similar but 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.159
 a little different I really like 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.970
 when on notebooks there are these here 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:14.460
 spirals so maybe even 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.800
 For this, I took it just for the sake of 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.840
 anyway the next thing is also here 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.610
 so that's nice to take the dog anything 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.650
 I will especially use for 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.510
 literature does not quite fit the problem 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.370
 no matter what I have here 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.020
 this is such an ordinary school 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.060
 I spent a diary last year exactly 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.920
 the same white and even plain 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.630
 white diary without any pictures there 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.460
 I like no more design 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.510
 diary here inside basically usually 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.820
 focus 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.740
 I also have two similar notebooks 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.630
 and I took these two notebooks for Russian 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.520
 language because for the Russian language we 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.260
 constantly use two notebooks that is 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.150
 notebook number one to spend number two 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.860
 so I immediately took two notebooks to 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.959
 then do not go shopping again 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.060
 perhaps you are familiar with quite ordinary ones 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.680
 but still a bit interesting and me 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.080
 really like the combination of colors that 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.610
 here is and so we go on does not know 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.860
 the next spend is also related to 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.240
 travel for brazilon how well 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.790
 you already understood i plan on using 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.410
 I took one for English 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.330
 the only special subject 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.250
 notebook and this notebook in physics 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.380
 I did not want to take all the items and notebooks 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.450
 because on the subject of notebooks drawing 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.489
 Well, not really cool but because of the presence 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.560
 here are very important formulas, I decided that 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.360
 in physics, and I'll take the last manuscript 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.700
 this here is the most common 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.830
 burgundy and labeled in the middle 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.780
 here this inscription by the way well dilutes 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.670
 this is too simple a notebook design and 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.410
 she already doesn't look so bad to me 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.540
 I like this package I still have 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.400
 interchangeable blocks for notebooks with interchangeable 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.570
 block I bought a notebook and replaceable 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.550
 block last year 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.680
 if near this is my last year leads and 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.570
 do you remember I decided that this year too 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.160
 I will use this notebook because 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.660
 it is convenient for me to use for two 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.910
 I have items since last year 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.470
 there were also replaceable blocks but I took 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.820
 gays to at least diversify 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.130
 your notebook 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.870
 I wanted vs1 but listen on took 2 but in 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.180
 In general, I will be useful at home day and night 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.350
 the first package is completely empty and we 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.840
 go to the second 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.970
 I think the second package will be 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.110
 I'm interested in the first thing that is here 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.480
 falls under the arm 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.580
 this pencil case seems to be usually nothing 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.099
 not a remarkable design but at the same time 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.840
 he clings to me anyway 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.120
 so I still stopped at this 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.840
 the final I thought to take another one which 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.340
 a little brighter but in the end took all the same 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.290
 the next something to eat is braces i 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.449
 took the vice to her stapler because 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.520
 that 100 plus school time is also very 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.350
 need to hold reports 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.180
 or for something else more relaxed 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.580
 probably ended in April, I did not 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.680
 I bought but now decided that for sure 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.750
 need to take the following that there is this 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.760
 different pens and so as usual 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.010
 I got the base knobs 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.960
 ordinary gel pen blue paste 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.580
 and I have two colored pens 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.500
 last year there was a set of color 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.630
 pens again the same if you watched mine 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.970
 last year's video you remember since 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.130
 pink i have the most consumable color he 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.990
 I ended long ago and I decided that I 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.150
 update buy new just took 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.889
 purple pen purple pen I 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.900
 was not and I wanted 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.789
 and took the next thing here is 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.680
 automatic pencil and uncomfortable 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.450
 use ordinary pencils me 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.639
 so let's say attract such 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.150
 pencils automatically so i took 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.650
 such a 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.050
 and slate pencil is him lying around me 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.090
 somewhere at home next is a corrector or 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.070
 bar I always forget to buy and its 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.510
 then it's too lazy to go to the store somewhere and 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.919
 buy it so we constantly 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.810
 you have to ask friends 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.940
 classmates meters after order 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.860
 I'm sick of it so I decided that I would buy 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.539
 Me finally, and I will use 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.910
 your strokes you probably now have me 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.070
 everyone will ask him yes and so we pass 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.930
 in the next things that I have here 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.760
 took a protractor because my 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.260
 the protractor that I had before he 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.180
 i have completely broken and im 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.220
 it is seriously impossible to use me 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.160
 decided to take in such a bright pink color 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.560
 so we go further I am an ordinary white room 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.120
 pencil eraser still loved the eraser 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.880
 not just a little plastic ruler 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.860
 15 centimeters and by the way about the line I'm 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.419
 for some reason, I also constantly lose 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.250
 or break I don't know what 's wrong with me 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.840
 so this regret is not the last 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.759
 the line that will buy in this 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.710
 year so what I will use it 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.689
 and I hope that I won't lose it on 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.979
 the next day, well, the last thing 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:06.469
 here it is definitely 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.460
 highlighters I'm not me without 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:10.370
 highlighters 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.469
 and references and more on 4 colors the most 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.240
 primary colors I am very glad that they have 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:16.370
 I have and I want to have them already 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.669
 take advantage and 2 packages already fully 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.139
 empty so that was all i bought 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.879
 I really hope you like them 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.069
 this video was probably the most 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:27.379
 requested video lately but 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.389
 here i did it i removed it here 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.340
 you have already watched it 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.169
 for watching this video if it is for you 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.699
 liked it and if you like like 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.409
 video please put it

 thumb up and also i'm waiting for your 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:40.520
 the comments below I'm all of you

 I love you very, very much, and we

 see you in the next video bye
