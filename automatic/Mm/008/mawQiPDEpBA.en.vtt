00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 even little ancient culture 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.690
 diffused in Brazil but she is 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.770
 beginning to win admirers and started 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.840
 through parana 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.179
 today we want to show the cultivation here 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.250
 of olive trees that is a product is a 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.170
 Producer la mandaguaçú in paraná he 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.880
 decided to bet on the readers 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.600
 We are expecting good results from now on 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.710
 bringing knowledge to the culture and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.500
 extremely broad market the leaves are 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.080
 delicate haunting produced by the foot 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 still does not hide the sun and for now 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.329
 also does not reveal the fruits 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.950
 the cultivation of olive trees is still little 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.260
 disseminated in the parana 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.200
 despite being the perfect culture for the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.600
 soil and for the climate of the state is hot 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.879
 or cold and even frost 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.520
 does not compromise the quality of the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.160
 olive and after much searching 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.949
 this producer of mandaguaçú decided 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.390
 test the culture in the little farm 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.270
 more than five bushels 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.760
 he planted three thousand feet the planting of 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.439
 olive tree is made in a 40 by 40 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.610
 the years fertilization efe can limestone 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.220
 potassium bora xxi dry this species 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.470
 reaches three meters in height and is used 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.110
 only for the extraction of olive oil 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.750
 the investment cost about 25 thousand 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.630
 in the culture little studied in the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.450
 region did well to leave the state 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.360
 learn about olives today with 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.430
 more knowledge he uses technology 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.130
 to stay informed as they enter 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.740
 on the internet looking for information 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.350
 making phone calls on trips 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.689
 to the region you are planting after 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.670
 planting takes an average of three years to 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.649
 that the tree reaches three meters and 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.899
 produces the first fruits 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.689
 after this emerged period occurs 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.630
 annually and according to the producer's 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.600
 possible to make a profit of up to R $ 60 thousand 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.060
 per hectare and even before the first 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.700
 harvesting your harlei already intends 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.009
 risk here in the greenhouse it produces 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.740
 olive tree seedlings to sell to others 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.030
 producers and encourage 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.230
 millennial than 5.5 hectares 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.990
 planted 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.650
 I intend to 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.320
 - is to double that amount within 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.110
 a couple of years according to council data 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.450
 international olive oil is Brazil's 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.540
 the world's seventh largest importer of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.580
 olive and the second of olives the market 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.120
 advantageous for large and small 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.580
 producers are beginning to appear 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.740
 details from one region to another but 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.290
 can be interesting because the staff 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.870
 betting on olive trees is because 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.170
 she resists the lack of rain the excess 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.160
 rain or frost and frost and remains 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.830
 affect the fruits 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.440
 confirmation we will follow 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.560
 to see if production actually comes in 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.560
 good scale and good banned the quality
