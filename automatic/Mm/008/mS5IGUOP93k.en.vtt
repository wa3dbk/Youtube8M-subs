00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
own separate organizer in it what a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.590 
own separate organizer in it what a
problem<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.670> easier<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.120> film<00:02:54.300> that's<00:02:54.510> a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
problem it easier to film that's a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.210 
problem it easier to film that's a
different<00:02:54.930> angle<00:02:55.050> but<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.500> lighting<00:02:55.920> wasn't

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
different angle but the lighting wasn't

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.100 
different angle but the lighting wasn't
working<00:02:56.670> out<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.510> bottom<00:02:57.810> drawer
