00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.320
 hello today I'm going to show you in this mini 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.020
 album 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.660
 is for a baby and well this is what 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.670
 They ordered it before delivering it 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.450
 I wanted to show them 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.990
 the cover because I left it so simple 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.910
 but I really liked it here just the same 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.460
 with rings the rr or the ugt rather 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.620
 I put eyes like I followed almost the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.629
 same structure of the previous mini album 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.420
 the truth that I think I'm going to adopt 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.640
 because I really liked that much 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.090
 style is very very practical to do it 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.300
 ok then here pebbles only 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.629
 here in this paper and I made a fake 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.290
 cooked you put these pebbles and 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.930
 some stickers these are the ones with 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.050
 fomi adhesive for you to see so that 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.290
 are highlighted and good this if it is 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.600
 like in third dimension little buttons and 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.210
 this ribbon that only decoration 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.210
 because this mini album because I did not put it 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.100
 the brooch because as it was not so 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.640
 chubby because I feel that no no what 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.200
 they need 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.200
 and good we go with the pages 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.120
 this is the first page that I just put 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.480
 huarte and some stickers 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.159
 and the edge that you already know opens up 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.210
 how do we make this edge 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.469
 and a pennant with a stand with stamp 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.810
 here is like a little pocket and I do not know 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.689
 how can you say just hit him 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.590
 the edges to stay here 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.090
 taken off to put the photos or 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.640
 anything 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.740
 and here is a label 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.780
 and now I really like labels 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.420
 so almost on all the pages I put 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.860
 labels so they can write or 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.010
 put smaller pictures and now use 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.020
 my textured now and I loved it because 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.080
 This is a cactus and ships and good with 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.300
 him with the unboxing folder he gives them 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.530
 a much better appearance I liked 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.530
 very much how it was 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.420
 here is just an equal pocket for 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.049
 that they can put their photos if they do not 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.049
 they want to hit 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.720
 another label 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.200
 sorry, it's my cell phone 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.230
 and this is this album take 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.129
 like a pocket and this opened towards 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.420
 up and here only simple not only 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:03.580
 I put a sticker and here buttons 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.580
 lanyards stickers and their label 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.659
 these crimes are foam and this is 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.360
 I bought some foami stickers 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.099
 they are as baby and good use them better 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.540
 to make the stamps and I liked them 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.540
 much like how they are 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.360
 this other page the same plus a little more 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.400
 simple 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:35.150
 and it's here just like I did the edge look 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.340
 and this opens up like this here has its 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.340
 label for 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.879
 They put more photos on the label to 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.920
 eyelashes just decorate them the same with 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:54.209
 stamps so that they do not remain 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.209
 so licit 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.490
 other 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.280
 same as his label here I just put him 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:07.750
 cotec on the banks here I did not do 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.750
 no stamping 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.870
 and this that is equal actress a pocket 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:16.870
 and this one opened down 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.590
 equal its label 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.520
 and these two that are 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.350
 and let's say almost equal 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.780
 it's just to put the photo 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.020
 and good on the back cover 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.320
 I just put a 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.540
 a decorated paper 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.020
 and this is how this mini album was 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.590
