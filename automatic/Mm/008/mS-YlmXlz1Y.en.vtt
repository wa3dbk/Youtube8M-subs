00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
I said it's a standard five liter it had

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.380 
I said it's a standard five liter it had
a<00:00:51.199> little<00:00:51.410> bit<00:00:51.500> of<00:00:51.789> meaning<00:00:52.789> it<00:00:52.879> had<00:00:53.120> an

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
different set of head gaskets put in it

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.549 
different set of head gaskets put in it
and<00:00:55.010> it's<00:00:55.429> got<00:00:55.550> some<00:00:55.730> more<00:00:55.820> camshaft<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:57.410> main

what<00:01:29.630> we<00:01:29.750> normally<00:01:29.930> do<00:01:30.230> to<00:01:30.380> one<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.620> these

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
what we normally do to one of these

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.760 
what we normally do to one of these
basically<00:01:32.810> that's<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.260> we'll<00:01:33.410> put<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.620> on<00:01:33.680> the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
basically that's it we'll put it on the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.340 
basically that's it we'll put it on the
dyno<00:01:33.920> now<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.750> go<00:01:35.750> through<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.110> show<00:01:36.140> you

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
dyno now and go through and show you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.500 
dyno now and go through and show you
what's<00:01:36.830> actually<00:01:37.040> horsepower<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.150> makes<00:01:38.330> on

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
what's actually horsepower it makes on

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.720 
what's actually horsepower it makes on
the<00:01:38.540> dyno<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.530> we'll<00:01:39.980> take<00:01:40.130> for<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.310> drive<00:01:40.490> so

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
the dyno and we'll take for a drive so

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.700 
the dyno and we'll take for a drive so
you<00:01:40.790> can<00:01:40.880> have<00:01:41.120> a<00:01:41.150> listen<00:01:41.960> in<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.140> bit<00:01:42.260> of<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.440> feel

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
you can have a listen in a bit of a feel

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.820 
you can have a listen in a bit of a feel
as<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:42.950> how<00:01:43.160> it<00:01:43.220> actually<00:01:43.370> goes<00:01:43.670> like<00:01:44.830> okay

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
as to how it actually goes like okay

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.320 
as to how it actually goes like okay
we've<00:01:45.980> got<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.160> supercharged<00:01:46.640> 5-liter<00:01:46.910> on

we've got the supercharged 5-liter on

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330 
we've got the supercharged 5-liter on
the<00:01:47.510> dyno<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.170> will<00:01:48.320> then<00:01:48.500> give<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.950> run<00:01:49.160> and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
the dyno and will then give a run and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:02:41.940 
the dyno and will then give a run and
stable<00:01:49.820> sort<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.060> horsepower<00:01:50.360> makes

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.740 

okay<00:02:42.950> we'll<00:02:43.520> go<00:02:43.640> for<00:02:43.850> driving<00:02:44.210> this<00:02:44.330> thing<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
okay we'll go for driving this thing and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:03:26.280 
okay we'll go for driving this thing and
why<00:02:44.960> share<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.320> goes<00:02:45.440> like

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.839 

okay<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.530> coasting<00:03:28.069> too<00:03:28.189> loose<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.430> can<00:03:28.579> see

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
okay is coasting too loose you can see

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.320 
okay is coasting too loose you can see
that's<00:03:29.090> normal

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
that's normal

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.690 
that's normal
just<00:03:32.330> go<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.900> exhaust<00:03:33.200> system<00:03:33.700> otherwise

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
just go to the exhaust system otherwise

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.570 
just go to the exhaust system otherwise
a<00:03:34.850> lot<00:03:35.810> more<00:03:36.230> responsiveness<00:03:36.830> standard<00:03:37.370> five

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
a lot more responsiveness standard five

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.460 
a lot more responsiveness standard five
