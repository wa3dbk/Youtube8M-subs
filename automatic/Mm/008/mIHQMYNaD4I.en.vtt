one of my jumps I did four sets of eight

one of my jumps I did four sets of eight
reps<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.339> those<00:01:05.519> jumps<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> did<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.990> and

reps of those jumps then I did on and
off<00:01:07.409> box<00:01:07.860> jumps<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.460> did<00:01:09.180> him<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.990> leg<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
off box jumps I did him with one leg the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.530 
off box jumps I did him with one leg the
reason<00:01:11.610> why<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.729> did<00:01:11.909> him<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.360> leg

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
reason why I did him with one leg

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.450 
reason why I did him with one leg
because<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.020> currently<00:01:13.380> am<00:01:13.590> working<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.130> my<00:01:14.189> one

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
because I currently am working on my one

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
because I currently am working on my one
night<00:01:14.580> jumping<00:01:14.970> ability<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.810> jump<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
night jumping ability because I jump a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.260 
night jumping ability because I jump a
lot<00:01:16.680> higher<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.369> foot<00:01:17.610> than<00:01:17.850> two<00:01:18.030> feet

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
lot higher with one foot than two feet

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.999 
lot higher with one foot than two feet
and<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.810> reason<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.470> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and the reason for that is because I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
and the reason for that is because I
feel<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.270> more<00:01:21.390> reactive

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
feel like I have a lot more reactive

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.100 
feel like I have a lot more reactive
ability<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.530> my<00:01:22.850> legs<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.450> first<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:24.990> are

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
ability in my legs so first of them are

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.140 
ability in my legs so first of them are
left<00:01:25.320> leg<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:26.009> add<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.280> my<00:01:26.400> right<00:01:26.610> leg<00:01:26.759> four

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
left leg then add in my right leg four

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
left leg then add in my right leg four
sets<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.630> six<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.530> eight<00:01:28.710> reps<00:01:30.890> after<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.130> I

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
sets of six to eight reps after that I

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.600 
sets of six to eight reps after that I
did<00:01:32.579> depth<00:01:33.150> jumps<00:01:33.619> same<00:01:34.619> thing<00:01:34.890> four<00:01:35.189> sets<00:01:35.490> of

six<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.030> eight<00:01:36.240> reps<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.869> use<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.500> lower<00:01:37.680> box

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
six to eight reps I use the lower box

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.620 
six to eight reps I use the lower box
this<00:01:38.280> time<00:01:38.340> because<00:01:38.700> i<00:01:38.970> felt<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.270> i<00:01:39.479> was

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
this time because i felt like i was

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.300 
this time because i felt like i was
actually<00:01:39.780> jumping<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:41.009> bit<00:01:41.100> higher

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
with the lower box and this works really

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.230 
with the lower box and this works really
well<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.950> prime<00:01:44.189> metric<00:01:44.579> ability<00:01:45.090> as

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
