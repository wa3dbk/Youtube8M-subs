00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:37.780 

I

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.819 

you

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:01:33.920 

you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.080 

okay<00:01:34.930> so<00:01:35.290> i<00:01:36.010> figure<00:01:36.640> i'll<00:01:36.760> show<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:38.160> a<00:01:39.160> little

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
okay so i figure i'll show you a little

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.620 
okay so i figure i'll show you a little
example<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:41.020> going<00:01:41.410> up<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.800> down<00:01:41.890> i<00:01:42.790> can<00:01:43.600> i

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
example of it going up and down i can i

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.590 
example of it going up and down i can i
can<00:01:43.960> bring<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.260> up<00:01:44.350> slowly<00:01:47.730> now<00:01:48.730> again<00:01:48.880> as<00:01:49.390> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
can bring it up slowly now again as the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.770 
can bring it up slowly now again as the
ship<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:50.080> course<00:01:50.560> goes<00:01:51.400> below<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.030> water<00:01:52.240> as

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
ship of course goes below the water as

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.690 
ship of course goes below the water as
more<00:01:53.140> of<00:01:53.200> its<00:01:53.350> floating<00:01:53.650> surface<00:01:54.220> goes<00:01:54.400> below

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
more of its floating surface goes below

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.570 
more of its floating surface goes below
the<00:01:54.820> water<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.650> you<00:01:56.650> know<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.890> potential<00:01:57.280> of

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
the water that you know the potential of

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.380 
the water that you know the potential of
its<00:01:57.730> float<00:01:58.090> is<00:01:58.330> realized<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.410> therefore<00:02:00.390> you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
its float is realized and therefore you

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.440 
its float is realized and therefore you
know<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:02.680> more<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.250> force<00:02:05.250> pushing<00:02:06.250> up<00:02:06.640> so

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
know it's more of a force pushing up so

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.480 
know it's more of a force pushing up so
what<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:07.960> need<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.140> do<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.590> flood<00:02:08.890> more<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.369> get

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
what you need to do is flood more to get

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.550 
what you need to do is flood more to get
it<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.700> go<00:02:09.850> down<00:02:10.260> likewise<00:02:11.260> when<00:02:11.440> you're

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
it to go down likewise when you're

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.880 
it to go down likewise when you're
coming<00:02:11.830> back<00:02:11.980> up<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.520> have<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.730> blow<00:02:12.940> air<00:02:13.270> out

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
coming back up you have to blow air out

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.070 
coming back up you have to blow air out
when<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> when<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.250> starts<00:02:15.850> getting<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.600> the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
when it when it starts getting to the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.900 
when it when it starts getting to the
when<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.410> starts<00:02:17.680> rising<00:02:18.220> above<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.700> water

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
when it starts rising above the water

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.270 
when it starts rising above the water
that<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:20.260> force<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.710> it<00:02:20.830> was<00:02:20.950> getting<00:02:21.190> to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
that that force that it was getting to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.900 
that that force that it was getting to
push<00:02:21.460> itself<00:02:21.760> up<00:02:22.000> before<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:23.230> gone<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.910> it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
push itself up before is is gone and it

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.910 
push itself up before is is gone and it
has<00:02:25.060> less<00:02:25.330> force<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.930> push<00:02:26.080> itself<00:02:26.380> up<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.800> it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
has less force to push itself up so it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.500 
has less force to push itself up so it
basically<00:02:27.130> equalizes<00:02:28.090> itself<00:02:28.480> at<00:02:28.630> some<00:02:28.870> point

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
basically equalizes itself at some point

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.850 
basically equalizes itself at some point
so<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:34.660> know<00:02:34.750> sitting<00:02:35.290> fairly<00:02:35.709> level

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
so this is you know sitting fairly level

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.100 
so this is you know sitting fairly level
in<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.100> water<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.180> can<00:02:37.360> get<00:02:37.480> moving<00:02:37.690> under

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
in the water so we can get moving under

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.410 
in the water so we can get moving under
way<00:02:38.260> here

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.290 

once<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.230> motor<00:02:46.440> kicks<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.950> its<00:02:47.300> sounding

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
once the motor kicks in its sounding

00:02:48.300 --> 00:03:05.830 
once the motor kicks in its sounding
pretty<00:02:48.420> good<00:02:48.540> clip

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:25.360 

jump<00:03:06.319> in<00:03:06.470> that

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:34.790 

this

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:04:04.430 

this<00:03:35.800> is<00:03:36.010> the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.990 

go<00:04:06.140> all<00:04:07.140> right

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
go all right

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000 
go all right
I<00:04:09.090> like<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:10.230> nice<00:04:10.470> smooth

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
I like a nice smooth

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.840 
I like a nice smooth
I<00:04:16.030> can<00:04:17.030> crashed<00:04:17.299> on<00:04:17.540> this<00:04:18.470> thing<00:04:18.709> but<00:04:18.979> then<00:04:19.459> I'm

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
I can crashed on this thing but then I'm

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.900 
I can crashed on this thing but then I'm
out<00:04:20.000> of<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.239> with<00:04:20.449> a<00:04:20.479> little<00:04:20.780> tiny<00:04:21.199> little<00:04:21.910> dive

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
out of it with a little tiny little dive

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.020 
out of it with a little tiny little dive
planes<00:04:23.210> is<00:04:23.449> is<00:04:23.960> very<00:04:24.080> difficult<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:25.790> planes

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
planes is is very difficult the planes

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.900 
planes is is very difficult the planes
at<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.270> back<00:04:26.710> aren't<00:04:27.710> in<00:04:27.949> the<00:04:28.190> submarine<00:04:28.580> yet

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
at the back aren't in the submarine yet

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.850 
at the back aren't in the submarine yet
although<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.389> submarine<00:04:29.840> does<00:04:30.080> have<00:04:30.350> rear

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
although the submarine does have rear

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.520 
although the submarine does have rear
planes<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:32.060> sub<00:04:32.270> is<00:04:32.300> loosely<00:04:32.870> based<00:04:33.020> off<00:04:33.500> a

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
planes the sub is loosely based off a

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.170 
planes the sub is loosely based off a
German<00:04:34.100> type<00:04:34.880> 21<00:04:35.510> u-boat<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:39.580> I'm<00:04:40.580> not<00:04:40.639> making

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
German type 21 u-boat so I'm not making

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.930 
German type 21 u-boat so I'm not making
a<00:04:41.270> replica<00:04:41.479> here<00:04:42.080> but<00:04:42.470> that<00:04:43.039> was<00:04:43.370> my

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
a replica here but that was my

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.409 
a replica here but that was my
inspiration<00:04:45.340> why<00:04:46.340> did<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.669> base<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:46.910> off<00:04:47.180> at

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
inspiration why did I base it off at

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.180 
inspiration why did I base it off at
your<00:04:47.449> world<00:04:47.720> war<00:04:47.930> two<00:04:48.110> u-boat<00:04:48.650> instead<00:04:49.010> of<00:04:49.100> a

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
your world war two u-boat instead of a

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.129 
your world war two u-boat instead of a
modern<00:04:49.520> submarine<00:04:50.060> because<00:04:50.449> I<00:04:50.570> like<00:04:50.930> it

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
modern submarine because I like it

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.500 
modern submarine because I like it
better<00:04:51.350> I<00:04:51.740> just<00:04:52.370> simply<00:04:52.940> like<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.300> design<00:04:54.400> it

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
better I just simply like the design it

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.850 
better I just simply like the design it
basically<00:04:56.510> inspired<00:04:57.020> all<00:04:57.260> posts<00:04:57.710> or

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
basically inspired all posts or

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.740 
basically inspired all posts or
submarines<00:04:58.490> and<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:01.610> know<00:05:01.699> it<00:05:01.970> could<00:05:02.389> be<00:05:02.539> said

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
submarines and you know it could be said

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.689 
submarines and you know it could be said
that<00:05:02.900> it<00:05:03.050> had<00:05:03.169> its<00:05:03.350> issues<00:05:03.500> but<00:05:04.100> I<00:05:04.340> thought<00:05:04.550> it

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
that it had its issues but I thought it

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.370 
that it had its issues but I thought it
was<00:05:04.789> a<00:05:04.850> pretty<00:05:05.060> cool<00:05:05.300> looking<00:05:05.510> submarine<00:05:06.139> for

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
was a pretty cool looking submarine for

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.890 
was a pretty cool looking submarine for
its<00:05:06.500> time<00:05:06.740> and<00:05:07.070> I<00:05:07.190> wanted<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.610> model<00:05:07.880> one<00:05:08.510> after

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
its time and I wanted to model one after

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:41.200 
its time and I wanted to model one after
it<00:05:08.930> so<00:05:09.380> that's<00:05:09.560> what<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:09.740> did

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.900 

you

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910
