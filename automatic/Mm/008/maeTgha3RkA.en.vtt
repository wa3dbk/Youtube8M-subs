00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
first things first shot designer works

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.190 
first things first shot designer works
as<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.220> canvas<00:00:08.790> so<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.090> can<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.809> know<00:00:09.870> pan

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
as a canvas so you can you know pan

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.379 
as a canvas so you can you know pan
around<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.860> pinch<00:00:11.429> zoom<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.940> all<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.179> stuff

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
that you know but you have to actually

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.120 
that you know but you have to actually
tap<00:00:14.549> objects<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.210> work<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.570> them<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.039> if<00:00:17.039> you

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
tap objects to work with them and if you

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.880 
tap objects to work with them and if you
tap<00:00:17.340> them<00:00:17.550> again<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> menu<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.900> you

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
tap them again you get a menu and you

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.410 
tap them again you get a menu and you
notice<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> plus<00:00:20.640> sign<00:00:20.880> here<00:00:20.910> means<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
notice the plus sign here means that

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.880 
notice the plus sign here means that
there's<00:00:21.660> more<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> menus<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.500> scroll

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
there's more in the menus you can scroll

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.790 
there's more in the menus you can scroll
inside<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.490> menu<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.880> well<00:00:24.000> if<00:00:24.590> you<00:00:25.590> tap

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
inside the menu as well if you tap

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.679 
inside the menu as well if you tap
outside<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> menu<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.730> goes<00:00:26.910> away<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.539> then

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
outside the menu it goes away and then

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.080 
outside the menu it goes away and then
if<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.960> tap<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.529> canvas<00:00:29.220> itself<00:00:29.580> then<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
if you tap on the canvas itself then it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.959 
if you tap on the canvas itself then it
deselects<00:00:30.480> completely<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:32.550> only<00:00:32.730> thing<00:00:32.880> we

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
deselects completely the only thing we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.180 
deselects completely the only thing we
do<00:00:33.059> besides<00:00:33.210> tapping<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> long-pressing<00:00:34.620> so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
do besides tapping is long-pressing so

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.979 
do besides tapping is long-pressing so
if<00:00:35.309> i<00:00:35.399> press<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.850> hold<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> makes<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
if i press and hold here then it makes a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.710 
if i press and hold here then it makes a
copy<00:00:37.200> which<00:00:37.620> you're<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.950> use<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> lot

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.840 

the<00:00:42.500> next<00:00:42.710> thing<00:00:42.800> about<00:00:42.860> objects<00:00:43.340> is<00:00:43.489> you<00:00:43.670> can

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
the next thing about objects is you can

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.700 
the next thing about objects is you can
rotate<00:00:44.090> them<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:44.720> you<00:00:44.780> get<00:00:45.050> like<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.290> normal

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
rotate them so you get like a normal

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.100 
rotate them so you get like a normal
rotation<00:00:45.920> handle<00:00:46.580> but<00:00:47.390> what's<00:00:47.630> special<00:00:47.870> here

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
rotation handle but what's special here

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.870 
rotation handle but what's special here
is<00:00:48.410> that<00:00:48.590> objects<00:00:49.040> can<00:00:49.190> have<00:00:49.309> more<00:00:49.489> than<00:00:49.670> one

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
is that objects can have more than one

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.720 
is that objects can have more than one
rotation<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:50.750> if<00:00:50.930> I<00:00:51.050> tap<00:00:51.110> here<00:00:51.739> I<00:00:51.860> can<00:00:52.250> insert<00:00:52.670> a

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
rotation so if I tap here I can insert a

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.430 
rotation so if I tap here I can insert a
turn<00:00:53.000> after<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:53.600> then<00:00:53.720> check<00:00:53.930> this<00:00:54.050> out<00:00:54.260> now

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
turn after and then check this out now

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.350 
turn after and then check this out now
we<00:00:54.500> have<00:00:54.680> multiple<00:00:55.370> rotations<00:00:55.580> and<00:00:56.239> the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
we have multiple rotations and the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.479 
we have multiple rotations and the
software<00:00:56.750> draws<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.230> turn<00:00:57.530> arrows<00:00:57.920> by<00:00:58.190> itself

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
software draws the turn arrows by itself

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.330 
software draws the turn arrows by itself
and<00:00:59.170> turns<00:01:00.170> have<00:01:00.410> their<00:01:00.530> own<00:01:00.650> settings<00:01:00.890> too<00:01:01.160> so

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
and turns have their own settings too so

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.060 
and turns have their own settings too so
if<00:01:01.430> I<00:01:01.519> tap<00:01:01.760> this<00:01:02.000> one<00:01:02.180> here<00:01:02.629> let<00:01:03.559> me<00:01:03.590> just<00:01:03.680> move

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
if I tap this one here let me just move

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.370 
if I tap this one here let me just move
that<00:01:04.280> over<00:01:04.400> there<00:01:04.489> then<00:01:04.940> I<00:01:05.150> can<00:01:05.390> say<00:01:05.630> turn<00:01:05.960> back

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
that over there then I can say turn back

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.140 
that over there then I can say turn back
again<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:07.040> can<00:01:07.130> see<00:01:07.340> now<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.580> character

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
again so you can see now the character

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.880 
again so you can see now the character
turns<00:01:08.360> over<00:01:08.600> here<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.140> then<00:01:09.229> you<00:01:09.259> turns<00:01:09.619> back

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
turns over here and then you turns back

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.700 
turns over here and then you turns back
again<00:01:10.280> notice<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.119> little<00:01:11.270> arrow<00:01:11.570> I<00:01:11.869> can<00:01:12.380> hide

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
again notice the little arrow I can hide

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.070 
again notice the little arrow I can hide
the<00:01:12.979> turn<00:01:13.300> which<00:01:14.300> just<00:01:14.540> means<00:01:14.690> that<00:01:14.810> we<00:01:14.930> don't

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
the turn which just means that we don't

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.780 
the turn which just means that we don't
really<00:01:15.200> care<00:01:15.500> about<00:01:15.590> turn<00:01:15.950> number<00:01:16.310> one<00:01:16.550> we're

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
really care about turn number one we're

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.359 
really care about turn number one we're
interested<00:01:17.450> in<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.720> turn<00:01:18.020> into<00:01:18.740> position

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
interested in a turn into position

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.749 
interested in a turn into position
number<00:01:19.640> two<00:01:20.920> next<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:21.979> make<00:01:22.130> characters<00:01:22.520> walk

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
number two next to make characters walk

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.700 
number two next to make characters walk
I<00:01:22.970> just<00:01:23.240> tap<00:01:23.509> them<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:23.780> then<00:01:24.050> in<00:01:24.170> their<00:01:24.289> menu<00:01:24.649> I

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
I just tap them and then in their menu I

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.100 
I just tap them and then in their menu I
have<00:01:24.920> some<00:01:25.399> options<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:25.910> walk<00:01:26.300> to<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.899> walk

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
have some options like walk to and walk

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.260 
have some options like walk to and walk
from<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:27.800> I'm<00:01:27.950> going<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.160> select<00:01:28.280> walk<00:01:28.910> from

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
from so I'm going to select walk from

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.580 
from so I'm going to select walk from
and<00:01:29.630> then<00:01:29.780> it's<00:01:29.960> going<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.140> ask<00:01:30.200> down<00:01:30.440> here

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
and then it's going to ask down here

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.350 
and then it's going to ask down here
walk<00:01:30.890> from<00:01:31.130> where<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.729> I'm<00:01:31.910> just<00:01:32.149> going<00:01:32.330> to

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
walk from where and I'm just going to

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.139 
walk from where and I'm just going to
tap<00:01:32.810> right<00:01:33.020> there<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:33.890> now<00:01:34.160> she<00:01:34.670> walks<00:01:34.910> from

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
tap right there so now she walks from

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.060 
tap right there so now she walks from
over<00:01:35.420> here<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.990> let's<00:01:36.320> do<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.619> other<00:01:36.740> part<00:01:37.009> of

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
over here and let's do the other part of

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.460 
over here and let's do the other part of
that<00:01:37.250> too<00:01:37.430> I'm<00:01:37.670> going<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.940> say<00:01:38.420> walk<00:01:38.750> too<00:01:39.170> and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
that too I'm going to say walk too and

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.710 
that too I'm going to say walk too and
then<00:01:39.619> she's<00:01:39.890> going<00:01:40.039> to<00:01:40.100> walk<00:01:40.310> over<00:01:40.850> behind<00:01:41.539> the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
then she's going to walk over behind the

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.150 
then she's going to walk over behind the
red<00:01:41.930> character<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:42.440> let<00:01:42.530> me<00:01:42.590> just<00:01:42.770> turn<00:01:42.979> her

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
red character and let me just turn her

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.270 
red character and let me just turn her
into<00:01:43.280> place<00:01:44.350> if<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.470> then<00:01:45.500> select<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.009> walk

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
into place if I then select the walk

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.160 
into place if I then select the walk
arrow<00:01:46.550> then<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.149> can<00:01:47.330> tap<00:01:47.539> it<00:01:47.690> again<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:48.020> get<00:01:48.110> a

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
arrow then I can tap it again to get a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.230 
arrow then I can tap it again to get a
menu<00:01:48.440> where<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:48.860> can<00:01:48.950> add<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.340> control<00:01:49.970> point

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
menu where I can add a control point

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.940 
menu where I can add a control point
which<00:01:50.630> gives<00:01:50.869> me<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.080> control<00:01:51.470> point<00:01:51.740> right

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
which gives me a control point right

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.919 
which gives me a control point right
there<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.429> I<00:01:52.459> can<00:01:52.700> then<00:01:52.849> pull<00:01:53.390> around<00:01:53.509> to

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
there that I can then pull around to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.010 
there that I can then pull around to
make<00:01:54.050> more<00:01:54.289> sophisticated<00:01:55.130> paths<00:01:55.520> and

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
make more sophisticated paths and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.089 
make more sophisticated paths and
there's<00:01:57.020> another<00:01:57.200> way<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.410> do<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:57.740> which<00:01:57.950> is

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
there's another way to do that which is

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.559 
there's another way to do that which is
just<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.369> press<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.819> hold<00:01:58.849> the<00:01:59.149> line<00:01:59.330> right

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
just to press and hold the line right

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.290 
just to press and hold the line right
there<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.700> gave<00:02:01.700> me<00:02:01.789> another<00:02:01.910> control

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
there so that gave me another control

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.850 
there so that gave me another control
point<00:02:02.569> let<00:02:02.690> me<00:02:02.750> pull<00:02:03.110> that<00:02:03.140> over<00:02:03.470> here<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:03.679> now

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
point let me pull that over here so now

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.279 
point let me pull that over here so now
she's<00:02:04.220> kind<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:04.970> drunk<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:06.020> I'm<00:02:06.110> going<00:02:06.259> to

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
press and hold this one to make it go

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.080 
press and hold this one to make it go
away<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.990> same<00:02:09.140> for<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.410> next<00:02:09.440> one

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.610 

next<00:02:13.090> let's<00:02:13.270> add<00:02:13.390> some<00:02:13.630> cameras<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.470> they're

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
next let's add some cameras so they're

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.110 
next let's add some cameras so they're
basically<00:02:14.890> two<00:02:15.130> ways<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.460> add<00:02:15.580> stuff<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:15.940> a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
basically two ways to add stuff to a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.970 
basically two ways to add stuff to a
scene<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.660> first<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:17.020> use<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.440> plus<00:02:17.710> sign

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
scene the first is use the plus sign

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.740 
scene the first is use the plus sign
menu<00:02:18.310> down<00:02:18.520> here<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:18.880> let's<00:02:18.970> tap<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.450> and

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
menu down here so let's tap that and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
here you can add characters and cameras

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.150 
here you can add characters and cameras

and you can also bring in a background
image<00:02:25.990> if<00:02:26.260> your<00:02:26.440> production<00:02:26.920> designer<00:02:27.250> has<00:02:27.610> a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
image if your production designer has a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.190 
image if your production designer has a
drawing<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.240> set<00:02:28.450> they<00:02:28.630> can<00:02:28.750> just<00:02:28.960> block

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
drawing of the set they can just block

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.370 
drawing of the set they can just block
on<00:02:29.380> top<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.510> get<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.810> same<00:02:32.050> menu

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
on top of it and you get the same menu

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.200 
on top of it and you get the same menu
but<00:02:32.590> just<00:02:32.770> long<00:02:33.010> pressing<00:02:33.460> in<00:02:33.670> any<00:02:33.940> empty

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
place on the canvas and that's pretty

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.770 
place on the canvas and that's pretty
much<00:02:36.160> how<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.370> do<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.670> all<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.910> time<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.150> let's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
much how I do it all the time so let's

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.500 
much how I do it all the time so let's
add<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:37.990> camera<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.700> tend<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> use<00:02:39.910> green<00:02:40.120> cameras

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
add a camera I tend to use green cameras

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.240 
add a camera I tend to use green cameras
for<00:02:40.690> everything<00:02:41.110> but<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.590> multiple<00:02:41.950> colors

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
for everything but the multiple colors

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.070 
for everything but the multiple colors
are<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.700> can<00:02:42.880> visually<00:02:43.330> group<00:02:43.540> shots<00:02:43.840> that

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
are you can visually group shots that

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.320 
are you can visually group shots that
are<00:02:44.170> part<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.530> same<00:02:44.709> function<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:46.240> I'm

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
are part of the same function so I'm

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.900 
are part of the same function so I'm
going<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.510> position<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.110> here<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.910> rotate

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
going to position that here and rotate

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.070 
going to position that here and rotate
it<00:02:49.030> into<00:02:49.209> place<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.720> then<00:02:49.810> I'm<00:02:49.900> going<00:02:50.050> to

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080

press hold and then I'm going to pull a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.430 
press hold and then I'm going to pull a

copy that I'm going to put over here and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.650 
copy that I'm going to put over here and
let's<00:02:54.430> get<00:02:54.550> rid<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.850> her<00:02:55.000> mark<00:02:55.209> over<00:02:55.420> here<00:02:55.570> so

let's get rid of her mark over here so

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.880 
let's get rid of her mark over here so
I'm<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:55.870> going<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.080> tap<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.320> there's<00:02:56.739> the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
tracking the way that we just did

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.540 
tracking the way that we just did
walking<00:03:01.720> where<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.020> just<00:03:02.260> select<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.190> camera

walking where you just select the camera

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.610 
walking where you just select the camera
and<00:03:03.670> then<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:03.790> say<00:03:04.030> track<00:03:04.420> 2<00:03:04.720> or<00:03:05.020> track<00:03:05.290> from

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.550 
says track from where and I'm just going
to<00:03:09.580> tap<00:03:09.880> right<00:03:10.120> here<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.720> then<00:03:10.840> rotate<00:03:11.140> that

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
to tap right here and then rotate that

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.650 
to tap right here and then rotate that
into<00:03:11.830> place<00:03:12.100> so<00:03:12.790> what<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.270> now<00:03:13.450> is

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
into place so what you have now is

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.210 
into place so what you have now is
basically<00:03:14.050> a<00:03:14.140> move<00:03:14.350> that<00:03:14.530> goes<00:03:14.709> like<00:03:14.920> this

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
basically a move that goes like this

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.190 
basically a move that goes like this
that<00:03:15.640> converge<00:03:16.030> or<00:03:16.299> a<00:03:16.330> counter<00:03:16.750> into<00:03:17.080> the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
that converge or a counter into the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.110 
that converge or a counter into the
over-the-shoulder<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.790> can<00:03:18.940> keep

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
over-the-shoulder and you can keep

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.030 
over-the-shoulder and you can keep
adding<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:19.660> move<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.200> if<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.560> select<00:03:20.769> this

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
adding to this move so if I select this

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.130 
adding to this move so if I select this
one<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.430> then<00:03:21.519> I<00:03:21.610> say<00:03:21.820> track<00:03:22.209> 2<00:03:22.480> then<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.959> can

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
one and then I say track 2 then I can

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.780 
one and then I say track 2 then I can
just<00:03:23.320> select<00:03:23.410> an<00:03:23.709> empty<00:03:24.040> place<00:03:24.280> on<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.519> track

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
just select an empty place on the track

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.900 
just select an empty place on the track
joint<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.690> then<00:03:26.500> that's<00:03:26.950> now<00:03:27.160> mark<00:03:27.459> number<00:03:27.700> 3

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
joint and then that's now mark number 3

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.870 
joint and then that's now mark number 3
so<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.090> goes<00:03:28.209> from<00:03:28.330> 1<00:03:28.600> 2<00:03:29.049> &amp;<00:03:29.470> 3<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:30.070> let<00:03:30.519> me<00:03:30.610> undo

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
so it goes from 1 2 &amp; 3 and let me undo

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.300 
so it goes from 1 2 &amp; 3 and let me undo
that<00:03:31.049> because<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.260> can<00:03:32.440> also<00:03:32.590> attract<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.280> a

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
that because I can also attract to a

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.280 
that because I can also attract to a
spot<00:03:33.730> outside<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.390> track<00:03:34.630> so<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.870> just<00:03:35.080> against

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
spot outside the track so I just against

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.920 
spot outside the track so I just against
a<00:03:35.440> track<00:03:35.860> 2<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.160> then<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:36.670> tap<00:03:36.730> right<00:03:37.360> here<00:03:37.420> and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
a track 2 and then I tap right here and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.070 
a track 2 and then I tap right here and
there<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.709> go<00:03:38.860> so<00:03:39.040> suddenly<00:03:39.430> you<00:03:39.580> have<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:40.080> it

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
there you go so suddenly you have a it

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.410 
there you go so suddenly you have a it
extended<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.620> track<00:03:42.120> now<00:03:43.120> there's<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.390> thing

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
extended the track now there's the thing

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.940 
extended the track now there's the thing
to<00:03:43.600> notice<00:03:43.780> here<00:03:43.900> because<00:03:44.410> since<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.769> did<00:03:44.920> that

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
to notice here because since I did that

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.710 
to notice here because since I did that
in<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.310> straight<00:03:45.580> line<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:46.150> track<00:03:46.420> is<00:03:46.600> still

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
in a straight line the track is still

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.740 
in a straight line the track is still
just<00:03:47.019> one<00:03:47.290> segment<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:49.120> if<00:03:49.239> I<00:03:49.360> track<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:49.720> a

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
just one segment but if I track to a

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.300 
just one segment but if I track to a
place<00:03:49.989> that's<00:03:50.260> much<00:03:50.440> more<00:03:50.680> at<00:03:50.799> an<00:03:50.950> angle<00:03:51.280> like

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
place that's much more at an angle like

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.250 
place that's much more at an angle like
over<00:03:52.180> here<00:03:52.330> on<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.540> other<00:03:52.630> side<00:03:52.959> then

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
over here on the other side then

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.130 
over here on the other side then
suddenly<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.739> turns<00:03:53.950> into<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.280> curvy<00:03:54.700> track<00:03:55.140> so

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
suddenly it turns into a curvy track so

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.390 
suddenly it turns into a curvy track so
that<00:03:56.260> means<00:03:56.380> you<00:03:56.500> can<00:03:56.650> pretty<00:03:56.860> much<00:03:56.950> do<00:03:57.220> any

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
that means you can pretty much do any

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.740 
that means you can pretty much do any
kind<00:03:57.640> of<00:03:57.730> move<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.120> can<00:03:58.239> imagine<00:03:58.420> this

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
kind of move that you can imagine this

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.720 
kind of move that you can imagine this
is<00:03:58.900> now<00:03:59.019> turning<00:03:59.410> into<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.620> Steadicam<00:04:00.190> move<00:04:00.430> or

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
is now turning into a Steadicam move or

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.460 
is now turning into a Steadicam move or
I<00:04:00.760> can<00:04:01.120> select<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.540> track<00:04:01.780> also<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:02.320> then<00:04:02.410> I

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
I can select the track also and then I

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.800 
I can select the track also and then I
can<00:04:02.680> deselect<00:04:03.340> soft<00:04:03.940> curve<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.570> now<00:04:04.720> it

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
can deselect soft curve so now it

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.630 
can deselect soft curve so now it
becomes<00:04:05.170> straight<00:04:05.530> track<00:04:05.860> segments<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.430> if<00:04:06.519> I

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
becomes straight track segments so if I

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.250 
becomes straight track segments so if I
was<00:04:06.790> working<00:04:06.940> on<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.180> crab<00:04:07.480> dolly<00:04:07.750> then<00:04:07.989> I<00:04:08.079> go

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
was working on a crab dolly then I go

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.080 
was working on a crab dolly then I go
from<00:04:08.590> here<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.799> here<00:04:08.920> sit<00:04:09.670> for<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:09.910> while<00:04:10.030> and

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
from here to here sit for a while and

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.430 
from here to here sit for a while and
then<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:10.480> track<00:04:10.870> over<00:04:11.049> here

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
then I track over here

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.290 
then I track over here
you're<00:04:13.160> really<00:04:13.340> free<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:13.700> how<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:13.940> arrange

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
you're really free and how you arrange

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.330 
you're really free and how you arrange
cameras<00:04:14.780> Oh<00:04:15.020> another<00:04:15.320> thing<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:15.650> can<00:04:15.800> do<00:04:15.950> if<00:04:16.190> I

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
cameras Oh another thing I can do if I

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.770 
cameras Oh another thing I can do if I
make<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.550> copy<00:04:16.850> here<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.180> can<00:04:17.360> just<00:04:17.390> drag<00:04:17.750> a

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
make a copy here I can just drag a

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.900 
make a copy here I can just drag a
camera<00:04:18.200> over<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.560> just<00:04:18.739> drop<00:04:19.100> it<00:04:19.250> on<00:04:19.400> here<00:04:19.790> and

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
camera over and just drop it on here and

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.210 
camera over and just drop it on here and
now<00:04:20.810> it<00:04:20.870> snaps<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.500> track<00:04:21.739> so<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:21.950> can<00:04:22.040> see

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
now it snaps to the track so you can see

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.150 
now it snaps to the track so you can see
now<00:04:22.370> it's<00:04:22.520> part<00:04:22.730> of<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.910> track<00:04:23.830> but<00:04:24.830> right<00:04:25.010> now

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
now it's part of the track but right now

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.920 
now it's part of the track but right now
the<00:04:25.220> tracking<00:04:25.550> doesn't<00:04:26.000> stop<00:04:26.300> at<00:04:26.510> this<00:04:26.630> camera

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
the tracking doesn't stop at this camera

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.600 
the tracking doesn't stop at this camera
you<00:04:27.140> can<00:04:27.290> see<00:04:27.320> that<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.800> arrow<00:04:28.040> goes<00:04:28.340> right

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
you can see that the arrow goes right

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.250 
you can see that the arrow goes right
past<00:04:28.640> it<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.300> that's<00:04:29.570> because<00:04:29.930> we<00:04:30.110> haven't

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
past it and that's because we haven't

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.230 
past it and that's because we haven't
added<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.650> stop<00:04:30.950> mark<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:31.760> do<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:32.000> from

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
added a stop mark and you do that from

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.210 
added a stop mark and you do that from
the<00:04:32.330> cameras<00:04:32.660> menus<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.200> can<00:04:33.230> see<00:04:33.500> we<00:04:33.950> have<00:04:34.040> no

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
the cameras menus you can see we have no

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.070 
the cameras menus you can see we have no
stop<00:04:34.460> mark<00:04:34.700> or<00:04:34.910> one<00:04:35.180> two<00:04:35.450> three<00:04:35.690> four<00:04:35.900> so<00:04:36.020> I'm

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
stop mark or one two three four so I'm

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.930 
stop mark or one two three four so I'm
going<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.260> select<00:04:36.350> number<00:04:36.680> two<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.370> then<00:04:37.820> see

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
going to select number two and then see

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.250 
going to select number two and then see
what<00:04:38.030> happens<00:04:38.330> here<00:04:38.390> now<00:04:38.570> we'll<00:04:38.690> go<00:04:38.810> from<00:04:38.930> 1<00:04:39.230> to

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
what happens here now we'll go from 1 to

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.230 
what happens here now we'll go from 1 to
number<00:04:39.740> two<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.280> then<00:04:40.400> if<00:04:40.580> I<00:04:40.700> select<00:04:40.970> this<00:04:41.060> one

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
number two and then if I select this one

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.350 
number two and then if I select this one
I<00:04:41.270> can<00:04:41.450> turn<00:04:41.600> that<00:04:41.720> into<00:04:41.780> number<00:04:42.230> three<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.880> if

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
I can turn that into number three and if

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.850 
I can turn that into number three and if
I<00:04:44.450> now<00:04:44.570> go<00:04:44.690> back<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.020> also<00:04:45.230> set<00:04:45.410> this<00:04:45.500> one<00:04:45.680> to

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
I now go back and also set this one to

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.860 
I now go back and also set this one to
be<00:04:46.100> marked<00:04:46.400> number<00:04:46.490> four<00:04:46.970> then<00:04:47.240> notice<00:04:47.690> what's

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
be marked number four then notice what's

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.240 
be marked number four then notice what's
happening<00:04:48.230> here<00:04:48.380> now<00:04:48.530> because<00:04:48.830> now<00:04:48.950> we<00:04:49.010> have<00:04:49.220> a

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
happening here now because now we have a

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.490 
happening here now because now we have a
shot<00:04:49.490> that<00:04:49.670> goes<00:04:49.730> from<00:04:50.000> one<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.570> two<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.470> three

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
shot that goes from one to two to three

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.800 
shot that goes from one to two to three
to<00:04:52.130> four<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:52.640> that's<00:04:53.150> about<00:04:53.300> as<00:04:53.510> complicated

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
to four and that's about as complicated

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.480 
to four and that's about as complicated
as<00:04:54.170> you<00:04:54.200> want<00:04:54.290> to<00:04:54.530> get<00:04:54.650> on<00:04:54.770> a<00:04:54.800> dolly<00:04:55.070> because

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
as you want to get on a dolly because

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.010 
as you want to get on a dolly because
suddenly<00:04:55.670> it<00:04:55.880> starts<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.300> be<00:04:56.420> hard<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.810> shoot

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
suddenly it starts to be hard to shoot

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.500 
suddenly it starts to be hard to shoot
it<00:04:57.200> but<00:04:57.350> just<00:04:57.920> because<00:04:58.190> we<00:04:58.370> can<00:04:58.580> let's<00:04:58.880> turn

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
it but just because we can let's turn

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.170 
it but just because we can let's turn
this<00:04:59.660> one<00:04:59.840> into<00:05:00.110> mark<00:05:00.350> number<00:05:00.530> five

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.550 

now<00:05:04.180> as<00:05:04.390> diagrams<00:05:04.900> get<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.140> little<00:05:05.350> bigger

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
now as diagrams get a little bigger

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.750 
now as diagrams get a little bigger
you're<00:05:05.830> going<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.010> need<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.280> next<00:05:06.430> feature

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
you're going to need the next feature

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.940 
you're going to need the next feature
which<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.300> snapping<00:05:07.840> because<00:05:08.080> when<00:05:08.830> you

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
which is snapping because when you

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.560 
which is snapping because when you
rearrange<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.400> diagram<00:05:09.850> after<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.330> while<00:05:10.420> it's

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
rearrange the diagram after a while it's

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.850 
rearrange the diagram after a while it's
going<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.750> drive<00:05:10.900> you<00:05:10.930> crazy<00:05:11.200> that<00:05:11.590> you<00:05:11.710> have

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
going to drive you crazy that you have

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.650 
going to drive you crazy that you have
to<00:05:12.010> rotate<00:05:12.280> everything<00:05:12.790> into<00:05:13.120> place<00:05:13.330> every

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
to rotate everything into place every

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.110 
to rotate everything into place every
time<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.960> come<00:05:14.080> up<00:05:14.110> with<00:05:14.260> something<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:15.120> we

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
time you come up with something and we

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.580 
time you come up with something and we
solve<00:05:16.480> that<00:05:16.630> in<00:05:16.840> what<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.110> think<00:05:17.200> is<00:05:17.410> a<00:05:17.440> really

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
solve that in what I think is a really

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.430 
solve that in what I think is a really
smart<00:05:17.860> way<00:05:18.390> it<00:05:19.390> centers<00:05:19.810> around<00:05:19.840> adding

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
smart way it centers around adding

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.620 
smart way it centers around adding
something<00:05:20.770> called<00:05:20.950> an<00:05:21.070> axis<00:05:21.550> line<00:05:21.790> and<00:05:22.150> if<00:05:22.450> I

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
something called an axis line and if I

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.710 
something called an axis line and if I
say<00:05:22.870> axis<00:05:23.440> line<00:05:23.620> two<00:05:23.920> and<00:05:24.280> then<00:05:24.460> axis<00:05:25.300> line<00:05:25.480> to

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
say axis line two and then axis line to

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.260 
say axis line two and then axis line to
this<00:05:25.870> character<00:05:26.320> then<00:05:26.530> this<00:05:26.770> is<00:05:26.950> a<00:05:26.980> ye<00:05:27.490> old<00:05:27.670> 180

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
this character then this is a ye old 180

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.000 
this character then this is a ye old 180
degree<00:05:28.600> rule<00:05:28.810> and<00:05:29.110> that's<00:05:29.410> very<00:05:29.650> good<00:05:29.830> because

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
degree rule and that's very good because

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.410 
degree rule and that's very good because
it<00:05:30.190> helps<00:05:30.340> you<00:05:30.400> understand<00:05:30.790> what<00:05:30.970> side<00:05:31.180> of<00:05:31.330> the

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
it helps you understand what side of the

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.140 
it helps you understand what side of the
line<00:05:31.600> you're<00:05:31.750> on<00:05:32.310> but<00:05:33.310> what's<00:05:33.520> clever<00:05:33.700> now<00:05:33.940> is

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
line you're on but what's clever now is

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.910 
line you're on but what's clever now is
that<00:05:34.270> I<00:05:34.330> can<00:05:34.450> actually<00:05:34.570> attach<00:05:35.050> my<00:05:35.260> cameras<00:05:35.710> to

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
that I can actually attach my cameras to

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.380 
that I can actually attach my cameras to
this<00:05:36.100> line<00:05:36.310> so<00:05:36.550> I'm<00:05:36.640> going<00:05:36.790> to<00:05:36.850> drag<00:05:37.000> this<00:05:37.210> one

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
this line so I'm going to drag this one

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.330 
this line so I'm going to drag this one
over<00:05:37.630> there<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:38.050> let<00:05:38.440> go<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:38.980> jumps<00:05:39.280> back

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
over there and let go and it jumps back

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.430 
over there and let go and it jumps back
and<00:05:39.700> let's<00:05:39.850> do<00:05:39.970> the<00:05:40.090> same<00:05:40.240> thing<00:05:40.300> over<00:05:40.600> here<00:05:40.720> so

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
and let's do the same thing over here so

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.430 
and let's do the same thing over here so
I<00:05:41.470> drag<00:05:41.710> it<00:05:41.830> over<00:05:41.920> and<00:05:42.250> let<00:05:42.670> go<00:05:43.050> so<00:05:44.050> check<00:05:44.290> this

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
I drag it over and let go so check this

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.140 
I drag it over and let go so check this
out<00:05:44.620> now<00:05:44.650> because<00:05:45.190> as<00:05:45.340> I<00:05:45.460> move<00:05:45.640> the<00:05:45.760> characters

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
out now because as I move the characters

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.790 
out now because as I move the characters
around<00:05:46.390> the<00:05:46.600> cameras<00:05:46.990> actually<00:05:47.170> keep<00:05:47.590> their

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
around the cameras actually keep their

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.720 
around the cameras actually keep their
formation<00:05:49.590> that's<00:05:50.590> pretty<00:05:50.980> incredible<00:05:51.130> and

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
formation that's pretty incredible and

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.360 
formation that's pretty incredible and
the<00:05:52.570> camera<00:05:52.870> is<00:05:52.930> also<00:05:53.200> they<00:05:53.410> they<00:05:53.770> stick<00:05:54.190> to

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
the camera is also they they stick to

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.070 
the camera is also they they stick to
the<00:05:54.490> end<00:05:54.670> of<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:54.880> line<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:55.240> we<00:05:55.390> snap<00:05:55.660> them<00:05:55.900> to

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
the end of the line that we snap them to

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.050 
the end of the line that we snap them to
so<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.620> camera<00:05:56.920> behind<00:05:57.190> here<00:05:57.520> stays<00:05:57.820> and

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
so the camera behind here stays and

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.490 
so the camera behind here stays and
over-the-shoulder<00:05:58.330> no<00:05:58.780> matter<00:05:58.960> what<00:05:59.200> we<00:05:59.320> do

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
over-the-shoulder no matter what we do

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.500 
over-the-shoulder no matter what we do
and<00:05:59.770> actually<00:06:00.310> if<00:06:00.550> you<00:06:00.580> notice<00:06:00.940> even<00:06:01.120> the

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
and actually if you notice even the

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.060 
and actually if you notice even the
characters<00:06:02.020> keep<00:06:02.290> looking<00:06:02.650> at<00:06:02.770> each<00:06:02.860> other

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
characters keep looking at each other

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.130 
characters keep looking at each other
because<00:06:03.280> of<00:06:03.430> the<00:06:03.610> axis<00:06:03.940> line<00:06:06.660> so<00:06:07.660> that<00:06:07.810> really

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
because of the axis line so that really

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.160 
because of the axis line so that really
saves<00:06:08.530> you<00:06:08.680> a<00:06:08.710> lot<00:06:08.860> of<00:06:08.920> work<00:06:09.870> so<00:06:10.870> that's<00:06:10.960> really

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
saves you a lot of work so that's really

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.750 
saves you a lot of work so that's really
all<00:06:11.380> you<00:06:11.500> need<00:06:11.650> to<00:06:11.830> get<00:06:11.920> started<00:06:12.100> but<00:06:12.580> let's

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
all you need to get started but let's

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.600 
all you need to get started but let's
talk<00:06:12.940> about<00:06:13.000> saving<00:06:13.600> and<00:06:13.750> loading<00:06:14.580> when<00:06:15.580> a

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
talk about saving and loading when a

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.490 
talk about saving and loading when a
scene<00:06:15.880> is<00:06:16.030> open<00:06:16.450> it's<00:06:16.600> open<00:06:16.870> no<00:06:16.990> matter<00:06:17.200> what

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
scene is open it's open no matter what

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.990 
scene is open it's open no matter what
screen<00:06:17.860> you're<00:06:18.070> on<00:06:18.220> so<00:06:18.550> don't<00:06:18.640> worry<00:06:18.760> about

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
screen you're on so don't worry about

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.240 
screen you're on so don't worry about
moving<00:06:19.180> between<00:06:19.660> screens<00:06:20.020> we<00:06:20.290> just<00:06:20.500> use<00:06:20.830> back

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
moving between screens we just use back

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.950 
moving between screens we just use back
to<00:06:21.430> the<00:06:21.550> editor<00:06:21.940> and<00:06:21.970> then<00:06:22.270> there's<00:06:22.660> a<00:06:22.720> home

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
to the editor and then there's a home

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.320 
to the editor and then there's a home
button<00:06:23.290> right<00:06:23.440> here<00:06:23.970> when<00:06:24.970> you<00:06:25.060> make<00:06:25.210> a<00:06:25.240> new

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
button right here when you make a new

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.450 
button right here when you make a new
scene<00:06:25.690> the<00:06:25.930> scene<00:06:26.140> is<00:06:26.320> in<00:06:26.440> an<00:06:26.560> edit<00:06:26.830> buffer<00:06:27.220> and

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
scene the scene is in an edit buffer and

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.760 
scene the scene is in an edit buffer and
so<00:06:27.970> that<00:06:28.300> means<00:06:28.510> that<00:06:28.690> when<00:06:29.140> you're<00:06:29.230> working

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
so that means that when you're working

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.110 
so that means that when you're working
on<00:06:29.830> a<00:06:29.890> scene<00:06:30.130> for<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.400> first<00:06:30.550> time<00:06:30.880> it's

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
on a scene for the first time it's

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.580 
on a scene for the first time it's
reminding<00:06:31.390> you<00:06:31.630> down<00:06:31.810> here<00:06:32.020> with<00:06:32.170> a<00:06:32.200> flashing

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
reminding you down here with a flashing

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.530 
reminding you down here with a flashing
floppy<00:06:33.040> disk<00:06:33.310> that<00:06:33.520> you<00:06:33.640> need<00:06:33.790> to<00:06:33.970> save<00:06:34.210> it<00:06:34.240> and

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
floppy disk that you need to save it and

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.930 
floppy disk that you need to save it and
then<00:06:35.290> you<00:06:35.770> go<00:06:35.950> back<00:06:36.100> here<00:06:36.310> to<00:06:36.430> the<00:06:36.490> main<00:06:36.520> screen

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
then you go back here to the main screen

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.340 
then you go back here to the main screen
and<00:06:36.970> then<00:06:37.180> you<00:06:37.300> can<00:06:37.420> give<00:06:37.570> it<00:06:37.600> a<00:06:37.750> proper<00:06:38.170> name

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
and then you can give it a proper name

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.220 
and then you can give it a proper name
by<00:06:38.680> you<00:06:39.670> know<00:06:39.760> using<00:06:40.180> the<00:06:40.270> save<00:06:40.480> dialogue<00:06:40.960> but

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
by you know using the save dialogue but

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.360 
by you know using the save dialogue but
that<00:06:41.380> doesn't<00:06:41.770> mean<00:06:41.860> that<00:06:41.890> you're<00:06:42.190> ever

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
that doesn't mean that you're ever

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.770 
that doesn't mean that you're ever
really<00:06:42.820> in<00:06:42.880> danger<00:06:43.030> of<00:06:43.270> losing<00:06:43.390> anything

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
really in danger of losing anything

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.110 
really in danger of losing anything
because<00:06:44.290> the<00:06:44.620> Edit<00:06:45.010> buffer<00:06:45.280> will<00:06:45.430> stay<00:06:45.730> until

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
because the Edit buffer will stay until

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.030 
because the Edit buffer will stay until
you<00:06:46.450> overwrite<00:06:46.900> the<00:06:47.080> Edit<00:06:47.290> buffer<00:06:47.590> by<00:06:47.710> making

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
you overwrite the Edit buffer by making

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.210 
you overwrite the Edit buffer by making
another<00:06:48.310> new<00:06:48.550> scene<00:06:48.960> in<00:06:49.960> a<00:06:50.650> related<00:06:51.040> feature

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
another new scene in a related feature

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.470 
another new scene in a related feature
that<00:06:51.430> we<00:06:51.550> have<00:06:51.580> down<00:06:51.850> here<00:06:52.060> is<00:06:52.150> called<00:06:52.180> the

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
that we have down here is called the

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.450 
that we have down here is called the
scene<00:06:52.780> freeze<00:06:53.230> because<00:06:53.560> you<00:06:53.980> can<00:06:54.160> save

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
scene freeze because you can save

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.790 
scene freeze because you can save
snapshots<00:06:55.150> you<00:06:55.270> can<00:06:55.480> return<00:06:55.780> to<00:06:56.080> so<00:06:56.290> I'm<00:06:56.410> not

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
snapshots you can return to so I'm not

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.200
