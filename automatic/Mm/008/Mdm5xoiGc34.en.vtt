00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 we only got it for the first time on 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.189
 Berlin, he was also shown on ifa 2013 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.730
 and finally now I can him 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.769
 feel is unusual in that the touchpad 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.070
 is on the other side of the keyboard 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.279
 that is, and the keyboard is on 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.020
 front end which makes it possible well to 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.949
 for example 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.740
 just clean and leave only 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.420
 keyboard if touchpad is needed 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.769
 just do it like this 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.199
 need to hold the laptop itself because 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.430
 what is he like but 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:39.059
 It is quite difficult to move in order 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.989
 was more durable as for the screen 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.300
 then here 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.899
 full hd ok with display diagonal 15 6 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.699
 everything has a very powerful iron 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.739
 the hardware here goes intel core i7 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:05.750
 well let us go in for example 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.750
 properties and see where this computer 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.340
 here goes intel core i7 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.240
 dual core with two and a half hertis 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.740
 each core 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.929
 12 gigabytes of ram and also 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.590
 here is one terabyte hard drive that is 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:27.420
 very powerful plus everything is very convenient 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.490
 that it can not be used 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.740
 Required in laptop mode 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.369
 but it can be used to 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.860
 presentations in simple tablet mode here 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.369
 such a mode, it switches and here 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.540
 so here it looks about 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.790
 Mortar pretty she looks yes 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.820
 Plus, there is a screen rotation 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.610
 there clearly defines how in which 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.650
 position is a laptop plus ko 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.000
 all the top cap is made here 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.060
 from plastic and here it is part 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.480
 metal that gives it well 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.610
 quite a stylish look by weight 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:13.310
 he is of course very heavy compared to 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.640
 3 kilos laptops here 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.150
 connector connector for sd card usb 30 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.580
 volume control power button 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.980
 for charging here 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.250
 also here is the full hd of may in my 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.090
 displayport 2 is 2 3 0 also for 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.090
 headphone 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.040
 plus everything here is long 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.250
 per round column that is very powerful 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.130
 the sound is generally like a business segment 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.250
 laptop and generally very cool that is 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.180
 any businessman have such a thing 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.340
 yourself in the office or 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.280
 or the principle of home can be used 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.269
 very comfortable that is, how is his soup with 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.709
 viewing angles everything is fine so I 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.620
 I think that let's look at the viewing angles 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.090
 the picture is not lost in general 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.730
 the last position I wanted 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.950
 would show this tablet position 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.610
 Of course, as for a tablet, he is really 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.140
 Mega heavy 3 kilograms but still 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.470
 there is a tablet mode when you can 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.830
 use well here so here that is 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.150
 very convenient when the desktop, that is 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:32.810
 all really comfortable sensor works in 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.750
 principle not bad very good 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.650
 sensor is working 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.660
 computer is very smart thanks 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.830
 latest cpu from intel and 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.500
 a lot of RAM 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.990
 all this is all i would like to say about 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.750
 this laptop 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.890
