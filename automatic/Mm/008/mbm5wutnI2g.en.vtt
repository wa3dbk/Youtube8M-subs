00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I believe that long-distance

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.890 
I believe that long-distance
relationships<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:23.009> real<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> think

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
relationships are real but do I think

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.469 
relationships are real but do I think
that<00:01:25.170> they're<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> good<00:01:25.710> idea<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.970> that

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
that they're a good idea I think that

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
that they're a good idea I think that
that<00:01:27.630> depends<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> relationship<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
that depends on the relationship and I

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.760 
that depends on the relationship and I
don't<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.700> enough<00:01:29.939> context<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:31.560> your
