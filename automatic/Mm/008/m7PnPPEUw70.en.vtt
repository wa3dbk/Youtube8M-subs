00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:28.617
I have so much to say, I leave so much unsaid.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.900
But I have debts to pay, so I just hang my head.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.150
And live that life, just to make that bread.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.150
I could do so much, I do nothing instead.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:41.085
Look at my TV, dismayed by what I see.

00:00:41.142 --> 00:00:42.492

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.240
Political idiocracy?

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.269
Gotta recognize, the oneness of you and me.

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:50.755
Human connectivity. Put faith in collectivity! 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.580
In the hardest times we go to remember to pray.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.500
Then you'll feel like, nothing can stand in your way.

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.719
You once thought your good life was contradictory.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.039
You prayed to God, and turned your crisis into victory.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.950
My old me's gone,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.700
I held the burial.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.250
This is my new faith,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.790
It's not material.

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:12.825
That sound foreign? Extraterrestrial? 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.170
It's not from this world, man it's celestial.

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:19.733
Want Change? Be it.

Old world's been devoured so,

00:01:44.073 --> 00:01:45.670
With that erased, I see God's face,

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:47.500
I see God's face in every place.

00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:49.020
Wow, wow, wow, it's not a race

00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:50.640
