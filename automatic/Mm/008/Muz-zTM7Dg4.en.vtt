I was said to go up here and grab the
ruby<00:01:35.729> red<00:01:36.110> cuz<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:37.710> look

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
ruby red cuz I think that would look

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.940 
ruby red cuz I think that would look
pretty<00:01:38.040> cool<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> inside<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.270> me<00:01:39.950> so

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:58.790 

this<00:01:49.740> looks<00:01:49.980> okay<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> guess<00:01:56.840> then<00:01:57.840> actually

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
this looks okay I guess then actually

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.400

empty<00:02:06.140> zoomed<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.530> then<00:02:07.740> we're<00:02:07.830> gonna

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
empty zoomed out and then we're gonna

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.970 
empty zoomed out and then we're gonna
turn<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.459> into<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.970> color<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:13.260> then<00:02:13.950> I
