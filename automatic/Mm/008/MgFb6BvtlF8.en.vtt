00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
I know how difficult it is to try to

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.150

find really cute flowy shorts that don't

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.260 
find really cute flowy shorts that don't
make<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.460> look<00:02:13.490> like<00:02:13.850> you're<00:02:14.000> wearing<00:02:14.090> a

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
make you look like you're wearing a

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.420 
make you look like you're wearing a
diaper<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.170> also<00:02:15.470> recommend<00:02:15.920> wearing<00:02:16.250> a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
diaper so I also recommend wearing a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.250 
diaper so I also recommend wearing a
sweater<00:02:16.790> over<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.180> because<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.690> just<00:02:17.840> makes<00:02:18.170> it

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
sweater over it because it just makes it

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.600 
sweater over it because it just makes it
look<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:18.680> much<00:02:18.800> more<00:02:18.860> tailored<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:25.190> next
