00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.170
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.860
 fourth video of an ex no life tinkering 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.619
 dedicated to water to the waters at creation 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.430
 of a fir tree a subject can not be 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.170
 more news 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.790
 normally when you buy a fir tree 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.960
 Christmas in the trade we usually have 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.400
 the little one that comes with 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.810
 in my case it comes from my land 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.460
 I had a tree that hid my view 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.169
 for several years and so I 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.540
 decided to join the useful to the pleasant 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.649
 but suddenly no foot personally 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.270
 it's plastic sells me very well 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.610
 but as you will understand it is a 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.440
 wish of my companion after putting myself 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.260
 in logging mode I'm going to create the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.510
 foot you will need for this a master 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.760
 a pencil a drill a wick dough to 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 wood about 22 mm in diameter to drill 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.839
 with wood of about 7 mm in diameter a 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.780
 target or a jigsaw a plane or 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.969
 a sander and to finish a piece of 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.859
 chevron about one meter first 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.749
 step after drinking your Christmas beer 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.039
 we did not believe that I did not 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.470
 will not talk alcohol in this video 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.110
 so we will draw on our chevron 2 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.800
 widely spaced 40 cm is cut and its 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.370
 mutations 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.560
 So here are two pieces of 40 cm 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.240
 congratulations again we would be almost jealous 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.130
 now we will draw a rectangle on 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.960
 our two pieces of wood at 15 centimeters 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.270
 on each side at half the height 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.439
 of the chevron I am not persuaded that my 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.180
 explanation are very very clear 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.560
 so I invite you to study well the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.360
 video we cut right then left and 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.189
 we arrive at the delicate part of this 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.899
 we will have to remove sludge 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.939
 little by little to free our rectangle 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.570
 it's a kind of tetris upside down the 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.310
 jigsaw 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.409
 she is very lucky will be really 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.939
 useful in this case we cut small end 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.299
 by little end and it should be well 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.680
 pass 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.240
 as you can see my finish 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.890
 is really disgusting in my heart 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.840
 my foot will be hidden in a bag so 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.250
 no importance on aesthetics if this 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.659
 is not your case I invite you to 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.009
 strongly focus during this 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.020
 step I read in several journals 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.460
 renowned scientists that turn 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.600
 alcohol allowed a rate of 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.219
 very high concentration 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.170
 so in this case do not hesitate to have 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.850
 beer with the flat wick we will 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.890
 pierce a hole of about one centimeter 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.149
 of deep these will serve that the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.289
 life it's not directly in 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.149
 contact with the ground 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.310
 if you have parquet will avoid 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.510
 laurel and you'll win a fight on 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.180
 loses this both ends of chevron and 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.920
 a forest of about 7 mm diameter 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 if you want no obligation you 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.610
 can create angles 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.620
 that's what I chose to do note 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.360
 well the direction of the cut because look 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.900
 well the big ball that I am I am 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.879
 am planted 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.340
 so I had to start all over again 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.560
 of wood do not worry I got 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.209
 copiously insulted whore but that's 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.549
 not possible to be as con but what 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.290
 big tassel species of bauchi bouzouk on 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.060
 pass suddenly sander planer for 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.560
 remove the splinters chose to screw 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.090
 which will be big enough for 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.769
 tie our two pieces of wood together 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.049
 two holes one cm deep and 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.480
 about 7 mm in diameter on each side 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.890
 of the main hole these will hide our 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.269
 screw heads that will read our two 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.010
 herringbone always for stripes 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.599
 second argue that I have you quickly 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.370
 if with that you can not conclude 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.900
 I can not do anything for you to 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.849
 finish we choose a screw that will do 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.049
 about 10 cm in length it will have to 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.790
 cross the two pieces of wood and 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.090
 can be sufficiently taken in the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.310
 fir 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.620
 we check that the cut on the end of 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.930
 fir trees and right otherwise it'll go in 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.060
 go on it screw and ada it's over 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.769
 icing on the cake you will be able to 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.120
 to serve next year just by the 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.040
 merciless flow to all for this 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.689
