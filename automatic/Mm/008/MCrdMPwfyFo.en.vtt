I<00:02:20.970> know<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.780> know<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.350> molds<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.250> Hong<00:02:23.490> Kong

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
I know I know the molds and in Hong Kong

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.400 
I know I know the molds and in Hong Kong
actually<00:02:24.090> had<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.540> metal<00:02:24.780> molds<00:02:25.050> actually

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
actually had the metal molds actually

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.880 
actually had the metal molds actually
had<00:02:25.590> these<00:02:25.770> little<00:02:26.010> pits<00:02:26.220> coming<00:02:26.580> out<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.590 
had these little pits coming out and
that's<00:02:28.890> probably<00:02:29.130> why<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.310> got<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.580> idea<00:02:29.880> last

can you run the board cool goes it to
the<00:05:44.000> didn't<00:05:44.300> see<00:05:44.420> that<00:05:44.570> it<00:05:45.350> did<00:05:45.500> a<00:05:45.530> divot

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.640

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
that's it

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.270 
that's it
look<00:05:51.830> at<00:05:51.919> that<00:05:52.070> is<00:05:52.220> that<00:05:52.370> often<00:05:54.130> there's<00:05:55.130> no

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
look at that is that often there's no

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.920 
look at that is that often there's no
thinking<00:05:55.699> there<00:05:55.910> you<00:05:56.120> just<00:05:56.270> put<00:05:56.540> that<00:05:56.570> feel

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
thinking there you just put that feel

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.490 
thinking there you just put that feel
bit<00:05:57.199> in<00:05:57.350> there<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:58.580> you're<00:05:58.759> done<00:05:59.289> that<00:06:00.289> is

bit in there and you're done that is
awesome

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.480 

so<00:06:04.200> anyways<00:06:04.500> I<00:06:04.620> got<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.890> do<00:06:04.980> this<00:06:05.160> to<00:06:05.310> all<00:06:05.340> my

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
so anyways I got to do this to all my

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.910 
so anyways I got to do this to all my
new<00:06:05.820> homes<00:06:06.140> and<00:06:07.140> I'm<00:06:07.260> not<00:06:07.440> sure<00:06:07.560> what<00:06:07.710> I<00:06:07.770> want

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
new homes and I'm not sure what I want

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.170 
new homes and I'm not sure what I want
to<00:06:07.950> call<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.310> but<00:06:08.510> okay<00:06:10.580> check<00:06:11.580> that<00:06:11.730> out

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
to call it but okay check that out

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.540 
to call it but okay check that out
let's<00:06:13.080> see<00:06:13.200> you<00:06:13.260> can<00:06:13.410> you<00:06:13.470> see<00:06:13.620> it<00:06:13.890> I<00:06:13.920> didn't

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
let's see you can you see it I didn't

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.120 
let's see you can you see it I didn't
even<00:06:14.640> cut<00:06:14.910> the<00:06:15.030> Sheep<00:06:15.330> out<00:06:15.480> yet<00:06:15.980> usually<00:06:16.980> cut

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
even cut the Sheep out yet usually cut

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.650 
even cut the Sheep out yet usually cut
the<00:06:17.220> Sheep<00:06:17.400> out<00:06:17.550> before<00:06:17.820> I<00:06:17.850> do<00:06:17.970> that<00:06:18.150> but<00:06:18.510> look

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
the Sheep out before I do that but look

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.110 
the Sheep out before I do that but look
at<00:06:18.780> those<00:06:18.870> those<00:06:19.560> nice<00:06:19.860> halls<00:06:20.190> okay

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
at those those nice halls okay

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.800 
at those those nice halls okay
now<00:06:21.540> the<00:06:21.930> trick<00:06:22.140> is<00:06:22.700> the<00:06:23.700> holes<00:06:23.880> they're<00:06:24.660> not

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
now the trick is the holes they're not

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.780 
now the trick is the holes they're not
they<00:06:25.410> should<00:06:25.440> be<00:06:25.680> pretty<00:06:25.800> Center<00:06:26.190> but

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
they should be pretty Center but

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.130 
they should be pretty Center but
remember<00:06:27.120> if<00:06:27.210> they're<00:06:27.330> a<00:06:27.360> little<00:06:27.540> tight<00:06:27.840> you

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
remember if they're a little tight you

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.230 
remember if they're a little tight you
take<00:06:28.740> the<00:06:28.890> little<00:06:29.010> bigger<00:06:31.700> 3/32<00:06:32.700> drill<00:06:32.730> make

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
take the little bigger 3/32 drill make

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.640 
take the little bigger 3/32 drill make
the<00:06:33.360> holes<00:06:33.510> a<00:06:33.600> little<00:06:33.810> bit<00:06:33.930> bigger<00:06:34.140> give<00:06:34.530> it<00:06:34.590> a

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
the holes a little bit bigger give it a

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.960 
the holes a little bit bigger give it a
little<00:06:34.740> more<00:06:34.950> room<00:06:35.160> for<00:06:35.220> those<00:06:35.460> trucks<00:06:35.760> to<00:06:35.880> get

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
little more room for those trucks to get

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.760 
little more room for those trucks to get
in<00:06:36.120> there<00:06:36.300> that's<00:06:36.840> the<00:06:36.960> trick<00:06:37.170> that<00:06:37.200> everybody

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
in there that's the trick that everybody

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.910 
in there that's the trick that everybody
does<00:06:37.980> okay<00:06:38.340> and<00:06:39.380> and<00:06:40.380> I'm<00:06:40.500> probably<00:06:40.680> going<00:06:40.860> to

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
does okay and and I'm probably going to

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.200 
does okay and and I'm probably going to
stick<00:06:41.070> that<00:06:41.130> little<00:06:41.430> drill<00:06:41.610> bit<00:06:41.790> because<00:06:42.120> I

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
stick that little drill bit because I

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.760 
stick that little drill bit because I
got<00:06:42.360> so<00:06:42.510> no<00:06:42.690> more<00:06:42.930> stick<00:06:43.170> with<00:06:43.290> have<00:06:43.410> my<00:06:43.500> drills

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
got so no more stick with have my drills

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.640 
got so no more stick with have my drills
and<00:06:44.010> so<00:06:44.940> everybody<00:06:45.300> could<00:06:45.420> have<00:06:45.570> that<00:06:45.780> but

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
and so everybody could have that but

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.610 
and so everybody could have that but
anyhow<00:06:46.880> that<00:06:47.880> I'm<00:06:48.180> excited<00:06:48.720> look<00:06:49.410> at<00:06:49.530> that

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
anyhow that I'm excited look at that

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
that's awesome so that just gets rid of

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.720 
that's awesome so that just gets rid of
that<00:06:51.810> step<00:06:52.140> so<00:06:52.170> easy<00:06:52.650> that<00:06:52.830> is<00:06:53.130> the<00:06:53.160> easy<00:06:53.400> step
