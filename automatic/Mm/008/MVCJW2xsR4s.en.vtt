facebook<00:01:46.340> he<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.460> now<00:01:47.640> adding<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.090> his

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
facebook he is now adding on his

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389 
facebook he is now adding on his
extractor<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.380> looks<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.220> bit

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
extractor and it looks like a little bit

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.069 
extractor and it looks like a little bit
of<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> delayed<00:01:50.820> extractor<00:01:51.360> from<00:01:51.540> hello<00:01:51.720> world

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079

hello<00:01:52.350> world<00:01:52.829> pool<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.700> slightly<00:01:54.090> earlier

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
hello world pool is up slightly earlier

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
hello world pool is up slightly earlier
though<00:01:55.229> bingo<00:01:55.560> bango<00:01:55.710> getting<00:01:56.100> his<00:01:56.219> pool<00:01:56.430> up

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
though bingo bango getting his pool up

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.490 
though bingo bango getting his pool up
slightly<00:01:56.969> later<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.659> bingo<00:01:57.899> bango<00:01:58.049> will<00:01:58.350> have

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
slightly later so bingo bango will have

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.030 
slightly later so bingo bango will have
the<00:01:58.649> faster<00:01:59.520> zergling<00:01:59.969> speed<00:02:00.740> hello<00:02:01.740> world

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the faster zergling speed hello world

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.160 
the faster zergling speed hello world
will<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.549> larger<00:02:03.420> zergling<00:02:03.869> numbers

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
