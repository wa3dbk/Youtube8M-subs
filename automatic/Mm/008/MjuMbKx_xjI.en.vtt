00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:30.070
 I wonder why I wanted to make something like this- 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.150
 I dropped my smartphone just bought a certain day and the screen was broken 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.900
 I'm sorry 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:40.900
 I was sad and I was crying every day 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:45.810
 No matter what you do, zexal will no longer occur 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.820
 I have run away to my favorite cat I bought 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:53.150
 That's why 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.150
 It is why I thought I would make a strong smart phone case to fall 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.930
 is 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:10.540
 At first we tried to start from breaking 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.670
 Though it is to collect a lot of data 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.070
 I tried to break hundreds of thousands of smartphones in various ways 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.920
 as a result 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:27.860
 Well it depends on the model of the smartphone, but about 1.76 meter entangled fall 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.860
 That the smartphone screen of corruption in was found 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:39.720
 It is a car air bag if it is said to cushion the shock 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.720
 You started developing with that as a hint 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:49.210
 It was the work of from scratch in real 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.210
 Material selection was also important for the size of the article 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:06.840
 It did not work even if it 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.840
 Even if it is dropped, the screen is broken even though it does not open or it is open 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.660
 The timing was important 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.660
 It was not the Itteyuu thing if you open Well 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.490
 But the tips were surprisingly close to me 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:32.710
 Though it is car called n wagon 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.710
 There are six airbags for all the seats in front and back of the seat 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:41.270
 I wondered if it should be developed with this as a hint. 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.650
 I was really happy 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.010
 Here you will 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:52.910
 I can be inflated with compressed carbon dioxide 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:57.430
 Detecting a lacquer with an acceleration sensor attached to this 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:01.109
 It has a mechanism to send and open gas to the six here 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.109
 In the meantime it is 0.2 seconds 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.160
 Let's go once 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.550
 Hmm 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.880
 goo 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.000
 5 minutes 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.310
 can not 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.310
 me 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.310
 Hmm 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.150
 goo 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.959
 Hmm 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.959
 goo 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.799
 Hmm 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.799
 stella 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.790
 Succeeded
