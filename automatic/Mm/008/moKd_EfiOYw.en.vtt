 coming from madrid 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.100
 we have lowered the lever as it always is 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.140
 in short, we realized that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.470
 indications were not the usual ones that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.330
 we expected that moment we have 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.450
 waited to be sure that 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.450
 the automatic system did not provide 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.940
 then to extend the cart and then 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.730
 we interrupted the descent of course 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.060
 we could not continue towards the track 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.730
 we have taken back so much power to the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.600
 engines alerted the control tower is 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.190
 started to perform the procedures 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.900
 alternative emergency for failure

 lowering of the carriage 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.530
 we have taken land and sincerely 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.360
 feeling was reassuring because 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.850
 Rome has behaved very well 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.180
 he remained under control even when 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.210
 the wing is lowered and the plane is yes 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.630
 is resting on the engine there 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.190
 have been in the noises or jolts the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.270
 rule was simply slightly 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:06.560
 tilted to one side and continued his 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.910
 race on the track without jolting us either 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.860
 I was the first officer 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.570
 perfectly unharmed we did not have any 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.370
 fire sign inside the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.840
 instrumental indications 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.820
 I heard passengers cheering 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.970
 so I realized that even behind the 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.260
 situation was was positive and then 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.230
 we opened the windows for 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.519
 also check outside with what 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.980
 our eyes what was happening 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.470
 we have seen the rescue vehicles already in 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.019
 action immediately intervened 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.959
 firefighters were spraying disks 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.480
 the aircraft bellow to prevent a 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.730
 Possible possibility then winning there 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.340
 it was a great relief 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.060
 in those moments 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.090
 one does not think of what one knows 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.769
 what one lives in life and therefore 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.010
 when you then dive into the life of 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:59.110
 they come back every day and come back 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:02.190
 those images return the voices of the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.799
 I could not return passengers though 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.230
 as how one knew how to manage in those 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.890
 moments with coldness 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.010
 the emergency even more so in life 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.610
 something more to be able to stay 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.650
 serene of what was done on 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.660
 his mark we did what 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.670
 we had to do 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.190
 I tell you a little episode of one 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.860
 passing that young man who took me 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.879
 hands and asked me why you are 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.769
 so quiet and I answered why 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.690
 we can't make it worry 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.080
 everything good 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.880
 don't worry Friday morning for the 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.010
 first time then the national body for 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.510
 civil aviation delivered one 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.060
 recognition plaque and two officers 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.770
 and four flight attendants also for 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.270
 to reward the Italian style e 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.980
 the excellence of civil aviation 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.170
 Italian as stated by the 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.480
 extraordinary commissioner enac vito 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.160
 riggio present at the ceremony together 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.810
 to the general manager enac alessio 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.180
 forty and the deputy general manager 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.400
 blessed marasÃ  the deputy director 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.750
 general alitalia giancarlo schisano in 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.940
 flight operations manager of the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.070
 roberto germano company was that one 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.100
 weight and we thought of it as in general 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.350
 on the incidents there is then an investigation by 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.930
 part of the national security agency 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.870
 flight that must be impartial also 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.480
 from enac it becomes difficult to say 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.940
 intervene during the investigation this 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.700
 time it seemed to us that the dynamics of the 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.260
 facts were so obvious that he deserved 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.220
 a recognition from us and 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.440
 so we did it 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.360
 I think that for once I emphasize that 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.190
 our country is also very large 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.960
 resources of professionalism and humanity 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.070
 good for the heart and therefore in short 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.070
 we did it with the choir
