00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.910

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.740
 the huacal and the rump if they can not 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.850
 make the pieces that are of their greatest 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.050
 liking 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.400
 We're going to need two banana leaves 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.510
 two cups of water two broad peppers eight 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.949
 guajillo chiles 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.949
 avocado leaves 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.680
 garlic clove half onion 2 peppers 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:59.070
 fat a nail salt and oil the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.940
 necessary to accompany we are going to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.379
 need nopales and a steamer to 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.250
 Cook 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.130
 I'll clean the chicken and I'll go 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.259
 to search 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.030
 I'm going to remove the feathers and I'm going to 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.610
 go through the fire to burn the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.060
 hairs that he brings I will not take away the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.960
 skin because this is going to give it a good flavor 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.790
 the chile I'm going to remove the little leg what 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.920
 I'm going to open 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.100
 and I'm going to take out the seed and oats 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.590
 since I took all the seed and the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:41.619
 oatmeal I will fry them in little oil 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.729
 and I'm going to put some oil for it 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.729
 fry the chiles 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.700
 since it's hot 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.200
 I'll put chilli good my 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.520
 oil is already hot now I'm going to 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.520
 fry the chiles 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.770
 I'm going to give you back 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.959
 so they do not burn because I have 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.130
 repeated several times if it 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.590
 burn bitter 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.320
 good in the same oil where I believed the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.720
 chilies I'll fry the garlic clove the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.910
 half onion the two peppers and the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.110
 I nail here already in the glass of the blender 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.080
 I put the chiles to fry 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.930
 onion the two fat peppers and the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.290
 I nail the clove of garlic I will add 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.340
 a little water and I'm going to grind it 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.630
 that is fast good good my chicken 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.630
 I'm going to add salt 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.750
 so that it will grab the taste of 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.630
 salt if not it will not be very simple 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.190
 because the chile that mill adds 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.600
 Salt 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.230
 I'm going to spin it 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.710
 so that salt is well integrated into 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.430
 pieces of chicken good to the chicken already 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.280
 I put the salt 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.900
 do not let stand 5 minutes now I'm going to 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.900
 add the chile that mole 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.560
 I will incorporate it well 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.560
 I will not put in the fridge for half an hour 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:33.330
 while navy 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:38.550
 now in our comal over low heat 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.550
 let's make the banana leaves 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.010
 if we are going to see how it is changing 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.010
 colour 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.159
 now we are going to give a turn 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.590
 this is to make them soften 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.590
 and the flavor of the leaf comes out more 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.650
 although as a color change and it 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.650
 softened 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.900
 if we see that the banana leaf brings 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.970
 this strip that is a little thicker is 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.070
 we remove it 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.180
 because if not, it will not soften 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.570
 correctly the sheet 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.870
 I saw myself 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.720
 well now my steamer I will add 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.630
 what I 'm left with water and I'm going to 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.570
 check 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.270
 that the water does not rise to the grid if 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.160
 lack you can add a little more but 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.010
 you should not raise the water here to the 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.129
 grate because as it was in case it remains 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.369
 very high water 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.210
 will keep the chicken and will not go out 

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:55.090
 dry 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.250
 if they did not have a steamer they can 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.830
 do also in the express pot is the 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.620
 same process nothing more than less time 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.030
 in the express pot would be approximately 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.780
 a half hour and here is an hour now 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.660
 I'm going to place the banana leaf 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.320
 in this way I am going to broadcast it here 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.320
 down like this 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.900
 and I'm going to leave it like that 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.920
 and I will go accommodating 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.080
 the chicken 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.240
 I'll put 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.910
 one piece 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.110
 A) Yes 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:40.850
 another piece like that 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.920
 I'm going to put all whole nopales because 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:47.530
 as they are of the small ones it has no case 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.530
 that chop them this is to accompany 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.260
 but then here sewn in the same flesh 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.750
 and the chili then imagine how they are going to 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.420
 stay 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.910
 I will also add 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:05.200
 avocado leaves 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:07.620
 like I'm going to make another chicken bed like this 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.280
 up to the end 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.290
 as giacomo of everything as it should be 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.009
 now with what I'm left of the sheet the 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.479
 I'm going to cover 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.479
 like giving him here 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.400
 and with the help of another piece I'm going to 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:29.770
 make another lid 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.770
 so that the temperature is well preserved 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.160
 and have the right knowledge 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.639
 well I put it in the fire 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:41.479
 I'm going to cover it up and when I take it out 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.879
 steam 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.639
 I'm going to lower the temperature to 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.740
 medium 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.449
 good as you will see the 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.460
 smoke 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.460
 I'm going to cover it again and I'm going to lower it 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.700
 at medium heat there I'll leave it for a 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.790
 hour 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.730
 well now yes here is our chicken 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:05.090
 I wait for barbecue and they have been 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.830
