00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
have now where the the most affordable

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.020 
have now where the the most affordable
food<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.620> least<00:02:25.830> healthy<00:02:26.100> food<00:02:26.520> for<00:02:26.880> us

and the challenge in the next generation
is<00:04:06.770> how<00:04:06.980> do<00:04:07.040> we<00:04:07.160> make<00:04:07.450> cheap<00:04:08.450> healthy<00:04:08.870> food

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
is how do we make cheap healthy food

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.250 
is how do we make cheap healthy food

well<00:05:10.100> it<00:05:10.310> does<00:05:10.790> look<00:05:10.820> like<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.360> farm<00:05:11.600> bill

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
well it does look like the farm bill

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.990 
well it does look like the farm bill
isn't<00:05:12.140> gonna<00:05:12.530> feature<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.370> lot<00:05:13.580> of<00:05:13.730> change

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
isn't gonna feature a lot of change

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.520 
isn't gonna feature a lot of change
although<00:05:14.240> there<00:05:14.510> is<00:05:14.780> movement<00:05:15.050> in<00:05:15.290> the<00:05:15.410> right

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
although there is movement in the right

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
direction are you going to continue your

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.100 
direction are you going to continue your
quest<00:05:19.580> sort<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:20.030> to<00:05:20.150> educate<00:05:20.570> people<00:05:20.720> to<00:05:20.900> where

very<00:05:25.100> much<00:05:25.310> so<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.550> mean<00:05:25.880> changing<00:05:26.390> the<00:05:26.419> farm

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
very much so I mean changing the farm

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.500 
very much so I mean changing the farm
bill<00:05:26.900> is<00:05:27.050> a<00:05:27.080> very<00:05:27.320> slow<00:05:27.800> process<00:05:28.370> but<00:05:29.090> it<00:05:29.240> when

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
bill is a very slow process but it when

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.300 
bill is a very slow process but it when
it<00:05:29.630> changes<00:05:29.660> it<00:05:30.260> will<00:05:30.380> be<00:05:30.530> an<00:05:30.680> incredibly

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
it changes it will be an incredibly

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.790 
it changes it will be an incredibly
powerful<00:05:31.610> thing<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:32.419> the<00:05:33.200> writing<00:05:33.500> is<00:05:33.620> on<00:05:33.740> the

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
powerful thing and the writing is on the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.380 
powerful thing and the writing is on the
wall<00:05:33.919> that<00:05:34.100> that<00:05:34.490> will<00:05:34.640> happen<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.150> whether

wall that that will happen and whether

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.330 
wall that that will happen and whether
it's<00:05:35.600> this<00:05:35.810> year<00:05:36.140> or<00:05:36.169> four<00:05:36.800> or<00:05:36.890> five<00:05:37.040> years

it's this year or four or five years
from<00:05:37.460> now<00:05:37.550> it's<00:05:38.210> going<00:05:38.450> to<00:05:38.540> happen

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
from now it's going to happen

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.170 
from now it's going to happen
we<00:05:40.500> have<00:05:40.710> policies<00:05:40.949> in<00:05:41.220> place<00:05:41.430> now<00:05:41.759> that<00:05:42.060> are

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
we have policies in place now that are

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.779 
we have policies in place now that are
based<00:05:42.629> on<00:05:42.870> a<00:05:42.900> perceived<00:05:43.680> scarcity<00:05:43.949> that<00:05:44.580> just

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
based on a perceived scarcity that just

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.240 
based on a perceived scarcity that just
doesn't<00:05:45.120> exist<00:05:45.210> and<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.800> new<00:05:46.949> kind<00:05:47.220> of

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
of this time which are an obesity

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.260 
of this time which are an obesity
epidemic<00:05:52.919> rather<00:05:53.639> than<00:05:53.849> a<00:05:53.940> Great<00:05:54.120> Depression

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
can to help that kind of change come

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:10.969 
can to help that kind of change come
into<00:06:02.129> being<00:06:09.169> good<00:06:10.169> thing<00:06:10.349> is<00:06:10.470> these<00:06:10.650> don't

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
into being good thing is these don't
