mining<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> shiny<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.730> I've<00:00:32.850> wanted<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
mining is a shiny that I've wanted for a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.630 
mining is a shiny that I've wanted for a
very<00:00:34.290> long<00:00:35.130> time<00:00:36.260> let's<00:00:37.260> start<00:00:38.250> knocking<00:00:38.550> out

very long time let's start knocking out
some<00:00:38.850> mine<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.660> he's<00:00:39.899> right<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
some mine in here he's right in the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.950 
some mine in here he's right in the
middle<00:00:40.829> there<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> we're<00:00:42.329> gonna<00:00:42.420> start<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.840> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
here might mention that I used a little

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.240 
here might mention that I used a little
trick<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.329> think<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.350> shiny<00:01:52.619> mine<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.100> this

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
trick I think to get shiny mine in this

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.719 
trick I think to get shiny mine in this
quickly

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
quickly

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.440 
quickly
normally<00:01:54.420> mining<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.960> only<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> 30%<00:01:55.799> horde<00:01:56.450> on

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
normally mining is only the 30% horde on

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.730 
normally mining is only the 30% horde on
this<00:01:57.750> route<00:01:58.049> usually<00:01:59.090> Magnemite<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:01.200> 60%

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
this route usually Magnemite is the 60%

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.270 
this route usually Magnemite is the 60%
horde<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.569> let<00:02:03.899> off<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.380> static

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
horde but I let off with a static

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.339 
horde but I let off with a static
Pokemon<00:02:05.789> which<00:02:06.000> makes<00:02:06.299> electric<00:02:07.049> types

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
Pokemon which makes electric types

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.469 
Pokemon which makes electric types
appear<00:02:07.649> more<00:02:07.799> frequently<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.209> use

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
appear more frequently and then use

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.089 
appear more frequently and then use
sweet<00:02:10.049> scent<00:02:10.410> which<00:02:11.099> means<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:13.099> guess

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
sweet scent which means that I guess

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.650 
sweet scent which means that I guess
electric<00:02:14.489> types<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:14.910> more<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.239> chance<00:02:15.450> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
electric types have more of a chance to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.420 
electric types have more of a chance to
appear<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.829> think<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:18.140> kind<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.430> helps

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
appear and I think that kind of helps

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.650 
appear and I think that kind of helps
down<00:02:20.700> my<00:02:20.880> odds<00:02:21.060> here<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.569> think<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:23.660> mining

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
down my odds here I think the mining

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.580 
down my odds here I think the mining
horse<00:02:24.959> became<00:02:25.319> more<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.880> 50%<00:02:26.880> or<00:02:27.120> more

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
horse became more like a 50% or more

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.330 
horse became more like a 50% or more
