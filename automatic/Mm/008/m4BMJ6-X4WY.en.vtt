00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
together my favorite class in the summer

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.969 
together my favorite class in the summer
program<00:02:05.900> was<00:02:06.470> probably<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.670> men's<00:02:07.880> class<00:02:08.240> I

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
program was probably the men's class I

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.950
