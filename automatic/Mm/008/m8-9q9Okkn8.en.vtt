scribbling and so forth but there are
lots<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.149> different<00:00:33.510> ways<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.780> judging<00:00:33.989> skill

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
lots of different ways of judging skill

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.520 
lots of different ways of judging skill
and<00:00:35.090> that<00:00:36.090> certain<00:00:36.720> kinds<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.140> things<00:00:37.200> even

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
and that certain kinds of things even

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.260 
and that certain kinds of things even
very<00:00:37.829> simple<00:00:38.040> sorts<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.640> things<00:00:38.880> can<00:00:39.090> have

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
very simple sorts of things can have

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.920 
very simple sorts of things can have
amazing<00:00:40.340> degrees<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.579> skill<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
amazing degrees of skill and it's a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.060 
amazing degrees of skill and it's a
question<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.410> whether<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.649> want<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.860> throw

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
question of whether you want to throw

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.610 
question of whether you want to throw
yourself<00:00:44.489> into<00:00:45.469> understanding<00:00:46.469> those

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
yourself into understanding those

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.410 
yourself into understanding those
different<00:00:47.040> degrees<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> skill<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.210> just

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
different degrees of skill so just

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.959 
different degrees of skill so just
because<00:00:48.540> something<00:00:48.899> looks<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.969> something

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
because something looks like something

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.660 
because something looks like something
very<00:00:51.149> easy<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> scribble<00:00:53.100> it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
very easy to do like a scribble it

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.860 
very easy to do like a scribble it
doesn't<00:00:54.030> necessarily<00:00:54.480> mean<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.690> all

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
doesn't necessarily mean that all

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.740 
doesn't necessarily mean that all
scribbles<00:00:55.500> are<00:00:55.680> alike<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:57.510> not

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
scribbles are alike and that that's not

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.229 
scribbles are alike and that that's not
actually<00:00:58.050> such<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> crazy<00:00:59.160> thing<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.610> say<00:00:59.820> you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
actually such a crazy thing to say you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
actually such a crazy thing to say you
know<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.510> are<00:01:00.600> writers<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:01.230> instance<00:01:01.530> who

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
know there are writers for instance who

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.069 
know there are writers for instance who
can<00:01:02.070> write<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.340> very<00:01:02.550> simple<00:01:02.910> style<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.510> some

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
can write in very simple style and some

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:05.989 
can write in very simple style and some
of<00:01:04.229> those<00:01:04.289> sentences<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:05.159> actually<00:01:05.670> just

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:05.999 
of those sentences are actually just

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.300 
of those sentences are actually just
really<00:01:06.329> simple<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.840> dull<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.499> then<00:01:08.100> there

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
really simple but dull and then there

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.459 
really simple but dull and then there
are<00:01:08.369> Hemingway's<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.209> or<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.899> should<00:01:10.319> say

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
are Hemingway's and or I should say

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.739 
are Hemingway's and or I should say
there<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.859> Hemingway<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.329> very<00:01:12.509> notion

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:12.749 
there is Hemingway and the very notion

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:15.230 
there is Hemingway and the very notion
of<00:01:12.959> simplicity<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.829> declarative<00:01:14.459> sentence<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
of simplicity a declarative sentence you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.109 
of simplicity a declarative sentence you
know<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.079> hand<00:01:16.649> it's<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.549> nothing<00:01:17.999> and

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
know in one hand it's it's nothing and

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.470 
know in one hand it's it's nothing and
in<00:01:18.240> another<00:01:18.389> hand<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.869> art

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
in another hand it's art

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.720 
in another hand it's art
I<00:01:20.590> think<00:01:21.590> it's<00:01:21.710> actually<00:01:21.890> good<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.550> there

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
I think it's actually good that there

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.670 
I think it's actually good that there
isn't<00:01:22.850> what<00:01:23.120> you'd<00:01:23.270> call<00:01:23.450> strict<00:01:23.870> standards

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
isn't what you'd call strict standards

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.490 
isn't what you'd call strict standards
for<00:01:25.250> art<00:01:25.790> there's<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:26.180> specific<00:01:26.750> thing<00:01:27.110> art

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
for art there's a specific thing art

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.170 
for art there's a specific thing art
must<00:01:27.770> be<00:01:28.040> you<00:01:28.250> know<00:01:28.370> that's<00:01:28.580> in<00:01:28.820> fact<00:01:29.000> what

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
must be you know that's in fact what

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.060 
must be you know that's in fact what
there<00:01:29.630> used<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.960> be<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.290> French<00:01:30.530> created<00:01:30.980> it

there used to be the French created it

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.070 
there used to be the French created it
in<00:01:31.190> fact<00:01:31.370> an<00:01:31.520> academy<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.090> create<00:01:32.510> standards

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
in fact an academy to create standards

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.480 
in fact an academy to create standards
for<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.380> way<00:01:33.470> people<00:01:33.500> were<00:01:33.890> supposed<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.250> draw

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
for the way people were supposed to draw

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.220 
for the way people were supposed to draw
in<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.210> was<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.420> breakdown<00:01:35.960> of<00:01:35.990> that

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
in and it was the breakdown of that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.680 
in and it was the breakdown of that
Academy<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.100> very<00:01:37.340> idea<00:01:38.120> that<00:01:38.180> artists

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
Academy the the very idea that artists

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.840 
Academy the the very idea that artists
had<00:01:38.900> in<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.200> 19th<00:01:39.560> century<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.160> know<00:01:40.280> the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
had in the 19th century you know the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.150 
had in the 19th century you know the
Impressionists<00:01:41.480> and<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:41.900> on<00:01:42.080> that<00:01:42.740> those

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
Impressionists and so on that those

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.450 
Impressionists and so on that those
standards<00:01:43.880> were<00:01:44.270> not<00:01:44.860> enough<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:46.310> there

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
standards were not enough that there

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.220 
standards were not enough that there
were<00:01:46.550> other<00:01:46.700> ways<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:47.180> being<00:01:47.240> expressive<00:01:48.110> and

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
were other ways of being expressive and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.590 
were other ways of being expressive and
creative<00:01:48.290> that<00:01:49.220> opened<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.940> world<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.420> modern

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
creative that opened a world of modern

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.520 
creative that opened a world of modern
art<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.560> West<00:01:52.660> so<00:01:53.660> I<00:01:53.690> like<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.500> idea

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
art and in the West so I like the idea

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.230 
art and in the West so I like the idea
in<00:01:54.980> a<00:01:55.040> certain<00:01:55.280> sense<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.700> standards<00:01:56.210> are

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
in a certain sense that standards are

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.540 
in a certain sense that standards are
not<00:01:56.450> one<00:01:56.660> thing<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.530> doesn't<00:01:58.190> mean<00:01:58.400> there

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
not one thing that doesn't mean there

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.000 
not one thing that doesn't mean there
are<00:01:58.670> no<00:01:59.030> standards<00:01:59.720> it<00:02:00.260> means<00:02:00.620> that<00:02:00.830> there

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
are no standards it means that there

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.650 
are no standards it means that there
isn't<00:02:01.280> there<00:02:01.700> aren't<00:02:01.880> standards<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.450> are

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.560 
isn't there aren't standards that are
fixed<00:02:03.230> never<00:02:04.190> changing<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.850> everybody<00:02:05.330> has

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
fixed never changing that everybody has

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.570 
fixed never changing that everybody has
to<00:02:05.600> agree<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:06.440> them<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:07.010> think<00:02:07.220> that's<00:02:07.400> a

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
to agree to them and I think that's a

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.600 
to agree to them and I think that's a
key<00:02:07.760> point<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.210> that<00:02:09.080> art<00:02:09.440> like<00:02:09.710> all<00:02:09.980> true

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
key point to that art like all true

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.130 
key point to that art like all true
culture<00:02:11.120> isn't<00:02:11.900> about<00:02:12.190> utter<00:02:13.190> agreement<00:02:14.140> math

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
culture isn't about utter agreement math

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.170 
culture isn't about utter agreement math
maybe<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:16.340> know<00:02:16.460> two<00:02:16.520> plus<00:02:16.820> two<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.120> just

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
maybe you know two plus two is just

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.240 
maybe you know two plus two is just
gotta<00:02:17.570> equal<00:02:18.020> four<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.620> got<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.130> know

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
gotta equal four and we got to you know

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.400 
gotta equal four and we got to you know
start<00:02:19.640> with<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.780> culture<00:02:21.290> is

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
start with that but culture is

start with that but culture is

can hate prisons I can't imagine why you

could but you have that right it's

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.250 
could but you have that right it's

yourself why you have the standards you
do<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.900> what<00:02:39.380> their<00:02:39.590> implications<00:02:40.250> are<00:02:40.430> and

more<00:02:50.870> I've<00:02:51.050> done<00:02:51.340> my<00:02:52.340> job<00:02:52.610> which<00:02:52.820> is<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.000> look

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
more I've done my job which is to look

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.090 
more I've done my job which is to look
at<00:02:53.450> art<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.780> more<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.020> have<00:02:54.410> found<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.890> that

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
at art the more I have found that that

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.490 
at art the more I have found that that
the<00:02:55.280> penny<00:02:55.580> will<00:02:55.820> drop<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.930> other<00:02:57.110> words<00:02:57.320> there

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
the penny will drop in other words there

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.600 
the penny will drop in other words there
will<00:02:57.560> be<00:02:57.620> an<00:02:57.739> artist<00:02:58.040> whose<00:02:58.250> work<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.580> just

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
will be an artist whose work I just

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.150 
will be an artist whose work I just
never<00:02:58.880> got<00:02:59.120> who<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.390> think<00:02:59.660> oh<00:02:59.870> now<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.709> see

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
never got who I think oh now I see

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.520 
never got who I think oh now I see
that's<00:03:01.550> okay<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.870> think<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.260> inclination

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
that's okay and I think the inclination

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.900 
that's okay and I think the inclination
of<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.950> lot<00:03:04.130> of<00:03:04.340> people<00:03:04.640> when<00:03:04.760> they're

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
of a lot of people when they're

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.390 
of a lot of people when they're
approaching<00:03:05.330> art<00:03:05.510> is<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:06.500> be<00:03:06.650> very<00:03:06.830> skeptical

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
approaching art is to be very skeptical

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.010 
approaching art is to be very skeptical
to<00:03:07.700> feel<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.209> wolves<00:03:08.480> being<00:03:08.660> pulled<00:03:08.900> over

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
to feel the wolves being pulled over

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.690 
to feel the wolves being pulled over
their<00:03:09.260> eyes<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.800> unless<00:03:10.400> they're

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
their eyes and that unless they're

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.100 
their eyes and that unless they're
really<00:03:10.730> just<00:03:11.150> going<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.360> get<00:03:11.570> it<00:03:11.690> instantly

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
really just going to get it instantly

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.580 
really just going to get it instantly
that<00:03:12.380> probably<00:03:12.830> it's<00:03:13.280> not<00:03:13.400> okay<00:03:14.440> once<00:03:15.440> you

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
that probably it's not okay once you

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.140 
that probably it's not okay once you
move<00:03:15.739> away<00:03:15.830> from<00:03:15.920> commonly<00:03:16.700> accepted

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
move away from commonly accepted

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.449 
move away from commonly accepted
standards<00:03:17.630> then<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.500> move<00:03:18.709> towards<00:03:19.100> some

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
standards then you move towards some

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.340 
standards then you move towards some
other<00:03:19.910> standards<00:03:20.510> which<00:03:20.780> have<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:21.260> be

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
other standards which have to be

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.530 
other standards which have to be
understood<00:03:21.739> by<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.950> group<00:03:22.220> of<00:03:22.370> people<00:03:22.760> as<00:03:22.970> the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
understood by a group of people as the

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.680 
understood by a group of people as the
patrons<00:03:24.020> for<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.280> new<00:03:25.489> kind<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.850> art<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:26.630> you

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
patrons for this new kind of art so you

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.270 
patrons for this new kind of art so you
immediately<00:03:26.930> have<00:03:27.350> an<00:03:27.440> inside<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:27.860> outside

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
immediately have an inside and outside

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.240 
immediately have an inside and outside
group<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.959> majority<00:03:30.440> has<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.799> be<00:03:30.920> outside

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
group and the majority has to be outside

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.620 
group and the majority has to be outside
otherwise<00:03:31.489> there's<00:03:31.970> nothing<00:03:32.120> particularly

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
otherwise there's nothing particularly

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.910 
otherwise there's nothing particularly
cool<00:03:32.870> about<00:03:33.109> being<00:03:33.170> inside

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
cool about being inside

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.530 
cool about being inside
it's<00:03:34.280> just<00:03:34.550> in<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.730> nature<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:35.060> things<00:03:35.150> and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
it's just in the nature of things and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.020 
it's just in the nature of things and
finally<00:03:36.500> when<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.709> move<00:03:37.010> towards<00:03:37.400> an<00:03:37.550> arse

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
finally when you move towards an arse

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.380 
finally when you move towards an arse
that<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:39.020> so<00:03:39.760> inside<00:03:41.830> then<00:03:42.830> you<00:03:43.670> create<00:03:44.360> a

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
that is so inside then you create a

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.589 
that is so inside then you create a
situation<00:03:45.140> in<00:03:45.380> which<00:03:45.610> only<00:03:46.610> those<00:03:47.120> people<00:03:47.390> who

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
situation in which only those people who

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.229 
situation in which only those people who
declare<00:03:48.200> themselves<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:49.160> be<00:03:49.280> experts<00:03:49.849> are

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
declare themselves to be experts are

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.690 
declare themselves to be experts are
allowed<00:03:51.020> essentially<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:51.980> tell<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.459> whether

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
allowed essentially to tell you whether

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.270 
allowed essentially to tell you whether
