what this thing gives you on a folder
the<00:00:53.219> weakest<00:00:53.640> part<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.149> folder<00:00:54.629> when<00:00:54.989> you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the weakest part of a folder when you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410 
the weakest part of a folder when you
compare<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.860> fixed<00:00:56.250> blade<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:57.120> course

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
compare it to a fixed blade is of course

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.729 
compare it to a fixed blade is of course
the<00:00:58.379> pivot<00:00:58.770> area<00:00:59.100> that's<00:01:00.530> that's<00:01:01.530> the

the pivot area that's that's the

the pivot area that's that's the
weakness<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.309> folders<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.629> pivot<00:01:04.049> it's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
weakness of folders is the pivot it's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.010 
weakness of folders is the pivot it's
never<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:05.100> strong<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> good<00:01:06.210> fixed<00:01:06.600> plate<00:01:06.780> no

matter how good the folder I don't care

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.210 
matter how good the folder I don't care
if<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.270> Strider<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:10.040> whatever<00:01:12.170> they

if it's a Strider or whatever they

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.370 
if it's a Strider or whatever they
beefed<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.729> pivot<00:01:14.939> area<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.840> by

beefed up the pivot area on this by

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.440 
beefed up the pivot area on this by
giving<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.009> four<00:01:17.610> millimeter<00:01:17.850> blade

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.580 
giving it a four millimeter blade
thickness<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.860> an<00:01:20.750> extra<00:01:21.750> large<00:01:21.990> pivot

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590

thickness here an extra large pivot
screw<00:01:23.450> it's<00:01:24.450> bigger<00:01:24.780> than<00:01:25.020> any<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.310> other

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
screw it's bigger than any of the other

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.890 
screw it's bigger than any of the other
spriter<00:01:27.960> codes<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:29.780> compared<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
spriter codes that I have compared it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.990 
spriter codes that I have compared it
real<00:01:31.079> quick<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.619> paramilitary<00:01:32.549> screw

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
real quick to the paramilitary screw

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600 
real quick to the paramilitary screw
they<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> same<00:01:33.780> size<00:01:34.110> clip<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.430> can

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
they have the same size clip so you can

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.210 
they have the same size clip so you can
see<00:01:35.909> by<00:01:36.750> how<00:01:36.930> much<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.320> fills<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.770> hole<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
see by how much it fills the hole in the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.499 
see by how much it fills the hole in the
clip<00:01:39.320> that's<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:40.740> bigger<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.119> took<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
clip that's a lot bigger and I took it

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.660 
clip that's a lot bigger and I took it
apart<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> shaft<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> screw<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
apart and the shaft of the screw is

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.850 
apart and the shaft of the screw is
bigger<00:01:44.939> also<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.960> nested

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
bigger also so then then this nested

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.210 
bigger also so then then this nested
liners<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.259> goes<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.829> make<00:01:53.009> this

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
liners and all that goes to make this

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.370 
liners and all that goes to make this
pivot<00:01:53.820> area<00:01:54.200> very<00:01:55.200> strong<00:01:55.740> very<00:01:56.280> solid<00:01:57.320> for<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
pivot area very strong very solid for a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.560 
pivot area very strong very solid for a
folder<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:59.130> course<00:01:59.820> it's<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.180> gonna<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.509> as

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
folder of course it's not gonna be as

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.020 
folder of course it's not gonna be as
strong<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> fixed<00:02:01.350> plate<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.790> comes

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
strong as a fixed plate but it comes

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.700 
strong as a fixed plate but it comes
about<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.420> close<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:04.680> I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
about as close as you can get now I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.789 
about as close as you can get now I
imagine<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.369> Strider<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.149> also<00:02:07.140> very<00:02:07.380> strong

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
imagine a Strider is also very strong

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.330 
imagine a Strider is also very strong
being<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> frame<00:02:08.640> lock<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:10.129> Striders<00:02:11.129> are

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
being a frame lock and Striders are

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.680 
being a frame lock and Striders are
known<00:02:11.489> for<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.849> strength

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
known for this strength

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.200 
known for this strength
but<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.110> about<00:02:16.710> one<00:02:17.250> third<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.610> price<00:02:17.970> of

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
but this is about one third the price of

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.830 
but this is about one third the price of
a<00:02:18.300> straighter

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
a straighter

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.420 
a straighter
and<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:19.860> pretty<00:02:20.430> strong<00:02:21.110> pivot<00:02:22.110> area

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
and you get pretty strong pivot area

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.730 
and you get pretty strong pivot area
also<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.300> get<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.720> titanium<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
also you can get it in titanium with the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.830 
also you can get it in titanium with the
frame<00:02:25.980> lock<00:02:26.250> which<00:02:26.760> might<00:02:27.060> be<00:02:27.210> even<00:02:27.510> stronger

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
frame lock which might be even stronger

than this but this lock works at some
very<00:02:31.320> strong<00:02:31.680> spring<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:33.720> can<00:02:33.900> see<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.350> I

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
very strong spring and you can see as I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:43.030 
very strong spring and you can see as I
do<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:39.350> snaps<00:02:40.350> right<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.950> halfway<00:02:41.160> point

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
do this snaps right to the halfway point

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.590 
do this snaps right to the halfway point
right<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.070> there<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.700> halfway<00:02:44.880> point<00:02:45.120> so

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
right in there to the halfway point so

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.720 
right in there to the halfway point so
you<00:02:45.720> got<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> nice<00:02:46.140> solid<00:02:46.470> lock<00:02:46.860> up<00:02:49.730> really

strong spring works real good and the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.080 
strong spring works real good and the

serious<00:05:04.280> reach<00:05:04.550> there<00:05:06.490> but<00:05:07.570> it's<00:05:08.570> probably

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
serious reach there but it's probably

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.560 
serious reach there but it's probably
illegal<00:05:09.230> in<00:05:09.590> many<00:05:09.920> states<00:05:10.370> because<00:05:11.120> it's<00:05:11.300> over

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
illegal in many states because it's over

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.250

that<00:05:11.750> three<00:05:12.080> inch<00:05:12.230> mark<00:05:13.120> but<00:05:14.120> it's<00:05:14.300> if<00:05:14.720> you<00:05:15.050> can

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260

a little smoother than when I got it but

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.900 
a little smoother than when I got it but
it<00:05:58.520> didn't<00:05:58.820> scratch<00:05:59.090> it<00:05:59.480> wasn't<00:05:59.810> scratchy

anything<00:06:01.910> when<00:06:02.060> I<00:06:02.090> got<00:06:02.390> it<00:06:02.540> either<00:06:04.210> so<00:06:05.590> very

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
anything when I got it either so very

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.439

very<00:06:06.830> nice

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.339 

I<00:06:11.539> like<00:06:12.199> the<00:06:12.409> oversized<00:06:12.860> pivot<00:06:13.129> screw<00:06:13.460> I<00:06:14.349> think

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
I like the oversized pivot screw I think

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.350 
I like the oversized pivot screw I think
that<00:06:15.529> does<00:06:15.770> add<00:06:16.009> to<00:06:16.279> it<00:06:16.430> and<00:06:16.580> looks<00:06:16.819> nice<00:06:17.059> too

on<00:06:17.479> this<00:06:17.659> side<00:06:17.960> I<00:06:18.289> think<00:06:18.919> that<00:06:19.039> adds<00:06:19.370> to<00:06:19.610> the

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
on this side I think that adds to the

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:24.480 
on this side I think that adds to the
strength<00:06:20.469> it<00:06:21.469> feels<00:06:21.710> real<00:06:21.979> good<00:06:22.009> choked<00:06:22.490> up

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
strength it feels real good choked up

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.369 
strength it feels real good choked up
