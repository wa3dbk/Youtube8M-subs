00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.960 
trying to get laid and then but which is
slightly<00:01:40.829> different<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.400> professor<00:01:41.790> next

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
slightly different for professor next

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.670 
slightly different for professor next
video<00:01:42.210> right<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.840> lots<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.110> professors<00:01:43.380> want

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
video right know lots of professors want

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.330 
video right know lots of professors want
to<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.979> don't<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> know<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:45.680> yeah<00:01:46.680> it's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
to do that don't you know that yeah it's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.920 
to do that don't you know that yeah it's
always<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> palms<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.360> papers<00:01:48.689> now

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
always in the palms up in the papers now

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.889 
always in the palms up in the papers now
um<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.670> now<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.000> guess<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.479> challenges

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
um so now I guess one of the challenges

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.350 
um so now I guess one of the challenges
was<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.829> your<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> prequel

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
was because there is your the prequel

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.609 
was because there is your the prequel
but<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> don't<00:01:55.079> want<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> same

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
but you don't want to do the same

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.800 
but you don't want to do the same
character<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.700> Patrick<00:01:57.149> Stewart<00:01:57.659> would

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
character that Patrick Stewart would

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.020 
character that Patrick Stewart would
have<00:01:57.930> done<00:01:58.079> correct<00:01:58.500> well<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.880> be<00:02:00.000> too

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
have done correct well not to be too

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.520 
have done correct well not to be too
influenced<00:02:00.570> by<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> yeah<00:02:00.899> you're<00:02:01.140> playing<00:02:01.409> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
influenced by the yeah you're playing a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.620 
influenced by the yeah you're playing a

Charles Xavier and it's 40 years before
the<00:02:12.480> first<00:02:12.630> movie<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.770> cat's<00:02:13.980> gonna<00:02:14.130> be

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
the first movie so the cat's gonna be

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.270 
the first movie so the cat's gonna be
different<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:16.140> yeah<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.560> life<00:02:16.770> some<00:02:17.040> people

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
different and yeah in life some people

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.870 
different and yeah in life some people
stay<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> same

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
stay the same

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.690 
stay the same
some<00:02:18.180> people<00:02:18.390> don't<00:02:18.480> change<00:02:18.750> much<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:19.700> for

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
some people don't change much but for

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.330 
some people don't change much but for
drama<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.150> for<00:02:21.740> movie<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.890> think<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.250> would

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
drama and for movie I think that would

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.280 
drama and for movie I think that would
be<00:02:23.370> incredibly<00:02:23.850> dull<00:02:24.060> if<00:02:24.600> he<00:02:24.750> was<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
be incredibly dull if he was just the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.220 
be incredibly dull if he was just the
same<00:02:25.470> guy<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:27.120> changed<00:02:27.840> them<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.050> purpose

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
same guy so we changed them on purpose

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.960 
same guy so we changed them on purpose
so<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.620> looked<00:02:28.860> at<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.130> Patrick's<00:02:29.490> performance
