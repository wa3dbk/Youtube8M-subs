00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.520 

still<00:02:28.130> not<00:02:28.280> really<00:02:28.580> used<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.530> it's

still not really used to it and it's
kind<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.740> difficult<00:02:31.160> because<00:02:31.220> each<00:02:31.550> time<00:02:31.760> you

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
kind of difficult because each time you

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.300 
kind of difficult because each time you
hit<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:33.080> have<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.440> make<00:02:33.590> sure<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:33.830> you
