00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.589
 hello everyone I'm from spartanburg 543 and today I come to present a top 5 of 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.169
 the xbox games that are fucking mother 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:12.539
 good for me because then there are some subnormales that tell me what you missed 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.309
 that you put a game and that in bastard 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.519
 well we will start this top 5 with the game of esppor and 2 fertilizer 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.399
 those two games of killing zombies that want to dominate the world and you and 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.970
 three other comrades who have to kill zombies to no longer able to 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:30.320
 can stop the zombie threat to return to your normal life 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.230
 in the first game of the esppor dead they are like the four survivors to three 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.230
 men and a woman as the three men meet 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.680
 filipas 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.950
 and francis and how the woman finds act and that she is well good at the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.590
 second game you must also annihilate the zombie threat that also 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.010
 they want to dominate the world in this game you also use four 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.210
 survivors three men and a woman just like in the first game 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.430
 as the three men are cobos efi without hit and how the woman is 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.300
 rochelle 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.030
 for me these two tickets so so from the host 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.970
 now let's move on to position number four that what was our buddy bob 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.150
 Thanks sponge or Sparta 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.340
 and as position number four we have the indigo he talk hannah game 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.340
 montana but what the fuck 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.580
 minutes 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.120
 shit 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.800
 I'm sorry for that bullshit that said spongebob because I was bullshit if I 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.650
 love the game of hannah montana is poetry 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.260
 And also that old woman is very good and I can masturbate seeing her better 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.560
 Shut up asshole and let me continue with my good video and as position number 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.250
 four we have the game of resident evil 5 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.540
 In addition to its other deliveries this game is also based on the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.190
 elimination of the zombie threat because of the ty virus and you have to 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.800
 liquidate all the zombies and the boss that is this wesker who is the person 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.400
 guilty that the problem with the virus occurs 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.270
 and you using chris referred to seba alomar you must find a Huesca and 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.170
 kill him so he can solve the problem besides Chris wants revenge 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.030
 because he thinks that kuester kills his partner jill valentine and chris with 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.379
 more reason wants to kill westergaard emas of the problem with the virus 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.989
 this game for me was the best installment of the resident evil that could have 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:20.959
 take 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.689
 now we have the number three position 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.219
 omar and ccoo that great 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.589
 we are almost close to knowing which is the number one position 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.629
 aam excited now to orgasm now there 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.279
 Well, after that excitement, we have position number three at 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.179
 halo game 3 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.999
 well that game is the mere cock because you have to drive a spartan 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:48.649
 called master chief in the 25th century to stop an alien threat that 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.649
 they want to destroy humanity with some rings called to not 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:54.799
 in this third part of the halo game 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.719
 the inquisitor along with his squad called the the ips to prevent the 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.419
 prophet of truth activate the rings and destroy humanity 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:06.319
 you also have as enemies the clubs that are parasites that depend 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.209
 of intelligent beings to survive by taking over bodies 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.499
 of the dead or the dark are still alive in which in a part of the 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:17.249
 game you have to join the clubs to really kill and prevent him from activating 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.719
 the Rings 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.599
 well this delivery has been one of the five more that has left the games 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.659
 of halo because it has a story they had fucking mother 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.599
 besides the multiplayer option just like the maps are really cool and 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.290
 you can also modify your esparta can not be an ebit and edit it and 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.299
 also the games of xbox live that are good chingones xd and now we go 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.969
 with the number 2 position 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.429
 I'm from spartan let me say the number 2 post 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:47.829
 I'll say nonsense, I'll say what you say but please let me say 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.549
 mouth is fine 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.349
 I'll give you one last chance but this time do not screw it up 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.349
 I will be forced to kill the devil and not let you leave in my videos 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.749
 you understood 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:00.129
 one hundred loved him 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.529
 now as number two we have the halo game odst in this game 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:09.230
 you are in the year two thousand 552 and you are a soldier of descent shock what 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.430
 vital or rather a soldier lst but you are a rookie athens and on the descent 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.220
 when falling in the city of new mombasa deviating from his companions and what 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.070
 you have to gather or look for it but in the city to the square for it is controlled 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:23.599
 by the covenant and you have or benefits 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.479
 meet you with your hair ton 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.999
 keep alive escape the city of new mombasa try to stop the 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:33.229
 covenant to be able to restore peace and win the war 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.099
 in this game there is also a mode called shooting that tries to ride 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.499
 bruce attacks try to survive as much as you can this option can 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:45.279
 play on xbox live you and three other friends so they can survive more and 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.860
 it is not worth that you lodge faster you have to see how a subnormal to ha ha and 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.560
 now a Spartan ask our position number one for 100 up 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:56.969
 we arrived at that post that great thanks boc for saying the position number 2 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.069
 and do not go out with your blowjobs like they used to say that shitty game 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.219
 of the jana monta belgian pardoned of the espartal 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.819
 but the one that really moves me that game 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:07.870
 now it is OK 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.719
 and as number one we have the game of 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:15.469
 gears of war 2 the start of gears of war 2 occurs six months later than 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.490
 happened in gears of war 1 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.050
 although much of the locust horde was defeated after the detonation 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.979
 of the light mass pump the explosion also brought severe consequences to 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.430
 the human population by causing the raid 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.289
 a phosphorescent substance in a liquid state 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.659
 that humans use on the planet will be like fuel 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.490
 it goes by and zara and emerges from the subsoil causing deadly diseases 

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:40.389
 lungs to the human race 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.090
 while humans seek to survive this new threat a new and coordinated 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.340
 locust attack manages to get hold of some human capitals that slowly go 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.699
 yielding to the enemy offensive 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.059
 humanity then have a last refuge the impenetrable before 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:00.379
 hyacinth plateau from which a last and desperate counterattack is planned 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.439
 dig up the locust shelters that survived the bomb attack 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:05.949
 of light mass 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.069
 in this game besides q the story is very good 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.809
 also has the multiplayer part in which there are several modalities of 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.870
 game for example is the execution mode 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.199
 this mode is a mode very similar to war zone 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.210
 in principle the game is developed the same, removing the fact that 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.309
 can kill anyone from the opposing team at long distance if a weapon is not used 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:31.720
 explosive like a triple grenade launcher or the explosive bow or it bursts 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.919
 head with any of the weapons 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.220
 any other type of attack knocks down the player and must be topped body to 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.759
 body 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.409
 with any execution 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.580
 can be done with any weapon but melee 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.330
 if the player goes down a long time instead of dying 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.199
 get up again to continue the game 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.810
 if the player is private more than three times 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.930
 death instantly 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.100
 there is also the guardian mode 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.410
 in this modality each team has a leading player a variant of the game of 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.420
 murder in the first installment in which the goal is to kill the leader at 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.520
 start and then the other players to win 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.400
 this to kill the leader first 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.280
 is because if the leader is not killed the other players can relive how many 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.659
 sometimes want 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:19.589
 this game is my favorite that has existed in these times and you 

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:21.059
 I hope they change what they know 

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:23.080
 well here ends my video 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.520
 I say goodbye and remember to comment and score
