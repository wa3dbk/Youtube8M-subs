expansion<00:00:03.990> gonna<00:00:04.319> try<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.500> take<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.740> hatchery

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
expansion gonna try to take a hatchery

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.740 
expansion gonna try to take a hatchery
or<00:00:05.220> maybe<00:00:05.370> he's<00:00:05.549> trended<00:00:05.970> than<00:00:06.120> deny<00:00:06.509> mind

or maybe he's trended than deny mind

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.909 
or maybe he's trended than deny mind
that<00:00:06.899> third<00:00:07.080> expansion<00:00:07.350> which<00:00:07.649> mine<00:00:07.830> is

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
that third expansion which mine is

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.350 
that third expansion which mine is
taking<00:00:08.040> now<00:00:08.309> so<00:00:08.519> both<00:00:08.610> players<00:00:08.880> being<00:00:09.059> really

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
taking now so both players being really

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.509 
taking now so both players being really
conservative<00:00:09.840> here<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.590> feel<00:00:10.769> like<00:00:10.800> really

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
conservative here and I feel like really

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.490 
conservative here and I feel like really
yeah<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.969> feel<00:00:12.450> like<00:00:12.570> mine<00:00:12.750> if<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.080> wanted<00:00:13.380> to

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
yeah I feel like mine if you wanted to

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.049 
yeah I feel like mine if you wanted to
could<00:00:13.799> push<00:00:14.009> up<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.370> could<00:00:14.549> take<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.849> game

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
could push up and could take this game

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.400 
could push up and could take this game
at<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.299> point<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.020> meantime<00:00:16.170> he's

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
at this point and in the meantime he's

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.290 
at this point and in the meantime he's
just<00:00:16.529> kind<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.710> letting<00:00:16.890> her<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.250> build<00:00:18.119> up<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
just kind of letting her on build up a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.880 
just kind of letting her on build up a
nidus<00:00:18.539> canal<00:00:18.869> going<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:19.320> her<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.740> he's

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
nidus canal going up for her on so he's

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.290 
nidus canal going up for her on so he's
going<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.070> be<00:00:20.130> able<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> protect<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
going to be able to protect that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.730 
going to be able to protect that
expansion<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.840> top<00:00:21.990> right<00:00:22.170> corner<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.560> feel

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
expansion in the top right corner I feel

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.019 
expansion in the top right corner I feel
like<00:00:22.830> mine<00:00:23.010> has<00:00:23.189> all<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> pieces<00:00:23.580> now<00:00:23.820> if<00:00:23.939> you

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
like mine has all the pieces now if you

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.370 
like mine has all the pieces now if you
wanted<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.449> forward<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.810> attack<00:00:25.050> instead

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
wanted to go forward and attack instead

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.509 
wanted to go forward and attack instead
he's<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.710> gonna<00:00:25.800> let<00:00:25.920> those<00:00:26.070> two<00:00:26.130> filers

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
he's just gonna let those two filers

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.880 
he's just gonna let those two filers
develop<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> energy<00:00:27.599> they<00:00:27.750> need<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:28.650> i<00:00:28.680> should

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
develop the energy they need or i should

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.439 
develop the energy they need or i should
say<00:00:29.039> research<00:00:29.460> consume<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.179> he's<00:00:30.330> going

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
say research consume and then he's going

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.429 
say research consume and then he's going
to<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.630> trouble<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:31.019> all<00:00:31.170> he<00:00:31.260> has<00:00:31.410> is

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
to be in trouble because all he has is

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.530 
to be in trouble because all he has is
medics<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.579> marines<00:00:33.059> he's<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
medics and marines he's not going to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.130 
medics and marines he's not going to
have<00:00:33.630> anything<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:35.040> dark<00:00:35.399> swarm<00:00:35.670> attack

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
have anything for that dark swarm attack

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.090 
have anything for that dark swarm attack
like<00:00:37.140> set<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.440> he's<00:00:37.590> probably<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.040> have

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
like set and he's probably going to have

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.310 
like set and he's probably going to have
to<00:00:38.190> sacrifice<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.820> expansion<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:40.110> out

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to sacrifice that expansion that's out

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.630 
to sacrifice that expansion that's out
more<00:00:40.530> science<00:00:40.800> vessels<00:00:41.100> being<00:00:41.280> produced<00:00:41.489> in

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
more science vessels being produced in

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.220 
more science vessels being produced in
the<00:00:41.730> meantime<00:00:41.910> my<00:00:42.510> guess<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.840> radiates

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the meantime my guess is radiates

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
the meantime my guess is radiates
already<00:00:43.500> researched<00:00:43.820> not<00:00:44.820> even<00:00:45.059> bothering

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
already researched not even bothering

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
already researched not even bothering
getting<00:00:45.600> tanks<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.079> point<00:00:46.320> doing<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
getting tanks at this point doing a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.889 
getting tanks at this point doing a
decent<00:00:47.399> job<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.910> researching<00:00:48.300> he<00:00:48.570> has<00:00:48.690> three

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
decent job of researching he has three

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:49.940 
decent job of researching he has three
science<00:00:49.170> vessels<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.530> let's<00:00:49.680> see<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:49.829> he

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
science vessels and let's see if he

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.100 
science vessels and let's see if he
decides<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.550> finally<00:00:50.879> push<00:00:51.149> forward<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
decides to finally push forward now the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.479 
decides to finally push forward now the
meantime<00:00:52.350> doesn't<00:00:52.649> look<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.890> her<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.219> has<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
meantime doesn't look like her on has a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.220 
meantime doesn't look like her on has a
lot<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.940> basically<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.570> decent-sized<00:00:55.020> air

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
lot of a basically a decent-sized air

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
lot of a basically a decent-sized air
force<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.860> fight<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.460> off<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> he's

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
force to kind of fight this off and he's

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.130 
force to kind of fight this off and he's
still<00:00:57.149> gathering<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> South<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.050> I'm

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
still gathering to the South there I'm

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.240 
still gathering to the South there I'm
still<00:00:58.379> wondering<00:00:58.530> why<00:00:58.710> he's<00:00:58.829> getting<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
still wondering why he's getting to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.229 
still wondering why he's getting to
South<00:00:59.399> they<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.699> what<00:00:59.820> he's<00:00:59.940> doing<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.180> he's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
South they think what he's doing is he's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.330 
South they think what he's doing is he's
actually<00:01:00.510> prison<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.219> make

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
actually prison if I was going to make

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.770 
actually prison if I was going to make
kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.640> guess<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> strategy<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> think

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
kind of a guess of the strategy I think

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.450 
kind of a guess of the strategy I think
he's<00:01:03.899> trying<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.199> position<00:01:04.439> their<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.189> force

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
he's trying to position their to force

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.800 
he's trying to position their to force
mind<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.790> camp<00:01:06.000> those<00:01:06.119> medical<00:01:06.390> marines<00:01:06.630> there

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
mind to camp those medical marines there

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.940 
mind to camp those medical marines there
and<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.080> soon<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.320> those<00:01:07.439> medical<00:01:07.740> marines

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and as soon as those medical marines

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.679 
and as soon as those medical marines
start<00:01:08.130> pushing<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> front<00:01:08.850> he'll<00:01:09.510> bring

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
start pushing at the front he'll bring

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.179 
start pushing at the front he'll bring
up<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.960> our<00:01:10.049> attack<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.680> third<00:01:10.860> expansion

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
up on our attack on that third expansion

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.609 
up on our attack on that third expansion
and<00:01:11.549> basically<00:01:11.850> try<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> starve<00:01:12.510> mine<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619

of science vessels up I'm very surprised
actually<00:02:36.040> more<00:02:37.000> science<00:02:37.239> vessels<00:02:37.540> being

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
actually more science vessels being

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.030 
actually more science vessels being
produced<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.080> kind<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.290> expected<00:02:38.739> mind

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
produced I kind of expected mind

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.920 
produced I kind of expected mind
actually<00:02:39.220> showing<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.730> little<00:02:39.819> bit<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.269> macro

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
actually showing a little bit of a macro

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.960 
actually showing a little bit of a macro
lacks<00:02:41.170> here<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.650> my<00:02:42.129> opinion<00:02:42.400> as<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.760> can<00:02:42.849> see

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
lacks here in my opinion as you can see

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.309 
lacks here in my opinion as you can see
those<00:02:43.150> barracks<00:02:43.450> not<00:02:43.629> going<00:02:43.930> off<00:02:44.080> those

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
those barracks not going off those

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.110 
those barracks not going off those
doesn't<00:02:45.040> have<00:02:45.160> as<00:02:45.250> many<00:02:45.370> science<00:02:45.700> vessels<00:02:46.000> as

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
doesn't have as many science vessels as

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.520 
doesn't have as many science vessels as
he<00:02:46.239> should<00:02:46.510> have<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.840> my<00:02:46.930> opinion<00:02:47.170> considering

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
he should have in my opinion considering

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.199 
he should have in my opinion considering
you<00:02:48.069> went<00:02:48.220> for<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.370> two<00:02:48.549> star<00:02:48.790> port<00:02:49.000> build

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
you went for that two star port build

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.990 
you went for that two star port build
and<00:02:49.450> he's<00:02:49.599> had<00:02:49.890> basically<00:02:50.890> two<00:02:51.400> gas<00:02:51.579> pumping

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
and he's had basically two gas pumping

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.339 
and he's had basically two gas pumping
this<00:02:52.120> entire<00:02:52.420> time<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:52.840> he's<00:02:53.019> just<00:02:53.140> been

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
this entire time and he's just been

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.830 
this entire time and he's just been
producing<00:02:53.709> mostly<00:02:54.099> mostly<00:02:54.970> Marines<00:02:55.450> here<00:02:55.660> and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
producing mostly mostly Marines here and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.569 
producing mostly mostly Marines here and
now<00:02:56.590> going<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.010> South<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.340> think<00:02:57.489> he's

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
now going to the South I think he's

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.770 
now going to the South I think he's
going<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.760> go<00:02:57.849> after<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.150> expansion<00:02:58.569> that

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
going to go after that expansion that

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.819 
going to go after that expansion that
nine<00:02:58.930> o'clock<00:02:59.140> position<00:02:59.500> just<00:02:59.650> probably

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
nine o'clock position just probably

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.470 
nine o'clock position just probably
compsat<00:03:00.220> another<00:03:00.610> beautiful<00:03:00.879> storm<00:03:01.239> going<00:03:01.390> to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
force mine back and we'll see if Iran

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.610 
force mine back and we'll see if Iran

is<00:03:37.690> ultra<00:03:38.019> lyst<00:03:38.200> that's<00:03:38.380> going<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.590> be

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
is ultra lyst that's going to be

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.650 
is ultra lyst that's going to be
somewhat<00:03:38.950> costly<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.549> really<00:03:40.209> that's<00:03:40.359> kind

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
somewhat costly and really that's kind

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.610 
somewhat costly and really that's kind
of<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.810> worst<00:03:40.959> thing<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.349> could<00:03:41.440> happen

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
of the worst thing that could happen

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.589 
of the worst thing that could happen
there<00:03:41.919> I'm<00:03:42.790> surprised<00:03:43.150> he<00:03:43.269> didn't<00:03:43.480> have<00:03:43.569> a

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
there I'm surprised he didn't have a

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.210 
there I'm surprised he didn't have a
couple<00:03:43.900> scourges<00:03:44.290> there<00:03:44.470> because<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.099> was<00:03:45.190> a

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
couple scourges there because that was a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.740 
couple scourges there because that was a
really<00:03:45.400> risky<00:03:45.669> maneuver<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:46.180> mines<00:03:46.450> part<00:03:46.690> I

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
really risky maneuver on mines part I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.300 
really risky maneuver on mines part I
think<00:03:46.900> he<00:03:46.989> calms<00:03:47.200> sided<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.650> off<00:03:47.769> pushed<00:03:48.099> off

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
think he calms sided that off pushed off

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.949 
think he calms sided that off pushed off
did<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:48.970> now<00:03:49.090> he's<00:03:49.239> going<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:49.419> lift<00:03:49.599> off<00:03:49.780> his

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
did it now he's going to lift off his

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.360 
did it now he's going to lift off his
factory<00:03:50.349> actually<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.739> use<00:03:50.829> that<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:51.040> scout

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
factory actually and use that to scout

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.830 
factory actually and use that to scout
for<00:03:51.400> him<00:03:51.700> because<00:03:52.060> he's<00:03:52.269> not<00:03:52.419> using<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.810> for

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
for him because he's not using it for

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.420 
for him because he's not using it for
anything<00:03:52.930> else<00:03:53.319> he's<00:03:53.500> totally<00:03:53.859> dedicated<00:03:54.010> to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
anything else he's totally dedicated to

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.610 
anything else he's totally dedicated to
a<00:03:54.459> medic<00:03:54.700> marine<00:03:54.970> fight<00:03:55.180> as<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:56.200> can<00:03:56.319> see<00:03:56.410> now

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
think Iran is going to win this along

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.390 
think Iran is going to win this along
simply<00:06:39.080> because<00:06:39.169> her<00:06:39.440> on<00:06:39.590> is<00:06:39.740> out<00:06:39.919> Mac<00:06:40.130> rowing

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
simply because her on is out Mac rowing

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.840 
simply because her on is out Mac rowing
him<00:06:40.550> mine<00:06:41.330> does<00:06:41.510> not<00:06:41.660> secured<00:06:42.050> anything<00:06:42.850> he's

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
him mine does not secured anything he's

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.970 
him mine does not secured anything he's
just<00:06:44.000> I'm<00:06:44.389> just<00:06:44.450> economically<00:06:45.380> so<00:06:45.650> far<00:06:45.889> ahead

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
just I'm just economically so far ahead

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.129 
just I'm just economically so far ahead
he<00:06:46.160> has<00:06:46.250> so<00:06:46.460> many<00:06:46.550> hatcheries<00:06:47.060> out<00:06:47.210> looks<00:06:48.020> like

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
he has so many hatcheries out looks like

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:49.300 
he has so many hatcheries out looks like
that<00:06:48.290> bottom<00:06:48.560> right<00:06:48.680> hand<00:06:48.710> corner<00:06:48.860> is<00:06:49.160> going

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
that bottom right hand corner is going

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.560 
that bottom right hand corner is going
to<00:06:49.370> be<00:06:49.460> able<00:06:49.520> to<00:06:49.700> he's<00:06:50.060> going<00:06:50.210> to<00:06:50.300> take<00:06:50.450> that

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
to be able to he's going to take that

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.270 
to be able to he's going to take that
out<00:06:50.630> but<00:06:51.260> I<00:06:51.290> think<00:06:51.530> mine<00:06:51.710> is<00:06:51.740> going<00:06:52.010> to<00:06:52.100> start

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
out but I think mine is going to start

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.890 
out but I think mine is going to start
getting<00:06:52.400> star<00:06:52.790> for<00:06:52.970> res<00:06:53.120> he<00:06:53.270> has<00:06:53.419> some<00:06:53.600> tanks

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
getting star for res he has some tanks

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.770 
getting star for res he has some tanks
now<00:06:54.020> deal<00:06:54.860> too<00:06:55.040> dark<00:06:55.220> swarm<00:06:55.510> but<00:06:56.510> I<00:06:56.570> think<00:06:56.690> it

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
now deal too dark swarm but I think it

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
now deal too dark swarm but I think it
might<00:06:56.870> be<00:06:56.900> too<00:06:57.110> little<00:06:57.200> too<00:06:57.320> late<00:06:57.410> but<00:06:57.590> if

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
might be too little too late but if

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.470 
might be too little too late but if
there<00:06:57.980> is<00:06:58.130> if<00:06:58.669> he<00:06:58.880> is<00:06:58.970> going<00:06:59.060> to<00:06:59.180> win<00:06:59.300> it<00:06:59.389> he's

00:06:59.470 --> 00:06:59.480 
there is if he is going to win it he's

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.430 
there is if he is going to win it he's
going<00:06:59.600> to<00:06:59.690> win<00:06:59.780> with<00:06:59.960> that<00:07:00.050> right<00:07:00.260> there<00:07:00.410> that

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
going to win with that right there that

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.100 
going to win with that right there that
huge<00:07:00.889> Science<00:07:01.220> Vessel<00:07:01.280> force<00:07:01.750> as<00:07:02.750> you<00:07:02.870> can<00:07:02.990> see

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
huge Science Vessel force as you can see

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.480 
huge Science Vessel force as you can see
not<00:07:03.290> a<00:07:03.350> lot<00:07:03.410> of<00:07:03.560> resources<00:07:03.770> left<00:07:04.070> in<00:07:04.220> her<00:07:04.340> ons

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
not a lot of resources left in her ons

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.240 
not a lot of resources left in her ons
main<00:07:04.790> there<00:07:05.480> is<00:07:05.600> some<00:07:05.840> in<00:07:06.020> his<00:07:06.169> secondary<00:07:06.590> but

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
main there is some in his secondary but

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.409 
main there is some in his secondary but
still<00:07:07.580> he's<00:07:07.760> got<00:07:07.970> that<00:07:08.060> upper<00:07:08.300> right

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:08.419 
still he's got that upper right

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.060 
still he's got that upper right
expansion<00:07:08.840> and<00:07:09.020> at<00:07:09.139> nine<00:07:09.290> o'clock<00:07:09.410> expansion

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
expansion and at nine o'clock expansion

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.159 
expansion and at nine o'clock expansion
semi<00:07:10.850> under<00:07:11.060> his<00:07:11.150> control<00:07:11.270> our<00:07:11.479> mind<00:07:11.720> i<00:07:11.900> think

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:12.169 
semi under his control our mind i think

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.379 
semi under his control our mind i think
his<00:07:12.710> main<00:07:12.950> is<00:07:13.160> probably<00:07:13.520> almost<00:07:13.760> out<00:07:14.060> i'm

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
his main is probably almost out i'm

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:15.940 
his main is probably almost out i'm
going<00:07:14.540> to<00:07:14.600> guess<00:07:14.750> the<00:07:14.900> secondary<00:07:15.320> is<00:07:15.440> also

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 
going to guess the secondary is also

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.340 
going to guess the secondary is also
quite<00:07:16.669> low<00:07:16.880> on<00:07:17.030> resources<00:07:17.150> her<00:07:17.690> on-again

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350 
quite low on resources her on-again

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.340 
quite low on resources her on-again
going<00:07:18.889> to<00:07:18.950> expand<00:07:19.280> right<00:07:19.430> there<00:07:19.610> and<00:07:20.540> a<00:07:20.570> large

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
going to expand right there and a large

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.110 
going to expand right there and a large
ultralisk<00:07:21.860> force<00:07:22.130> out<00:07:22.639> and<00:07:22.880> about<00:07:23.090> but

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 
ultralisk force out and about but

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.879 
ultralisk force out and about but
they're<00:07:23.510> still<00:07:23.600> there's<00:07:23.960> plenty<00:07:24.229> of<00:07:24.260> a<00:07:24.410> radius

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:24.889 
they're still there's plenty of a radius

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:26.740 
they're still there's plenty of a radius
wedding<00:07:25.250> and<00:07:26.150> it<00:07:26.360> looks<00:07:26.479> like<00:07:26.510> they're<00:07:26.660> gonna

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:26.750 
wedding and it looks like they're gonna

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.150 
wedding and it looks like they're gonna
push<00:07:26.960> down<00:07:27.110> here<00:07:27.260> comes<00:07:27.440> science<00:07:27.650> vessels<00:07:28.040> and

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 
push down here comes science vessels and

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.710 
push down here comes science vessels and
from<00:07:28.550> behind<00:07:28.790> those<00:07:29.030> science<00:07:29.300> vessels<00:07:29.600> not

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 
from behind those science vessels not

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.969 
from behind those science vessels not
going<00:07:29.900> to<00:07:29.960> be<00:07:30.020> protected<00:07:30.380> by<00:07:30.470> these<00:07:30.650> Marines

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:30.979 
going to be protected by these Marines

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:32.830 
going to be protected by these Marines
so<00:07:31.550> we'll<00:07:31.729> see<00:07:31.850> if<00:07:31.880> mine<00:07:32.120> ends<00:07:32.300> up<00:07:32.389> losing<00:07:32.510> both

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 
so we'll see if mine ends up losing both

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.180 
so we'll see if mine ends up losing both
these<00:07:32.990> science<00:07:33.260> vessels<00:07:33.530> before<00:07:33.650> and<00:07:33.860> radiate

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190 
these science vessels before and radiate

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.980 
these science vessels before and radiate
even<00:07:34.400> comes<00:07:34.610> off<00:07:34.790> and<00:07:35.000> looks<00:07:35.690> like<00:07:35.810> mine's

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:35.990 
even comes off and looks like mine's

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.360 
even comes off and looks like mine's
going<00:07:36.110> to<00:07:36.229> spawn<00:07:36.410> another<00:07:36.560> expansion<00:07:37.010> going

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.370 
going to spawn another expansion going

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.820 
going to spawn another expansion going
for<00:07:37.580> her<00:07:37.700> on<00:07:37.850> and<00:07:38.169> while<00:07:39.169> the<00:07:39.380> game<00:07:39.500> up<00:07:39.650> at<00:07:39.770> this

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 
for her on and while the game up at this

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.980 
for her on and while the game up at this
point<00:07:39.979> really<00:07:40.160> has<00:07:40.370> been<00:07:40.580> mine<00:07:41.540> trying<00:07:41.900> to

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:41.990 
point really has been mine trying to

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.570 
point really has been mine trying to
deal<00:07:42.139> with<00:07:42.350> with<00:07:42.650> her<00:07:42.800> on<00:07:42.919> expanding<00:07:43.400> all<00:07:43.550> over

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:43.580 
deal with with her on expanding all over

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.790 
deal with with her on expanding all over
the<00:07:43.850> map<00:07:43.970> and<00:07:44.240> then<00:07:44.390> when<00:07:45.350> it<00:07:45.440> comes<00:07:45.590> to<00:07:45.680> these

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 
the map and then when it comes to these

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.870 
the map and then when it comes to these
sort<00:07:46.070> of<00:07:46.130> games<00:07:46.370> you<00:07:46.550> have<00:07:46.700> to<00:07:46.729> be<00:07:46.850> very

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:46.880 
sort of games you have to be very

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.190 
sort of games you have to be very
careful<00:07:47.210> and<00:07:47.419> we'll<00:07:47.539> see<00:07:47.660> what<00:07:47.870> mine<00:07:48.020> does

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.200 
careful and we'll see what mine does

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.270 
careful and we'll see what mine does
here<00:07:48.410> it<00:07:48.470> looks<00:07:48.620> like<00:07:48.770> the<00:07:48.890> yeah<00:07:49.039> they<00:07:49.190> have

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 
here it looks like the yeah they have

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.770 
here it looks like the yeah they have
nothing<00:07:49.370> protect<00:07:49.820> them<00:07:49.970> going<00:07:50.360> to<00:07:50.419> be<00:07:50.479> boxed

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:50.780 
nothing protect them going to be boxed

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.180 
nothing protect them going to be boxed
in<00:07:50.840> by<00:07:50.960> these<00:07:51.020> scourges<00:07:51.380> these<00:07:51.650> scourges<00:07:51.890> are

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.190 
in by these scourges these scourges are

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.200 
in by these scourges these scourges are
in<00:07:52.280> fact<00:07:52.460> going<00:07:52.520> to<00:07:52.640> be<00:07:52.729> able<00:07:52.789> to<00:07:52.940> take<00:07:53.060> these

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.210 
in fact going to be able to take these

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.310 
in fact going to be able to take these
two<00:07:53.360> science<00:07:53.600> vessels<00:07:53.900> out<00:07:53.990> before<00:07:54.260> they

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:54.320 
two science vessels out before they

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.529 
two science vessels out before they
really<00:07:54.500> do<00:07:54.620> anything<00:07:54.880> and<00:07:55.880> that's<00:07:56.330> really
