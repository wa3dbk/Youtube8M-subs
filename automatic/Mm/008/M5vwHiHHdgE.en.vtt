 episode I want to show you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.680
 some of my successes that I have already completed 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.470
 but first the score against the real 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.930
 company code 3 to 2 valid for the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.810
 back of the cup of spain this score 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.539
 aggregate from 4 to 4 but how they did 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.750
 three goals away from home to our team 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.899
 has been eliminated and we are out of the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.700
 spain there the goals for you to see cost 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.790
 in the area made the two goals of our team 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.040
 from barcelona and the effects 20 this guy 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.079
 and scored three goals each and ended with 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.739
 our defense, I did not play this 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.110
 match 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.660
 my note was not so good would be good 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.309
 see soon the head goal that closed 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.610
 the score in 3 to 2 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.129
 I got 6.9 and I got four kicks and one 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.210
 of us I missed many many passes 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.340
 releases 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.589
 I want to show the successes now 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.560
 for you there my ace before 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.439
 match against Celtic de vigo is there 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.900
 my points I completed 49% of 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.850
 general progress of the qualities there for 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.460
 being done, I have improved a lot 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.900
 part of fintas and the mental part I want 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.570
 show first to you 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.150
 the part of finalizations there my 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.189
 kicks from afar and my kicking force 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.890
 in the two questions that I improved the most 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.720
 I did not raise anything in the accuracy of the faults 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.290
 because I'm not the official collector of the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.909
 team 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.340
 neither the first nor the second nor the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.430
 third then I did not have how to climb 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.009
 these points in the passes and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.079
 I increased the light short pass more than I 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.509
 act there in the middle of the central field receive 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.490
 the ball of defense and passed pro attack 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.740
 so it was very easy to grow 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.270
 these points I have some there still 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.369
 to improve as from 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.390
 crosses as I play very little 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.700
 by the tips 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.280
 I do not cross much still in the mental part 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.710
 It's what I climb the most in my career. 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.930
 he the stinging attack position 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.869
 has been the fastest growing since I started 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.489
 to play since curitiba and that if many 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.120
 That was the point that improved a lot 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.870
 my general in the points there in general I 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.480
 I'm 70 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.299
 7 my part of acceleration there and itch 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.310
 are the highest with 86 and the rest between 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.920
 81 and 84 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.930
 these points seem to be very good in 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.879
 paper does not appear too high numbers 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.190
 but I have to successes that still are 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.930
 very weak and this lowers the 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.730
 my average so my overall 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.590
 it's still 77 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.690
 Let's go to our departure at the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.909
 Spanish championship against Celta de 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.400
 We only have the championship to do there. 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.260
 Since we're out of the glass and I'm 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.690
 I played well this match he 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.030
 I took the ball twice and again 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.129
 the third time I came face to face with the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.829
 Goal kicker weak in the corner for 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.629
 opening the score 1 to 0 is just my 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.180
 sixth goal of the season we are already 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.340
 in the middle of the championship I only made six 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.799
 goals is this championship in the first 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.780
 division is actually more complicated and 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.790
 I have to act much more with the medium 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.829
 field than the guy that appears there 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.230
 surprise on the attack and almost gave the 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.480
 I almost helped their team there. 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.569
 to make the equalizer goal was not 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.090
 goal and we left with 1 to 0 until 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.400
 so like I said I do not cross too much 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.410
 in matches then from now on I 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.120
 I'm over there in the far left corner 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.639
 to really improve the points of 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.129
 which is an easy point to climb 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.709
 quickly and improve the general points 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.410
 I made this release for odone and you 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.989
 he got the penalty was there gave a 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.139
 brake on charging the 24 shirt and hit 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.720
 the goal 2 to 0 at 28 and still the first 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:45.060
 time I celebrated alone would teach the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.549
 ants like a launch 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.650
 at the end of the first half the team of 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.349
 Celtic of vigo took advantage of this failure 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.049
 monstrous of our defense and dagoberto 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.989
 yes the degoberto is playing pro celta 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.299
 de vigo managed to score the 2 - 1 goal 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.040
 score in the interval of the match was 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.530
 Playing well and very happy with my 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.260
 performance in the first stage 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.049
 and our table and I the rodrigo fall 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.209
 long range shooting and the goalkeeper saved but 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.599
 It's a little table I like to make 12 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.639
 to get out in the face of the goal with a 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.440
 space to kick away one more 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.719
 I tried my leg this time. 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.159
 left a kick placed one more 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.020
 which I need to change that is 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:28.169
 I need to improve because the males 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.150
 placed are very bad and went outside 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.789
 the Celtic still with a little bit of breath 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.220
 tried to disrupt our staff and 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.530
 try to tie the match in a 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.240
 far that went up was out and 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.400
 we left with the win away from home 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.900
 an important departure is that the sky 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.250
 also the team that is down there in the 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.280
 relegation zone 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.620
 my note at the end was 9.1 and I increased 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.569
 plus three positioning points of 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.830
 attack is the Question that I more 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.319
 get evolved 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.120
 I do not know why but I can evolve 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:00.330
 I think it's easy for the crew to 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.280
 just stay in position do not act out of 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.259
 The position that they send you 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.110
 I do it a lot now, right? 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.009
 my note be bigger and 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.509
 consequently the increase plus mine 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.479
 points in an extremely match 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.900
 important now a classic in quotation marks 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.750
 huh 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.370
 which are in b against barcelona 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.710
 and this time playing in our 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.349
 house in our stadium barcelona comes 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.750
 visit us so to speak, right and I 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.139
 I played this game very badly, you guys are going to 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.719
 to see 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.940
 look how much defense error how the error 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:32.669
 my half striker and with the middle 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.770
 central field barcelona almost reached the 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.990
 goal came close but nothing that 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.900
 I'm scared, you look at the pass. 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.419
 from the rodrigo out face passes to me 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.800
 not for outside and when I thought it would 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.590
 get a counter attack 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.449
 I went to who the projuízos 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.009
 confuse things I swear to you 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.909
 They want I thought was a player 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.979
 barcelona b 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:56.340
 I went over to him thinking it was 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.199
 team but it was the judge looks only level 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.110
 was playing in that match against 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.630
 barcelona and when I left for the attack 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.460
 was an impediment because the team was 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.740
 very slow to pass and do the 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.529
 releases I wanted me to do in 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.930
 second stage barcelona achieved this 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:15.330
 penalty by hand on ball within area 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.000
 and the judge scored and you know what they did 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.940
 take the neymar to put the messi 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.630
 clear pro messi charged the penalty and did 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.699
 his goal 1 to 0 barcelona goal of the 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.919
 leonel messi shirt 10 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.960
 he came in just for this 40 only that 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.029
 because then he had very few 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.669
 opportunities like that there is mine 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:37.120
 I let the ball slip and the 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.340
 messi almost did 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.040
 second goal but after that neither 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.990
 did nothing else I finally got a 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.210
 step is the grandson's release 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.680
 I asked for the ball back in the 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.440
 but the ball was very strong. 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.900
 went to the European and Valdés defended well 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.729
 easy to halt we lose yet again 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.900
 for the main team I do not think 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:58.419
 It's obvious, right? 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.639
 how does barcelona b leave you and 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.139
 to win the main barcelona, ​​right? 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.780
 being that they are in the first place 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:07.900
 being leaders of the championship and the people 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.760
 being time reserve their beauty plus one 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.639
 The match that was made lost one more 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.860
 time to propose who took the goal was a 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.419
 brazilian alan kardec 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.060
 another Brazilian playing in the championship 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:21.490
 Spanish is seeing the chances of 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.949
 Osasuna were much more likely to them 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.380
 than our more a rainy game than 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.690
 I really messed up but the goal finally came out 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.720
 from alan kardec was on kick rebound 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:34.630
 he just pushed for the goal is small and the 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.550
 my grade was 6.4 plus a game I 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.770
 I played badly has episodes that play a lot 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.510
 well episode that game very badly I 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.490
 I have a very large inconsistency. 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.460
 but I hope to change this soon 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.620
 we are in 16th place we leave the zone of 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.870
 relegation at least that's it guys 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.530
 another episode of his career as
