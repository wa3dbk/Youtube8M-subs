00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:04.540 
now let's get into one of my favorite

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.449 
now let's get into one of my favorite
new<00:00:04.690> features<00:00:05.110> of<00:00:05.290> Mario<00:00:05.560> 2<00:00:05.680> point<00:00:05.919> 0<00:00:06.009> and<00:00:06.279> it's

00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:06.459 
new features of Mario 2 point 0 and it's

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:10.110 
new features of Mario 2 point 0 and it's
the<00:00:06.609> masking<00:00:07.029> system<00:00:07.890> so<00:00:08.890> as<00:00:08.920> I<00:00:09.610> did<00:00:09.760> before<00:00:09.880> I

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
the masking system so as I did before I

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.750 
the masking system so as I did before I
created<00:00:10.480> this<00:00:10.630> brightness<00:00:10.900> layer<00:00:11.760> however

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
created this brightness layer however

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.400 
created this brightness layer however
let's<00:00:12.880> say<00:00:13.270> for<00:00:13.450> argument's<00:00:13.480> sake<00:00:13.900> I<00:00:14.110> didn't

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
let's say for argument's sake I didn't

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.020 
let's say for argument's sake I didn't
want<00:00:14.620> to<00:00:14.770> just<00:00:15.310> overall<00:00:16.140> brighten<00:00:17.140> the<00:00:17.230> entire

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
want to just overall brighten the entire

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.300 
want to just overall brighten the entire
texture<00:00:19.030> so<00:00:19.660> I<00:00:19.720> can<00:00:20.080> actually<00:00:20.260> create<00:00:20.590> down

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
texture so I can actually create down

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.180 
texture so I can actually create down
here<00:00:21.850> a<00:00:22.000> mask<00:00:22.840> associated<00:00:23.650> with<00:00:23.800> this<00:00:24.630> layer

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 
here a mask associated with this layer

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.029 
here a mask associated with this layer
and<00:00:27.190> so<00:00:27.490> if<00:00:27.760> say<00:00:28.449> we<00:00:28.630> wanted<00:00:28.960> to<00:00:28.990> leave<00:00:29.530> the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
and so if say we wanted to leave the

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.090 
and so if say we wanted to leave the
handle<00:00:30.699> alone<00:00:31.110> make<00:00:32.110> sure<00:00:32.140> I<00:00:32.289> have<00:00:32.590> my<00:00:32.800> mask

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
handle alone make sure I have my mask

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
handle alone make sure I have my mask
selected<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:35.140> can<00:00:35.170> grab<00:00:35.530> a<00:00:35.559> brush<00:00:36.399> here<00:00:36.819> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
selected you can grab a brush here and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.950 
selected you can grab a brush here and
I'm<00:00:38.230> going<00:00:38.409> to<00:00:39.089> paint<00:00:40.089> that<00:00:40.210> brightness<00:00:40.780> away

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
I'm going to paint that brightness away

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.139 
I'm going to paint that brightness away
like<00:00:43.960> so<00:00:49.769> and<00:00:50.769> I'm<00:00:50.859> painting<00:00:51.190> just<00:00:51.609> into<00:00:52.120> the

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
like so and I'm painting just into the

00:00:52.149 --> 00:01:00.629 
like so and I'm painting just into the
mask<00:00:53.519> say<00:00:54.519> we<00:00:54.639> want<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:54.909> do<00:00:55.030> for<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:59.309> base<00:01:00.309> hilt

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:00.639 
mask say we want to do for the base hilt

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:14.320 
mask say we want to do for the base hilt
as<00:01:00.940> well

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.359 

like<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:17.810> we<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.050> wanted<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> affect<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
like so so we just wanted to affect the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.649 
like so so we just wanted to affect the
blade<00:01:23.119> obviously<00:01:24.119> there's<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.330> bunch<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.570> ways

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
blade obviously there's a bunch of ways

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.540 
blade obviously there's a bunch of ways
you<00:01:24.690> can<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.890> kind<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.130> quickly

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
you can do this but just kind of quickly

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.050 
you can do this but just kind of quickly
going<00:01:26.850> through<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.619> as<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.850> see

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
going through this so as you can see

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.639 
going through this so as you can see
it's<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.300> affecting<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.990> blade<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
it's just affecting the blade here and

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.969 
it's just affecting the blade here and
if<00:01:32.399> I<00:01:32.520> toggle<00:01:33.330> this<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.840> it'll<00:01:34.140> show<00:01:34.320> me<00:01:34.500> just

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
if I toggle this on it'll show me just

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.490 
if I toggle this on it'll show me just
my<00:01:35.159> mask<00:01:35.340> which<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.420> exactly<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.470> want<00:01:39.500> so

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
my mask which is exactly what I want so

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.040 
my mask which is exactly what I want so
on<00:01:40.590> top<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.830> this<00:01:41.100> i<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.729> actually<00:01:41.910> in<00:01:42.330> my<00:01:42.570> mask

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.359 

say<00:01:46.050> i<00:01:46.110> want<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> create<00:01:46.500> some<00:01:46.710> more<00:01:46.860> variation

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
say i want to create some more variation

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.520 
say i want to create some more variation
in<00:01:47.460> here<00:01:47.640> i<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.940> create<00:01:48.179> use<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.080> texture<00:01:49.500> like

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
in here i can create use a texture like

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.370 
in here i can create use a texture like
so<00:01:50.160> and<00:01:51.679> paint<00:01:52.679> it<00:01:52.800> in<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.039> mask<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:54.170> get<00:01:55.170> more

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
so and paint it in the mask to get more

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:10.279 
so and paint it in the mask to get more
texture<00:01:56.780> variation<00:02:04.880> looks<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:09.110> it's<00:02:10.110> pretty

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
texture variation looks so it's pretty

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.970 
texture variation looks so it's pretty
cool<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:13.110> take<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.440> even<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.709> step<00:02:13.739> further

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
cool and to take it even a step further

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.970 
cool and to take it even a step further
i<00:02:15.320> can<00:02:16.320> actually<00:02:16.440> go<00:02:16.739> into<00:02:16.950> my<00:02:17.160> layer<00:02:17.459> mask

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
i can actually go into my layer mask

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.870 
i can actually go into my layer mask
it's<00:02:19.980> kind<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.220> getting<00:02:20.370> cut<00:02:20.579> off<00:02:20.610> by<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
it's kind of getting cut off by the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.069 
it's kind of getting cut off by the
recording<00:02:21.360> but<00:02:21.510> there's<00:02:21.690> an<00:02:21.780> option<00:02:22.049> called

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
recording but there's an option called

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.520 
recording but there's an option called
make<00:02:22.500> masks<00:02:22.769> group<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.810> now<00:02:25.200> i<00:02:25.260> can

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
make masks group and so now i can

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.580 
make masks group and so now i can
actually<00:02:25.890> have<00:02:26.390> inside<00:02:27.390> my<00:02:27.660> layer<00:02:27.930> mask<00:02:27.959> i

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
actually have inside my layer mask i

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.330 
actually have inside my layer mask i
have<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.769> group<00:02:29.070> where<00:02:29.880> i<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.150> do<00:02:30.360> even<00:02:31.140> more

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
have a group where i can do even more

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.400 
have a group where i can do even more
adjusting<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:33.150> say<00:02:33.450> i<00:02:33.480> want<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.079> just<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.380> a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
adjusting so say i want to just do a

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:44.259 
adjusting so say i want to just do a
levels<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.370> mask<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.950> ability<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.579> so

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.250 

and<00:02:45.920> say

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
and say

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.979 
and say
wanted<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.680> levels<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.220> affect<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:49.420> blade<00:02:49.689> I

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
wanted the levels to affect the blade I

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.429 
wanted the levels to affect the blade I
can<00:02:50.920> go<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.340> create<00:02:51.430> another<00:02:51.549> layer<00:02:51.909> mask

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.110 

for<00:02:56.439> just<00:02:56.709> this<00:02:56.799> levels<00:02:57.189> within<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.549> layer

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
for just this levels within the layer

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:07.440 
for just this levels within the layer
mask<00:02:58.360> and<00:03:02.010> let's<00:03:03.010> do<00:03:03.220> something<00:03:03.250> obscene<00:03:06.450> so

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
mask and let's do something obscene so

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.099 
mask and let's do something obscene so
from<00:03:07.629> here<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:09.250> actually<00:03:09.700> go<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.780> paint

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
from here I can actually go and paint

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:28.890 
from here I can actually go and paint
back<00:03:14.319> again<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.790> hilt

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.330 

like<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:34.560> already<00:03:35.560> I'm<00:03:35.739> getting<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.040> really

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
like so so already I'm getting a really

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.589 
like so so already I'm getting a really
complicated<00:03:38.819> layering<00:03:39.819> system<00:03:40.180> which<00:03:40.450> is

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
complicated layering system which is

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.690 
complicated layering system which is
really<00:03:41.590> neat<00:03:41.860> because<00:03:41.890> it's<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.459> hundred

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
really neat because it's a hundred

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.940 
really neat because it's a hundred
percent<00:03:42.790> non-destructive<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:44.590> now<00:03:44.709> if<00:03:44.829> I<00:03:44.920> go

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
percent non-destructive so now if I go

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.289 
percent non-destructive so now if I go
back<00:03:45.069> to<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:46.109> levels<00:03:47.730> just<00:03:48.730> wanted<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.060> crank

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
back to this levels just wanted to crank

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.780 
back to this levels just wanted to crank
this<00:03:49.450> up<00:03:49.599> a<00:03:49.720> bit<00:03:49.750> do<00:03:50.170> something<00:03:50.439> crazy<00:03:50.790> it's

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
this up a bit do something crazy it's

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.910 
this up a bit do something crazy it's
just<00:03:52.150> affecting<00:03:53.970> this<00:03:54.970> layer<00:03:55.239> mask<00:03:55.859> for<00:03:56.859> the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
just affecting this layer mask for the

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.759 
just affecting this layer mask for the
brightness<00:03:58.140> it's<00:03:59.140> not<00:03:59.260> touching<00:03:59.680> the

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
brightness it's not touching the

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.479 
brightness it's not touching the
original<00:04:00.099> paint<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:02.980> think<00:04:03.069> you<00:04:03.280> guys<00:04:03.400> can

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
original paint so I think you guys can

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.520 
original paint so I think you guys can
have<00:04:03.579> a<00:04:03.700> lot<00:04:03.849> of<00:04:03.879> fun<00:04:04.120> with<00:04:04.299> this<00:04:04.329> and<00:04:04.690> you're

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
have a lot of fun with this and you're

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.569 
have a lot of fun with this and you're
going<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.709> be<00:04:05.769> able<00:04:05.799> to<00:04:05.980> create<00:04:06.040> some<00:04:06.280> really

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
going to be able to create some really

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.020 
going to be able to create some really
complicated<00:04:07.299> intricate<00:04:08.129> textures<00:04:09.129> with<00:04:09.790> the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
complicated intricate textures with the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.220 
complicated intricate textures with the
implementation<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.870> this<00:04:11.049> masking<00:04:12.010> system
