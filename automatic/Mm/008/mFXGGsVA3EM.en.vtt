00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hi everybody today i want to continue 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.990
 our acquaintance with the cleaning system 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.019
 colleagues and propose to come to the second 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.220
 step I remind you that the first step 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.260
 we had it every morning we did 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.279
 five minute rescue room that is 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.170
 carried 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.310
 quick quick things according to your 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.070
 places and now I suggest to go to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.219
 the second step is in our house 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.950
 more or less now purely because we 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.780
 daily pay May 10 minutes to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.010
 so that everything is quick 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:45.180
 dilute the second step I propose to do 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.050
 is to make a daily routine cancellation 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.550
 some land on call it like 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.309
 want that is the main meaning you need 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.640
 make up 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.649
 mode so that we remove all the time in 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.199
 same time then find 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.680
 some specific time for cleaning 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.470
 why do we need it because if we will 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.260
 put all the job well, we have to clean it 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.030
 clearly some time will be there 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.650
 add it all up for later 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.409
 we result everything is done very much with 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.140
 big delay some day may 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.689
 therefore not to become so 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.680
 step we have to make up some mode 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:38.250
 I suggest to start taking them on 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.049
 a sheet of paper and burn all the bodies that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.750
 tied some time that is 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.910
 let's say you lead 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.880
 baby kindergarten some kind of definite 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.370
 time there you take the stage of the cord 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.400
 sections go to the gym and go to 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.250
 work that is something that somehow 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.880
 tied to time you have to write 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.580
 his 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:05.960
 in on a leaf for example by whom 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:08.899
 the journal then after that we look when 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.480
 what time is it free for us apple 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.120
 remains and at this time we enter already 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.380
 cleaning we enter in the morning 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.150
 five minute jar 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.670
 lay on and save the room here and then 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.500
 we enter already some time we look 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.830
 yourself who has this morning who has afternoon to 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.780
 in the evening who works who do not enter 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:39.890
 there is already a room cloak 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.980
 I still do not propose to divide by 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.280
 zones I think like tachi later why 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.820
 because for a start we need at least 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.750
 somehow decide on time 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:59.959
 so I really liked how 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:04.030
 I made up the schedule and on juice 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:07.850
 she took it for an idea not thank you very much 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.560
 but once again I will repeat it to me as if 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.489
 It is more convenient to make 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.160
 day mode more to begin with in order 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.030
 to somehow share in general what is it 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:25.690
 so here 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:28.300
 time with an interval of 15 minutes at 7 to 23 00 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.030
 and here are the heels for each member 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.320
 family column that is here we have from 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:39.520
 you family members and we have 5 columns 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:43.720
 that's mean but here indicated who imagine 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.690
 no matter how different color this time is 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.120
 indicated when you are something they are human 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.490
 for example , I have a husband here in blue 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.880
 this is when we sleep that is at this time i 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:58.209
 I do not plan to park a snail and then bam 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.510
 so on my husband goes to work here 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.360
 all day he's not there let's say younger 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.910
 baby he's always there but spect 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.970
 for example at this time that is me nobody 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.630
 do not distract there second child epiploons 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.440
 3 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:18.910
 i'm already made up for school we first 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.240
 make to school but now grandmothers in 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.750
 mostly so how would i decide already 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.300
 immediately schedule yourself when 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.720
 schools approximate ie time 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.560
 when it is not there and I am already tentatively 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.500
 I see in my free time when not when 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.979
 something busy and when walk when lunch 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.590
 as it should be and then already at that time 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.979
 when I compared it to everyone 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.650
 I grow up he sleeps here school here garden 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.220
 here at work I have time for example 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.640
 some or 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.760
 and when the child is active in the morning vigorous 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.610
 can play myself here already 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.200
 you decide for yourself here I am there 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.230
 a reference where you can download this 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.970
 a sign that is to fill you and yourself 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.770
 of course a bouquet for yourself for completed 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.440
 here and after you force this 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.630
 the plate can already be led out 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.180
 some specific cleaning time 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.640
 that is the next step that we are with 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.670
 let's make it some 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.280
 specific cleaning time 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.220
 I advised not to 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.830
 forget to clean up by this time 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.790
 put yourself a poodle and if you're in 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.590
 phone there is patel nichke separately 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.920
 there are alarm clocks in calendars 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:46.040
 in general, I don't know everything seems to me 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.980
 comments to which the phone is very 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:54.560
 convenient there you can put on any 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:57.169
 alarm time and already after he 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.419
 rang we already know that here but I already 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.450
 I will not forget it's time to go clean up that is 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.750
 in order not to forget i advise still 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.990
 bring in 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:13.819
 alarm clock make a note or task 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:16.129
 some kind of a phone and that's when 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:18.940
 rumble signal we set aside time for ourselves 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:22.370
 15 minutes to clean 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.970
 you for the time being are taking away what you think about 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.639
 necessary 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:30.099
 and the next step, I'll tell you what we 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.099
 will do next on this for now
