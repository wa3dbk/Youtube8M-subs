00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Let us now come to profit growth 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hunting deer among us like this 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.500
 what is called also belongs 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.210
 Of course, biological is not correct 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.710
 it is not a horn 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.509
 which like the morning so the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.580
 ears carriers is constantly growing 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.619
 but as a bone every year anew 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.990
 thrown off again and pushed 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.119
 We have an obligation to do so 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.279
 For all ban so the developers 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.970
 which therefore actually bone carrier 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.800
 have to be called 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.939
 the rule is in the group of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.769
 domestic antler one 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.599
 a special position is there for one thing 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.550
 his was in winter so in the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.710
 so-called original pushes something 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.239
 actually makes no sense and to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.969
 others see the profit development 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.340
 directly after the putting thus the bear 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.469
 and from the fawns in may june 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.680
 Heidfeld uses a bowl 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.350
 image data whether monster or again 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.879
 mainly in the months of may june 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.590
 the black animal has a special role 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.199
 occupies 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.390
 that can always be our old ones 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.120
 Residents just at the stone picture can 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.420
 be a little later due to climate because 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.379
 to know the early and late 1 here 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.680
 why does everything sparkle ? 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.570
 mainly at this time because now 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.340
 the food is growing in the usa and so on 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.680
 the mother animals have enough power for the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.960
 milk production can muster 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.150
 at least the vegetation offers at least 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.820
 for the offspring of our deer-like 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.830
 now also enough coverage in the video 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.850
 drop and follow types I here 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.229
 more precisely it a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.930
 let's get back to the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.330
 profit development at the deer 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.660
 since this starts right after the set 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:37.430
 I call that since may june as well 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.460
 the hour or the month 0 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.410
 no phase in profit development 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.010
 memorize we memorize 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:56.920
 us first of all following series of numbers 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:02:00.790
 0 3 5 to 6 6 7 7 to 8 8 to 9 9 to 10 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.790
 and 12 to 13 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.140
 these numbers 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.400
 for the age of the boxes in months so 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.250
 three for three months 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.840
 five to six five to six months and 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.880
 so on 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.200
 furthermore, the numbers are for each 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.670
 individual at development stage now 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.950
 We can also enjoy the months of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.890
 individual antlers do not just live underneath 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.210
 exam stress but also later 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.490
 We do practice in the hunting practice 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.170
 an example we know the hour 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.010
 null is in may june wants the box 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.480
 is set 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.730
 We also know why that is 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.280
 and that the profit trend immediately 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.020
 starts what we do not know yet 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.690
 like the pictures of the individual phases 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.120
 look and count the story, so to speak 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.050
 but later 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.490
 So first the months end if now 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.840
 June is then we expect 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.630
 following always from may / june 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.800
 the numbers are so times june plus 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.770
 three months is on accordingly 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.390
 august to september and may june plus 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.810
 five to six months would be then 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.030
 accordingly october november and 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.140
 We proceed accordingly 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.660
 Finally a year of life 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.840
 so full have 12 to 13 months and 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.270
 landed again in may / june 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.730
 Now let's look at the individual pictures 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.580
 of the three development and become the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.950
 to tell the story finally 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.360
 becomes 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.250
 always just the numbers with the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.060
 individual pictures and not the months 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.250
 with the pictures 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.410
 No one can remember that 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.060
 and get to the end only abroad which 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.430
 is not sustainable and also no 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.319
 fun only with the practical 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.819
 confrontation in hunting if 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.099
 for example, the first box in the 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.340
 december january will have become 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.090
 So the picture is your own story 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.940
 automatically from the freshly laid 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.739
 make friends with the months of december january 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.080
 but only then connect 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.220
 or you will be their teacher and tells 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.040
 that every new month 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.940
 Okay, let's have some fun aside 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.910
 the individual pictures to the numbers 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.319
 in the month now is the skull ceiling place 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.670
 third month are slightly rosy 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.099
 approaches to fulfill 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.200
 in five sentences are the month of life 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.989
 canes already clearly visible 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.540
 these are now finished and finished 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.160
 if now for a buck live the basis 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.889
 for the week now one hears 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.320
 colloquially from the sixth 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.530
 Lebensmonat grows knob-like firstly 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.690
 belong without roses and so far 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.090
 everything under the button scalp 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.150
 respectively the buttons and have 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.940
 will fit in the seventh month of life 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.220
 buttons dried up in the eighth of the new 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.880
 First of all, this will be the profit of life 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.700
 discarded and in the ninth month of life 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.560
 will immediately belong to the fire or games 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.830
 now with roses the debts 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.800
 exactly one year later so in the 12th to 13th 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.750
 month in may june, the people will 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.750
 or apprentice perfect 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.390
 Now we have almost all ingredients for one 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.370
 good story is missing only a few 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.870
 information 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.560
 there is one in the profit development 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.960
 so called - variant of this - variant 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.210
 has no roses because she has that 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.370
 First, belong in eight to nine months 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.960
 do not throw off 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.000
 we call these blocks so 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.460
 called button presses and are the 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.460
 classic for every junior if this 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.320
 is invited on his first bock 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.580
 if there is one - variant so have 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.490
 we also have a plus version 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.380
 we are roses available speak 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.270
 that, first of all, was in the eighth to belong 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.470
 Ninth month dropped and we 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.200
 speak here of the so-called 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.470
 witness or first heard 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.240
 So the story she spoke 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.360
 Furthermore, the structure is divided into 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.949
 in three actions that on the one hand the 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.180
 three drop off 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.020
 secondly because so push the 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.920
 Bone structure covered by bast and 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.990
 third, the lack of the guest 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.500
 from the antlers drop to the finished 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.410
 Bock needed only two months to move 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.480
 whether box with his first hear or the 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.840
 plus variation in may with the apprentice 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.420
 belong or the following years 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.550
 It is only about two months 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:22.020
 pushed 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:26.370
 the period from the drop off over the 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:30.690
 push to finish commit 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:36.020
 In turn, it always takes from the 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.020
 plus variant in total about five months
