00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 cedar came to the exhibition mvc 2015 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.820
 thanks to our friends by intel 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.309
 asus and purge icons it was 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.070
 not easy but we did find a stall with seibu 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.520
 yourself is a smartphone that got very 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.199
 many awards on si and from 2015 here in our 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.230
 hands let's see what we ourselves 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.449
 I will immediately say what we say 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.650
 so early prototype engineering sample and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.720
 so there are such nuances 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.430
 something is not tacking on 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.810
 moving buttons is not very good 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.110
 pressed that is it is engineering 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.400
 sample but promise he will even 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.890
 waterproof so no gap 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.620
 naturally in the final instance to be 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.320
 should not and of course about the material 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.230
 if we talk here we have carbon here 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.160
 aluminum here again carbon protected 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.870
 glass is good speakers what does 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.300
 This smartphone as some have called 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.820
 probably universal swiss knife 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.059
 or the most running smartphone itâ€™s also 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.510
 Availability 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:08.200
 Now I will try to remove the presence of two 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.580
 card slots in 1 can be set 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.460
 up to one hundred twenty eight gigabytes 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.860
 its 2 + smartphone itself 64 gigabytes 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.189
 memory but as representatives told us 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.140
 Cyrus companies they say now 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.229
 work with on the disc and soon 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.790
 200 gigabytes each will be available 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.810
 slot that is you can put here 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.660
 400 and plus 64 we have it at almost half 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.450
 terabyte built-in storage honestly 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.700
 speaking for the first time I thought I personally 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.130
 wondered who it might be necessary 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.030
 but nevertheless it is a phone server on 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.740
 you can 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.130
 phone sysadmin on which you can 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.730
 to treat the sites until the end 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.620
 close 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.370
 from unique features which 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.960
 It was the first time that the entire cargo of the despla 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.540
 tear and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.510
 risking 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.540
 This is the ability to transfer pictures to 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.210
 TV for example in 1080p 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.210
 using a special chip which 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.960
 developed by silicon image 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.880
 yet he is like a prototype too 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.440
 not available to the masses and in 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.540
 TVs that do not have it yet, you see 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.900
 on TV such a dongle is connected 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.280
 it is exactly made to 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.970
 broadcast the image right now we 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.100
 watch video in full hd format and if 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.680
 we will leaf through here see i leaf through and 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.860
 all that we see happens very quickly 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.580
 on the display it is broadcast and on the screen 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.060
 there also if we run the game then we 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.820
 we can play right on the smartphone but 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:46.940
 look at your tv screen 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.980
 moreover they said that if others 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.330
 game developers will support this 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.330
 thought and of course the topic will be 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.520
 popular then the smartphone screen can 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.269
 enter some separate elements 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.630
 control and not duplicate the screen then 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.910
 have this technology supports 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.150
 split-screen you can buttons some 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.700
 manager to drive on the smartphone himself 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.660
 gameplay on your nike display 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.959
 on the TV screen 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.890
 Here is such a wonderful technology from 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.980
 characteristics worth saying here 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.100
 we dragon 801 probably because 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.040
 tested and did not want to risk here 3 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.610
 gigabytes of ram here full 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.310
 HD 5 inch display quality audio 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.830
 here is 21 megapixel main camera 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.830
 with optical stabilization on the sides 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.540
 there is everything that only the soul desires 10 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.890
 infrared there is even a scanner 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.930
 which unfortunately will need 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.430
 hold but nevertheless it is located 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.140
 in a convenient enough place to 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.120
 hold it with your finger as it will 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.830
 work naturally for now 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.569
 say we can not please many 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.609
 the location of the connector looked 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.739
 nick at the bottom of it so that's why 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.650
 love but u can say that cool what 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.890
 headset jack 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.540
 charging is located offset up when 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.790
 you play not to discharge 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.250
 battery cord will stick up here 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.349
 from here they are straight pn20 alternate by the way 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.230
 battery capacity here is 3100 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.420
 milliamper hours of this kind 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.889
 optimization should be enough for enough 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.889
 plenty of time and if you notice here 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:23.560
 android version is not the latest 44 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.880
 kitkat but without all add-ons then 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.789
 here you get 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.479
 the experience that google intended 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.070
 and we were told that over version 50 already 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.780
 work that is perhaps the nearest 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.050
 time she will appear too without any 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.830
 settings that is if you like 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.020
 directly naked android this 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.810
 smartphone you also nice cedars came 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.229
 to the mvc 2015 thanks to our 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.889
 friends of intel asus and 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.889
 Chistyakovoy and comp
