00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.150
 for the demented recipe 10 or muffins at 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.700
 chocolate and nuggets 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.039
 you need 150 g of flour 75 g of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.770
 semolina sugar in the spoon we have a 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.010
 pinch of salt you will need milk 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.730
 soup catch 100 g of nuggets 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.040
 chocolate 1/2 sachet of baking powder 1 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.510
 egg 50 g melted butter and units there 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.610
 the first thing you need to do 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.170
 it's preheat your oven to 200 Â° c 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:47.210
 what are we going to do now is m 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.210
 9 the melted butter 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.579
 so more milk so the the a4 qr1 is 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.129
 see there and we see now 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.129
 mix 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.950
 and that's what we get and we go 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.880
 look at that side 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:22.740
 then you take the flour on you 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:28.160
 stop adding the sugar as well as towards 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:35.210
 pinch of salt and half a bag 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.210
 about and then you mix well 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:49.440
 you add our first mix and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:53.450
 you mix in order to get a dough and 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:58.190
 the dough a movement this texture does not 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:05.630
 you break that it's normal 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:10.020
 then you add the two chocolates 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.739
 and you will see four levers for the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.680
 decor and that's it is already everything he me 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.870
 remains to leave them and to put 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.760
 oven and for that we will change the decor 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.350
 since I will go to my parents 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.989
 since in my apartment 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.660
 I do not have an oven adequate for 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.040
 leathers one finds oneself at home for the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.420
 dressage so it's very simple you 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.830
 take a spoon of pasta as 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:45.050
 these doubt quite well and then you 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:47.600
 put a spoon of nicolas in the center 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.900
 here 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.900
 and then a further course of pasta 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:06.560
 we are left with more than 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:09.290
 well- distributed chocolate chips and 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.080
 that's what we get is true that's the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.190
 leather twenty minutes to 200 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.900
 degrees that's what we get after 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.960
 baking 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.590
 so I'll I want to unmount it here 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.240
 our machine 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.700
 so it really is really very beautiful 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.830
 they are really very good and I already have 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.750

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.490
 really really awesome so here
