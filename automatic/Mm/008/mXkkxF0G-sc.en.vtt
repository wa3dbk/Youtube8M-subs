00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.670
 after as suggested by eric cantona 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.770
 to withdraw all the money in a year before 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.320
 I really think it's a bit like withdrawing money from 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.319
 banks - staff 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.529
 but that would be a good thing but on the other hand we have to think that is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.039
 winter someone who has a lot of money are we 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:19.920
 chairs the eu 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.300
 I do not see the problem in my opinion 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.060
 done there is the case and it's not huge 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.910
 in short the implement not especially the interest of this 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.380
 way is to put them back after 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.680
 for me it's not a lot of money it does not bother me to repeat it a year 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 while you withdraw our money from the banks yes 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.120
 for the entity 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.650
 a year ago to some problems of the Ecuadorian economy the country is 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.769
 ready to wear only problems 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.460
 I think I'll do it's done 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.500
 I find it quite ridiculous because his driver to everyone 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.420
 the pastor was traveling I'm going for a walk with my money six months and finally 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.200
 is it pleasant serving it to boyce - our hearts 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.450
 Anyway 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.000
 I do not agree and that the monetary system fans the system 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.890
 financial with people who would not play the network game earlier this 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.820
 scandal 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.670
 but that's not the right way to react right now this very a very 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 wrong way to react and to the extent to know the numbers have 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.760
 of what to do shopping or maybe not in any case he knows that more than 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.420
 everywhere in europe 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.120
 this will allow financial actions 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.049
 khelil discipline who play on the stock market 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.380
 and still 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.829
 on this total minimum from elsewhere but thanks to saab 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.850
 aaron wear 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.660
 further support projects in the third world even at our neighbors' 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.659
 solidarity projects 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.320
 not to dig into the question of the image of the pallet is autumnal in 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.200
 keeping only planned it's going to be very complicated 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.560
 Francois Hollande 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.280
 he passed for us 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.270
 twenty six new ideas for 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.570
 childhood for children these words moderate death on the world 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.530
 the pressure went a little bit and then 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.860
 the influential blog 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.320
 technically I think that 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.220
 this kind of operation me I always take a little bit like with a 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.810
 some distance no I think he has no way to live without the banks 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.709
 Nevertheless 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.220
 anyway it's to choose his 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.119
 at 1 5% 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.089
 provide 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.359
 here I do not think I'm here in this kind of 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:24.579
 the walkers 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.069
 because indeed if the goal 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.310
 starring to stabilize the system I think there will be consequences 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.069
 timekeeping shot for the saver actually that we do not report 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.540
 much to be putting his money in the banks right now rather 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.309
 amazing of are relatively low 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.739
 for a year for business think it's something else so if 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.949
 actually every saver was doing 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.189
 this action part to this action will be sabila maybe actually the 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.529
 banks the first employees would be the companies and then the 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.989
 innovative companies in their preface completely ridiculous it's 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.429
 good fun like that to my 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.939
 think it's not really achievable that it's kind of a bit utopian but like 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:57.950
 he is 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.510
 there is already enough kaohsiung 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.539
 she's 5 years old no I think that 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:04.739
 without complexity and the spirits 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.739
 the new members mentality 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.370
 mÃ©lanie 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.610
 but that's also why 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.910
 the cdc of the Akwa canton aside I do not want to say 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.640
 our fears 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.099
 the word that comes to mind mutualist 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.139
 I read the s5 by the announced s &amp; p is achievable quite hypocritical 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.379
 a system works like sony or their solutions yet
