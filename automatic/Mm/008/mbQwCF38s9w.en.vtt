00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
which i think is insane for this card i

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.040 
which i think is insane for this card i
even<00:00:31.650> though<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> very<00:00:32.130> good<00:00:32.250> card<00:00:32.640> i

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.880 
even though it is a very good card i
don't<00:00:34.050> think<00:00:34.079> anyone<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.530> paying<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
don't think anyone to be paying that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.770 
don't think anyone to be paying that
much<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> weekend<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.570> price

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
much but it is the weekend so the price

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.700 
much but it is the weekend so the price
is<00:00:36.809> plopping<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> little<00:00:37.410> bit<00:00:37.559> higher
