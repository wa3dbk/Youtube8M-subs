00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.600
 despite all I hope you are well no 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.820
 so we actually find ourselves in fact as indicated in the title it's for 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.789
 give the data of the types of lymphoma compared to the 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.789
 at the activity being the update as many points 14 that will be done 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.369
 so help out small flag leaks that already have 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.499
 commented appear on the net 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.479
 it happened leaks anyway score apparently no less than the feet 

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:25.470
 on a site not at war 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.109
 who apparently explained that rockstar rockstar pass that 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.379
 leaked or rock star side that gave 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:33.810
 already information 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.120
 donkalor but how's that going to give you information 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.120
 of clothing to the group on debts by translating them 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.020
 donkalor already a little novelty for that she updated a point 14 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.760
 we can put away your garage 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.550
 so for now we can do a matter in a way we will say 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.260
 Manual not as fast convincing as schoolchildren to tidy up the garage 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.000
 with them to be able to select vehicle 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.900
 and to be able to change his place directly but to get him out 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.900
 and get out their entry as we do the young appellants because currently 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.280
 in the update includes 14 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.799
 others he died while so many counters this fair elements 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.720
 military that will be added to the updated head in 3 14 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.770
 donkalor military elements did that mean uniform 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.600
 so I think we dress our subscribers the slim pants it's as much a level 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.950
 heroic life it will be played level uniform 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.100
 and shoes 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.590
 so it would have been more thimoté it has a side% 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.590
 we are no longer in the field military textile elements 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.950
 after then for them as students of the new races 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.490
 new missions 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.300
 in the high mission part so as I understand it apparently there will be 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.540
 possible missions with them 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.440
 in the case there will be the police 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.720
 for your permission from firefighters 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.770
 and percent and hospital 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.780
 indeed so what about the business of the towers 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360
 panetta the hospital is the debt that deals 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.110
 one of the wings the lower hospitals will also be possible surrender 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.759
 so basically empty it integrates the public functions into the show 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.929
 So here is 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:16.739
 after what else to say that I found then 8% a very good 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.879
 information 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.959
 we will tell them new customization has as usual it's not new 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:24.679
 we have a donation for our vehicles in May 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:29.519
 % also and then the event type factor to their assets well understood 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.229
 as well 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.229
 murat günak famous colors while everyone is waiting 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.529
 then the men's gold color for an allied time but not as we would not want 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:38.330
 really 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.719
 so their real carla the color of richard the most expensive 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.369
 for the car so with whom I also understood 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.309
 morally they could possibly later in the night two days a 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.789
 point press so there it does not repeat from a point 14 but later 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.009
 in the business 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.429
 so that means soon 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:03:00.139
 so here's after air continuously with a beta 3 new players 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.589
 tattoos that will be available as well as haircuts 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:08.199
 and then I filmed% and in the information to note them the big for 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.779
 to be ten years 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.450
 the big novelty of the report at age 14 raged to own a dog in 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:14.419
 made 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.469
 so then own a dog I think it's not ridiculous 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:21.829
 carreras - alu tickets headlights like everyone who played in the menu 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:22.629
 rens 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.669
 solo with franklin would provide the range 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:30.029
 and not at a given moment the mark-prone pattern is not decided in 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.509
 a lot of ngos we have to take care of 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.399
 so I think it's possible 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:37.809
 normally tibet understood his real wife so to lend who will have seen this 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.469
 not the related activities and sing dog races we do not know 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.189
 not align something like that 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.819
 but then normally listen to a teaser to information are good 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.319
 we will soon be able to own a dog I was in Pau the Malian 5 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.529
 so that's it bah listen I hope you're just recap before two 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:59.549
 wheels the facts then heavily removed the garage 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.729
 so in novelties for the major at the update still at 14 in the garage 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.259
 military elements 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:07.599
 new race mission 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.119
 suddenly their doors so percent year customization with them others 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:12.049
 accessories 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.339
 for customization 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.329
 tattoos shots 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.220
 and so the big update by the big novelty after owning a 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.870
 dog 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.920
 this is the listened I hope that its neighbors of this information must in 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:23.529
 more 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.659
 and then beaten you are not good at mashhad subscribe and then 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:29.130
 on that I say goodbye and see you soon for a future issue 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.170
 and do not forget he's on a little james tape a little say go fishing
