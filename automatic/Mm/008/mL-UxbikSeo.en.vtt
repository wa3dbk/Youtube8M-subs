00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.380
 hello hello all the rates rates matteo i 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.599
 you're a serious cricket I take care of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 barbecue of all that concerns the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.770
 cooking on peace 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
 you had a very trivial question 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.910
 perfect luck the perfect cooking is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.140
 the one you feel with your heart while 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 absolutely you crimi then you 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.750
 so try all the meats 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.210
 from the simplest simpler one 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.070
 deck allows some errors that other i 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.920
 cuts of meat born types of cute you 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.600
 instead they allow the strangest meat 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.390
 view you have to tell me on the street 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.059
 the crocodile and all crocodile 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.340
 they say he knows about his neck but his 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.440
 because to try if it happens to me 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.109
 the opportunity trying very interesting 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.270
 banditu around italy 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.990
 so whenever it goes in some 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.270
 place so you always try some 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.040
 particular meat you are clearly looking for 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.900
 to enhance the product and the area c 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.790
 I happen to grill Tuscan go 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.619
 obviously on a canine there are in 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.020
 piedmont i prefer beef limousine e 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.939
 obviously in my beautiful Modena and roses 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.060
 a micro with a tail pulled out by the king 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:29.280
 of the table times and makeup for 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.920
 then watch this video is fine 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.659
 quick view that audi you do courses at 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 as also to our school 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.310
 we also tell about these with the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.049
 project with models with taste and we have 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.980
 bari courses that did not go 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:48.310
 very well where the whole record 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:49.990
 he found five lessons inside 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.760
 of the project moderated with taste 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.400
 within four patro lessons 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.490
 courses we explore all types of 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.250
 all cooking methods also 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.450
 at school with a parliament and how 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.640
 what is your approach towards 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.310
 of the card my approach is a 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.130
 extreme respect for the raw material not 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.740
 I never go as far as to make beauty 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.870
 exhibition of techniques a raw material 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.120
 maybe perfect then perfect 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.820
 respecting the raw material with yours 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.070
 times what he said he comes 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.260
 right from the soul while grids succeeds 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.850
 to arrive at an excellent final result 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.570
 and the truth 10 that I also tear off the 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.540
 strange colored shirt that there and does 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.350
 but if a great eater goes too 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.960
 obviously a ditch the caricatures of 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.760
 all you meat fish fruit vegetables e 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.970
 we also have fewer sweeties at 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.350
 barbera but the use and cooking in 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.300
 then similarly direct what 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.760
 you can come in an oven and more 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.310
 providing a slight smoke go to 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.420
 transfer this no but the outlets on 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.360
 food also the center and what kind of wood 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.430
 each type of meat must be used 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.170
 recall a type of wood then veni of 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.239
 fruit will be more suitable for 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.430
 persistence focused on limiting it 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.440
 delicate others more robust hold up the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.459
 important brand to avoid absolutely 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.330
 conifers because all eco free only 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.780
 poison 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.120
 and what do you think of all those 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.370
 coals that devil those things there 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.790
 that are found sincerely anyway 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.380
 look for ease of execution and 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.950
 clear that one cannot always put oneself 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.930
 there we must also arrive at compromise 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.970
 you can get a great trip that 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.100
 over the years with a terrace bar with 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.310
 a clear ticino electric smoker 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.400
 time desire and possibility 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.410
 all the roads are down you know it is 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.320
 one was the second method in the 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.680
 Neolithic cuisine the grill does not have 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.730
 studied that if even a little 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.930
 probably the first one 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.420
 cooking occasion was when 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.850
 probably to a child in asia 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.990
 in the extreme asia helmet a bit of 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.230
 meat in the middle of the fire 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.360
 I imagine so been scolded by 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.430
 caveman written by me I eat it myself 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.959
 because you made it fall into the fire then 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.090
 maybe later, however, teaches me about the child 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.150
 ruined my deal the treat of 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.430
 and my credit and 15 certainly 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.210
 been a case etc. but it is a 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.990
 tool are you a spokesperson for one 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.970
 ancient cooking technique like man 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.500
 let's say and of the first with shaped 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.150
 the kitchen we had is the one with the 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.580
 support of Professor and the City 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.289
 instead 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.509
 of Indians free from c3 advice to the 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.909
 good then please Mr. 1 the first 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.500
 what and not underestimated compared to 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.819
 bring many vegetarians to the gods 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.060
 years of which does not go but in the end we do 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.669
 some vegetables instead there are some 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.629
 like to party more than they have a limited 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.550
 in fact, if you study it, it's time to menu a 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:07.409
 a small reissue of a report 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.990
 of parmesan should dance come 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.580
 grilled instead of fried then comes 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.250
 composed this tina tower with the 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.509
 fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.620
 a little live cooking in 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.039
 so that your networks are 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.409
 melt making love 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.539
 when you come to bring it to the table it comes 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.900
 almost valued better than many dishes 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.610
 I ask you one last question 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.800
 provocative final from the nightclubs 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.469
 although I am a great lover 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.150
 of the grill of course of the grillai 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:42.509
 however with the Syria in the Spanish countries 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.939
 but it is true that all this smoke this way 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.279
 it does not do very well that is to eat all the 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:50.159
 grilled days goes well beyond things 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.449
 it takes moderation is fine berlin yes 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.090
 you see a hard glass of pasta 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.430
 neither protection nor two bottles no good 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.110
 eat polenta once a 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.839

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.699
