like that they're gonna be soft supple

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.470 
like that they're gonna be soft supple
and<00:04:33.420> promote<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.780> soft<00:04:34.050> flex<00:04:35.240> another<00:04:36.240> thing

and promote a soft flex another thing

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.240 
and promote a soft flex another thing
that<00:04:36.840> helps<00:04:37.110> with<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.380> flex<00:04:37.620> it's<00:04:37.830> associate

that helps with the flex it's associate

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.310 
that helps with the flex it's associate
at<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.460> outer<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:39.240> going<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.900> be<00:04:40.020> what's

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
at the outer is going to be what's

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.000 
at the outer is going to be what's
called<00:04:40.380> an<00:04:40.620> articulating<00:04:41.280> cuff<00:04:42.860> let's<00:04:43.860> see<00:04:43.980> a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
called an articulating cuff let's see a

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.680 
called an articulating cuff let's see a
lot<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.340> boots<00:04:44.520> going<00:04:44.850> with<00:04:45.180> this<00:04:45.360> kind<00:04:45.600> of

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
lot of boots going with this kind of

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.900 
lot of boots going with this kind of
construction<00:04:46.110> nowadays<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:47.520> actually

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
construction nowadays it actually

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.340 
construction nowadays it actually
separates<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.570> upper<00:04:48.840> part<00:04:49.080> of<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.230> boot

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
separates the upper part of the boot

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.650 
separates the upper part of the boot
from<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.160> lower<00:04:50.340> part<00:04:50.640> of<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:50.790> boot<00:04:50.970> so<00:04:51.480> that

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
from the lower part of the boot so that

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.840 
from the lower part of the boot so that
the<00:04:51.810> boot<00:04:51.960> can<00:04:52.140> flex<00:04:52.440> more<00:04:53.010> like<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.220> hinge<00:04:53.610> on

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
the boot can flex more like a hinge on

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.240 
the boot can flex more like a hinge on
itself<00:04:54.420> and<00:04:54.900> you<00:04:55.230> don't<00:04:55.410> get<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.680> bunching<00:04:56.130> or

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
itself and you don't get the bunching or

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.590 
itself and you don't get the bunching or
the<00:04:56.610> crimping<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.180> would<00:04:57.300> typically

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
the crimping that you would typically

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.230 
the crimping that you would typically
get<00:04:57.930> in<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.230> instep<00:04:58.650> area<00:04:59.040> with<00:04:59.910> older

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
get in the instep area with older

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.850 
get in the instep area with older
traditional<00:05:00.960> boots<00:05:01.170> that<00:05:01.320> have<00:05:01.500> like

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
open hardware not eyelets you have to

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.510 
open hardware not eyelets you have to
feed<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.420> through<00:05:33.450> so<00:05:34.230> usually<00:05:34.800> use<00:05:34.920> pole<00:05:35.220> in

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520
