it's like a really I don't know it's
just<00:01:48.810> an<00:01:48.990> odd<00:01:49.200> situation<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:50.220> they<00:01:50.399> put<00:01:50.670> you

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
just an odd situation that they put you

00:01:50.819 --> 00:02:02.029 
just an odd situation that they put you
in<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.470> my<00:01:52.470> opinion<00:02:00.440> like<00:02:01.440> look<00:02:01.799> at<00:02:01.890> this

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
in in my opinion like look at this

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.649 
in in my opinion like look at this
bombardment<00:02:02.580> I<00:02:04.819> honestly<00:02:05.819> think<00:02:06.179> that<00:02:06.299> this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
bombardment I honestly think that this

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.029 
bombardment I honestly think that this
tower<00:02:07.020> um<00:02:07.610> is<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:10.200> little<00:02:10.739> bit<00:02:10.890> better

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
tower um is a little bit better

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.380 
tower um is a little bit better
