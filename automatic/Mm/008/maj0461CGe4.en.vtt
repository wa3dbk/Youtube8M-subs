00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.719 
basically like if someone Baylor's me i
can<00:01:59.720> still<00:02:00.410> do<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.709> loop<00:02:00.860> very<00:02:01.129> consistently

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
can still do the loop very consistently

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.630 
can still do the loop very consistently
i<00:02:02.030> do<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.959> MSTS<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:03.770> here<00:02:03.950> in<00:02:04.099> some<00:02:04.280> back<00:02:04.429> room

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
i do to MSTS just here in some back room

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.529 
i do to MSTS just here in some back room
because<00:02:04.910> it<00:02:04.940> helps<00:02:05.349> the<00:02:06.349> pot<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.619> avarice

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
because it helps the pot of avarice

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.940 
because it helps the pot of avarice
reinforcement<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.629> army<00:02:08.690> helps<00:02:09.649> then<00:02:09.800> my

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
reinforcement of the army helps then my

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.940 
reinforcement of the army helps then my
deck<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.190> helps<00:02:10.879> with<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.090> loop<00:02:11.300> also

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
deck and helps with the loop also

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.320 
deck and helps with the loop also
because<00:02:12.950> junk<00:02:13.190> forward<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.670> maroney<00:02:13.940> captain

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
because junk forward and maroney captain

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.770 
because junk forward and maroney captain
are<00:02:14.420> warriors

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
are warriors

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.840 
are warriors
the<00:02:16.260> basic<00:02:16.650> monster<00:02:17.069> reborn<00:02:17.160> heavy<00:02:17.580> storm

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
the basic monster reborn heavy storm

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.449 
the basic monster reborn heavy storm
dark<00:02:18.120> hole<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:19.290> only<00:02:19.530> trap<00:02:19.920> card<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.250> play

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
dark hole and the only trap card I play

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.809 
dark hole and the only trap card I play
is<00:02:20.700> solemn<00:02:21.030> judgment<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:22.280> my<00:02:23.280> reason<00:02:23.640> behind

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
is solemn judgment and my reason behind

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.400 
is solemn judgment and my reason behind
that<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.180> because<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.480> kind<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.720> use<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> maxies

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
that is because I kind of use the maxies

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.460 
that is because I kind of use the maxies
as<00:02:25.800> trap<00:02:26.430> cards<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.000> they<00:02:27.600> usually<00:02:28.080> slow

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
as trap cards and they usually slow

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.840 
as trap cards and they usually slow
people<00:02:28.800> down<00:02:28.830> unless<00:02:29.130> they're<00:02:29.370> going<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.700> kill

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850
