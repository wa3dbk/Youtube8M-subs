00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.920 
know they know one so
they<00:02:05.630> looked<00:02:05.870> through<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.110> glass<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.930> while

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
they looked through a glass and while

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.840 
they looked through a glass and while
the<00:02:09.110> glass<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:10.100> lens<00:02:10.310> might<00:02:10.610> be<00:02:10.760> the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
the glass and the lens might be the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.110 
the glass and the lens might be the
right<00:02:11.030> strength<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:13.010> distortion<00:02:13.610> lies<00:02:13.940> in

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
right strength the distortion lies in

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.620 
right strength the distortion lies in
the<00:02:14.240> brain<00:02:14.860> behind<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.100> lens<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:17.480> is

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
the brain behind the lens and that is

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.170 
the brain behind the lens and that is
what<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.840> see
