00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.750
 hello how about all my dear friends 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.550
 welcome to this new tutorial in the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.119
 which are we going to learn something very 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.410
 important and interesting and well before 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.090
 start the tutorial I want them 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.380
 invite them to join the group of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.900
 facebook which I leave in the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.310
 description of the video and they like me 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 new page that just created and then 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.650
 Now let's start good, then all 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.890
 we know that windows 7 is classified in 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.870
 different versions be it windows 7 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.110
 professional starter 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.850
 ultimate home premium or basic and then 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.520
 to have each one of them we must 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.730
 have the iso image 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.190
 of each of them is worth the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.840
 redundancy and what are we going to do in this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.290
 video because in this video I'm going to 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.220
 teach how to have all the versions 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.229
 in a single image did or in a single / 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.840
 Well, what we need would be the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.180
 ultra iso program which left the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.729
 link in the description of the video and the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.660
 image did here in my case I already have a 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.440
 of any edition of windows 7 this 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.050
 tutorial I will use it windows 7 starter 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.090
 then let's start we open our 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.030
 ultra-low program and 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.859
 which we will use to edit the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.980
 then the image did give me a file 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:38.580
 open 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.910
 and we locate here is located the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.190
 image did of our windows 7 and the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.700
 we open then we appear these 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.970
 folders here on this side and we give 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.190
 we select the source folder and then 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.210
 on the right side we select 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.970
 any and we press the key 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.290
 which will position us in this file 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.720
 which has name and point cfg then 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.080
 this file we give you right click and what 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.420
 we eliminated and that would be the entire edition 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.660
 of the one the image did then now 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.170
 we give in saving 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.760
 and we will wait for the end of the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.130
 process meanwhile I would put it 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.700
 pause the video and I'll come back when and 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.700
 has finished 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.960
 ok it was about to end 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.660
 these moments and it's over then 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.850
 Now we can close the program and 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.850
 we will see that we have created a file 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.740
 which is a backup of the previous state 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.020
 of the image then I'm not interested in that 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.700
 I'm going to eliminate it and this would be the 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.430
 modified then now let's 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.740
 simulate the installation with the program 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.180
 virtual box we are going to do accounts that 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.450
 you are already installing it in a 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.450
 computer 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.800
 here we are going to create it and the virtual machine 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.530
 we hope and now if we are going to start 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:05.840
 here we are going to count as 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.060
 we are installing it on a computer 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.350
 let's select the image made that 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.950
 we have edited 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.950
 what is this we give in next and we start 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.890
 ok because here it says windows is 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.890
 loading the files let's wait 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.549
 and here is beginning we give the following 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.710
 we leave this by default and we give it in 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.410
 install now 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.480
 and it tells us that the program 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.280
 installation is starting let's 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.220
 wait a little bit more 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.819
 and here is the good and the 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.790
 interesting and the wonderful thing is that here 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.500
 we have to select the system 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.260
 operative that we want to install here 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.540
 we have the five editions or versions 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.430
 we only select for example me here 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.519
 I have selected the ultimate and I give it 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.829
 in next and it will begin to 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.049
 install here says we accept the pse 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.760
 we accept the contract we accept the 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.060
 contract and we give you the following and everything 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.300
 would be normal and would install would say the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.010
 ultimate version ok then this would be 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.680
 everything in this tutorial the truth I hope 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.050
