playing well the organ wouldn't sound

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.970 
playing well the organ wouldn't sound
quite<00:04:01.760> complete<00:04:02.299> if<00:04:02.840> we<00:04:03.049> played<00:04:03.319> it<00:04:03.500> exactly

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
quite complete if we played it exactly

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.339 
quite complete if we played it exactly
what<00:04:04.130> he's<00:04:04.310> doing<00:04:04.549> on<00:04:05.150> that<00:04:05.510> recording

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
what he's doing on that recording

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.390 
what he's doing on that recording
because<00:04:06.560> all<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.890> instruments<00:04:07.310> are<00:04:07.340> going

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
because all the instruments are going

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.770 
because all the instruments are going
together<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:08.060> we're<00:04:08.209> trying<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.480> make<00:04:08.630> this

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
together so we're trying to make this

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.620 
together so we're trying to make this
sound<00:04:08.989> good<00:04:09.319> as<00:04:09.500> a<00:04:09.530> piano<00:04:09.950> solo<00:04:10.340> okay<00:04:10.849> so<00:04:11.360> f

octave

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.499 

we<00:04:19.819> go<00:04:19.940> back<00:04:20.090> to<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:21.819> to<00:04:22.819> the<00:04:22.850> same<00:04:23.180> minor

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
we go back to a to the same minor

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.820 
we go back to a to the same minor
coordinate<00:04:24.380> in<00:04:24.500> here<00:04:24.770> okay

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.260 

you<00:04:28.830> were<00:04:28.949> doing<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.190> C<00:04:29.430> quarter<00:04:29.759> we<00:04:29.880> did<00:04:30.030> over

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
you were doing the C quarter we did over

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
you were doing the C quarter we did over
here

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
here

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.410 
here
so<00:04:32.740> that's<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.130> city<00:04:33.340> now<00:04:33.820> here<00:04:34.060> we<00:04:34.150> give<00:04:34.300> to

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
so that's the city now here we give to

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.600 
so that's the city now here we give to
an<00:04:34.540> E<00:04:34.750> major<00:04:35.560> chord<00:04:35.910> all<00:04:36.910> right<00:04:37.060> so<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:38.280> have<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.340> 2

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
an E major chord all right so I have a 2

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.000 
an E major chord all right so I have a 2
there<00:04:39.850> because<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.240> happens<00:04:40.570> two<00:04:40.780> times<00:04:41.020> so<00:04:41.290> er

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
there because it happens two times so er

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.500 
there because it happens two times so er
the<00:04:42.250> right<00:04:42.760> is<00:04:42.880> gonna<00:04:43.060> be<00:04:43.210> Nietzsche<00:04:43.780> sharp

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
the right is gonna be Nietzsche sharp

00:04:45.510 --> 00:05:02.160 
the right is gonna be Nietzsche sharp
all<00:04:46.510> right<00:04:49.950> it's<00:04:50.950> two<00:04:51.130> times<00:05:00.780> like<00:05:01.780> those<00:05:01.930> two

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
all right it's two times like those two

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:17.920 
all right it's two times like those two
times<00:05:02.440> now<00:05:03.070> let's<00:05:03.760> do<00:05:03.910> what<00:05:04.030> we<00:05:04.090> have<00:05:04.300> this<00:05:04.510> far

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.390 

we're<00:05:18.169> going<00:05:18.290> to<00:05:18.350> repeat<00:05:18.620> back<00:05:18.860> that's<00:05:19.310> a

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
we're going to repeat back that's a

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.740 
we're going to repeat back that's a
repeat<00:05:19.699> sign<00:05:19.910> it's<00:05:20.150> my<00:05:20.270> way<00:05:20.449> of<00:05:20.570> writing

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
repeat sign it's my way of writing

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.840 
repeat sign it's my way of writing
repeat<00:05:21.199> I'm<00:05:21.590> gonna<00:05:21.740> go<00:05:21.889> back<00:05:22.100> when<00:05:22.490> we<00:05:22.610> get<00:05:22.729> to

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
repeat I'm gonna go back when we get to

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.120 
repeat I'm gonna go back when we get to
the<00:05:22.970> asterisk<00:05:23.479> we're<00:05:24.259> gonna<00:05:24.380> skip<00:05:24.680> over<00:05:24.860> and

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
the asterisk we're gonna skip over and

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:34.930 
the asterisk we're gonna skip over and
doom<00:05:25.250> here<00:05:25.580> okay<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:26.090> let's<00:05:26.330> go<00:05:26.479> back

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.220 

skip<00:05:35.900> over<00:05:36.080> to<00:05:36.200> here<00:05:36.530> do<00:05:37.040> the<00:05:37.220> e1<00:05:37.790> see<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:38.480> e<00:05:38.510> do

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
skip over to here do the e1 see the e do

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:47.410 
skip over to here do the e1 see the e do
this<00:05:39.410> one<00:05:41.680> yeah<00:05:45.640> you<00:05:46.640> think<00:05:46.760> II<00:05:46.940> wanted<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.210> do

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
this one yeah you think II wanted to do

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.170 
this one yeah you think II wanted to do
the<00:05:47.540> a1<00:05:48.020> which<00:05:48.320> is<00:05:48.350> this<00:05:48.620> one

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.440 

and<00:05:51.300> then<00:05:51.480> eat<00:05:52.460> now<00:05:53.460> we<00:05:53.910> would<00:05:54.090> do<00:05:54.210> this

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
and then eat now we would do this

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.960 
and then eat now we would do this
pattern<00:05:55.050> if<00:05:55.200> we're<00:05:55.770> going<00:05:55.920> verse<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.580> verse<00:05:56.610> to

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
pattern if we're going verse to verse to

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.850 
pattern if we're going verse to verse to
verse<00:05:57.000> if<00:05:57.270> we<00:05:57.360> keep<00:05:57.480> doing<00:05:57.630> vs.<00:05:58.140> I<00:05:58.350> think

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
verse if we keep doing vs. I think

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.090 
verse if we keep doing vs. I think
sometimes<00:05:59.340> when<00:05:59.520> they<00:05:59.640> have<00:06:00.590> if<00:06:01.590> you<00:06:01.890> want<00:06:02.040> to

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
sometimes when they have if you want to

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.130 
sometimes when they have if you want to
do<00:06:02.160> that<00:06:02.310> little<00:06:02.460> interlude<00:06:02.880> okay<00:06:03.750> that<00:06:03.990> the

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
do that little interlude okay that the

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.160 
do that little interlude okay that the
band<00:06:04.560> does<00:06:04.830> in<00:06:05.160> between<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:06.120> verses<00:06:06.300> then<00:06:07.020> you

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
band does in between the verses then you

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:25.540 
band does in between the verses then you
would<00:06:07.320> have<00:06:11.720> that<00:06:12.720> eat<00:06:13.020> you<00:06:13.560> come<00:06:13.770> in<00:06:13.920> here

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.960 

I<00:06:26.020> think<00:06:27.020> you<00:06:27.170> would<00:06:27.320> strike<00:06:27.620> the

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.270 

let<00:06:30.570> me<00:06:30.660> go<00:06:30.780> through<00:06:30.960> it<00:06:31.050> so<00:06:31.200> I<00:06:31.260> can<00:06:31.290> clearly

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
let me go through it so I can clearly
