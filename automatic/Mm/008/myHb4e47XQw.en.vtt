biggest things that he keeps harping on

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.750 
biggest things that he keeps harping on
you<00:03:34.860> guys<00:03:35.099> about<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:37.010> would<00:03:38.010> say<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.519> thing

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
you guys about I would say the thing

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.400 
you guys about I would say the thing
that<00:03:38.910> he<00:03:39.030> stresses<00:03:39.629> to<00:03:39.840> everybody<00:03:40.290> before

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
that he stresses to everybody before

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.380 
that he stresses to everybody before
every<00:03:40.769> practice<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.340> getting<00:03:41.970> better<00:03:42.150> getting

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
every practice is getting better getting

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.309 
every practice is getting better getting
better<00:03:42.690> than<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:42.930> were<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.170> day<00:03:43.230> before

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
better than we were the day before

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.449 
better than we were the day before
getting<00:03:43.920> better<00:03:44.099> and<00:03:44.489> we<00:03:45.120> were<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.360> holy<00:03:45.540> and

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
getting better and we were the holy and

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.229 
getting better and we were the holy and
I<00:03:47.459> think<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:49.019> yeah<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:49.410> improving<00:03:50.239> being

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
I think that so yeah so improving being

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.759 
I think that so yeah so improving being
physical<00:03:51.690> going<00:03:52.019> out<00:03:52.140> there<00:03:52.380> hearing

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
physical going out there hearing

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.319 
physical going out there hearing
football<00:03:53.220> just<00:03:54.140> making<00:03:55.140> it<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.290> man's<00:03:55.560> game<00:03:55.829> and

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
football just making it a man's game and

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.470 
football just making it a man's game and
I<00:03:57.650> would<00:03:58.650> probably<00:03:58.799> say<00:03:59.150> yeah<00:04:00.150> those<00:04:00.360> are

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
I would probably say yeah those are

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.369 
I would probably say yeah those are
those<00:04:00.510> are<00:04:00.750> probably<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.170> two<00:04:01.260> most

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
those are probably the two most

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.050 
those are probably the two most
important<00:04:01.920> things<00:04:02.099> that<00:04:02.310> all<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.910> coaches

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
important things that all the coaches

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.860 
important things that all the coaches
stressed<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.599> us<00:04:03.629> is<00:04:03.870> improving

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
stressed to us is improving

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.120 
stressed to us is improving
probably<00:04:06.870> just<00:04:06.960> making<00:04:07.650> sure<00:04:07.830> your<00:04:07.980> head<00:04:08.100> is

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
probably just making sure your head is

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.100 
probably just making sure your head is
in<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.430> game<00:04:08.550> as<00:04:08.730> well<00:04:08.880> it's<00:04:09.720> not<00:04:09.840> making

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
in the game as well it's not making

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.390 
in the game as well it's not making
mental<00:04:10.500> errors<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:11.270> letting<00:04:12.270> your
