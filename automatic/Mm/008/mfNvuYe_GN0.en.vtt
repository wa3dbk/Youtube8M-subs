 growth and multiplication of 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.890
 cells throughout the descent 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.960
 to the roots that develop and 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.900

 digestive that the great wise they are 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.280
 mainly frugivorous the book you 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.930
 will serve as a support for learning to 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.550
 to do double u the fins is to
