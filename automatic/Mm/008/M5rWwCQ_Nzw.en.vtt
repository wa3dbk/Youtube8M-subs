00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 April of '90 my nose operated coke 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.040
 actor also speaker also that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.870
 always seriously but you also went to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.849
 many castings because I wanted to be an actor 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.330
 of three series but something happened that did not 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.369
 it was not much casting of what 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.400
 they are commercial already but I do not represent 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.160
 the abc1 stereotype and people need 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 see in their houses then there is no 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 none is none left and was 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.210
 more than 300 casting but you were 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.350
 extra in a lot on many occasions 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.350
 a very beautiful stage 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.930
 The first is that I had the opportunity to 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:50.580
 be something audiovisual and so movie of 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.580
 santiago our people 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:03.629
 extra people are dedicated to that I 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:03.629
 I worked with him and hereafter 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.040
 extra 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.540
 our respect to the world efe and the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:22.700
 discriminated against gave them different food 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:28.760
 but not the actors give coca-cola and the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:31.670
 another one gives a discriminated brand but 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.080
 a significant contribution for chile 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.970
 the extras because if one day they look at 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.080
 the teleseries in things are the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:44.170
 same extras always the truth is 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.170
 they dedicate and it's a world and they enjoy it 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.310
 I was very good for the PS and always 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.140
 they stop asking me for a party and one day 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.420
 33 is in the same series on the same day 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:59.950
 and all three of the pp and now I had to 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.950
 make a notepad and look at them 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.069
 ah 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.290
 and I'm stunned 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.900
 but that's already happened now you're famous for 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.950
 sovereign sovereign visit has changed you 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.780
 life in practice that if you're a lot 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.010
 especially as soon as you hit them now 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.720
 happens upside down I had shows the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.240
 résumé that this one when it arrives now 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.490
 the rest as they already know you already and 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.780
 you have to uncheck new repentant 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.790
 I feel like iker was sticking a lot in a 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.400
 side is not good for one who wants to be 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.470
 actor but I love you not as it is said 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.110
 how to be known as well as suddenly 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.220
 they look at you so much but I already learned that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.080
 is that they are prepared to the street that 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.190
 is the well-dressed in perfumed and 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.450
 willing to greet all those who 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.660
 I have been up to date with many 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.510

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.010

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.450
