back<00:00:25.539> but<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:26.690> hype<00:00:26.869> around<00:00:27.080> that<00:00:27.470> shoot<00:00:27.770> is

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.070 
so minimal I think you can get them on
eBay<00:00:29.810> for<00:00:29.840> like<00:00:30.080> 120<00:00:30.800> bucks<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:31.789> shoe<00:00:32.080> you

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
enough how hard it is to find the bigger

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.450 
enough how hard it is to find the bigger
sizes<00:01:09.229> of<00:01:09.590> these<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.770> was<00:01:10.039> talking<00:01:10.340> with<00:01:10.399> a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
sizes of these I was talking with a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.529 
sizes of these I was talking with a
couple<00:01:10.670> people<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.090> typically<00:01:11.390> what<00:01:11.509> happens

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
couple people and typically what happens

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.690 
couple people and typically what happens
especially<00:01:12.259> with<00:01:12.350> concept<00:01:12.799> releases<00:01:13.219> all<00:01:13.520> the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
especially with concept releases all the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.389 
especially with concept releases all the
smaller<00:01:13.939> sizes<00:01:14.259> are<00:01:15.259> easier<00:01:15.649> to<00:01:15.710> find<00:01:15.799> because

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
smaller sizes are easier to find because

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:17.889 
smaller sizes are easier to find because
they<00:01:16.520> go<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.700> resellers<00:01:17.240> from<00:01:17.359> sellers<00:01:17.719> know

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899

that<00:01:18.200> sizes<00:01:18.950> 8<00:01:19.189> to<00:01:19.430> 10<00:01:19.700> are<00:01:20.000> quick<00:01:20.329> flip<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.689> lot

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
that sizes 8 to 10 are quick flip a lot

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.719 
that sizes 8 to 10 are quick flip a lot
of<00:01:21.020> people<00:01:21.229> are<00:01:21.350> looking<00:01:21.439> for<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:21.859> but

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
of people are looking for that but

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.639
