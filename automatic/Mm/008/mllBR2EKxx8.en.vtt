 Lithuanian everyone knows what I had there 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.160
 many bugs doofig tailbone box 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.500
 buildings which made up 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.650
 and with Kurchatov there more such 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.690
 interesting building varied 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.580
 realistic i will be reading 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.900
 number of residents write street names 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.900
 and so on, in principle, all by 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.690
 realistic I will try to do and here 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.130
 and basically now i built one of 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.010
 real buildings which is in 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.200
 Pripyat still what for cities cities Russia 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.759
 there is no rain 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.579
 but its this in principle let's 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.610
 see our first residential building then 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.110
 five-story building here's the name I don't know but in 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.289
 principle, there are the same pripyat 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.909
 not exactly the same approximate here from so 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.189
 five-storey building look like it I was in 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.649
 the project Russian city maykrafte too 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.619
 quite a long time ago it was almost a year 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.170
 back here's how time flies fast 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.420
 Now we will fly around and now this is impossible 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.759
 call Khrushchev it all this here I do not 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.649
 I remember the name of the five-story building Well 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.200
 so it looks like this is our five-story building 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.799
 not 6 front five floors jackpot guessed 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.569
 Well, then I'm here we hang such wires 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.160
 that is, the creak of the board I was not here 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.640
 we have everything to bring what we are 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.319
 wires hang in a different network here's the way to 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.750
 there is a roof and let's go our 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.239
 the first parade by the way here you have 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.430
 billboard information guard reside 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.660
 120 people in the city only but it 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.940
 naturally in this building 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.579
 here if you copy a lot 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.340
 important buildings to build 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.060
 principle city status city status 13 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.359
 thousand inhabitants 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.519
 you let's say let's go down building here 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.680
 there are only two of us such a vicious corridor 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.480
 block in general there are very small apartments 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.750
 the buildings turned out so small but 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.470
 cozy that's what i said almost 6 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.160
 months ago coziness is the main thing well 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.440

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.889
 according to the standard, there is a stove and here we can 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.810
 eat here and the room looks tact with us

 the other apartments here are well, here we are 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.069
 months of the stairs with windows like this 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.629
