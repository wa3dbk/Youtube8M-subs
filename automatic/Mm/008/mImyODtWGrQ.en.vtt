00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:22.643
-	Good evening, dear viewers, welcome the “The Business Sharks” show!

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:28.255
-	Well, actually it was a little introduction as I’ve decided

00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:31.627
to do my first video blog about team Na`Vi,

00:00:31.627 --> 00:00:36.635
our adventures and everything interesting we got here as well as our plans.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:40.441
-	First of all, we’ll talk about our Counter-Strike team

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.049
and their performance at GameGune 2012.

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:48.620
I can definitely say that the team was prepared decently;

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.686
they practiced for about 10-14 days with 7 of them being at LAN.

00:00:54.686 --> 00:01:00.680
That’s why they did their best, but as you can see

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.577
right now team fnatic feel themselves pretty comfortable

00:01:06.577 --> 00:01:12.739
and they are very hard to beat for the past two months or so.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.068
Yet, as you can remember, the same way team SK did,

00:01:15.068 --> 00:01:17.947
before they started to fade out very quickly.

00:01:17.947 --> 00:01:20.926
I hope we will be able to find a key to their fortress soon

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:22.411
and fight them in the nearest tournaments.

00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:27.810
-	Speaking about tournaments that Na`Vi will attend in 2012,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.334
there will be TechLabs in the end of September,

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:36.580
Dreamhack in Romania in October, maybe we will also attend

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.654
DreamHack in Valencia, a tournament in Portugal,

00:01:40.654 --> 00:01:45.346
ASUS Cup (hi to d1monn) and most probably DH Winter.

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:48.077
This is a minimum of 6 events that we plan to attend.

00:01:48.077 --> 00:01:52.817
-	Now let’s move to our DOTA 2 squad and our recent matches

00:01:52.817 --> 00:01:56.718
where we had stand-ins, a lot of hassles and things like that…

00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:00.982
I’d like to clearly dispel all the rumors that the team is not ready

00:02:00.982 --> 00:02:06.459
and stuff like that. I mean, there was a lot of flame about it on the internet.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:11.963
The situation is easy to explain: Slavic teams play worse online than on LAN.

00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:17.566
That is just a fact. No matter what you say, it’s just a matter of mentality,

00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:20.591
psychology and preparation that the guys just cannot to give-it-all playing online.

00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:25.913
They simply can’t. That’s why Na`Vi always practice bootcamps,

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:29.951
always before every event, all of gaming squads in 90% of times

00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:35.115
do bootcamping. That’s why it’s not correct to say smth like

00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:39.194
“the team is underperforming, it’s f**ked up”, etc.

00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:42.609
I think it’s very subjective opinion and The International will show

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:48.423
“who is who” and what place team Na`Vi has in the food chain.

00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:51.905
Right after we can discuss it on a serious note.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.670
-	Now let’s speak about League of Legends squad

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.680
that attended OGN in Korea and showed very sloppy and bad result –

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.435
we didn’t even qualify for the most prestigious League of Legends Season 2

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:11.489
tournament in Seattle (at the same time with The International).

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.767
Well, we definitely take it as a fail as organization,

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:17.240
but it’s still a priceless experience for us.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.548
I think you should expect some new and interesting statements

00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:24.377
as to our League of Legends expansion in the next few days.

00:03:24.377 --> 00:03:27.306
-	I am constantly being asked about StarCraft 2 squad

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.409
and here you got my answer: no matter what,

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.418
but in 2013 Na`Vi will have its own SC2 team.

00:03:32.418 --> 00:03:35.647
It will be announced either in the last month of 2012

00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:38.798
or in the first month of 2013, that’s for sure.

00:03:38.798 --> 00:03:41.545
We are going to expand to SC2 team.

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:48.006
-	Now, if you have any interesting questions to ask,

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:51.529
what should I talk about, etc, then please

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:55.295
leave your comments on the website or YouTube channel.

00:03:55.295 --> 00:03:57.322
I will be glad to receive your feedback.

00:03:57.322 --> 00:03:59.753
Have a good week and weekend, good bye!
