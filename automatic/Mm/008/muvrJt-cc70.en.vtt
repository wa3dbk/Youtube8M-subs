00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.010
Today I will be making paneer pakoras.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.920
Marinated paneer dipped in batter

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.680
and deep fry makes a delicious appetizer.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.260
This pakoras are very addicting.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.540
This can be served also snack with hot cup of tea.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.820
Anyway you serve paneer pakoras, they taste great.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.080
This recipe will make 14 to 16 pakoras.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.900
To make them we will need:

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.040
About 4 oz of paneer

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.220
Paneer is available in every Indian grocery store.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.240
I have already sliced them in thin slices.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.160
They are about 1/8 inch thick.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.560
For batter we need

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.260
1/2 cup of besan or gram flour

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.500
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds (jeera)

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.659
1/2 teaspoon of salt

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.010
About 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.230
For marinating the paneer we will need

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.210
2 tablespoons of yogurt (dahi)

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.960
3 tablespoons of cornstarch or arrowroot powder

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.100
About 1 tablespoon of finely chopped cilantro (hara dhania)

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.920
1 teaspoon of ginger paste

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.800
1 finely chopped green chilli

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.120
And 1/2 teaspoon of salt

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.400
First I will make the yogurt paste to marinate the paneer.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.180
Yogurt

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840
Cornstarch

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.460
Salt

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.080
Green chilli

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.320
Ginger paste

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.080
Cilantro

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.460
And now mix it well.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.860
This paste is ready and now I am going to put the paneer.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.700
Put the paneer very gently and mix them well.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.980
So all the paneer pieces are coated with the yogurt.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.180
Paneer pieces have been really coated well with yogurt paste.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.680
Now I am going to leave this for at least an hour

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.540
so paneer is marinated really well.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.580
Now I will make the batter to make pakoras

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.820
and this batter should be very thick.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.320
Besan

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.740
Cumin seeds

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.620
Salt

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.840
And baking soda.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.800
Mix it well.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.180
And break all the lumps.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.560
Add the water slowly

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.220
because we need to make sure the batter is very thick.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.880
Whip the batter for about 2 minutes

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.500
and I have used about 1/4 cup of water.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.000
As you see it is very thick batter.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.100
And batter is ready.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.340
And now we will be making the pakoras.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.500
I am ready to make pakoras.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.800
I have marinated 1 batch of paneer

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.640
about 2 hours before.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.360
Oil should be moderately hot.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.860
You should have about 1 inch of oil in the frying pan.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.840
And now first I am going to test the oil if it is ready.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.560
So just put 1 drop of batter

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.940
and it should sizzle and come up.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.420
And not change the color.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.800
So this looks really good.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.180
Dip 1 paneer piece at a time in the batter

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.760
and just drop it slowly.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.760
Next one.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.260
If oil is very hot then pakoras will get brown very quick

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.820
and they won’t be crisp.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.720
When you are putting the paneer in the frying pan

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.740
they shouldn’t be over crowded.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.720
So they are looking good and floating on the top.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.000
So now I am going to turn them over.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.720
And you need to turn them few times

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.340
till they are golden brown both sides.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.620
Which should take about 3-4 minutes.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.720
This has been about 2 minutes.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.040
And as you see it’s coming out really good.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.580
Pakoras should be deep golden brown

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.420
And I think it will take just another minute.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.920
It has been already 4 minutes.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.280
Since I have started it.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.140
Paneer pakoras are ready and looking really nice color.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.000
So it’s time to take them out.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.500
They look very crunchy.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.780
Paneer pakoras are looking great, very tempting.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.700
They are crispy outside and soft inside.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.740
After you make these pakoras once your family

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.480
will request you again and again to make more.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.540
These pakoras I like to serve them with

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.740
hari cilantro chutney or tamarind chutney.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.220
Both chutneys recipe you can see on my website.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.260
Today I will be serving them with hot cup of chai.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.020
Chai and pakora is just a great combination.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.540
Enjoy.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.520
Thank you.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.700
