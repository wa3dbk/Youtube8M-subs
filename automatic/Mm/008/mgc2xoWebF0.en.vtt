one we're going to look at something
that's<00:00:21.830> very<00:00:22.430> close<00:00:22.640> to<00:00:22.760> my<00:00:22.970> heart<00:00:23.240> something

that<00:00:23.810> I<00:00:23.840> use<00:00:24.020> a<00:00:24.050> lot<00:00:24.380> and<00:00:24.650> that<00:00:25.279> is<00:00:25.580> muting

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
that I use a lot and that is muting

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.630 
that I use a lot and that is muting
specifically<00:00:27.470> palm<00:00:27.800> muting<00:00:28.189> with<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:28.430> right

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640

simple<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.500> major<00:01:12.710> chord<00:01:20.950> now<00:01:21.950> you'll<00:01:22.130> notice

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
simple a major chord now you'll notice

simple a major chord now you'll notice
that<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.670> pinkie<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.119> moving<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.720> help<00:01:23.960> mute

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
that the pinkie is moving to help mute

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.319 
that the pinkie is moving to help mute
those<00:01:24.710> strings<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.460> between<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.000> they<00:01:26.119> don't

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
those strings in between so they don't

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.230 
those strings in between so they don't
unexpectedly<00:01:27.110> ring<00:01:27.439> out<00:01:27.590> I'm<00:01:28.240> relaxing

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
pressure also with this chord not taking

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.929 
pressure also with this chord not taking
them<00:01:33.500> off<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.829> strings<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:34.460> relaxing

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
them off the strings but just relaxing

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.450

pressure<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:35.479> between<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.530> that<00:01:36.799> like<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:37.250> said

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
pressure in between so that like I said

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.399 
pressure in between so that like I said
they<00:01:37.790> don't<00:01:37.970> unexpectedly<00:01:38.720> ring<00:01:39.049> out<00:01:39.200> if

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409

to move the strings the low strings way
back<00:02:01.189> here<00:02:01.490> at<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.700> bridge

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
back here at the bridge

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.310 
back here at the bridge
if<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:03.110> mute<00:02:03.289> it<00:02:03.409> too<00:02:03.590> high<00:02:04.899> you<00:02:05.899> get<00:02:06.049> nothing

if you mute it too far back you get just

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.430 
if you mute it too far back you get just
open<00:02:10.459> strings<00:02:10.789> it<00:02:11.300> has<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.630> be<00:02:11.720> way<00:02:11.930> back<00:02:12.170> here

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
open strings it has to be way back here

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.190 
open strings it has to be way back here
at<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.650> bridge<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.720> get<00:02:14.930> an

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
appropriate sound now what's tricky is

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.350 
appropriate sound now what's tricky is
strumming<00:02:18.830> at<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.310> same<00:02:19.549> time<00:02:19.819> as<00:02:20.060> keeping

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
strumming at the same time as keeping

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.420 
strumming at the same time as keeping
those<00:02:20.480> strings<00:02:20.870> muted<00:02:21.140> what<00:02:21.950> tends<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.310> happen

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
those strings muted what tends to happen

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.699 
those strings muted what tends to happen
is<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.060> wrist<00:02:23.330> moves<00:02:25.810> while<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.170> palm<00:02:27.380> muting

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
is the wrist moves while the palm muting

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.240 
is the wrist moves while the palm muting
remains<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:29.380> then<00:02:30.380> before<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:31.040> do<00:02:31.160> that

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
remains and then before I do that

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.100 
remains and then before I do that
percussive<00:02:31.910> hit<00:02:32.090> which<00:02:32.569> by<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.840> way<00:02:32.959> is

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
percussive hit which by the way is

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.380 
percussive hit which by the way is
available<00:02:33.319> as<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.220> first<00:02:34.640> lesson<00:02:35.239> in

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
available as the first lesson in

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.820 
available as the first lesson in
advanced<00:02:36.110> strumming<00:02:36.500> techniques<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:38.390> one

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
advanced strumming techniques this one

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.520 
advanced strumming techniques this one
as<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:40.459> do<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.910> percussive<00:02:41.420> hit<00:02:41.599> your<00:02:42.319> hand

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
as you do that percussive hit your hand

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.440 
as you do that percussive hit your hand
will<00:02:42.709> come<00:02:42.920> up<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.160> little<00:02:43.250> bit<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.700> then<00:02:44.239> come

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
will come up a little bit and then come

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.660 
will come up a little bit and then come
back<00:02:44.480> down<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:44.870> remain<00:02:45.470> there<00:02:45.709> for<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
back down and remain there for the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.610 
back down and remain there for the
muting<00:02:47.330> I'm<00:02:47.870> going<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.140> try<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.349> do<00:02:48.500> this

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
muting I'm going to try to do this

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.199 
muting I'm going to try to do this
slowly<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.280> can<00:02:49.310> see<00:02:49.459> exactly<00:02:49.730> what's

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
slowly so you can see exactly what's

00:02:50.209 --> 00:03:04.199 
slowly so you can see exactly what's
going<00:02:50.420> on

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.149 

you'll<00:03:05.209> notice<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.959> hand<00:03:06.439> mostly<00:03:06.890> stays

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
you'll notice that the hand mostly stays

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.530 
you'll notice that the hand mostly stays
here<00:03:07.579> and<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:10.069> wrist<00:03:10.459> is<00:03:10.730> muting<00:03:11.120> those<00:03:11.269> low

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
here and the wrist is muting those low

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.949 
here and the wrist is muting those low
strings<00:03:12.310> every<00:03:13.310> time<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.519> come<00:03:13.819> up<00:03:13.849> it'd<00:03:14.629> have

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
strings every time I come up it'd have

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.500 
strings every time I come up it'd have
obviously<00:03:15.799> has<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.280> leave<00:03:16.639> the<00:03:16.819> strings<00:03:17.120> and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
obviously has to leave the strings and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.910 
obviously has to leave the strings and
then<00:03:18.079> come<00:03:18.290> back<00:03:18.319> down

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
then come back down

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.009 
then come back down
but<00:03:19.069> as<00:03:19.189> soon<00:03:19.340> as<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.549> come<00:03:19.730> back<00:03:19.849> down<00:03:20.120> your

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
but as soon as you come back down your

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.390 
but as soon as you come back down your
right<00:03:21.230> hand<00:03:21.469> should<00:03:21.620> be<00:03:21.769> ready<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.219> that

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
right hand should be ready in that

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:31.149 
right hand should be ready in that
muting<00:03:22.790> position<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:29.349> use<00:03:30.349> this<00:03:30.560> technique<00:03:30.739> and

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
muting position I use this technique and

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.789 
muting position I use this technique and
a<00:03:31.280> lot<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.519> songs<00:03:31.849> that<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.090> play<00:03:32.560> just<00:03:33.560> one

okay so here we go with a little bit of

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.130 
okay so here we go with a little bit of
palm<00:04:07.340> muting<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:07.880> percussive<00:04:08.480> hit<00:04:08.510> with<00:04:09.050> the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
palm muting and percussive hit with the
