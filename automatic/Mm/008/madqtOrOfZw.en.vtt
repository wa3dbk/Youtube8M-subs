what we do is stare at a lamp and the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.110 
what we do is stare at a lamp and the
energy<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> lamp<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.760> sucks

energy out of the lamp will get sucks

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.229 
energy out of the lamp will get sucks
ass<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> lamp<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.579> lamp<00:00:56.940> will<00:00:57.090> turn

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
ass of the lamp and the lamp will turn

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.529 
ass of the lamp and the lamp will turn
off<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.629> I'll<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> XP<00:00:58.739> orbs<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.070> exchange

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
off and I'll get the XP orbs in exchange

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.380 
off and I'll get the XP orbs in exchange
so<00:01:00.539> after<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> while<00:01:00.930> come<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.190> go

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
so after a while come on there we go

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.030 
so after a while come on there we go
it's<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.480> little<00:01:03.690> bit<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.860> accurate

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it's a little bit it's not accurate

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
it's a little bit it's not accurate
because<00:01:05.339> i'm<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.000> using<00:01:06.150> all<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> angles

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
because i'm not using all the angles

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
because i'm not using all the angles
associated<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.369> stare<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
associated so if I stare at it for a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
associated so if I stare at it for a
while<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.330> will<00:01:09.450> turn<00:01:09.630> off<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> I'll<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
while it will turn off and I'll get the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.160 
while it will turn off and I'll get the
nice<00:01:10.890> XP<00:01:11.310> orbs<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> lamp<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:13.020> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
nice XP orbs out of the lamp I do this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
nice XP orbs out of the lamp I do this
for<00:01:13.320> every<00:01:13.560> single<00:01:13.740> lamp<00:01:14.010> every<00:01:14.430> single<00:01:14.670> lamp

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
for every single lamp every single lamp

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.390 
for every single lamp every single lamp
will<00:01:14.939> turn<00:01:15.119> off<00:01:15.650> after<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> while<00:01:16.920> it's

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
will turn off after a while it's

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.679 
will turn off after a while it's
obviously<00:01:17.790> not<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.420> hundred<00:01:18.509> percent

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
obviously not one hundred percent

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.660 
obviously not one hundred percent
accurate<00:01:19.259> because<00:01:19.439> i'm<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.890> using<00:01:20.040> every

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
accurate because i'm not using every

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.310 
accurate because i'm not using every
single<00:01:20.939> angle<00:01:21.030> i'm<00:01:21.240> using<00:01:21.540> ten<00:01:21.780> angle

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
single angle i'm using ten angle

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
single angle i'm using ten angle
increments<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.220> my<00:01:23.430> laser<00:01:23.820> concept<00:01:24.360> i

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
increments just like my laser concept i

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.450 
increments just like my laser concept i
can<00:01:25.350> stare<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.890> these<00:01:25.979> lamps<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.340> can

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
can stare at all of these lamps you can

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.440 
can stare at all of these lamps you can
kind<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.700> what's<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.210> I'm

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
kind of see what's going on I'm

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.300 
kind of see what's going on I'm
basically<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:27.990> wiping<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> levers

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
basically just wiping out all the levers

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.850 
basically just wiping out all the levers
out<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.909> lamps<00:01:30.270> through<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.840> order<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.619> turn

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
out of lamps through in order to turn

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.350 
out of lamps through in order to turn
them<00:01:32.009> off<00:01:32.159> obviously<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> could<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.150> used

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
them off obviously I could have used

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
them off obviously I could have used
redstone<00:01:33.990> blocks<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.710> well<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.579> one's<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> bit

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
redstone blocks as well that one's a bit

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.080 
redstone blocks as well that one's a bit
crazy<00:01:36.200> but<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.650> course<00:01:37.950> levers<00:01:38.640> will<00:01:38.790> also

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
crazy but of course levers will also

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
crazy but of course levers will also
work<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> same<00:01:39.750> let's<00:01:40.350> turn<00:01:40.500> last<00:01:40.710> one

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
work just the same let's turn last one

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.850 
work just the same let's turn last one
off<00:01:40.979> over<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> there<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.530> XP

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
off over here and there we go so the XP

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.740 
off over here and there we go so the XP
orbs<00:01:44.070> act<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.549> energy<00:01:44.850> balls<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
orbs act as the energy balls and the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.560 
orbs act as the energy balls and the
levers<00:01:46.110> will<00:01:46.350> turn<00:01:46.560> off<00:01:46.710> each<00:01:46.950> lamp<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.880> how

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
levers will turn off each lamp so how

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
levers will turn off each lamp so how
this<00:01:48.689> works<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.200> through<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> whole<00:01:50.009> bunch<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
this works is through a whole bunch of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010 
this works is through a whole bunch of
understands<00:01:50.729> being<00:01:50.939> summoned<00:01:51.180> depending<00:01:52.020> on

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
understands being summoned depending on

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.980 
understands being summoned depending on
the<00:01:52.229> angle<00:01:53.299> obviously<00:01:54.299> using<00:01:54.420> trigonometry

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the angle obviously using trigonometry

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.020 
the angle obviously using trigonometry
here<00:01:55.140> again<00:01:55.350> which<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.890> guess<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.460> trend<00:01:56.850> on

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
here again which is I guess a trend on

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.060 
here again which is I guess a trend on
my<00:01:57.149> channel<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.630> will<00:01:57.719> I'll<00:01:58.079> stuff<00:01:58.380> I'll<00:01:58.829> stop

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
my channel I will I'll stuff I'll stop

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.459 
my channel I will I'll stuff I'll stop
one<00:01:59.250> day<00:01:59.460> I<00:02:00.210> probably<00:02:00.840> start<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.290> right<00:02:01.439> off

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
one day I probably start like right off

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.620 
one day I probably start like right off
this<00:02:01.680> video<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.189> i'm<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> give<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
this video because i'm going to give you

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.030 
this video because i'm going to give you
guys<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.049> entire<00:02:04.409> test<00:02:04.649> want<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> download

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
guys this entire test want to download

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.219 
guys this entire test want to download
i'll<00:02:05.880> get<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.420> minute<00:02:06.509> but

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
i'll get to that in a minute but

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.650 
i'll get to that in a minute but
basically<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.340> uses<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.879> very<00:02:09.209> similar

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
basically this uses the very similar

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.160 
basically this uses the very similar
concept<00:02:10.110> from<00:02:10.289> my<00:02:10.410> laser<00:02:10.649> concepts<00:02:11.360> summoning

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
concept from my laser concepts summoning

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.270 
concept from my laser concepts summoning
understands<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.800> teleporting<00:02:14.190> them

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
understands and teleporting them

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.630 
understands and teleporting them
depending<00:02:14.730> on<00:02:14.849> my<00:02:15.450> angle<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:17.280> detection

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
depending on my angle and the detection

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.250 
depending on my angle and the detection
works<00:02:17.970> through<00:02:18.239> another<00:02:18.510> contraption<00:02:18.840> just

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
works through another contraption just

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.010 
works through another contraption just
over<00:02:19.500> there<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.310> each<00:02:21.270> understand<00:02:21.840> will

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
over there and each understand will

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.809 
over there and each understand will
detect<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.860> your<00:02:22.980> lamp<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.370> turned<00:02:23.700> on

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
detect so that your lamp is turned on

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.970 
detect so that your lamp is turned on
and<00:02:24.060> if<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.870> turned<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.260> its<00:02:25.440> going<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.770> fill

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
and if it is turned on its going to fill

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.430 
and if it is turned on its going to fill
the<00:02:26.220> area<00:02:26.400> around<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.819> lamp<00:02:27.030> with<00:02:27.360> air<00:02:27.569> so

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the area around the lamp with air so

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.809 
the area around the lamp with air so
it's<00:02:28.680> really<00:02:28.890> quite<00:02:29.489> as<00:02:29.610> straightforward

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
it's really quite as straightforward

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.370 
it's really quite as straightforward
concept<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.569> little<00:02:30.690> bit<00:02:30.870> elegant<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.319> I

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
concept a little bit elegant and I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.640 
concept a little bit elegant and I
think's<00:02:31.590> driving<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:31.950> today<00:02:32.120> but<00:02:33.120> anyway<00:02:33.650> i'm

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
think's driving it today but anyway i'm

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.809 
think's driving it today but anyway i'm
going<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.890> give<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.010> guys<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.340> entire<00:02:35.640> world

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
going to give you guys this entire world

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.420 
going to give you guys this entire world
to<00:02:35.880> download<00:02:36.209> as<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.450> said<00:02:36.660> that's<00:02:37.590> because<00:02:37.950> my

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
to download as I said that's because my

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.040 
to download as I said that's because my
scored<00:02:38.700> objectives<00:02:39.150> are<00:02:39.360> getting<00:02:39.690> very<00:02:39.720> very

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
scored objectives are getting very very

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.229 
scored objectives are getting very very
cramped<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.670> world<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.940> getting<00:02:42.000> pretty

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
cramped and the world is getting pretty

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.050 
cramped and the world is getting pretty
big<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.810> I'm<00:02:43.739> going<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.920> start<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.250> new<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.910> guys

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060

can look around the entire test world is

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.900 
can look around the entire test world is
yours<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:48.209> explore<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:49.310> use<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> concepts

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
yours to explore and use the concepts

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.490 
yours to explore and use the concepts
for<00:02:51.090> your<00:02:51.239> own<00:02:51.390> creations<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.049> want<00:02:52.260> I

projects<00:02:57.569> which<00:02:57.720> failed<00:02:58.100> there's<00:02:59.100> one<00:02:59.220> right

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
projects which failed there's one right

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.650 
projects which failed there's one right
there<00:02:59.569> that<00:03:00.569> bedrock<00:03:01.049> cubed<00:03:01.410> failed<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.420> I

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
there that bedrock cubed failed so I

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.000 
there that bedrock cubed failed so I
didn't<00:03:03.959> make<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.110> video<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:04.890> guys

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
didn't make a video of that so you guys

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.440 
didn't make a video of that so you guys
can<00:03:05.220> go<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.489> explore<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.910> entire<00:03:06.000> world<00:03:06.299> if

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450
