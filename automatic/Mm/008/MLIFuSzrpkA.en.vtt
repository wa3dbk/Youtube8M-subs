00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.400
 this as you can see the model 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.810
 of a road with a crossing 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.660
 pedestrian in this 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.810
 traffic lights of which 2 manage 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.060
 the pedestrian crossing and two the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.190
 road conditions on the road 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.750
 here you can see the buttons for 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.650
 make the pedestrian call 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.849
 the operation is therefore very simple 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.370
 traffic is normally allowed 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.280
 on the road so these traffic lights are 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.300
 green at the time of the pedestrian call 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.450
 by pressing the appropriate buttons 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.160
 normally open a timer which 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.870
 will turn red traffic lights into 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.110
 street and green ones for 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.100
 pedestrian crossing 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.620
 this is how i was made 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.810
 connections and two traffic lights for the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.690
 road in parallel as well as those for 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.620
 pedestrians 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.720
 these are the clamps for 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.460
 5 volt power supply to the 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.380
 traffic lights 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.379
 these are successful plc to which they are 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.180
 connected green red yellow led for the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.820
 road lost giallorosso for 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.460
 pedestrian crossing the buttons 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.869
 for the pedestrian call instead 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.350
 determine contact between the power supply 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.590
 plc to 24 volts and the input number 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.590
 one 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.360
 this is the outline of the program in 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.460
 the hearing that I will enter in the plc for 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.470
 drive the traffic light 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.320
 as you can see here is the contact 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.450
 t1 which normally remains closed that 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.360
 keeps the cum exit active where it has us 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.520
 connected the bed loses in the street and 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.710
 at the same time there is this other 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.480
 normally closed contact that keeps 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.930
 activates the output where c is connected to 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.810
 red pedestrian crossing LED 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.600
 ok when one of the buttons is pressed 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.610
 for pedestrian crossing connected 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.590
 at the entrance and one will close 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.229
 temporarily this contact that 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.450
 will feed this fictitious cow that 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.270
 making by authors held with this 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.590
 contact will remain active even when the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.530
 pedestrian crossing button 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.260
 this coil will be released closes 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.540
 this contact number 1 to be activated 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.730
 the timer for the duration of the green of the 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.060
 road that I set to five 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.040
 seconds when he stops counting ap 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.440
 this contact that feeds the output 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.620
 where it is connected to the green led 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.090
 turning it off and I close this contact 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.190
 goes to activate the output where c is 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.489
 connected to yellow and goes to feed 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.160
 the timer to determine its duration 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.320
 I put in two seconds when too 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.300
 this will have finished counting opened the 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.910
 contact that deactivates the output of the 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.100
 yellow and closes this which goes to 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.200
 activate the red output in addition to 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.510
 activate this other timer in number 3 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.680
 which determines the time that 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.390
 will employ traffic light for 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.790
 pedestrian crossing to become 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.250
 green after those on the road will be 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.750
 turned red whose time set 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.459
 a second 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.260
 then this contact closes e 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.200
 activates the pedestrian green LED output 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.420
 here are the timers as before 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.670
 this determines the duration of the green 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.459
 which as offices count active to yellow 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.310
 then the timer 5 which determines the duration of the 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.840
 yellow and the timer 6 that determines 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.239
 the interval 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.580
 of time between pedestrian red and green 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.950
 of the road when the bill ends 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.800
 I go to open this contact in series the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.540
 dummy coil turning it off of 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.310
 consequence will go to interrupt 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.440
 the power supply of the first timer 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.909
 rejecting everything 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.450
 now in charge of the milk program in the 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.450
 plc 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.989
 ok 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.140
 at the start of the program 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.689
 I try to make the pedestrian call 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.979
 I make the pedestrian call 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:07.360
 turned yellow and the road now red and 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:10.199
 green for pedestrians yellow red green 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.199
 on the road
