00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello health degree xÃ tiva and this we are going to 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.090
 talk about 15 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.799
 kingdom hearts and I want game depends 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.049
 a lot of you do not depend on some 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.110
 if this rpg game is very very very 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.609
 good you will playstation2 and good 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.859
 let's go to a challenge of kino heart good to 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.210
 We all know that Disney helps create 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.710
 the video game and not hearts all what 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.109
 we know before the rights more than anything 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.100
 with the characters of his films not 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.530
 that is already more than 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.560
 what known not but very well tetsuya 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.290
 nominates the person who is in charge of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.170
 create kingdom hearts wondered what 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.590
 next we can put characters from 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.750
 star wars in kingdom hearts 3 and it seems 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.270
 that the answer is a means or a 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.890
 maybe good because we all know the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.840
 Disney people have all the rights 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.780
 of star wars and even this gentleman 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.690
 tetsuya nomura is watching the chance 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.989
 to be able to put star wars characters 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.430
 in kingdom hearts 3 that is already 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.500
 working on the eye and it's also there's no 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.180
 declined to play 3 but is watching the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.620
 chance to put star war characters 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.920
 which would be very good remember that 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.380
 disney 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.830
 or the silver poplars obviously do not think 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.049
 that has so much star wars character 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.580
 they have done very well already in Chinese heart 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.979
 we have mixed characters also in 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.479
 final fantasy and apart from disney 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.520
 that is 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.700
 imagine disney final fantasy star wars 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.460
 in a video game eye eye not say anything 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.530
 do not want to leave is a great game I see no 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.820
 is distressingly few people who 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.080
 know that it is realistic because we are not 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.600
 I was in the call of duty and 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.549
 other things but if it's in a game with 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.069
 liquid hard with final fantasy that already 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.289
 he is 100% sure and 6-3 and that they put him 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.789
 star award game sure obviously 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.600
 watching each world would not be super super 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.850
 amazing for the moment they are 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.690
 waiting there what happens to see if the people 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.890
 He says Lee know that already use the wolf not 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.330
 use people who keep the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.560
 problem but it would be cool 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.300
 It would be cool talking about death with 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.750
 a razor will be super lucina before a 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.840
 but let's see what happens now in a 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.640
 yeray suit those who now good 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.430
 look for it and I played something like that, I say goodbye 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.030

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.640

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.930
 true 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.310
