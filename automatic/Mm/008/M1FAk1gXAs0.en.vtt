00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hey and welcome with us 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.190
 his new video today has one 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:15.089
 reboot to a keyboard for which he ipad 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:17.250
 have fun with the video and that comes 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.539
 The keyboard of the company like dancing 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.850
 sharing that is also here again 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.859
 of course, the first one started at the beginning 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.529
 keyboard was there then this 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.849
 charging cable which micro-usb it has me 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.650
 but not tested since I already 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.480
 a lot of micro USB charging cable at home 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.279
 It's about a drive to drive around 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 five hours fully charged again 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.660
 then like a little user manual 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 if still has any questions and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.980
 such a small transport bag that one 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.719
 can easily take time to more 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.969
 to take a brief look at the keyboard 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.469
 so that you have a small expression where 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.090
 then we just put our ipad in it 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.890
 make we can use it to such a beautiful 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.379
 We then have the perspective 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.899
 a led or line this better said 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.180
 one shows the current status and the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.340
 So other pairing the status of a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.410
 device is connected or the device is 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.120
 just in perry mode and have 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.530
 We then press the button which we press 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.240
 if a device connects with it 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.549
 want and turn on and off 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.229
 the bottom 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.510
 also have now at the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.070
 back the lettering and this 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.630
 small particles where we are so easy 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.040
 can flip up 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.479
 we already know that from the pc 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.909
 keyboard that we just a bit 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.759
 we have an oblique angle to type 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.100
 there are so little particles around the whole 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.409
 to put that on the aluminum 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.700
 So slide around here does so in 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.110
 the rating I'm already angry 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.329
 comments read that is not enough 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.320
 Aluminum could be the back side 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.150
 I imagine that 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.229
 Of course, I can do aluminum now 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.270
 not say exactly 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.150
 looks very high quality in any case 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.340
 and it also puts a little something on the cool side 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.049
 so it's a little cold on the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.399
 the front is not so bad 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.720
 So the case could be there 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.759
 that in any case plastic 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.860
 has been used by it on it 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.820
 gotten lighter so I guess 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.100
 it certainly does not exist 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.390
 100% aluminum 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.770
 and if we have the ipad now 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.570
 Take along with the keyboard 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.170
 we just want to do that here 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.250
 click on it or open up 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.030
 we have such a small part down here 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.350
 holding everything together 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.940
 maybe you just heard it like that 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.709
 at least the alarm function so price 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.720
 we would now implement the ipad 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.150
 automatically locked when we return it 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.470
 get what little bit stuck 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.120
 does so you need it already on 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.190
 best sign that now in front of the camera 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.480
 show something hard between, the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.160
 ipad unlocked again as we do here 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.810
 can see the ipad now with the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.880
 Just connect the keyboard 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.650
 down here pressed the perry button 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.209
 Keep it up here so we're flashing 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.100
 you can see that then you go in 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.260
 bluetooth and can now here once 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.900
 click on the keyboard is called 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.459
 mobile bluetooth keyboard for ipad then 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.440
 here we have the small number 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.489
 then just enter 2385 and the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.100
 return key 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.180
 and we are connected 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.760
 many different ones up here now 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.410
 Function keys eg the home button can 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.090
 I imitate then I say push 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.980
 can trust multitasking 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.810
 I can change the brightness and so on 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.269
 I can change the volume 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.280
 change to the next song and change 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.660
 so on I find that really cool 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.120
 you can do all the functions you can 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.120
 Of course I also write texts 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.739
 my message is of course on 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.700
 in the beginning a bit awkward but you 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:19.130
 in any case, it gets used to it 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.600
 as you can see, all key presses are on 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.190
 another point that we at 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.420
 The keyboard really liked that 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.109
 we have a very good battery performance 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.209
 to have 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.380
 It is stated that the 90 days 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.459
 So I have to keep it so far 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.959
 not yet clear 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.549
 and if she should go empty 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.200
 we have the possibility the whole via 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.030
 micro usb with the supplied cable 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.890
 that you can do that within five hours 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.810
 can recharge and then again 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.130
 can use another 90 days here 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.510
 we can very happy in the video 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.680
 Comment what you write about the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.180
 keep keyboard 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.980
 if he also already experiences with 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.480
 another keyboard did it 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.829
 Of course there are some of logitech 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.359
 but they are much more expensive 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.530
 if you are interested in this now 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.090
 look in the video description 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.470
 There you will find the purchase takes because you 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.910
 no more videos from us 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.780
 do not miss subscribes to our channel 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.780
 see you next time
