reason<00:04:07.769> what<00:04:08.769> I<00:04:08.799> built<00:04:09.430> this<00:04:09.609> team<00:04:09.820> because<00:04:10.090> of

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
reason what I built this team because of

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.420 
reason what I built this team because of
how<00:04:10.510> girl<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.870> come<00:04:11.049> in<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:11.230> free<00:04:11.500> pack<00:04:11.799> what<00:04:12.280> EA

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
how girl I come in a free pack what EA

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.599 
how girl I come in a free pack what EA
gave<00:04:12.790> us<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.680> basically<00:04:14.680> I<00:04:14.829> couldn't<00:04:15.310> sell<00:04:15.489> it

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
gave us and basically I couldn't sell it

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.640 
gave us and basically I couldn't sell it
so<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:15.790> was<00:04:15.910> like<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.510> know<00:04:16.720> good<00:04:17.320> team<00:04:17.590> around

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
so I was like you know good team around

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.009 
so I was like you know good team around
him<00:04:17.919> so<00:04:18.250> yeah<00:04:18.640> I<00:04:18.669> got<00:04:18.880> Cavani<00:04:19.239> with<00:04:19.510> him<00:04:19.630> up

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
him so yeah I got Cavani with him up

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.030 
him so yeah I got Cavani with him up
from<00:04:20.349> there<00:04:20.560> as<00:04:20.739> such<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.160> good<00:04:21.430> pair<00:04:21.669> too

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
from there as such a good pair too

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.910 
from there as such a good pair too
I'd<00:04:22.640> really<00:04:23.150> recommend<00:04:23.420> those<00:04:23.960> two<00:04:24.560> strikers

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
I'd really recommend those two strikers

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.790 
I'd really recommend those two strikers
so<00:04:25.790> overall<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.480> think<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:27.170> team<00:04:27.380> would<00:04:27.560> cost

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
so overall I think this team would cost

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.690 
so overall I think this team would cost
around<00:04:27.950> 65<00:04:28.640> to<00:04:28.850> 75<00:04:29.330> thousand<00:04:29.930> coins<00:04:30.400> it's<00:04:31.400> very

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
around 65 to 75 thousand coins it's very

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.490 
around 65 to 75 thousand coins it's very
good<00:04:31.940> squad<00:04:32.180> indeed<00:04:32.570> i<00:04:32.780> really<00:04:33.410> recommend

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500
