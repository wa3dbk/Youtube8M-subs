bill for that one guy brought me to fix
it

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
it

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.020 
it
actually<00:00:15.469> there<00:00:15.980> was<00:00:16.100> a<00:00:16.160> very<00:00:18.220> short<00:00:19.220> cut<00:00:19.610> here

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
actually there was a very short cut here

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.880 
actually there was a very short cut here
and<00:00:20.090> it<00:00:20.450> burns<00:00:22.150> well<00:00:23.150> part<00:00:23.840> of<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.290> cells<00:00:24.590> or

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
and it burns well part of the cells or

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.520 
and it burns well part of the cells or
maybe<00:00:25.280> I<00:00:25.820> have<00:00:26.330> more<00:00:26.570> self<00:00:26.870> that<00:00:27.110> I<00:00:27.140> need<00:00:27.410> to

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
maybe I have more self that I need to

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.570 
maybe I have more self that I need to
check<00:00:28.090> need<00:00:29.090> to<00:00:29.240> open<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:29.660> check<00:00:29.840> it<00:00:30.020> so<00:00:30.580> this

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
check need to open and check it so this

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.250 
check need to open and check it so this
is<00:00:31.789> a<00:00:32.860> Chinese<00:00:34.360> Chinese<00:00:35.360> back

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
is a Chinese Chinese back

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.640 
is a Chinese Chinese back
it's<00:00:36.470> Gua<00:00:36.829> quite<00:00:37.520> square<00:00:38.530> this<00:00:39.530> is<00:00:39.739> a<00:00:40.000> box

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
it's Gua quite square this is a box

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.370 
it's Gua quite square this is a box
right<00:00:42.650> with<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.010> box<00:00:43.220> this<00:00:43.430> is<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:44.290> short<00:00:45.290> cut

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
right with the box this is the short cut

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:53.850 
right with the box this is the short cut
it<00:00:45.649> it<00:00:45.860> arrived<00:00:46.220> like<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:46.899> I<00:00:49.329> think<00:00:50.329> that<00:00:50.810> I

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.310 

think<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.579> wires<00:00:55.820> touch<00:00:56.149> each<00:00:56.360> other<00:00:56.600> in

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
think that the wires touch each other in

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.630 
think that the wires touch each other in
some<00:00:58.130> way<00:00:59.350> just<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.440> show<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:01.219> quality

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
some way just to show you the quality

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.210 
some way just to show you the quality
the<00:01:02.360> I<00:01:02.660> think<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.260> low<00:01:03.410> quality<00:01:03.590> of<00:01:04.009> this

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
the I think the low quality of this

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.370 
the I think the low quality of this
packs<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:06.830> cells<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:08.120> cells<00:01:08.229> actually<00:01:09.229> are

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
packs the cells the cells actually are

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.600 
packs the cells the cells actually are
quite<00:01:09.799> light<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:11.110> compare<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:12.620> another

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
quite light and compare it to another

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.490 
quite light and compare it to another
Chinese<00:01:14.270> cell<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:16.720> even<00:01:17.720> here<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:18.049> can<00:01:18.200> see

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
Chinese cell so even here you can see

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.120 
Chinese cell so even here you can see
that<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.580> work<00:01:19.760> is<00:01:20.060> different<00:01:20.299> like<00:01:21.130> quality

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
that the work is different like quality

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
that the work is different like quality
is<00:01:22.340> different<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:24.820> I<00:01:27.010> I<00:01:28.010> think<00:01:28.610> this<00:01:28.790> this

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
is different and I I think this this

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.140 
is different and I I think this this
pack<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.930> almost<00:01:30.680> lost<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.490> don't<00:01:31.700> know<00:01:31.880> really

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
pack is almost lost I don't know really

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.700 
pack is almost lost I don't know really
how<00:01:32.510> many<00:01:32.750> cells<00:01:33.140> all<00:01:34.040> these<00:01:34.400> two<00:01:34.700> lines<00:01:35.000> is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
how many cells all these two lines is

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:44.880 
how many cells all these two lines is
dead<00:01:36.710> cells<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:39.700> probably<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.930> BMS<00:01:43.060> I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
dead cells and probably the the BMS I

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.940 
dead cells and probably the the BMS I
think<00:01:45.890> it's<00:01:46.700> gone<00:01:46.939> I<00:01:47.259> will<00:01:48.259> check<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:48.500> after

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
think it's gone I will check it after

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.530 
think it's gone I will check it after
that<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:51.369> well<00:01:52.600> one<00:01:53.600> guy<00:01:53.780> at<00:01:54.650> YouTube<00:01:55.540> he

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
that and well one guy at YouTube he

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.730 
that and well one guy at YouTube he
posted<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.549> he<00:01:58.549> said<00:01:58.930> that<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.320> batteries

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
posted and he said that the batteries

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.370 
posted and he said that the batteries
that<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.570> assemble<00:02:02.570> here<00:02:03.460> look<00:02:04.460> like<00:02:05.380> homemade

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
that I assemble here look like homemade

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.809 
that I assemble here look like homemade
batteries<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.840> was<00:02:09.429> important<00:02:10.429> for<00:02:10.520> me<00:02:10.789> to

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
batteries so it was important for me to

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.820 
batteries so it was important for me to
show<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.660> inside<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.140> this

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
show you the inside of this

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.130 
show you the inside of this
to<00:02:12.980> be<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:14.360> understand<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:16.580> pack<00:02:17.140> it

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
to be to understand that the pack it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.770 
to be to understand that the pack it
doesn't<00:02:18.530> mean<00:02:18.650> nothing<00:02:19.070> it's<00:02:19.550> just<00:02:19.940> cover

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
doesn't mean nothing it's just cover

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
it's made of this fiberglass material

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.370 
it's made of this fiberglass material
and<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:29.840> tape<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.380> know<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.800> gray<00:02:32.380> sticky

tape and hmm what else I wanted to show
you<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:44.570> nickel<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.890> nickel<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.370> these

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
you the the nickel the nickel that these

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.020 
you the the nickel the nickel that these
people<00:02:47.420> use<00:02:47.750> when<00:02:48.140> they<00:02:48.320> assemble<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.160> the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
people use when they assemble the the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.860 
people use when they assemble the the
pack<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:51.560> really<00:02:52.010> thin<00:02:52.540> nickel<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.870> actually

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
pack is really thin nickel so actually

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.100 
pack is really thin nickel so actually
what's<00:02:57.230> happening<00:02:57.800> here<00:02:58.270> what<00:02:59.270> is<00:02:59.720> going<00:02:59.750> on

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
what's happening here what is going on

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.620 
what's happening here what is going on
that<00:03:00.760> when<00:03:01.760> when<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.330> when<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.050> take<00:03:04.630> high

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
that when when you when you take high

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.710 
that when when you when you take high
current<00:03:06.080> from<00:03:06.350> this<00:03:06.530> pack<00:03:07.270> there<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.420> good

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
current from this pack there is a good

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.430 
current from this pack there is a good
possibility<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.709> this<00:03:10.630> this<00:03:13.180> nickel<00:03:14.440> nickel

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
possibility that this this nickel nickel

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.570 
possibility that this this nickel nickel
belt<00:03:16.190> or<00:03:16.610> nickel<00:03:17.510> pieces<00:03:18.250> there<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.400> good

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
belt or nickel pieces there is a good

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.570 
belt or nickel pieces there is a good
chance<00:03:19.820> that<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.300> will<00:03:20.450> get<00:03:20.690> hot<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:22.310> will

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
chance that it will get hot and it will

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.280 
chance that it will get hot and it will
burn<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:24.050> will<00:03:24.350> make<00:03:24.560> all<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:25.160> pack<00:03:25.400> hot

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
burn and it will make all the pack hot

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.560 
burn and it will make all the pack hot
because<00:03:27.290> it's<00:03:27.700> too<00:03:28.700> thin<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:31.430> pass<00:03:32.269> through

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
because it's too thin to to pass through

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.110
