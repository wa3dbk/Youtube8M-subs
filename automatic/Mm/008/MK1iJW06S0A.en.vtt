00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
an extra small so I went through a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.360 
an extra small so I went through a
process<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.230> soaking<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.890> lukewarm<00:00:38.100> water

process of soaking it in lukewarm water
with<00:00:38.879> hair<00:00:39.120> conditioner<00:00:39.660> mixed<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.649> then<00:00:41.250> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
with hair conditioner mixed in then I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.250 
with hair conditioner mixed in then I
stretched<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.850> out<00:00:41.969> until<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.510> dried<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
stretched it out until it dried and it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.110 
stretched it out until it dried and it
got<00:00:43.440> quite<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.920> bigger<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.879> still<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
got quite a bit bigger but it's still a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.459 
got quite a bit bigger but it's still a
little<00:00:45.360> tight<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.870> thought<00:00:46.020> I'd<00:00:46.170> try<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469

of use and I've been getting a number of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600 
of use and I've been getting a number of
questions<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.649> them<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.489> if

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
questions and one of them was what if

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.700

comment suggested that you I would

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.560 
comment suggested that you I would
stretch<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.859> kind<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.250> instead<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.789> out<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
stretch it kind of instead of out on a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.320 
stretch it kind of instead of out on a
table<00:01:04.110> over<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> back<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.250> chair<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.820> thought

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
table over the back of a chair I thought

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.910 
table over the back of a chair I thought
that<00:01:06.479> was<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> great<00:01:06.840> idea<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.619> looking

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that was a great idea I was looking

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.340 
that was a great idea I was looking
around<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.280> house<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.520> all<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:08.850> chairs

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
around my house and all my chairs

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.600 
around my house and all my chairs
actually<00:01:10.350> they're<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:10.979> stretching<00:01:11.369> wide

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
actually they're not stretching wide

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.740 
actually they're not stretching wide
enough<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.850> would<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.210> any<00:01:12.420> better<00:01:12.630> than

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
enough that would be any better than

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
enough that would be any better than
what<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> did<00:01:13.170> before<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:14.100> found<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.880> laundry

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
what I did before but found this laundry

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.179 
what I did before but found this laundry
basket<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.200> stretch<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.650> out<00:01:16.740> over<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
basket and I stretch it out over that

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.240 
basket and I stretch it out over that
and<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.909> fit<00:01:18.119> great<00:01:18.619> really<00:01:19.619> stretched<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.159> out

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and it fit great really stretched it out

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.370 
and it fit great really stretched it out
hard<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.390> gonna<00:01:21.509> make<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.840> wet<00:01:22.020> I'm<00:01:22.229> going

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
hard so I'm gonna make it wet I'm going

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.440 
hard so I'm gonna make it wet I'm going
to<00:01:22.439> go<00:01:22.530> through<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> whole<00:01:22.979> process<00:01:23.189> again<00:01:23.610> 20

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
to go through the whole process again 20

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.420 
to go through the whole process again 20
minutes<00:01:24.750> lukewarm<00:01:25.290> water<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> mix

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
minutes lukewarm water I'm going to mix

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.789 
minutes lukewarm water I'm going to mix
in<00:01:26.640> some<00:01:26.670> hair<00:01:27.030> conditioner<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.689> try<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
in some hair conditioner and try it that

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.710 
in some hair conditioner and try it that
way<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.400> it'll<00:01:29.790> dry<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> lot<00:01:30.270> faster

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
way and I think it'll dry a lot faster

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.359 
way and I think it'll dry a lot faster
because<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.470> set<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> can

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
because I can just set it up and it can

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.640 
because I can just set it up and it can
get<00:01:32.490> air<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:32.970> four<00:01:33.420> sides<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.439> think

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
get air on all four sides and I think

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.410 
get air on all four sides and I think
that'll<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:34.950> great<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.579> I'll<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.240> addressing

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that'll be great so I'll be addressing

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.749 
that'll be great so I'll be addressing
those<00:01:36.869> two<00:01:37.049> issues<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.470> try<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.579> can

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
those two issues to try to see if I can

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.940 
those two issues to try to see if I can
get<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.030> out<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:39.900> bit<00:01:40.110> more<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.680> it's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
get this out a little bit more if it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.069 
get this out a little bit more if it's
good<00:01:41.159> now<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> second<00:01:42.299> time<00:01:42.420> even<00:01:42.869> wider

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
good now but the second time even wider

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.510 
good now but the second time even wider
would<00:01:43.439> be<00:01:43.560> great<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:43.950> let's<00:01:44.100> try<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.460> see

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
would be great so let's try it and see

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.219 
would be great so let's try it and see
what<00:01:44.640> happens<00:01:44.820> I'm<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> fill<00:01:46.140> in

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
what happens I'm not going to fill in

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.410 
what happens I'm not going to fill in
the<00:01:46.290> process<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.149> go<00:01:48.270> back

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the process because that you can go back

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.550 
the process because that you can go back
and<00:01:48.509> watch<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> video<00:01:49.020> I'll<00:01:49.110> put<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> link
