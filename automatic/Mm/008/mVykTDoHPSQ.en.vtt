00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:09.870
 forever 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.540
 all the other many things 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.360
 40 years after the beginning of the struggle 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.330
 videogame has had many games that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.300
 they dispute to be the best of all by 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.140
 this we have created points 25 with the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.140
 best games 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.000
 if you are a fan of the rpg and never played until 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.860
 the osman up cycle 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 you have to stop what you are doing and 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:39.330
 get it this heart came out in 1993 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.030
 for super nintendo and that I had like 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.300
 features very large areas 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.610
 to explore a very interesting plot 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.070
 and deep and also a mobility 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.220
 action-oriented similar to the two 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.559
 cells must also be noted that the 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.079
 maps were very different from each other and 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.760
 we could also improve the weapons and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.280
 each type of magic of the three 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
 characters available otherwise 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.110
 remarking is that the game had a 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.720
 cooperative mode when we found a 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.979
 our first character which was a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.979
 madness for the time 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.590
 I like your old school ornament 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.939
 silent hill 2 is one of the best 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.310
 exponents of this genre 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.009
 the game puts us in the skin of jeans 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.110
 In addition , he had to discover the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.719
 mysteries of this town and also 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.689
 find his wife who was believed 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:36.840
 that the fire was dead is very dark 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.240
 and macabre and puts us in a crowded town 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 of haze where no little power almost nothing 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.039
 and at any moment we can leave 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.429
 monsters of all types the game of 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.740
 a very interesting plot and also to 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.860
 highlight that the characters evolve 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.140
 throughout the game you also have to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.539
 say that makes the end of the frame there is 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.039
 a very interesting twist and 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.539
 the multiple endings offered by the 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.539
 game is one better than the other 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.170
 many will enjoy the games of 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.069
 modern platforms without knowing the floor 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.770
 original expert this is dust came out in 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:19.069
 1989 and it offered us 2d graphics 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.950
 quite colorful and realistic and also 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.500
 a systems of acrobatics and movements 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.810
 that was pretty good for the time 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.640
 We also have a combat system 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.550
 with swords that made the game very 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.560
 interesting in if we have a game that 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.340
 it influenced the genre a lot and that 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.340
 You should try 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.680
 the extra contra in us became 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.019
 in the most successful online game of all 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.780
 the times but also introduced 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.909
 the concept of pc models any 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.939
 user could create a skin for his 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.819
 character or a new map which the 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:58.989
 almost infinite variety of the game too 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.150
 this back by is casual and hardcore and 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.969
 we also have to highlight the game 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.430
 simple entertaining and security almost 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:08.799
 impossible to stop playing it for all this 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.400
 is a nickname for the most recognized to 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.400
 world level 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.410
 the devil 2 is for many the best 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.630
 footballer although it 's hard to say this 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.310
 since all military sagas have 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.790
 had some delivery crisis history 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.070
 of the devil 2 is an action game 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.050
 rpg which allowed us to choose between 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.840
 several classes very different from each other 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.630
 but it was limited only that also 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.580
 We could choose from a wide range of 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.040
 skills which allow 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.780
 our character is unique too 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.270
 we had a very developed history 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.790
 interesting and maps that were in 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.880
 constant change which made almost 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.100
 impossible to get bored of the game 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.020
 and that's it for this week we hope 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.670
 your comments and predictions and 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.630
 let's hope they keep seeing us to see 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.780
 how it goes on 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.780
 i 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.200
