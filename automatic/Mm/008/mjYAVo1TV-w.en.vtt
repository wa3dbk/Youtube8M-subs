00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello people I'm giacomo and gives you the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.430
 welcome to this new installment of 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.859
 audio mania the column that goes on the air 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.710
 every week where we talk about how 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.000
 improve sound, sound and music 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.070
 within our videos today 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.599
 celebrate with you the arrival of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.660
 this package that comes directly 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.609
 from sydney australia and I take this opportunity 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.140
 to tell you about this accessory 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.550
 it is nothing but the answer to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.380
 many of your questions 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.320
 when you ask me how to mount the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:39.360
 your external zoom microphone h1 or pocket 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:40.940
 above your reflex sign well 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.530
 let's start by saying that usually 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 used this accessory to mount 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:54.840
 my zoom h1 above the camera 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:56.730
 so this but after several tests me 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.809
 I realized that being very h1 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.870
 delicate 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.750
 often the movement of the car or the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 impact with external agents 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.460
 they made me an annoying noise let's go 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.880
 to hear a test with this support 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.580
 test done with the use of the classic 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.600
 support they use before we do 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.600
 some movements 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:32.500
 let's see what happens ok for more 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.750
 the use of this support me 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.200
 prevented from mounting at the same time 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.990
 also the led to illuminate by looking up 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.460
 internet I found this channel where 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.020
 sell this support 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.020
 let's try to feel the difference 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.900
 this is a test done with the adapter 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.630
 taken precisely in Australia as you can 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.520
 see mounted semi reflection here 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.369
 busy for the stop motion that soon 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.520
 we hope you will see some try 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:09.130
 movement so it is very simple to 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.989
 mount is a system of three rubber bands 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.940
 over a plastic frame 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.950
 just insert your microphone 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.989
 outside in the middle of the rubber bands here 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.140
 here you have the solution as you see 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.140
 very resistant does not fall 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.519
 and this mitigates any type of impact 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.250
 vibration so you won't feel that 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.739
 annoying stock on the site I leave you 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.769
 in the description find the two models of 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.080
 support of this kind a normal e 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.510
 one advanced we say that this is what I have 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.660
 I took that leaves you the possibility of 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.120
 use three more sled mounts 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.709
 for your accessories for SLR 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.100
 in fact you can assemble something I say 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.780
 this wow well I hope the video will 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.299
 It was useful to remind you that you can 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.190
 find myself on both facebook and twitter 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.120
 I'm giacomo citro and certainly vi 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.120
