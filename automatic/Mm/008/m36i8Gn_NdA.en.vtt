considering<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:17.909> now<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.420> eleven<00:01:18.750> years<00:01:18.930> old

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
considering it's now so eleven years old

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.010 
considering it's now so eleven years old
it<00:01:19.860> has<00:01:20.040> been<00:01:20.250> garaged<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.540> time<00:01:21.720> since

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it has been garaged all the time since

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.320 
it has been garaged all the time since
it's<00:01:22.170> been<00:01:22.320> um<00:01:22.640> it's<00:01:23.640> been<00:01:23.759> restored<00:01:23.939> though

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it's been um it's been restored though

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.210 
it's been um it's been restored though
and<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> only<00:01:25.530> done<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.979> think<00:01:26.130> about

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and so I only done about I think about

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.999 
and so I only done about I think about
ten<00:01:26.490> eleven<00:01:26.759> thousand<00:01:27.119> miles<00:01:27.350> but<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.829> when

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
ten eleven thousand miles but all when

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.289 
ten eleven thousand miles but all when
the<00:01:29.130> front<00:01:29.280> end<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.790> looks<00:01:29.970> loving<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the front end here it looks loving the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.940 
the front end here it looks loving the
crime<00:01:30.509> isn't<00:01:30.750> some<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
crime isn't some I don't think the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.770 
crime isn't some I don't think the
chrome<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.280> redone<00:01:32.640> at<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> time<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
chrome was redone at the time so the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.300 
chrome was redone at the time so the
chrome<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.140> actually<00:01:34.409> largely<00:01:34.710> original

actually that side of the blade may have

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.800 
actually that side of the blade may have
been<00:01:37.680> redone<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.820> perhaps<00:01:38.970> not<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.630> fact

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
