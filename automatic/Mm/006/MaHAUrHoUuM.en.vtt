00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.479 
really clunky just with the harmonicas
alone<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:25.350> wait<00:02:25.560> till<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.770> hear<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.190> sounds

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
alone but wait till you hear this sounds

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.680 
alone but wait till you hear this sounds
when<00:02:26.580> we<00:02:26.670> add<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.060> guitar<00:02:27.360> key<00:02:27.569> I<00:02:27.600> think

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
when we add the guitar key I think

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.990 
when we add the guitar key I think
you're<00:02:27.870> gonna<00:02:27.989> be<00:02:28.110> surprised<00:02:29.810> ok<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
you're gonna be surprised ok so on the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.960 
you're gonna be surprised ok so on the
count<00:02:33.350> four<00:02:34.350> we'll<00:02:35.040> play<00:02:35.250> together<00:02:35.660> 1<00:02:36.660> 2<00:02:37.670> 3<00:02:38.670> and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
count four we'll play together 1 2 3 and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.050 
count four we'll play together 1 2 3 and
so<00:02:39.540> I'm<00:02:40.170> noticing<00:02:40.500> her<00:02:40.860> harmonicas<00:02:41.730> hanging<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
so I'm noticing her harmonicas hanging a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.060 
so I'm noticing her harmonicas hanging a
little<00:02:42.180> down<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.900> was<00:02:42.989> angled<00:02:43.500> down<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.860> way

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
little down it was angled down this way

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.759 
little down it was angled down this way
and<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.000> check<00:02:45.180> yourself<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.959> see<00:02:46.560> if<00:02:46.650> you've

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
and so check yourself and see if you've

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.620 
and so check yourself and see if you've
got<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.070> angle<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.000> way<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.300> know<00:02:48.390> it's<00:02:48.570> a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
got that angle that way I know it's a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.720 
got that angle that way I know it's a
little<00:02:48.750> awkward<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.260> angle<00:02:49.769> if<00:02:50.010> I'm<00:02:50.250> lifting

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
little awkward to angle if I'm lifting

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.880 
little awkward to angle if I'm lifting
my<00:02:50.760> whole<00:02:51.090> elbow<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:52.440> easier<00:02:52.860> to

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
my whole elbow so it's easier to

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.120 
my whole elbow so it's easier to
actually<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.370> spin<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.940> harmonica<00:02:55.100> know<00:02:56.100> I

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
actually to spin the harmonica know I

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.530 
actually to spin the harmonica know I
can<00:02:56.370> get<00:02:56.459> my<00:02:56.580> elbow<00:02:56.880> down<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.300> lot<00:02:57.390> more

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
can get my elbow down it's a lot more

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.780 
can get my elbow down it's a lot more
comfortable<00:02:57.840> right<00:02:58.290> than<00:02:59.070> having<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.400> lift<00:02:59.610> my

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
comfortable right than having to lift my

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.979

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
little more complex we're going to build

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.210 
little more complex we're going to build
on<00:04:41.990> this<00:04:42.140> pattern<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.830> think<00:04:43.040> you're<00:04:43.130> gonna
