00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
at a resolution of 1440 x 900 also we

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.119 
at a resolution of 1440 x 900 also we
got<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> special<00:00:40.489> intel<00:00:41.489> HD<00:00:41.940> graphics<00:00:43.129> 3000

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
got a special intel HD graphics 3000

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.840 
got a special intel HD graphics 3000
processor<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:45.149> 384<00:00:45.989> megabytes<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.500> RAM<00:00:46.850> now

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
processor with 384 megabytes of RAM now

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.119 
processor with 384 megabytes of RAM now
that's<00:00:48.329> pretty<00:00:49.050> good<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.289> average<00:00:49.859> video

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that's pretty good for average video

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
that's pretty good for average video
editing<00:00:50.519> and<00:00:50.670> things<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.199> you

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
editing and things like that but you

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.669 
editing and things like that but you
have<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> 1.7<00:00:53.339> inch<00:00:53.489> shooting<00:00:54.120> 1.7<00:00:54.870> gigahertz

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
have a 1.7 inch shooting 1.7 gigahertz

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.739 
have a 1.7 inch shooting 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core<00:00:56.010> processor<00:00:56.760> now<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.089> is<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.269> i5

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
dual-core processor now this is the i5

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:00.680 
dual-core processor now this is the i5
so<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.089> virtualization<00:01:00.089> of<00:01:00.480> two

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
so you do get the virtualization of two

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.299 
so you do get the virtualization of two
extra<00:01:01.050> cores<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.530> technically<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
extra cores so technically this is a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.360 
extra cores so technically this is a
quad-core<00:01:02.640> processor<00:01:03.449> now<00:01:04.260> also<00:01:04.620> with<00:01:05.190> the

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
quad-core processor now also with the

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.120 
quad-core processor now also with the
2011<00:01:06.120> model<00:01:06.450> there's<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> new<00:01:07.440> feature<00:01:07.680> with

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
2011 model there's a new feature with

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
2011 model there's a new feature with
the<00:01:08.250> backlit<00:01:08.700> keyboard<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.870> one<00:01:10.050> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the backlit keyboard so that's one of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.200 
the backlit keyboard so that's one of
the<00:01:10.200> biggest<00:01:10.620> plusses<00:01:11.040> also<00:01:11.850> you're<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the biggest plusses also you're going to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.160 
the biggest plusses also you're going to
get<00:01:12.620> mac<00:01:13.620> OS<00:01:13.890> x<00:01:14.070> lion<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.000> ilife<00:01:15.750> installed

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
get mac OS x lion and ilife installed

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.250 
get mac OS x lion and ilife installed
not<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> mention<00:01:17.490> also<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.690> see<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:18.990> there

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
not to mention also you see right there

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.200 
not to mention also you see right there
that<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> Thunderbolt<00:01:20.130> port<00:01:20.400> now<00:01:21.060> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that is the Thunderbolt port now that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.330 
that is the Thunderbolt port now that
allows<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.050> doubles<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.530> display<00:01:23.040> port

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
allows you it doubles as a display port

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.150 
allows you it doubles as a display port
as<00:01:23.460> well<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.910> it<00:01:24.420> allows<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.160> transfer

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
as well and it allows you to transfer

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.310 
as well and it allows you to transfer
data<00:01:26.540> once<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.690> come<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.170> some

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
data once they come out with some

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.890 
data once they come out with some
Thunderbolt<00:01:29.190> compatible<00:01:29.880> devices<00:01:30.330> but<00:01:30.690> let's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
Thunderbolt compatible devices but let's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.000 
Thunderbolt compatible devices but let's
go<00:01:30.960> ahead<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.230> to<00:01:31.350> their<00:01:31.470> own<00:01:31.530> box<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.890> their

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
go ahead get to their own box in their

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:39.110 
go ahead get to their own box in their
packaging

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120
