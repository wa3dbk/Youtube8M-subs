be<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.570> lot<00:03:12.690> easier<00:03:12.750> apparently<00:03:13.470> we're<00:03:13.620> gonna

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
be a lot easier apparently we're gonna

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.259 
be a lot easier apparently we're gonna
have<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.070> do<00:03:14.190> according<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.580> Brian<00:03:14.820> be<00:03:15.090> is

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
have to do according to Brian be is

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.360 
have to do according to Brian be is
drive<00:03:15.720> your<00:03:15.959> vehicles<00:03:16.380> in<00:03:16.560> order<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.130> how<00:03:17.310> you

entirely sure how the process does work

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.560
