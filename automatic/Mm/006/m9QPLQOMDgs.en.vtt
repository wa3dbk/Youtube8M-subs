on and be able to take care of my

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.050 
on and be able to take care of my
children<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:31.079> myself<00:02:31.439> I<00:02:31.650> also<00:02:32.400> got<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.700> i

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
children in myself I also got this i

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.770 
children in myself I also got this i
bought<00:02:33.239> myself<00:02:33.420> at<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.439> same<00:02:34.739> time<00:02:35.159> and<00:02:35.780> I

think it's like one of forever necklaces

my journey i'm closing this book and

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.460 
my journey i'm closing this book and
opening<00:02:59.489> another<00:02:59.670> for<00:03:00.030> sure<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.720> check<00:03:01.379> out

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
opening another for sure so I check out

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.679 
opening another for sure so I check out
this<00:03:01.590> place<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.069> see<00:03:02.250> what<00:03:02.849> I<00:03:02.879> can<00:03:03.030> get<00:03:03.359> and

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
this place and see what I can get and

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:04.879 
this place and see what I can get and
then<00:03:03.840> there's<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.139> across<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.379> street<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.829> I

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
then there's one across the street so I

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.140 
then there's one across the street so I
probably<00:03:05.010> get<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> second<00:03:05.519> opinion<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:06.030> then

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
probably get a second opinion and then

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.479 
probably get a second opinion and then
and<00:03:06.959> then<00:03:07.260> go<00:03:07.409> from<00:03:07.590> there<00:03:07.680> but<00:03:08.189> I<00:03:08.220> hope
