stone<00:03:24.989> I'll<00:03:25.319> flint<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.130> steel<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.549> here<00:03:26.730> and

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
stone I'll flint and steel in here and

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.140 
stone I'll flint and steel in here and
you<00:03:26.940> got<00:03:27.090> another<00:03:27.209> type<00:03:27.630> of<00:03:27.660> creep<00:03:27.989> trap<00:03:29.150> let

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
you got another type of creep trap let

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.789 
you got another type of creep trap let
me<00:03:30.209> get<00:03:30.359> that<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:31.380> I'm<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.590> put<00:03:31.650> that

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
me get that so I'm going to put that

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.440 
me get that so I'm going to put that
there<00:03:32.099> turn<00:03:32.430> create<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.790> moat<00:03:32.970> onyx<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.299> don't

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
there turn create a moat onyx I don't

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.270 
there turn create a moat onyx I don't
want<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.660> die<00:03:33.780> step<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:35.190> will

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
want to die step on it and it will

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.729 
want to die step on it and it will
create<00:03:35.609> this<00:03:36.420> entire<00:03:36.989> ring<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.410> fire<00:03:37.709> around

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
create this entire ring of fire around

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.379 
create this entire ring of fire around
you<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.459> you'll<00:03:38.609> you're<00:03:39.000> going<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.209> be<00:03:39.329> stuck

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
you so you'll you're going to be stuck

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.860 
you so you'll you're going to be stuck
in<00:03:39.780> here<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:40.609> like<00:03:41.609> this<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.120> you're<00:03:42.720> going

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
in here just like this and you're going

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.940 
in here just like this and you're going
to<00:03:42.930> have<00:03:43.019> fire<00:03:43.169> on<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.650> only<00:03:43.769> way<00:03:43.889> to

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
to have fire on you and the only way to

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.009 
to have fire on you and the only way to
get<00:03:44.130> out<00:03:44.250> obviously<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:45.030> by<00:03:45.389> hitting<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.780> fire

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
get out obviously is by hitting the fire

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.170 
get out obviously is by hitting the fire
and<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:46.950> be<00:03:47.069> pretty<00:03:47.250> scary<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.730> step<00:03:47.910> on<00:03:48.060> it

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
and I can be pretty scary to step on it

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.129 
and I can be pretty scary to step on it
because<00:03:48.389> obviously<00:03:48.569> you're<00:03:48.840> going<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.049> run

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
because obviously you're going to run

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.520 
because obviously you're going to run
into<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.500> fire<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.010> most<00:03:51.000> likely<00:03:51.150> die<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:51.810> if

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
into the fire and most likely die so if

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.620 
into the fire and most likely die so if
you<00:03:52.739> see<00:03:52.919> those<00:03:53.130> they<00:03:53.430> have<00:03:53.639> little<00:03:53.970> faces<00:03:54.329> on

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
you see those they have little faces on

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.629 
you see those they have little faces on
them<00:03:54.720> like<00:03:54.870> creepers<00:03:55.230> do<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.680> that's<00:03:56.519> the

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
them like creepers do and that's the

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.220 
them like creepers do and that's the
second<00:03:56.940> type<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.060> creep<00:03:57.329> trap<00:03:57.540> also<00:03:57.959> there's

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
second type of creep trap also there's

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.589 
second type of creep trap also there's
one<00:03:58.560> more<00:03:58.799> type<00:03:59.069> of<00:03:59.250> creep<00:03:59.489> trap<00:03:59.849> I<00:04:00.120> don't<00:04:00.540> know

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
one more type of creep trap I don't know

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.789 
one more type of creep trap I don't know
if<00:04:00.660> it's<00:04:00.810> really<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:01.049> creep<00:04:01.230> trap<00:04:01.500> but<00:04:01.650> there's

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
if it's really a creep trap but there's

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.229 
if it's really a creep trap but there's
one<00:04:01.950> more<00:04:02.130> kind<00:04:02.609> of<00:04:02.700> thing<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:02.940> can<00:04:03.060> do<00:04:03.180> with

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
one more kind of thing you can do with

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.509 
one more kind of thing you can do with
this<00:04:03.389> and<00:04:03.680> I'm<00:04:04.680> going<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:04.919> need<00:04:05.069> some<00:04:05.099> glass

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
this and I'm going to need some glass

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.409 
this and I'm going to need some glass
for<00:04:05.790> this<00:04:05.910> one<00:04:06.980> ok<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.040> I'm<00:04:09.030> going<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.209> put<00:04:09.389> some

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
for this one ok so I'm going to put some

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.110 
for this one ok so I'm going to put some
creep<00:04:09.750> stone<00:04:09.989> around<00:04:10.169> here<00:04:10.849> you're<00:04:11.849> going<00:04:12.000> to

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
creep stone around here you're going to

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.640 
creep stone around here you're going to
put<00:04:12.269> glass<00:04:12.510> there<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.079> you're<00:04:13.260> going<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:13.530> get

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
put glass there and you're going to get

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.430 
put glass there and you're going to get
creeped<00:04:14.160> glass<00:04:14.459> so<00:04:15.150> this<00:04:15.569> has<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:16.079> nice

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
creeped glass so this has this nice

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.650 
creeped glass so this has this nice
green<00:04:17.039> tint<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.729> as<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:18.329> can<00:04:18.450> see<00:04:18.479> I

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
green tint to it and as you can see I

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.860 
green tint to it and as you can see I
can<00:04:18.810> see<00:04:19.349> through<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.880> creep<00:04:21.120> stone<00:04:21.419> see<00:04:21.690> I

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
can see through the creep stone see I

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.300 
can see through the creep stone see I
can't<00:04:22.140> see<00:04:22.200> through<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.710> I'm<00:04:23.130> going<00:04:23.280> to

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
can't see through it and I'm going to

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.950 
can't see through it and I'm going to
put<00:04:23.430> creep<00:04:23.669> stone<00:04:23.849> right<00:04:24.000> there<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:24.419> can

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
put creep stone right there and you can

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.050 
put creep stone right there and you can
actually<00:04:25.110> see<00:04:25.289> through<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.860> creep<00:04:26.070> stone<00:04:26.340> but

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
actually see through the creep stone but

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.260 
actually see through the creep stone but
if

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
if

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.270 
if
step<00:04:27.479> on<00:04:27.569> it<00:04:27.720> obviously<00:04:28.139> it<00:04:28.740> will<00:04:28.919> explode

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
step on it obviously it will explode

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.879 
step on it obviously it will explode
like<00:04:29.580> that<00:04:29.789> so<00:04:30.509> that's<00:04:30.690> not<00:04:30.900> good<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.590> do<00:04:31.740> not

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
like that so that's not good you do not

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.189 
like that so that's not good you do not
want<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.280> go<00:04:32.879> on<00:04:32.910> exploding<00:04:33.360> glass<00:04:33.599> and<00:04:33.990> it

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
want to go on exploding glass and it

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.589 
want to go on exploding glass and it
will<00:04:34.289> explode<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.009> put<00:04:35.490> fire<00:04:36.150> around<00:04:36.419> you

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
will explode and put fire around you

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.040 
will explode and put fire around you
like<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:37.699> if<00:04:38.699> you<00:04:39.419> were<00:04:39.539> to<00:04:39.599> build<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.930> house

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
like that if you were to build a house

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.420 
like that if you were to build a house
out<00:04:40.199> of<00:04:40.259> this<00:04:40.409> obviously<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.949> would<00:04:41.099> not<00:04:41.310> be

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
out of this obviously it would not be

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.100 
out of this obviously it would not be
very<00:04:41.610> practical<00:04:41.879> because<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.629> can't<00:04:42.840> step

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
very practical because you can't step

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.170 
very practical because you can't step
near<00:04:43.409> it<00:04:43.530> or<00:04:43.620> on<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:44.729> know<00:04:44.789> I<00:04:44.819> want<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.030> put

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
near it or on it you know I want to put

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.110 
near it or on it you know I want to put
like<00:04:45.360> real<00:04:45.569> glass<00:04:45.870> around<00:04:46.139> it<00:04:46.610> but<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:47.879> can't

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
like real glass around it but you can't

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.249 
like real glass around it but you can't
see<00:04:48.300> through<00:04:48.479> all<00:04:48.599> this<00:04:48.720> stuff<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.080> that

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
see through all this stuff and that

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.170 
see through all this stuff and that
would<00:04:49.349> make<00:04:49.560> for<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.800> pretty<00:04:49.979> cool<00:04:50.340> looking

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
would make for a pretty cool looking

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.029 
would make for a pretty cool looking
house<00:04:51.539> from<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:51.990> inside<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.289> probably<00:04:52.949> be

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
house from the inside and probably be

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.939 
house from the inside and probably be
outside<00:04:53.340> too<00:04:53.639> so<00:04:54.509> I'm<00:04:55.349> just<00:04:55.530> going<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.710> let<00:04:55.830> you

glass is pretty thick and as you can see
I<00:05:20.190> can<00:05:20.250> see<00:05:20.610> if<00:05:21.240> you<00:05:21.389> put<00:05:21.599> two<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.560> these<00:05:22.680> down

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
I can see if you put two of these down

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.029 
I can see if you put two of these down
it<00:05:23.159> looks<00:05:23.310> like<00:05:23.520> on<00:05:23.729> top<00:05:23.969> of<00:05:24.180> creep<00:05:25.139> creep

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
it looks like on top of creep creep

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.779 
it looks like on top of creep creep
stone<00:05:26.280> you<00:05:26.789> can<00:05:26.940> see<00:05:27.860> you<00:05:28.860> cannot<00:05:29.310> see<00:05:29.580> through

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
stone you can see you cannot see through

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.290 
stone you can see you cannot see through
it<00:05:29.849> or<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.659> can<00:05:30.840> see<00:05:30.990> nothing<00:05:31.229> through<00:05:31.560> it<00:05:31.680> so

the Sun is through here so I'm just
going<00:05:49.349> to<00:05:49.409> explode<00:05:49.710> through<00:05:50.639> here<00:05:50.940> oh<00:05:51.620> I<00:05:52.620> see

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
going to explode through here oh I see

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.620 
going to explode through here oh I see
let's<00:05:54.300> see<00:05:54.419> how<00:05:54.479> far<00:05:54.659> down<00:05:54.870> i<00:05:54.930> can<00:05:55.169> go<00:05:55.319> I<00:05:56.630> see

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
let's see how far down i can go I see

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.390 
let's see how far down i can go I see
what<00:05:57.750> this<00:05:57.870> is<00:06:00.080> so<00:06:01.080> here<00:06:01.349> we<00:06:01.440> go<00:06:01.469> that<00:06:02.159> just

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
what this is so here we go that just

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.490 
what this is so here we go that just
kind<00:06:02.729> of<00:06:02.759> made<00:06:02.909> me<00:06:03.029> pretty<00:06:03.389> messed<00:06:03.599> up<00:06:03.719> so<00:06:04.319> as

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
kind of made me pretty messed up so as

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.330 
kind of made me pretty messed up so as
you<00:06:04.620> can<00:06:04.740> see<00:06:05.039> the<00:06:05.729> moon<00:06:06.449> and<00:06:06.779> sun<00:06:07.110> see<00:06:07.860> sunrise

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
you can see the moon and sun see sunrise

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.510 
you can see the moon and sun see sunrise
I<00:06:09.240> think<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.139> time<00:06:10.349> should<00:06:10.650> be<00:06:10.680> opposite<00:06:11.370> see

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
I think the time should be opposite see

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.850 
I think the time should be opposite see
there's<00:06:11.729> the<00:06:11.880> Sun<00:06:12.319> Sun<00:06:13.319> goes<00:06:13.529> all<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.740> way

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
there's the Sun Sun goes all the way

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.939 
there's the Sun Sun goes all the way
down<00:06:13.889> and<00:06:14.190> I<00:06:14.310> see<00:06:14.880> so<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:16.199> sun<00:06:16.469> goes<00:06:16.710> down

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
down and I see so the the sun goes down

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.459 
down and I see so the the sun goes down
there<00:06:17.190> and<00:06:17.279> it<00:06:17.370> will<00:06:17.460> go<00:06:17.580> all<00:06:17.789> the<00:06:17.909> way<00:06:17.940> through

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
there and it will go all the way through

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:21.559 
there and it will go all the way through
and<00:06:19.469> if<00:06:19.919> I<00:06:20.039> can<00:06:20.219> get<00:06:20.370> to<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:21.029> top<00:06:21.240> of<00:06:21.270> this

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
and if I can get to the top of this

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.689 
and if I can get to the top of this
creep<00:06:21.810> world<00:06:22.110> you'll<00:06:23.009> be<00:06:23.190> able<00:06:23.250> to<00:06:23.370> see<00:06:23.550> the

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
creep world you'll be able to see the

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.670 
creep world you'll be able to see the
moon<00:06:23.940> at<00:06:24.599> midnight<00:06:25.080> that's<00:06:25.380> going<00:06:25.529> to<00:06:25.590> be

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
moon at midnight that's going to be

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.769 
moon at midnight that's going to be
pretty<00:06:25.770> cool<00:06:26.090> all<00:06:27.090> right<00:06:27.180> I'm<00:06:27.300> just<00:06:27.419> exploring

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
pretty cool all right I'm just exploring

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.149 
pretty cool all right I'm just exploring
right<00:06:27.990> now<00:06:28.050> because<00:06:28.380> the<00:06:28.560> creep<00:06:28.740> is<00:06:28.860> pretty

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
right now because the creep is pretty

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:30.959 
right now because the creep is pretty
cool<00:06:29.310> no<00:06:29.520> dimension

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:30.969 
cool no dimension

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:34.949 
cool no dimension
and<00:06:31.089> yeah<00:06:31.860> so<00:06:32.860> let<00:06:33.099> me<00:06:33.159> go<00:06:33.279> through<00:06:33.579> here<00:06:33.969> it's

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:34.959 
and yeah so let me go through here it's

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:37.079 
and yeah so let me go through here it's
a<00:06:35.110> lot<00:06:35.379> like<00:06:35.589> the<00:06:35.709> nether<00:06:35.889> but<00:06:36.189> obviously

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:37.089 
a lot like the nether but obviously

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:41.999 
a lot like the nether but obviously
creepier<00:06:37.659> no<00:06:38.589> pun<00:06:38.829> intended<00:06:40.619> okay<00:06:41.619> let's<00:06:41.919> see

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009 
creepier no pun intended okay let's see

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:43.769 
creepier no pun intended okay let's see
if<00:06:42.039> I<00:06:42.159> can<00:06:42.279> get<00:06:42.369> to<00:06:42.489> the<00:06:42.579> top<00:06:42.789> of<00:06:42.819> this<00:06:43.119> world<00:06:43.449> I

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:43.779 
if I can get to the top of this world I

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:46.559 
if I can get to the top of this world I
think<00:06:44.559> there's<00:06:44.709> bedrock<00:06:45.099> on<00:06:45.219> the<00:06:45.369> top<00:06:45.549> of<00:06:45.759> the

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:46.569 
think there's bedrock on the top of the

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:47.999 
think there's bedrock on the top of the
nether<00:06:46.839> let's<00:06:47.079> see<00:06:47.139> if<00:06:47.199> there's<00:06:47.379> bedrock<00:06:47.860> on

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
nether let's see if there's bedrock on

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.579 
nether let's see if there's bedrock on
the<00:06:48.129> top<00:06:48.279> few<00:06:48.489> of<00:06:48.579> them<00:06:48.869> pretty<00:06:49.869> high<00:06:50.139> up<00:06:50.169> here

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:50.589 
the top few of them pretty high up here

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:53.039
