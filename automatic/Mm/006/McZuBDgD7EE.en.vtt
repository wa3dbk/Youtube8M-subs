00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:16.129
 Next is Diagonal 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:18.370
 In a word, it is one move to take balance called balance 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.550
 a Basically everyone 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:24.450
 When I climb, I bend my arm and climb. 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.440
 Well centered on those who just started 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:32.369
 As soon as just a pass would try to climb in just the arm 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.860
 I'm tired of my arms and I can't climb a lot 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:43.870
 In short , this university will be in a state where you have extended your arms 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:47.010
 Amounting to comfortably give using the black in large famine without bending the arm as much as possible in 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.010
 It has become a useful Move 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.450
 I will climb a little and I will be very tired if I go as it is with my arms bent 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.700
 Because 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.860
 Stretch arms 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.910
 Raise your feet 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.020
 Body 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.020
 While turning thin like this 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.200
 We will think 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.170
 In at this time 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.740
 What is required 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.430
 It is going to take the hall hold to go to take the example hand on the opposite side of the foot on the diagonal line and here. 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.750
 Let out 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:27.070
 Depending on it here Nde twisted now body diagonal 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.240
 It is why say Rutte in the form of balance 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 So the Tteyuu become university to climb without using as much as possible the force 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.020
 It has become a room 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.180
 Firmly 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.180
 On the diagonal 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:50.710
 I will bend my arms and become a university 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:56.520
 I'll stretch out to make sense of balance , and I will put out my hand in university 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.520
 Now here in dropout and strangely therefore issue this hand 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.000
 It's like this
