 saying air of arrogance care no 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.490
 Interviewer likes to see a person 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.380
 arrogant so be careful with some 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.509
 I'll give you tips that will help you 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.909
 help me a lot at the time of a 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.430
 job interview 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.840
 pay close attention to the simple details 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.970
 first hold chin posture 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.829
 in this position or down or to 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.610
 when you sit in front of the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.740
 person 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.720
 one of the fundamental things you have 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.590
 that take care is your shoulders 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.200
 no shoulders dropped fallen shoulders 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.560
 shoulders forward fall misfits give 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.170
 the idea of ​​fragility and insecurity 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.710
 so keep your shoulders aligned city 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.090
 in an upright posture while keeping his face 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.250
 aligned with the person and never under 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.979
 any chance by sitting in front of the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.710
 interviewer I never felt front 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.380
 for it because our mind take this 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.930
 as a natural aggression and yours 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.050
 reptilian brain will understand how a 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.800
 threat because when we are left 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.130
 open body for another human being 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.180
 to develop a dialogue there is a 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.420
 perception of confrontation then whenever 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.940
 you sit feeling slightly inclined 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.220
 without this frontal posture 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.920
 lightly do not let the fluff 45 maybe 35 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.810
 degrees of difference to the roll but I do not know 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.540
 I have steps, I have no idea. 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.120
 Sometimes we forget all this in the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.730
 college but ends up being more like this 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.370
 I felt a position as I am now in this 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.590
 position being filmed slightly 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.520
 looking at people and can support you 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.010
 can tilt 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.070
 when sitting lean the body very light 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.580
 forwards but keeping straight or sits 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.370
 this fastest possible position 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.970
 looking at the person in the eyes being 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.250
 firmly fundamentally beyond the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.070
 body expression position of your gaze 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.910
 and the position of which I sit 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:17.150
 take care of the time you answer 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.700
 the questions that are asked answer 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.610
 with clarity and without speed without 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.459
 hasty notes question if you have 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.739
 Any question, ask again. 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.690
 because sometimes even more than the person 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.900
 what are you interviewing is super 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.000
 prepared it may not be specific 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.370
 At the time of the question or you do not understand 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.040
 perfectly what was the meaning 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.140
 fundamental of that question there is no 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.130
 no problem of you asking for 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.739
 this person 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.610
 first be very educated by 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.200
 kindness 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.420
 if you do not mind you can 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.120
 repeat the question please have 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.680
 sure that I understood then do not say there 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.660
 I do not understand the question you can 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.820
 ask again is not this 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.770
 use emotional intelligence and make the 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.260
 person realizes that it matters 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.110
 the interviewer must feel that 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.670
 it is occupying a space and is the 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.860
 moment of importance 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.910
 he feels respected then by 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.709
 kindness 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.040
 Can you repeat the question why? 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.769
 I 'm not sure if you understand the person. 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.450
 Are you going to answer the question? 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.940
 again the question without any problem 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.470
 and you will feel extremely flattered 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.150
 because you were very 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.280
 So these simple tips I 'll give 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.370
 other tips in the sequence of the most 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.180
 It is simple body posture to be 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.580
 insurance keeps your shoulders lined up never 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.190
 forwards and not backwards in a boat to 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.770
 forward more however you are 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.050
 perhaps Tabby Tabby and has a 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.220
 posture relaxes 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.919
 relax in this straight body lean 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.710
 slightly forward not so 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.740
 so with the column always well 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.190
 never facing the 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.830
 interviewer that position ever this 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.060
 position in light diagonal 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.000
 Look at the person. Be gentle and polite. 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:16.430
 and very polite and do not rush into 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.110
 give the answers be with the past be 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.810
 calm and before responding 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.930
 breathe because otherwise you're gone 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.210
 responding without oxygen and then the voice can 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.699
 dig ending just before time and there 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.250
 you do not even show that you are 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:38.430
 calm most important insurance 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.370

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.099
 interviewer and that you are prepared 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.180
