it's<00:02:01.070> pretty<00:02:01.250> pretty<00:02:01.400> powerful<00:02:01.850> software

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
it's pretty pretty powerful software

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.410 
it's pretty pretty powerful software
it's<00:02:02.780> one<00:02:02.960> of<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.110> few<00:02:03.640> programs<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:04.910> kind

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
it's one of the few programs that I kind

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.390 
it's one of the few programs that I kind
of<00:02:05.450> recommend<00:02:05.780> that's<00:02:06.140> not<00:02:06.530> that's<00:02:07.160> a

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
of recommend that's not that's a

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.490 
of recommend that's not that's a
proprietary<00:02:08.030> software<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:08.780> they<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:09.200> free

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
proprietary software it's they have free

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.800 
proprietary software it's they have free
versions<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:10.100> paid<00:02:10.340> versions<00:02:10.820> it's<00:02:11.240> not<00:02:11.480> open

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
versions and paid versions it's not open

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.510 
versions and paid versions it's not open
source<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:13.010> kind<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.220> different<00:02:13.460> from

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
source so it's kind of different from

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.150 
source so it's kind of different from
most<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:13.970> software<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.390> recommend<00:02:14.890> okay<00:02:15.890> so

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
most of the software I recommend okay so

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.920 
most of the software I recommend okay so
when<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.370> download<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.970> finished<00:02:17.270> we<00:02:17.780> will

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
when this download is finished we will

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.530 
when this download is finished we will
left<00:02:18.140> click<00:02:18.470> on<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:20.150> will<00:02:20.300> launch

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
left click on it and this will launch

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.650 
left click on it and this will launch
the<00:02:20.780> Installer<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:23.000> window<00:02:23.180> pops<00:02:23.510> up

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
the Installer so this window pops up

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.760 
the Installer so this window pops up
that<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.870> probably<00:02:24.110> weren't<00:02:24.230> able<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.560> see

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
that you probably weren't able to see

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.860 
that you probably weren't able to see
that<00:02:24.980> says<00:02:25.280> do<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.210> authorize<00:02:26.690> the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
that says do you authorize the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.180 
that says do you authorize the
installation<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.710> clicked<00:02:27.920> yes

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
installation of this and I clicked yes

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.290 
installation of this and I clicked yes
so<00:02:28.490> that<00:02:28.610> will<00:02:28.700> happen<00:02:28.820> if<00:02:29.060> we're<00:02:29.180> using

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
so that will happen if we're using

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.500 
so that will happen if we're using
Windows<00:02:29.780> 7<00:02:30.530> 8<00:02:30.800> or<00:02:31.010> Vista<00:02:34.240> then<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:35.360> just

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
Windows 7 8 or Vista then it just

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.990 
Windows 7 8 or Vista then it just
installs<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.080> program<00:02:36.730> or<00:02:37.730> it's<00:02:37.820> going<00:02:37.940> to

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
installs the program or it's going to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.640 
installs the program or it's going to
extract<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.420> Installer<00:02:38.870> actually<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.410> then

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
extract the Installer actually and then

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.180 
extract the Installer actually and then
it<00:02:39.800> will<00:02:39.950> start<00:02:40.850> installing<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.070> the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
it will start installing so this is the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
then we will have Sketchup what does it

SketchUp Pro 2014 installed on our
computer<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:02.780> I'm<00:03:03.709> not<00:03:03.860> sure<00:03:04.070> after<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.459> 8

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
computer and I'm not sure after the 8

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.740 
computer and I'm not sure after the 8
hours<00:03:05.000> if<00:03:05.360> it's<00:03:05.770> if<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:07.310> restricts<00:03:08.000> access<00:03:08.180> to

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
hours if it's if it restricts access to

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.780 
hours if it's if it restricts access to
us<00:03:08.900> altogether<00:03:09.140> or<00:03:09.830> if<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.100> just<00:03:10.190> limited<00:03:10.670> I

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
us altogether or if it's just limited I

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.120 
us altogether or if it's just limited I
think<00:03:10.970> it's<00:03:11.090> just<00:03:11.239> limited<00:03:11.420> features<00:03:12.130> and

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
think it's just limited features and

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.430 
think it's just limited features and
then<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.370> can<00:03:13.520> pay<00:03:13.730> an<00:03:13.910> upgrade<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:15.230> the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
then you can pay an upgrade to to the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.850 
then you can pay an upgrade to to the
other<00:03:16.040> version<00:03:17.050> ok<00:03:18.080> so<00:03:18.320> we'll<00:03:18.410> click<00:03:18.530> finish

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
other version ok so we'll click finish

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.620 
other version ok so we'll click finish
it<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.340> Installer<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:19.910> done<00:03:20.180> we<00:03:20.300> can<00:03:20.420> minimize

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
it the Installer is done we can minimize
