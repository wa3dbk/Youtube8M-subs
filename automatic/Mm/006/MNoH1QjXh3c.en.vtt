like now this concept is based off the
digitimes<00:01:26.250> rumor<00:01:26.579> of<00:01:26.609> a<00:01:26.909> bigger<00:01:27.119> iPhone<00:01:27.600> and

apple<00:01:44.640> won't<00:01:45.149> release<00:01:45.539> a<00:01:45.570> bigger<00:01:45.960> iphone<00:01:46.409> in

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
apple won't release a bigger iphone in

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.489 
apple won't release a bigger iphone in
the<00:01:46.619> future<00:01:47.039> if<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.909> market<00:01:48.450> trends<00:01:49.350> continue

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
the future if the market trends continue

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.550 
the future if the market trends continue
as<00:01:50.069> they<00:01:50.310> currently<00:01:50.579> are<00:01:51.079> screen<00:01:52.079> sizes<00:01:52.319> are

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
as they currently are screen sizes are

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.260 
as they currently are screen sizes are
only<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.009> get<00:01:53.130> bigger<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.609> time<00:01:53.850> goes<00:01:54.090> on

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
only going to get bigger as time goes on

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.789
