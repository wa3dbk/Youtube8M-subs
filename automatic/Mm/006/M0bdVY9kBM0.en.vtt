Villanova's<00:00:38.790> academic<00:00:39.270> programs<00:00:39.600> but

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
Villanova's academic programs but

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.209 
Villanova's academic programs but

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
different than other high schools

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.790 
different than other high schools
academic<00:00:41.610> programs<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.450> its<00:00:43.350> not

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
academic programs because of its not

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160 
academic programs because of its not
only<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.340> challenging<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.420> it's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
only that it's challenging but that it's

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.690 
only that it's challenging but that it's
challenging<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.920> right<00:00:47.160> support<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
challenging with the right support and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220 
challenging with the right support and
then<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> lot<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.360> lot<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.660> schools<00:00:48.960> will<00:00:49.110> say

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
then a lot of lot of schools will say

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.080 
then a lot of lot of schools will say
that<00:00:49.440> law<00:00:49.500> schools<00:00:49.770> will<00:00:49.920> say<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.850> our

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that law schools will say we have our

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.490 
that law schools will say we have our
teachers<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.480> care<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.379> much

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
teachers really care we have so much

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.420 
teachers really care we have so much
academic<00:00:52.680> support<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:54.030> no<00:00:54.149> no<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.449> it's

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
academic support but if no no but it's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.380 
academic support but if no no but it's
it's<00:00:56.430> hard<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> differentiate<00:00:57.120> between

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
it's hard to differentiate between

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.970 
it's hard to differentiate between
whether<00:00:57.899> they<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.289> care<00:00:58.559> they<00:00:58.710> don't<00:00:58.859> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
whether they really care they don't I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680 
whether they really care they don't I
don't<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.399> they<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.090> care

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
don't know but they really really care

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.470 
don't know but they really really care
how<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.559> show<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:03.300> any

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
how do they show that if you have any

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
how do they show that if you have any
trouble<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.019> anything<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.739> go<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.070> after
