00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.859
 follow the smartphone test with me 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.899
 philipp today with the well again 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.880
 currently strongest windows phone that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.679
 nokia lumia ever gives to the market 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.469
 930 and what's on the kasseler 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.120
 the idea now a big display is yes 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.650
 meanwhile, for heinz smartphones 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.590
 that's why here too 5 inches tall 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.090
 video of camera and button below 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.949
 with the menu buttons for windows from 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.720
 otherwise, we also have a very chic 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.519
 alu frame as I think volume is 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.189
 with power button and extra camera button 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.750
 also still and a micro usb and above 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.730
 headphone jack and nanos the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.530
 card slot everything housed in the frame 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.270
 the back is in black and white 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.770
 green and orange very bright colors 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.559
 sees people but also feels very 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.030
 nice share back camera with lightning 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.320
 Of course, also with it as I think 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.850
 visually one of the most beautiful 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.980
 smartphones are currently available at all 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.120
 but just right can through this 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.469
 frame and is therefore not completely 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.530
 require hand like other smartphones 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.050
 which are executed a little bit round 98 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.270
 millimeter thick all the way to 167 grams 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.559
 Hard is not so slim 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.079
 like others and much fatter 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.180
 samsung galaxy s 5 nokia installed at 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.250
 only 930 a five inch oled 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.260
 display with cleartec technology so 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.820
 As you might already suspect 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.619
 an excellent black value and so 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.240
 high contrast as it is at oled 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.070
 display is so common and also the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 Colors are very much alive and yet 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.430
 of course, really an external one 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.380
 display which is very nice to look at 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.960
 besides, is also high resolution gives full 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.270
 hd resolution with fans all that makes 441 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.860
 pepi really a great one 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.450
 display where there is nothing to complain about 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.240
 and protected by gorilla glas 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.710
 three things on the nokia lumia 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.479
 who would have thought no android is running 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.189
 or windows phone 8.1 is the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.110
 latest version that currently exists 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.920
 and the whole thing looks very nice too 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.079
 at first glance 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.520
 There are a few uniforms to you 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.110
 for example the photo book or something 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.880
 but can quickly delete all 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.470
 and of course it is missing again 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.360
 few things for example google 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.860
 specific apps like youtube but it 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.450
 is a way to question everything around 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.020
 to come and do it all the same 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.549
 use 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.930
 There are also three kovacs for example 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.399
 care apps they do not update then there 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.930
 it is also a mistake to find a mistake 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.119
 solution around it but of course disturbs 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.530
 the first look something 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.210
 otherwise it is really a nice os 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.920
 it is very fluid it all works 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.149
 wonderful it looks beautiful has many 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.710
 functions really a good one 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.480
 alternative to android if you look 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.410
 once listened to 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.230
 that makes for neat power 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.540
 networks 800 inside 2.21 quad core 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.310
 processor with 2 GB of RAM 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.990
 So there are performances for games of it 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.520
 more than enough for windows phone worries 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.770
 So for some hours of fun on 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.200
 the big screen still 32 gb 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.100
 etc mass storage for videos of photos 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.510
 page not expandable per 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.040
 memory card that means if you have more 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.700
 space needs to do must also attacked 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.560
 To fall back on 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.470
 nokia donates to the back 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.750
 lumen and 30 a 20 megapixel camera 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.310
 to a dual-led flash have been 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.570
 are only 1.2 megapixels 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.670
 that must be enough for the selphy 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.620
 on the way back of the camera makes 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.880
 really very nice photos for that 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.040
 Image quality is good noise behavior 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.320
 as well as the camera app itself 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.670
 is he extra the nokia kemmer is very 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.630
 beautifully constructed now briefly tarnish 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.550
 Settings below you can 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.990
 switch between photo and video and that 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.610
 really very cool you can 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.140
 even photos in raw format that absorbs 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.890
 means it is much better on the pc 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.480
 to edit 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.920
 Then there is the creative study 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.180
 means you can on the phone photos 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.110
 work with numerous for the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.020
 effects et cetera 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.610
 and that is very nice unfortunately 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.380
 not only with 30 frames and videos 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.660
 record full hd that is it 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.670
 gives neither 4k nor slow motion effects 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.380
 or similar but it's no cool 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.640
 Extra there is an audio bass filter that 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.710
 means tells you so have the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.910
 low-frequency sounds out as disturbing 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.560
 the engine noise or similar 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.280
 background you can do that with it 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.780
 filter out 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.760
 the speaker also does one 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.530
 very good figure has some volume 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.300
 Sounds neither tinny nor otherwise 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.640
 just a very nice thing makes you 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.780
 good figure and keep it going like it 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.180
 opt for a high end smartphone 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.250
 heard of course is lte with up to 150 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.170
 meter per second on board as well hspa 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.390
 plus for fast internet on the go 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.840
 but at home it's off the post with 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.060
 wlan b / g / n ac in the 2.4 and 5 ghz range 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.430
 and of course annecy and 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.500
 bluetooth 4.0 uses six order 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.330
 gps pay and even the chinese 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.890
 Baidu used the free ones 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.790
 cards from nokia here that's us 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.560
 really can around the world 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.360
 Free to navigate what actually 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.860
 is pretty cool feature and 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.520
 Tell me, you're so lost 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.530
 no way 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.360
 The battery only holds 2024 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.250
 milliole hours relatively small 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.510
 but the operating system is just fine 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.040
 programmed that means they come 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.810
 still loose throughout the day and 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.920
 maybe second and second 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.780
 I think that it comes for such a thing 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.850
 actually quite enough 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.800
 Power supply is with 15 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.209
 a bit stronger than normal and 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.830
 This will make the phone a bit faster 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.110
 loaded and with that we come already 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.580
 To sum up, I personally think so 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.380
 really nice that finally nokia one 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.270
 Highend money really very high quality 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.710
 has completed components too 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.630
 can compete with the competition 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.700
 There is a very good camera stronger 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.020
 hardware a good speaker and it 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.400
 is as I said for me visually that 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.080
 most beautiful smartphone there currently 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.970
 you celebrate with everyone on the way 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.170
 fall on both sides but always a bit 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.730
 Restricted what windows phone and the 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.350
 apps like i said just google 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.810
 special stuff is a bit 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.370
 cumbersome but otherwise for 410 euros 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.780
 currently have and thus for the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.650
 Offered equipment actually right 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.200
 cheap as I think 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.720
 and it can also be easily with lte or 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.920
 a samsung galaxy s 5 keep up with what 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.150
 he is so you have a windows 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.380
 friends or would you guys 11? 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.130
 want to buy writes in the 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.360
 Comments 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.920
 otherwise there is neither my thumb 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.290
 up here you see that was again 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.930
 last video the lg gps and children 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.930
 matthias with the lumia 925
