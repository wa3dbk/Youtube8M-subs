00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.140
 and so we will cut the ring like this 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.140
 way held in a vice 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.750
 and cut and then cut the ring 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.750
 grinder 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.790
 not hooking myself 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.790
 wagon 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:54.110
 well here is the basis of the semi 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.120
 we will change the bearing cut off 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.589
 old bearing retaining rings 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:06.460
 thrown out before you put a new 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.460
 bearing we remove these protective 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:17.690
 protective plates and we shove there 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:20.000
 grease see there balls down just 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.460
 hook it all with a screwdriver she 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.300
 removed and well capital back as well 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.990
 from this side 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.600
 why did he bring with diarrhea show 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.030
 difference what would be in the half-line 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.340
 Look here is a new retaining ring 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:41.530
 which we will heat and stick 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.530
 look so he finds this bands 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:52.890
 she practically comes to her place 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:55.620
 without heating and look at this half shaft 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:02.850
 these are different by 8 this bearing 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:07.310
 falls here too we need 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.310
 hammer him 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.070
 stuff we take such makarom 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:28.690
 adjustable wrench expose it by 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:28.690
 internal holder and hammer down 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.510
 until the bearing sits in its place 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.840
 consider here he rested 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:14.100
 farther 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.100
 the clip sits tightly 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.360
 further we warm this ring 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:26.160
 and dress here by this place 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:36.730
 so like that 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.730
 ring hard 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.490
 before landing filled 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.360
 such a propane burner 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.250
 it is clear that 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.250
 just we will not work 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.250
 toast so 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.250
 flow 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.580
 buried under 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.729
 chew 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:08.840
 and until it gets cold we started it 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.840
 pressed down 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.960
 how Makar 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:24.070
 waited 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.070
 and let's go cool to cool 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.070
 bespeco due 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.130
 understand
