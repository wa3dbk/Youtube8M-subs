00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
or something like that with this so I'll

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.370 
or something like that with this so I'll
play<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> few<00:01:06.600> tunes<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.200> hear<00:01:07.350> how

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380

play a few tunes so you can hear how
this<00:01:07.560> thing<00:01:07.740> sounds

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.630 

so<00:03:56.299> this<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:57.049> think<00:03:57.170> has<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.590> very<00:03:58.190> comparable

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
so this I think has a very comparable

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.300 
so this I think has a very comparable
kind<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.630> feel<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.440> lot<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.769> other<00:04:00.890> German

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
kind of feel to a lot of other German

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.110 
kind of feel to a lot of other German
models

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
models

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.849 
models
I<00:04:02.150> think<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.720> fingerboard<00:04:03.260> is<00:04:03.380> much<00:04:03.590> improved

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
I think the fingerboard is much improved

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.020 
I think the fingerboard is much improved
over<00:04:04.250> some<00:04:04.400> of<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.549> other<00:04:04.579> ones<00:04:04.850> that<00:04:04.940> you

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
over some of the other ones that you

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.400 
over some of the other ones that you
might<00:04:05.150> find<00:04:05.359> though<00:04:05.569> around<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.930> same<00:04:06.139> price

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
might find though around the same price

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.819 
might find though around the same price
range<00:04:06.880> comparable<00:04:07.880> models<00:04:08.030> yeah<00:04:08.359> so<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.470> very

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
range comparable models yeah so a very

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.050
