00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.129
 It does not hold, but the normal phone will be 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.809
 here you put it and it rests here 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.910
 you ca n't read twitter 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.219
 charge that from yusb immediately goes here on 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.059
 you hold the short wire you charge 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.420
 in general izi 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.460
 there is one volume control 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.609
 video is the volume control 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.379
 he fucking tight why are you 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.809
 tight and there is Alena 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.329
 flow the first time I see this movie 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.920
 that regulate the backlight strength this 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.909
 cool would do this all day 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.280
 this epic club would I have 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.530
 rock button i don't know what to do but 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.210
 I really want to press 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.570
 no this is not a button so let's 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.490
 try what it is 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.770
 protection can not be so no it 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.470
 some kind of button it just has a very 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.229
 small move probably and you can assign 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.479
 anything for a candle 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.030
 candles it is cherry red 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.409
 see a huge distance from the key to 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.720
 the basis 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.790
 not so much even such a muffled 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.369
 the sound is not ringing as it happens often 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.440
 mechanical keyboards new if 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.390
 Understand it is often heard that 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.050
 principle sound cherry red he practically 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.610
 everywhere the same there is a row of four 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.250
 five additional keys that 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.170
 you can bind on anything big 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.240
 curve gap by the way he curve is the same 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.020
 like a curve in laptops and such 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.990
 branded 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.660
 proprietary form of the Rogow's gap and this 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.880
 cool that they lead this line by 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.190
 all their accessories laptops on top 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.860
 have such an incomprehensible destination 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.670
 most likely just for beauty 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.250
 aluminum stuff on those 2 bolts 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.989
 stand under the palm removed by the way 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.270
 this is aluminum stuff here in general 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.130
 saying you need a huge table at the desk 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.240
 yours wo n't fit the minijack under 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.060
 headset and 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.020
 microphone and 2 usb ports is a keyboard 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.630
 wired 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.880
 by the way he has legs here 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.890
 there are gum everywhere 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.810
 now I think it is with me 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.610
 some corps torn off and now 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.620
 stuck here so that the keyboard does not 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.570
 moving really massive and not 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.070
 I will say that it freak because that 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.890
 massive there are big keyboards 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.980
 especially for example steelseries apex 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.710
 healthy and ugly well it's healthy and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.260
 sort of harmoniously all 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.740
 looks aluminum base is just 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.250
 bomb bomb keyboard and this is a new mouse 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.880
 g 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.030
 x 860 market means she is also under the label 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.870
 republic of gamer she is very light a little 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.760
 less than 100 grams has a sensor with a frequency 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.730
 abtu 8210 forever you can minimal 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.950
 set up 800 children and further in the scoop 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.420
 play as you like it has a lot 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.240
 all sorts of 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.030
 holes under the backlight here it is generally just 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.930
 made a hole so she glowed 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.930
 rubberized 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.390
 lining for grip different grip as themes 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.189
 somehow you have something to grab even 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.230
 if you are very strongly tight if 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.879
 the sweaty card goes that is here 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.099
 mortgages and here it will not slide 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.620
 there are extra many keys 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.939
 one two Three 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.950
 by the way even a little 3 just 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.859
 extra itâ€™s cool you can 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.519
 the base of the phalanx put here covers 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.959
 here here or here winston class 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.489
 there are keys that are directly below 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.739
 palanga you need the whole finger in the air 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.989
 keep and so you got laid pressed 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.180
 here on the same answer here there is a button 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.370
 sensitivity adjustment in a very 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.530
 beautiful wheel everyone watched the movie front 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.389
 there was a motorcycle wheel like this 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.919
 she looks and of course the lights 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.750
 in front of it all seems to me 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.349
 were inspired by some kind of automotive 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.539
 the subject may not be but looks 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.130
 beautifully easy accessible martyrs on 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.740
 this booth we found jayar 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.599
 6 this is a steam machine from asus which we 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.639
 seen on computer si last year ago 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.160
 she just got a new iron and 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.900
 now there is a newer gang 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.760
 modern there is a bundle where in which in 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.389
 The kit comes with such a membrane 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.550
 keyboard 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.680
 so simple but pretty 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.460
 mouse membrane keyboard is very light 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.199
 wired 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.510
 notice the highlight she 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.669
 highlights not the keys and damn it all 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.289
 keyboard and it looks enough 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.930
 well there is a special eyelet 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.330
 to hang here so ama hasal ama 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.210
 Ama Hasala on the neck can be hung 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.520
 and walk here or from this side 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.449
 or so you know on the neck is not the type 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.819
 walk around like that on the keyboard and 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:13.210
 as the type is such a delight for you 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:15.310
 perverts here it is this computer which 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.229
 that you want in your in 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.720
 two-room apartment to take one 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.729
 room the whole family of 9 people live 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.280
 in the same room and let the computer live 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:28.030
 in the second room he deserves it 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.840
 inwin housing which I don't even know how 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.500
 to write correctly 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.880
 he has motorized legs and 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.370
 motorized mechanisms understand and 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.560
 chesky who invest and lays out 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.590
 this body for it to open 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.410
 you got him looked at all that 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.330
 what is there and then closed and he 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.690
 formed worth waiting for the next time 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.220
 very interesting concept mobile 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.580
 what's the finished product keyboard 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.169
 which is called claymore rgb 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.150
 backlit mechanical keyboard here 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.060
 cherry switches 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.949
 rgb if remember yes those that were 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.460
 only corsair and now they have 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.740
 asus 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.060
 and it can be either wired or 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.360
 wireless become sorry when 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.310
 wireless it is not highlighted 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.270
 probably can not be highlighted but it 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.490
 no problem 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.580
 well she is very small and maybe 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.849
 and very nice way of interest 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.310
 what else can you connect 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:30.490
 additional blog to us where to find there in 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.360
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and everything else is possible 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.490
 connect here by microusb 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.919
 No, this is not like micro and light like 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.530
 is that this is some kind of court you can 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.330
 connect here you can connect with this 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.240
 the parties, too, something I basically do not know 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.830
 some block of extra keys 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.530
 a lot of interesting stuff here is yusb 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.210
 there is a headphone microphone in order 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.370
 to connect it all to the computer you 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.139
 first do connect it here 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.300
 when these ports become available 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.000
 In general, such interesting keyboards still 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.400
 I have not seen before 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.759
 wireless modular backlit p 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.080
 moron let's go back she now 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.779
 glows in different colors 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.069
 interesting creative installation 

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:14.610
 called triple 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:18.900
 swift begin 27 igil 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:21.779
 to country rock monitor 4k is not all 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:25.469
 g-sync technology all of them 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:27.420
 27-inch connected to computer in 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:30.900
 which 3 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.210
 g-tx titanium and you imagine what a force 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.870
 you take the joystick you can drive up to very 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.560
 I'll look for myself 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:41.120
 to the word recently on youtube linus by the way 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.710
 Cases and this video just to replay back 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.840
 Klayna did such a project and compared 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.660
 does it make sense even to the most powerful 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:52.110
 iron to set yourself 34 to the display and 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:55.710
 There is no point in playing a conclusion. 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:57.150
 because they will still play well they 

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.700
 not at all optimized for such 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:05.300
 hardcore but here to demonstrate 

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:05.300
 Eggs is his set up 

00:08:15.569 --> 00:08:17.599
 and
