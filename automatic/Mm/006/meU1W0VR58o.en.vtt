00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770 

this<00:00:00.719> example<00:00:01.170> has<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:02.340> very<00:00:02.639> familiar<00:00:03.210> look<00:00:03.480> to

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
this example has a very familiar look to

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.120 
this example has a very familiar look to
it<00:00:04.279> we<00:00:05.279> can<00:00:05.359> piggyback<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.410> assignments

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
it we can piggyback on the assignments

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.459 
it we can piggyback on the assignments
of<00:00:08.280> shapes<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:09.000> used<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.780> last<00:00:10.050> slide

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
of shapes that we used in the last slide

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.759 
of shapes that we used in the last slide
because<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.340> molecules<00:00:11.490> are<00:00:11.940> all<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.330> same

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
because the molecules are all the same

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.380 
because the molecules are all the same
to<00:00:13.769> go<00:00:13.950> directly<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.859> hybridization<00:00:16.859> and

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
to go directly to the hybridization and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.640 
to go directly to the hybridization and
now<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.930> need<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.350> make<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.770> connection<00:00:20.480> the

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
now we need to make that connection the

those<00:02:08.770> are<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.130> central<00:02:09.550> atoms<00:02:09.910> those<00:02:10.660> are

therefore<00:02:31.359> s<00:02:31.890> T<00:02:33.780> think<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.840> little<00:02:34.959> more<00:02:35.079> about

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469 
therefore s T think a little more about

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.869 
therefore s T think a little more about
that<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:37.030> SP<00:02:37.569> hybridization<00:02:38.519> goes<00:02:39.519> into

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
that the SP hybridization goes into

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:53.420 
that the SP hybridization goes into
making<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.900> two<00:02:41.849> sigma<00:02:42.849> bonds<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:51.010> F<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.260> 2n

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
making the two sigma bonds to F and 2n

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.369 
making the two sigma bonds to F and 2n
but<00:02:54.430> remember<00:02:54.760> there<00:02:55.090> are<00:02:55.120> two<00:02:55.689> P<00:02:56.349> orbitals

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
but remember there are two P orbitals

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:11.830 
but remember there are two P orbitals
that<00:02:56.980> are<00:02:57.159> unhybridized

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.559 

and<00:03:12.260> they<00:03:13.129> go<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.550> make<00:03:14.000> two<00:03:14.860> pi<00:03:15.860> bonds<00:03:17.379> linking

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
and they go to make two pi bonds linking

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.540 
and they go to make two pi bonds linking
the<00:03:20.569> carbon<00:03:21.879> nitrogen<00:03:22.989> triple<00:03:23.989> bond<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:25.400> the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
the carbon nitrogen triple bond so the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.270 
the carbon nitrogen triple bond so the
carbon<00:03:25.790> nitrogen<00:03:26.269> triple<00:03:26.840> bond<00:03:27.160> consists<00:03:28.160> of

carbon nitrogen triple bond consists of
a<00:03:29.590> sigma<00:03:30.590> bond<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.450> two<00:03:32.450> pi<00:03:33.080> bonds

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.770

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.820 
linking the carbon to the ch3 group to
the<00:05:08.270> hydrogen<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.080> to<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.710> oxygen<00:05:10.480> but<00:05:11.830> there

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
the hydrogen and to the oxygen but there

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:23.560 
the hydrogen and to the oxygen but there
is<00:05:12.860> one<00:05:14.470> unhybridized<00:05:15.470> p<00:05:16.360> orbital<00:05:21.910> and<00:05:22.910> that

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
is one unhybridized p orbital and that

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.430 
is one unhybridized p orbital and that
goes<00:05:23.870> to<00:05:24.200> make<00:05:24.350> a<00:05:24.590> pie<00:05:25.930> component<00:05:27.880> of<00:05:29.440> the

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
goes to make a pie component of the

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.530 
goes to make a pie component of the
carbon<00:05:31.720> oxygen<00:05:32.720> double<00:05:33.140> bond<00:05:33.760> so<00:05:34.760> just<00:05:35.180> as<00:05:35.390> in

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
carbon oxygen double bond so just as in

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.780 
carbon oxygen double bond so just as in
a<00:05:35.630> carbon-carbon<00:05:36.440> double<00:05:36.740> bond<00:05:37.280> we<00:05:37.610> have<00:05:37.640> a

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
a carbon-carbon double bond we have a

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.480 
a carbon-carbon double bond we have a
sigma<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:38.420> a<00:05:38.540> PI<00:05:38.750> component<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:40.190> in<00:05:40.340> this

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
sigma and a PI component so in this

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.880 
sigma and a PI component so in this
carbon<00:05:41.060> oxygen<00:05:41.510> double<00:05:41.870> bond<00:05:42.380> we<00:05:42.710> have<00:05:42.740> a

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
carbon oxygen double bond we have a

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.210 
carbon oxygen double bond we have a
sigma<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:43.940> pike
