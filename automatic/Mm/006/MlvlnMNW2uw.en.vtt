00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello there is a romance block with you again 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.240
 master mobile and in this tutorial we will 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.410
 change touchscreen on but those models c3 01 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.100
 it changes very simply now I tell you 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.720
 This will show us everything to begin with. 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.150
 need to remove the cover and the battery after 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.980
 what we unscrew on the perimeter 6 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:33.270
 screws 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:36.960
 unscrew t5 size screwdriver 6 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.719
 cogs that we attach to the front 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.280
 part of the body on which directly 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.700
 and our touchscreen is faulty 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.160
 touch screen element if exits 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.100
 the building begins such signs begins 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.510
 press some other functions 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:06.600
 if you push there for example on the menu 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:09.619
 climbs out or something shorter is still young with 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 we have two sides here 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:23.980
 clothespins that we need to unfasten 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:29.980
 before you start removing the cover 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.980
 we need to pull them a little bit 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.990
 closer to the center 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:46.700
 depth and body neatly here 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:48.580
 already think that the bones are shot so bent with 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.250
 this side 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.920
 picks up the bottom of the case keeps 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.180
 the keyboard clings to the case of nothing 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.700
 terrible break nothing and so 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.490
 we hold around the perimeter we remove the touchscreen 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.229
 we have a touchscreen 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:14.450
 attached to the frame straight to the front 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:22.180
 parts of the body so that we remove with 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:25.459
 him like this so they removed the touch screen 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:31.489
 now expand it backwards 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:36.739
 side and neatly delayed 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.940
 We raise the body so that we do not 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.930
 parses the whole frame 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.080
 it is enough for us to raise part of the body 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.340
 central and unfasten the connector 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:54.310
 neatly touchscreen and so likewise 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:59.200
 order we put set new 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.200
 let's position it with a connector 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.090
 then put neatly 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.090
 can it all 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.650
 pinch 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.650
 and so I can't get there 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:28.569
 So we look if the touchscreen connector 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:34.160
 connected to the connector on the system 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:37.100
 trays rather found fu loop headset 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.690
 called my 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.690
 pereschelkay neatly take 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:49.310
 wipe if we do not mess with that 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:56.810
 same not wipe and neatly it 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:58.790
 insert into the frame of the front of the case 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.440
 and so he had a pimple here 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:09.519
 neatly everything after that 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:11.530
 rotate it 180 degrees train 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:17.450
 on the touchscreen 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.620
 will take the position we need and then 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.610
 we can take off 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.510
 neatly internal film 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.210
 which was pasted on the touchscreen for 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.220
 so that he does not hold it 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:37.610
 just by shipment or 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:41.560
 not scratched and read everything back after 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.560
 which is neat 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.560
 snap 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.080
 bottom is usually bad here 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:05:00.060
 snaps 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:05:05.270
 keyboard case force and tighten on 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:08.870
 this lesson is over we tighten the screws 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.870
