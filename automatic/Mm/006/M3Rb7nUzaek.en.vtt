00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
release so it's kind of weird but I

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.540 
release so it's kind of weird but I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
for the collection so it looks like I'll

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.750 
for the collection so it looks like I'll

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.420 
course I can't leave a mac store without
getting<00:00:36.600> something<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.890> decided<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> get<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
getting something so I decided to get a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.410 
getting something so I decided to get a
few<00:00:38.579> pigments<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.770> actually<00:00:40.770> um<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.520> spoke

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
few pigments and actually um I spoke

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.700 
few pigments and actually um I spoke
with<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.629> manager<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.170> gave<00:00:43.440> me<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
with the manager and they gave me a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.350 
with the manager and they gave me a
pigment<00:00:44.100> sample<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.030> last

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
pigment sample so I know in my last

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.479 
pigment sample so I know in my last
video<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:46.050> was<00:00:46.469> complaining<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.010> they<00:00:47.280> didn't

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
video I was complaining that they didn't

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.910 
video I was complaining that they didn't
get<00:00:47.579> pigment<00:00:47.940> samples<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:49.140> actually<00:00:49.320> do

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
get pigment samples but they actually do

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.950 
get pigment samples but they actually do
so<00:00:50.640> i<00:00:50.670> don't<00:00:50.969> know<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.270> because<00:00:51.420> i<00:00:51.629> had

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
so i don't know if it's because i had

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.770 
so i don't know if it's because i had
pre<00:00:52.199> ordered<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> bunch<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.860> stuff<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.660> plus<00:00:54.660> i

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
pre ordered a bunch of stuff and plus i

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.360 
pre ordered a bunch of stuff and plus i
had<00:00:54.870> bought<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.260> stuff<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.710> top<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.219> i

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
had bought this stuff on top of it i

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.700 
had bought this stuff on top of it i
don't<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.760> i<00:00:57.000> guess<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.420> depends<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> mac

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
don't know i guess it depends on the mac

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.310 
don't know i guess it depends on the mac
ma<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.910> ma<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.570> gave<00:01:00.750> me<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> two

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
ma and the ma that gave me the two

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560 
ma and the ma that gave me the two
pigment<00:01:01.739> samples<00:01:02.100> before<00:01:02.329> actually<00:01:03.329> helped

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
pigment samples before actually helped

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.109 
pigment samples before actually helped
me<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.930> time<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.559> i<00:01:04.589> think<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.309> depends<00:01:05.760> on

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
me this time so i think it depends on

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.950 
me this time so i think it depends on
the<00:01:06.350> mac<00:01:07.350> ma<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.970> or<00:01:09.000> not<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.600> i

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the mac ma if they like you or not or i

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
the mac ma if they like you or not or i
don't<00:01:10.140> know<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.189> anyway<00:01:11.700> let<00:01:12.240> me
