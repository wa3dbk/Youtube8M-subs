00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.639

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.040
 homemade and I hope you like it 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.590
 all of you 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.440
 to make this rich ice cream we are going to 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.360
 need these ingredients starting 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.000
 for this fruit called Lucuma is 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.340
 a Peruvian fruit super creamy and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.170
 amarillito I really recommend it to 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.930
 all and now I get here frozen 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.570
 express are that it is already pegadita 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.079
 we're also going to need 500 milligrams 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.809
 of chantilly frozen 500 milligrams of 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.840
 milk and to decorate we will need 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.840
 beers and chocolates to taste 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.640
 we will start making our ice cream 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.010
 peeling the lucuma and removing the nugget 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.170
 that they have inside then this is 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.129
 will do as a creampie and we will beat 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.129
 the simply a little 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.180
 the followed you will take your blender and 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 you are going to empty the 500 milliliters of milk 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.530
 you will also add all the lucuma 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.060
 500 grams of lucuma and let's start 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.060
 to liquefy all this 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 then girls are going to add what is 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.450
 sugar and this in my preference I 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.189
 I add enough to make it very sweet 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.979
 yes it is but if you are taking care 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.369
 they simply add to the taste of all 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.369
 your 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.579
 we are going to let liquefy these for a few 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.399
 seconds for it to dissolve completely 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.500
 the sugar and it's going to take a consistency 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.930
 how would you be a milk if you are super 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.439
 creamy that video we are going to empty it in 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.689
 a large container and we're going to place 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.369
 all our chantilly blocks 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.369
 frozen inside him 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.340
 after adding all the chantilly we're going 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.120
 to place a few drops of vanilla 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.640
 to give it more smell and a little more 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.500
 flavor to our side we will use 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.720
 also this instrument that is like 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.790
 to beat egg all of you what 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.220
 they have at home so we can all 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.220
 make this super homemade ice cream girls and 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.350
 let's start to stir all this 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.520
 here my husband is helping me girls 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.500
 as you can see, it's super easy to dissolve 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.860
 so little by little we're going to go 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.870
 beating until a liquid forms 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.870
 super juicy and we want 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.530
 here 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.020
 this is optional girls like me 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.140
 love the sweet I'm going to add a 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.210
 little bit of condensed milk I ice it 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.760
 I'm going to let you beat for a few 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.340
 seconds more and as you see this 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.660
 increased it has become very very frothy 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.180
 it is for that reason that our side is going to 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.700
 keep super creamy so I'm going 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.330
 to add in a container that is a 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.190
 liter and a half and still going to be left over 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.050
 much more ice cream and this we are going to 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.540
 let stand in our refrigerator 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.540
 about three to four hours 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.810
 and here it's already been 4 hours and the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.629
 side is super super hard and also 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.079
 it's super creamy so we're going to 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:49.019
 start decorating our ice cream that 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:52.049
 I'm going to use these little things that are 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.120
 for ice cream and we're going to start 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.390
 remove it and that is helping me from this 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.349
 part I'm going to place about 3 balls 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.109
 after that I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.790
 chantilly and I'm going to place a beer 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.609
 you can also place the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.810
 chocolate that at the beginning I told them to 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:15.030
 so they can combine a lot of flavor 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:19.320
 so we made two to eat 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.329
 we both ice cream and if you 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.100
 could not get lucuma what can 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.979
 do mango or what can they do 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.289
 strawberry with the fruit that you most 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:32.000
 like it or more want so I hope that you 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.000
 I liked a kiss for all
