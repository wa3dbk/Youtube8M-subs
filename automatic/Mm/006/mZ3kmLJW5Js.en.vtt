this<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.599> the<00:00:01.310> xm25<00:00:02.659> that<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.990> Army<00:00:04.380> is

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
this is the xm25 that the Army is

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.709 
this is the xm25 that the Army is
experimenting<00:00:05.370> with<00:00:05.400> right<00:00:05.759> now<00:00:06.319> it<00:00:07.610> is

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
experimenting with right now it is

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.209 
experimenting with right now it is
extremely<00:00:09.719> high-tech<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.710> maybe<00:00:10.980> more

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
extremely high-tech and maybe more

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.980 
extremely high-tech and maybe more
accurate<00:00:11.820> than<00:00:12.059> any<00:00:12.330> gun<00:00:12.719> before<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.980> why

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
accurate than any gun before it why

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.529 
accurate than any gun before it why
here's<00:00:15.990> why<00:00:16.609> with<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.760> thing<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.090> soldier<00:00:18.510> can

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
here's why with this thing a soldier can

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.019 
here's why with this thing a soldier can
hit<00:00:18.840> bad<00:00:19.080> guys<00:00:19.380> from<00:00:19.800> as<00:00:19.980> far<00:00:20.220> as<00:00:20.460> two<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.359 
half football fields and here's the push
they<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.350> even<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> target<00:00:26.250> is

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
they can do so even if the target is

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.849 
they can do so even if the target is
hiding<00:00:26.670> behind<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.060> wall<00:00:27.300> or<00:00:27.660> hiding<00:00:28.170> behind<00:00:28.439> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
first time we're putting a smart weapon

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.600 
first time we're putting a smart weapon
in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> hands<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.890> our<00:01:20.009> soldiers<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
infantry squad level and the xm25 is a

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.350 
infantry squad level and the xm25 is a
25<00:01:24.689> millimeter<00:01:24.960> airburst<00:01:25.850> technology<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
25 millimeter airburst technology and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.210 
25 millimeter airburst technology and
what<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.720> does<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.770> three

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
what it really does is it's got three

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.710 
what it really does is it's got three
components<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> top<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.479> see<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
components on the top you see a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.859 
components on the top you see a
integrated<00:01:31.549> fire<00:01:32.549> control<00:01:32.970> system<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.479> a

integrated fire control system with a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.020 
integrated fire control system with a
day<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.650> night<00:01:34.680> sight<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
day and a night sight you have the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
day and a night sight you have the
weapon<00:01:36.600> system<00:01:36.900> itself<00:01:37.170> which<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.560> rifle

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
weapon system itself which is a rifle

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.130 
weapon system itself which is a rifle
semi-automatic<00:01:38.759> rifle<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.720> which<00:01:39.840> holds

four rounds and you have the smart round

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.960 
four rounds and you have the smart round
the<00:01:42.899> 25<00:01:43.500> millimeter<00:01:43.920> round<00:01:44.159> has<00:01:44.340> two<00:01:44.549> warheads

the 25 millimeter round has two warheads

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.190 
the 25 millimeter round has two warheads
in<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.360> that's<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> destructive<00:01:46.170> power

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
in it and that's the destructive power

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.710 
in it and that's the destructive power
you<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> video<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.790> how<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.090> works<00:01:48.299> it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
you see in a video but how it works it's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.749 
you see in a video but how it works it's
actually<00:01:49.079> very<00:01:49.110> simple<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:50.280> soldier<00:01:50.640> would

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
actually very simple the soldier would

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.120 
actually very simple the soldier would
just<00:01:51.000> pick<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> weapon<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.770> I'll<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.789 
for you here if it's okay mm-hmm pick up
the<00:01:56.189> weapon<00:01:56.520> he<00:01:57.030> would<00:01:57.180> charge<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.799> looks

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
the weapon he would charge it looks

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.980 
the weapon he would charge it looks
through<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:58.979> site<00:01:59.280> he<00:01:59.700> automatically<00:02:00.390> lazes

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
through the site he automatically lazes

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.499 
through the site he automatically lazes
the<00:02:01.140> distance<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.829> target<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:03.329> he

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the distance to the target and then he

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.910 
the distance to the target and then he
could<00:02:03.659> increment<00:02:03.990> using<00:02:04.439> these<00:02:04.500> buttons<00:02:04.740> here

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
could increment using these buttons here

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.130 
could increment using these buttons here
a<00:02:05.250> plus<00:02:05.700> or<00:02:05.939> minus<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.450> meter<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.960> case

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
a plus or minus a meter in this case

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.139 
a plus or minus a meter in this case
he'd<00:02:07.290> want<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.530> add<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> meter<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> he<00:02:08.759> simply

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
he'd want to add a meter and he simply

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.150 
he'd want to add a meter and he simply
just<00:02:09.330> pulls<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.869> trigger<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.590> he<00:02:10.739> does<00:02:10.950> that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
just pulls the trigger and he does that

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.690 
just pulls the trigger and he does that
that<00:02:11.270> automatically<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.450> fire<00:02:12.629> control

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
that automatically the fire control

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.580 
that automatically the fire control
system<00:02:13.940> sends<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.870> information<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.470> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
system sends the information to the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.740 
system sends the information to the
round<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.670> round<00:02:16.849> nose<00:02:17.000> exactly<00:02:17.599> would

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
round and the round nose exactly would

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.009 
round and the round nose exactly would
have<00:02:17.840> burst<00:02:17.989> over<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.440> target<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.840> it

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
have burst over the target so it

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.970 
have burst over the target so it
actually<00:02:21.200> rather<00:02:22.010> than<00:02:22.220> being<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.870> director<00:02:23.980> a

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
actually rather than being a director a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.729 
actually rather than being a director a
target<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.730> actually<00:02:26.239> would<00:02:26.720> go<00:02:26.930> around<00:02:27.170> and

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
target it actually would go around and

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.820 
target it actually would go around and
then<00:02:27.890> burst<00:02:28.310> behind<00:02:28.970> him<00:02:29.239> or<00:02:29.420> above<00:02:30.260> him<00:02:30.500> for

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
then burst behind him or above him for

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.339 
then burst behind him or above him for
example<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:31.640> can<00:02:32.030> kind<00:02:32.630> of<00:02:32.750> figure<00:02:32.930> out<00:02:33.200> what

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
example I can kind of figure out what

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.050 
example I can kind of figure out what
the<00:02:33.440> advantages<00:02:33.590> would<00:02:34.310> be<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:34.880> but

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
the advantages would be to this but

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.390 
the advantages would be to this but
would<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.390> explain<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.870> me<00:02:36.140> why<00:02:36.800> this<00:02:36.860> would

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
would you explain to me why this would

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.229 
would you explain to me why this would
be<00:02:37.580> integral<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.739> important<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:40.120> soldiers<00:02:41.120> in

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
be integral to important to soldiers in

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.530 
be integral to important to soldiers in
combat<00:02:42.519> yeah<00:02:43.519> absolutely<00:02:43.700> i<00:02:44.090> mean<00:02:44.299> when

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
combat yeah absolutely i mean when

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.180 
combat yeah absolutely i mean when
soldiers<00:02:44.840> come<00:02:44.959> on<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.140> direct<00:02:45.260> fire<00:02:45.590> on<00:02:45.890> both

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
soldiers come on to direct fire on both

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.800 
soldiers come on to direct fire on both
sides<00:02:46.489> they<00:02:46.730> get<00:02:46.849> down<00:02:46.970> behind<00:02:47.150> cover<00:02:47.540> that's

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
sides they get down behind cover that's

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.839 
sides they get down behind cover that's
the<00:02:47.900> first<00:02:48.110> thing<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.410> do<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:49.220> this<00:02:49.489> weapon

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
the first thing to do this this weapon

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.550 
the first thing to do this this weapon
system<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.239> this<00:02:50.330> round<00:02:50.599> basically<00:02:51.260> takes

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
system in this round basically takes

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.890 
system in this round basically takes
that<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:52.069> enemy's<00:02:52.579> ability<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:53.540> hide<00:02:53.750> behind

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
that the enemy's ability to hide behind

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.199 
that the enemy's ability to hide behind
cover<00:02:54.319> away<00:02:54.739> now<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.549> doesn't<00:02:55.790> necessarily<00:02:56.090> go

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
cover away now it doesn't necessarily go

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.240 
cover away now it doesn't necessarily go
around<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.660> target<00:02:57.019> but<00:02:57.380> it's<00:02:57.739> programmed<00:02:58.160> to

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
around a target but it's programmed to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.520 
around a target but it's programmed to
go<00:02:58.370> over<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:59.120> target<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.690> then<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.290> round

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
go over the target and then the round

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.440 
go over the target and then the round
explodes<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.549> fragmentation<00:03:02.120> comes

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
explodes and the fragmentation comes

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.270 
explodes and the fragmentation comes
down<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.900> soldiers<00:03:03.319> enemy<00:03:03.920> soldiers

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
down on the soldiers enemy soldiers

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.030 
down on the soldiers enemy soldiers
hiding<00:03:04.670> either<00:03:05.060> in<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.299> foxhole<00:03:05.690> behind<00:03:06.590> in

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
hiding either in a foxhole behind in

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.819 
hiding either in a foxhole behind in
behind<00:03:07.370> any<00:03:07.459> cover<00:03:07.730> as<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:07.970> saw<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.239> video

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
behind any cover as you saw in the video

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.490 
behind any cover as you saw in the video
how<00:03:09.829> long<00:03:10.130> before<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:11.420> thing<00:03:11.720> is<00:03:11.780> actually

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
how long before this thing is actually

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.819 
how long before this thing is actually
actuated<00:03:13.430> by<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:14.329> Pentagon<00:03:14.810> how<00:03:15.290> long<00:03:15.500> before

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
actuated by the Pentagon how long before

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.240 
actuated by the Pentagon how long before
we<00:03:15.950> see<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.310> use<00:03:17.680> well<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.769> program<00:03:19.100> is

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
we see it in use well the program is

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.410 
we see it in use well the program is
fully<00:03:19.400> funding<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:19.940> we're<00:03:20.030> extremely<00:03:20.329> excited

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
fully funding so we're extremely excited

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.809 
fully funding so we're extremely excited
about<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:21.109> our<00:03:21.680> operational<00:03:22.280> test<00:03:22.549> is<00:03:22.700> in

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
about that our operational test is in

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.670 
about that our operational test is in
fiscal<00:03:23.120> year<00:03:23.299> 12<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.870> shortly<00:03:24.380> after<00:03:24.650> that

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
fiscal year 12 and shortly after that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.710 
fiscal year 12 and shortly after that
we'll<00:03:24.950> begin<00:03:25.130> feeling<00:03:25.430> two<00:03:25.639> units<00:03:25.940> but<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.540> will

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
we'll begin feeling two units but I will

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.690 
we'll begin feeling two units but I will
tell<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.049> prior<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.889> we<00:03:28.400> will<00:03:28.549> do

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
tell you that prior to that we will do

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.879 
tell you that prior to that we will do
limited<00:03:29.420> user<00:03:29.660> assessments<00:03:30.319> with<00:03:30.440> units<00:03:30.799> in

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
limited user assessments with units in

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.110 
limited user assessments with units in
the<00:03:30.980> field<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.489> when<00:03:31.609> I<00:03:31.639> need<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.819> field

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
the field and when I need a field

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.030 
the field and when I need a field
typically<00:03:32.930> we'll<00:03:33.109> bring<00:03:33.260> them<00:03:33.440> two<00:03:33.680> units<00:03:33.980> in

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
typically we'll bring them two units in

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.920 
typically we'll bring them two units in
Afghanistan<00:03:34.639> because<00:03:35.060> we<00:03:35.239> want<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.510> know<00:03:35.660> what

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
Afghanistan because we want to know what

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.180 
Afghanistan because we want to know what
the<00:03:36.079> soldiers<00:03:36.260> think<00:03:36.620> about<00:03:36.769> the<00:03:36.889> system

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
the soldiers think about the system

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.949 
the soldiers think about the system
what's<00:03:37.489> good<00:03:37.730> what's<00:03:38.000> bad<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.480> then<00:03:38.780> we<00:03:38.840> can

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
what's good what's bad and then we can

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.120 
what's good what's bad and then we can
incorporate<00:03:39.230> that<00:03:39.650> into<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:39.950> manufacturing

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
incorporate that into the manufacturing

put it together I guess the another
question<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.720> that<00:04:37.840> raises<00:04:38.320> for<00:04:38.530> me<00:04:38.680> is<00:04:38.830> one

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
question that that raises for me is one

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.140 
question that that raises for me is one
of<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.160> things<00:04:39.280> I've<00:04:39.490> noticed<00:04:39.639> being<00:04:40.060> a

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
of the things I've noticed being a

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.760 
of the things I've noticed being a
former<00:04:40.360> college<00:04:40.630> football<00:04:41.050> player<00:04:41.320> is<00:04:41.560> the

former college football player is the

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.100 
former college football player is the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
better the NFL improves the equipment

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.409 
better the NFL improves the equipment
the<00:04:44.590> more<00:04:44.800> head<00:04:44.980> injuries<00:04:45.460> we<00:04:45.669> get<00:04:45.910> it's

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
the more head injuries we get it's

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.000 
the more head injuries we get it's
almost<00:04:46.690> like<00:04:46.870> when<00:04:47.050> you<00:04:47.169> make<00:04:47.380> people<00:04:47.560> when

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
almost like when you make people when

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.350 
almost like when you make people when
you<00:04:48.100> give<00:04:48.250> people<00:04:48.280> better<00:04:48.700> equipment<00:04:49.060> then

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
you give people better equipment then

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.790 
you give people better equipment then
they<00:04:49.480> can<00:04:49.630> ran<00:04:49.780> their<00:04:49.960> heads<00:04:50.139> together<00:04:50.290> in<00:04:50.710> the

they can ran their heads together in the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.379 
they can ran their heads together in the
past<00:04:51.010> before<00:04:51.250> they<00:04:51.460> wore<00:04:51.639> helmets<00:04:51.820> they

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
past before they wore helmets they

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.409 
past before they wore helmets they
grabbed<00:04:52.660> themselves<00:04:53.200> around<00:04:53.410> their<00:04:53.800> waist

the more we improve our stuff it always

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.340 
the more we improve our stuff it always

military<00:05:08.050> standpoint<00:05:08.560> does<00:05:08.889> that<00:05:09.040> concern

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
military standpoint does that concern

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.990 
military standpoint does that concern
you<00:05:10.830> know<00:05:11.830> because<00:05:12.040> we<00:05:12.160> always<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.550> one<00:05:12.790> step

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
you know because we always a one step

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.090 
you know because we always a one step
ahead<00:05:13.120> of<00:05:13.240> them<00:05:13.389> in<00:05:13.570> my<00:05:13.660> opinion<00:05:14.139> so<00:05:14.620> this

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
ahead of them in my opinion so this

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.350 
ahead of them in my opinion so this
technology<00:05:15.669> we<00:05:15.760> working<00:05:16.030> on<00:05:16.120> for<00:05:16.240> a<00:05:16.330> couple

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
technology we working on for a couple

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.210 
technology we working on for a couple
years<00:05:16.600> when<00:05:16.930> we<00:05:17.050> feel<00:05:17.290> this<00:05:17.530> that<00:05:18.010> we're<00:05:18.130> not

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
years when we feel this that we're not

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.409 
years when we feel this that we're not
going<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.430> stop<00:05:18.639> there<00:05:18.880> we're<00:05:19.240> going<00:05:19.360> to

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
going to stop there we're going to

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.760 
going to stop there we're going to
continue<00:05:19.540> to<00:05:19.810> make<00:05:19.990> developments<00:05:20.500> in<00:05:20.590> this

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
continue to make developments in this

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.330 
continue to make developments in this
and<00:05:20.979> other<00:05:21.070> technologies<00:05:22.889> how<00:05:23.889> long<00:05:24.070> do<00:05:24.250> you

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
and other technologies how long do you

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.020 
and other technologies how long do you
think<00:05:24.400> before<00:05:24.790> we<00:05:25.240> actually<00:05:25.750> see<00:05:26.380> this<00:05:27.030> being

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
think before we actually see this being

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.940 
think before we actually see this being
used<00:05:28.510> if<00:05:28.810> you<00:05:28.930> were<00:05:29.050> just<00:05:29.320> to<00:05:29.470> give<00:05:29.650> us<00:05:29.770> an

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
used if you were just to give us an

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.150 
used if you were just to give us an
estimated<00:05:30.700> guess<00:05:31.060> do<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:31.960> see<00:05:32.200> it<00:05:32.350> actually<00:05:32.950> I

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
estimated guess do you see it actually I

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.010 
estimated guess do you see it actually I
would<00:05:33.430> imagine<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:36.030> go-ahead<00:05:37.030> I<00:05:37.330> would<00:05:37.900> think

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
would imagine a go-ahead I would think

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.480 
would imagine a go-ahead I would think
reckon<00:05:38.320> about<00:05:38.410> a<00:05:38.560> year<00:05:38.770> from<00:05:38.800> now<00:05:38.979> we'll<00:05:39.280> see

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
reckon about a year from now we'll see

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.100 
reckon about a year from now we'll see
soldiers<00:05:40.000> in<00:05:40.150> limited<00:05:40.479> quantities<00:05:40.930> using

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
this in Afghanistan and that way again

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.050 
this in Afghanistan and that way again
we<00:05:43.930> can<00:05:44.110> get<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.890> likes<00:05:45.250> and<00:05:45.370> dislikes<00:05:45.820> and

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
we can get the likes and dislikes and

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.760 
we can get the likes and dislikes and
put<00:05:46.510> that<00:05:46.630> back<00:05:46.810> into<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.080> process<00:05:47.470> to<00:05:47.620> make<00:05:47.710> a

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
put that back into the process to make a

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.230 
put that back into the process to make a
make<00:05:48.130> it<00:05:48.160> even<00:05:48.370> better<00:05:48.520> fascinating

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
make it even better fascinating

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.350 
make it even better fascinating
