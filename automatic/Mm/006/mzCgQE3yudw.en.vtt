00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
location it'll be right there on the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.870 
location it'll be right there on the
other<00:01:37.620> shelf<00:01:38.010> but<00:01:38.250> we're<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:38.700> pick

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
other shelf but we're going to go pick

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.170 
other shelf but we're going to go pick
that<00:01:38.910> up<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.330> then<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.230> have<00:01:40.260> to<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.830> is

that up and then all you have to do is
collect<00:01:42.180> your<00:01:42.659> crystal<00:01:43.260> so<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.650> got<00:01:43.770> to

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
collect your crystal so you just got to

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.740 
collect your crystal so you just got to
go<00:01:43.980> down<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.340> crazy<00:01:44.640> place<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.510> time

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
and you'll be able to get the crystal

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.550 
and you'll be able to get the crystal
and<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.360> go<00:01:54.390> through<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> portal<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
then we can go and grab the crystal here

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.270 
then we can go and grab the crystal here
and<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.380> want<00:01:58.470> to<00:01:58.590> make<00:01:58.680> sure<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.920> don't<00:01:59.190> know

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and you want to make sure I don't know

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.469 
and you want to make sure I don't know
if<00:01:59.400> I've<00:01:59.550> said<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.000> other<00:02:00.180> videos

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
if I've said this in the other videos

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.520 
if I've said this in the other videos
you<00:02:00.510> want<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.870> make<00:02:00.990> sure<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.380> going

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
through the right portal to pick up the

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.969 
through the right portal to pick up the
crystal<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:04.260> if<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.500> don't<00:02:04.650> go<00:02:04.770> through

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
crystal because if you don't go through

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.920 
crystal because if you don't go through

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the right portal this time the crystal

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.990 
the right portal this time the crystal
won't<00:02:07.110> show<00:02:07.290> up<00:02:07.470> further<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.610> Easter<00:02:08.909> Egg

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
won't show up further on the Easter Egg

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.279 
won't show up further on the Easter Egg
it<00:02:09.119> doesn't<00:02:09.360> matter<00:02:09.479> what<00:02:09.659> portal<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.140> go

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
it doesn't matter what portal you go

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.990 
it doesn't matter what portal you go
through<00:02:10.590> however<00:02:11.220> once<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.580> actually<00:02:11.790> get

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
through however once you actually get

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.390 
through however once you actually get
the<00:02:12.060> crystal<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:13.049> can<00:02:13.260> go<00:02:13.409> ahead<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.799> go<00:02:14.250> down

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
the crystal you can go ahead and go down

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.300 
the crystal you can go ahead and go down
to<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.670> excavation<00:02:15.390> site<00:02:15.659> and<00:02:15.930> go<00:02:16.799> build<00:02:17.129> it

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
to the excavation site and go build it

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.280 
to the excavation site and go build it
and<00:02:17.430> like<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.700> said<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.150> other<00:02:18.180> two<00:02:18.569> Fire

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and like I said in the other two Fire

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.530 
and like I said in the other two Fire
and<00:02:19.620> wind<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.760> normal<00:02:20.970> buildable

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
and wind it's just a normal buildable

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.210 
and wind it's just a normal buildable
you<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:21.840> have<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.020> hold<00:02:22.170> X<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.650> once<00:02:23.069> you

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
you just have to hold X and once you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.949 
you just have to hold X and once you
hold<00:02:23.340> X<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.819> build<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.180> you're<00:02:24.360> going<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.780> get

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
hold X and build it you're going to get

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:25.809 
hold X and build it you're going to get
the<00:02:25.230> blue<00:02:25.470> I
