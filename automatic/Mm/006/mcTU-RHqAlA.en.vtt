17<00:00:24.359> gravity<00:00:24.750> I'm<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.680> thought<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
17 gravity I'm just thought I was on the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.859 
17 gravity I'm just thought I was on the
witness<00:00:26.340> honestly<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> difference

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
witness honestly what was the difference

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.200 
witness honestly what was the difference
i<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> scoring<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.250> guys<00:00:29.429> had<00:00:29.609> started

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
i can the scoring you guys had started

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.359 
i can the scoring you guys had started
off<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.810> well<00:00:30.840> second<00:00:31.470> half<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:32.009> kill<00:00:32.160> it

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
off so well second half can they kill it

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.639 
off so well second half can they kill it
28<00:00:33.030> points<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.570> second<00:00:33.989> well<00:00:34.410> i<00:00:34.440> don't

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
28 points in that second well i don't

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.930 
28 points in that second well i don't
think<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.890> was<00:00:35.040> able<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.399> stops<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
think we was able to get stops on the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
think we was able to get stops on the
power<00:00:36.149> cord<00:00:36.480> usual<00:00:37.380> gets<00:00:37.680> awfully<00:00:38.070> hit<00:00:38.190> when

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
power cord usual gets awfully hit when

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.650 
power cord usual gets awfully hit when
around<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> first<00:00:38.850> quarter<00:00:39.120> that's<00:00:39.329> probably

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
around the first quarter that's probably

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.130 
around the first quarter that's probably
a<00:00:40.379> good<00:00:40.860> temple<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.550> third<00:00:42.390> quarter<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.899> stop

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
a good temple or third quarter we stop

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.950 
a good temple or third quarter we stop
learning<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.620> stuff<00:00:43.739> that's<00:00:44.010> cute<00:00:44.340> dog

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
learning this stuff that's cute dog

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.180 
learning this stuff that's cute dog
everything<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.050> predicated<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.739> people's

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
everything is predicated on people's

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.459 
everything is predicated on people's
experiment<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.230> better<00:00:49.379> job

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
experiment so we gonna do a better job

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
experiment so we gonna do a better job
you<00:00:49.860> know<00:00:49.980> even<00:00:50.850> though<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.149> want<00:00:51.360> two<00:00:51.510> games

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
you know even though we want two games

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
in the lotus of the third game in where

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.069 
in the lotus of the third game in where
we<00:00:53.399> go<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> big<00:00:53.850> leaves<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.449> little<00:00:54.809> slip<00:00:54.989> away

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
we go to big leaves and little slip away

so you got to expect every game to be

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.670 
so you got to expect every game to be
like<00:01:13.189> this<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:13.880> know<00:01:14.229> coming<00:01:15.229> down<00:01:15.439> to<00:01:15.590> the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
like this you know coming down to the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.719 
like this you know coming down to the
wire<00:01:15.710> both<00:01:16.189> teams<00:01:16.490> trying<00:01:16.759> to<00:01:16.880> find<00:01:16.939> an<00:01:17.210> edge

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
feel like we let down to slip away so we

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.289 
feel like we let down to slip away so we
feel<00:01:30.200> like<00:01:30.320> we're<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.799> good<00:01:31.520> momentum<00:01:31.820> but<00:01:32.149> you
