00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
are delicious they are my favorite I

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.490 
are delicious they are my favorite I
make<00:05:29.949> them<00:05:30.130> so<00:05:30.490> often<00:05:31.030> they're<00:05:31.870> not<00:05:32.050> the

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
make them so often they're not the

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.409 
make them so often they're not the
healthiest<00:05:33.190> for<00:05:33.699> you<00:05:33.850> but<00:05:34.120> they're<00:05:34.240> still

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
made from whole ingredients the only

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.770 
made from whole ingredients the only
downfall<00:05:36.580> is<00:05:36.910> they<00:05:37.000> may<00:05:37.120> have<00:05:37.270> a<00:05:37.300> lot<00:05:37.479> of<00:05:37.570> fat

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780
