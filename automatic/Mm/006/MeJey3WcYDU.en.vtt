a kind of like what if the power goes

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.250 
a kind of like what if the power goes
out<00:00:20.670> prepper<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.359> that's<00:00:21.539> what<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.869> video<00:00:22.199> is

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so this is actually my heating system in

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.060 
so this is actually my heating system in
this<00:00:45.000> building<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.630> and<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.500> heat<00:00:46.680> my<00:00:46.710> house

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
this building here and I heat my house

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.670 
this building here and I heat my house
and<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.820> workshop<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.660> setup<00:00:48.990> and<00:00:49.260> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and the workshop with this setup and it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
and the workshop with this setup and it
runs<00:00:49.890> off<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.370> sunflower<00:00:51.150> seeds<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.750> have

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
runs off of sunflower seeds that have

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.260 
runs off of sunflower seeds that have
gone<00:00:52.140> through<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> milling<00:00:53.070> process<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.970> I<00:00:54.000> get

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
gone through a milling process so I get

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.930 
gone through a milling process so I get
the<00:00:54.390> waste<00:00:54.600> leftover<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.340> still<00:00:56.550> requires

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the waste leftover but it still requires

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.970 
the waste leftover but it still requires
a<00:00:57.090> little<00:00:57.270> bit<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> electricity<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.680> make<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
a little bit of electricity to make it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.150 
a little bit of electricity to make it
run<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.460> need<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.260> need<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.350> run<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.680> electric

guys will get themselves set up with a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.760 
guys will get themselves set up with a
generator<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:35.990> then<00:01:36.990> they<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:37.590> while

so we seem to spend a lot of time in the
workshop<00:02:10.399> when<00:02:11.330> I'm<00:02:11.450> making<00:02:11.720> videos<00:02:11.840> and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
workshop when I'm making videos and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.880 
workshop when I'm making videos and
stuff<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.310> today<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.670> get<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> rare<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.620> grow

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
stuff so today you get a rare and grow

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.090 
stuff so today you get a rare and grow
to<00:02:15.950> one's<00:02:16.220> house<00:02:16.930> experience<00:02:17.980> really<00:02:18.980> it's

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
to one's house experience really it's

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.010 
to one's house experience really it's
only<00:02:19.250> going<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.520> be<00:02:19.580> we're<00:02:19.880> just<00:02:19.910> in<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.330> like

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
only going to be we're just in the like

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.710 
only going to be we're just in the like
in<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.290> furnace<00:02:21.590> room<00:02:21.940> laundry<00:02:22.940> room<00:02:23.090> area<00:02:23.209> so

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
in the furnace room laundry room area so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.750 
in the furnace room laundry room area so
let's<00:02:23.959> go<00:02:24.080> have<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> look<00:02:24.500> at<00:02:24.620> my<00:02:24.770> generator<00:02:25.520> or

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
let's go have a look at my generator or

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.900 
let's go have a look at my generator or
transfer<00:02:26.180> switch<00:02:27.100> okay<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.430> couple<00:02:28.700> of

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
transfer switch okay so a couple of

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.520 
transfer switch okay so a couple of
panels<00:02:29.270> here<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.380> house

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
panels here that I have in the house

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.490 
panels here that I have in the house
this<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.340> my<00:02:31.550> my<00:02:32.270> main<00:02:32.450> power<00:02:32.720> source<00:02:33.020> this<00:02:33.290> is

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
this is my my main power source this is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.110 
this is my my main power source this is
that<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.680> believe<00:02:33.980> it's<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.250> 200<00:02:34.700> amp<00:02:34.819> service

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
that I believe it's a 200 amp service

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.740 
that I believe it's a 200 amp service
that<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.480> have<00:02:35.690> right<00:02:35.840> here<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.819> so<00:02:37.819> typically

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
that I have right here and so typically

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.229 
that I have right here and so typically
all<00:02:39.260> my<00:02:39.500> energy<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.010> coming<00:02:40.220> from<00:02:40.370> there<00:02:40.670> but

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
all my energy is coming from there but

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.020 
all my energy is coming from there but
here's<00:02:41.420> another<00:02:41.480> smaller<00:02:42.050> panel<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:43.030> I've

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
here's another smaller panel and I've

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.030 
here's another smaller panel and I've
got<00:02:44.239> all<00:02:44.390> my<00:02:44.420> key<00:02:44.959> breakers<00:02:45.470> here<00:02:45.680> all<00:02:45.890> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
got all my key breakers here all the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.850 
got all my key breakers here all the
stuff<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.519> I<00:02:46.790> want<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.180> have<00:02:47.300> energized<00:02:47.900> when

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
stuff that I want to have energized when

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.830 
stuff that I want to have energized when
that<00:02:49.100> power<00:02:49.280> goes<00:02:49.550> off<00:02:49.730> nothing<00:02:50.420> here<00:02:50.600> that's

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
that power goes off nothing here that's

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.690 
that power goes off nothing here that's
like<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.050> big<00:02:51.350> power<00:02:51.590> load<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.400> know<00:02:52.489> like

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
like a big power load but you know like

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.570 
like a big power load but you know like
my<00:02:52.880> furnace<00:02:53.269> fan<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.959> boiler<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:54.980> sewer

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
my furnace fan and the boiler and sewer

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.059 
my furnace fan and the boiler and sewer
pump<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.150> all<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.540> stuff<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:57.769> know<00:02:57.890> not

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
pump and all the stuff that you know not

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.070 
pump and all the stuff that you know not
high<00:02:58.310> load<00:02:58.549> stuff<00:02:58.910> but<00:02:59.150> key<00:02:59.569> stuff<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.049> I

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
high load stuff but key stuff that I

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.199 
high load stuff but key stuff that I
need<00:03:00.319> for<00:03:00.530> heating<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.130> just<00:03:01.610> general

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
need for heating and just general

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.289 
need for heating and just general
survival<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.140> house<00:03:03.290> here<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:04.760> can

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
survival in the house here so I can

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.750 
survival in the house here so I can
choose<00:03:05.600> where<00:03:06.380> this<00:03:06.769> panel<00:03:07.190> gets<00:03:07.430> its<00:03:07.610> power

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
choose where this panel gets its power

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.360 
choose where this panel gets its power
from<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.360> can<00:03:08.750> take<00:03:08.959> power<00:03:09.230> from<00:03:10.239> my<00:03:11.239> main<00:03:11.810> panel

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
from I can take power from my main panel

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.130 
from I can take power from my main panel
or<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.790> can<00:03:14.120> take<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.420> power<00:03:14.630> from<00:03:14.989> the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
or I can take the power from the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.220 
or I can take the power from the
generator<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.430> my<00:03:17.150> generator<00:03:17.630> can<00:03:17.870> supply

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
generator so my generator can supply

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.680 
generator so my generator can supply
this<00:03:18.290> box<00:03:18.769> also<00:03:19.130> if<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.610> want<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.390> all<00:03:20.660> I

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
this box also if I want to and and all I

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.800 
this box also if I want to and and all I
do<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.530> use<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:21.890> power<00:03:22.250> transfer<00:03:22.850> switch<00:03:23.090> to

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
do is I use a power transfer switch to

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.780 
do is I use a power transfer switch to
decide<00:03:24.260> where<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.709> gets<00:03:24.890> its<00:03:25.040> power<00:03:25.100> from<00:03:25.310> so

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
decide where it gets its power from so

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.990 
decide where it gets its power from so
right<00:03:26.420> now<00:03:26.570> this<00:03:27.350> small<00:03:27.530> breaker<00:03:28.400> box<00:03:28.730> it's

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
right now this small breaker box it's

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.770 
right now this small breaker box it's
getting<00:03:29.239> its<00:03:29.359> power<00:03:29.420> from<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.380> main<00:03:30.560> panel

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
getting its power from the main panel

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.120 
getting its power from the main panel
but<00:03:32.780> should<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.109> should<00:03:33.140> that<00:03:33.380> power<00:03:33.680> go<00:03:33.950> off

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
but should that should that power go off

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.599 
but should that should that power go off
and<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:35.150> will<00:03:35.390> fire<00:03:35.989> up<00:03:36.170> my<00:03:36.320> generator<00:03:36.769> then<00:03:37.430> I

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
and I will fire up my generator then I

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.640 
and I will fire up my generator then I
need<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> quick<00:03:38.090> way<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.660> energize<00:03:39.260> all<00:03:39.530> of

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
need a quick way to energize all of

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.840 
need a quick way to energize all of
those<00:03:39.739> breakers<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.340> that's<00:03:40.489> what<00:03:40.700> this

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
those breakers and that's what this

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.390 
those breakers and that's what this
power<00:03:41.329> transfer<00:03:41.959> switch<00:03:42.230> does<00:03:42.500> but<00:03:42.980> I'll<00:03:43.160> open

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
power transfer switch does but I'll open

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.800 
power transfer switch does but I'll open
this<00:03:43.489> thing<00:03:43.549> up<00:03:43.760> for<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.000> guys<00:03:46.750> show<00:03:47.750> you

this thing up for you guys show you

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.880 
this thing up for you guys show you
what's<00:03:48.049> on<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.290> inside<00:03:49.329> so<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:51.680> wire

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
what's on the inside so the the wire

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.759 
what's on the inside so the the wire
that<00:03:52.280> comes<00:03:52.489> from<00:03:52.760> my<00:03:52.940> panel<00:03:53.390> it's<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.590> one

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
that comes from my panel it's this one

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.000 
that comes from my panel it's this one
right<00:03:54.950> here<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:56.570> feeds<00:03:57.140> power<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.859> these

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
right here and it feeds power to these

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.110 
right here and it feeds power to these
two<00:03:58.700> terminals<00:03:59.000> here<00:03:59.630> and<00:04:00.370> if<00:04:01.370> this<00:04:01.640> lever<00:04:01.910> is

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
two terminals here and if this lever is

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.750 
two terminals here and if this lever is
in<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.269> down<00:04:02.359> position<00:04:02.799> then<00:04:03.799> contact<00:04:04.549> is

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
in the down position then contact is

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.160 
in the down position then contact is
made<00:04:05.590> up<00:04:06.590> on<00:04:06.799> top<00:04:07.040> there<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.940> these<00:04:08.170> contacts

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
made up on top there to these contacts

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.900 
sub panel here
if<00:04:21.230> I<00:04:21.500> decide<00:04:21.920> that<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.190> want<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.550> use<00:04:22.670> the

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
if I decide that I want to use the

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.600 
if I decide that I want to use the
generator<00:04:23.360> instead<00:04:23.980> they'll<00:04:24.980> move<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.400> lever

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
generator instead they'll move the lever

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.000 
generator instead they'll move the lever
in<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.790> up<00:04:25.970> position<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.660> then<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:27.710> red

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
in the up position and then this red

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.070 
in the up position and then this red
wire<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.490> then<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.760> black<00:04:29.000> one<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.750> takes

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
wire and then that black one it takes

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.200 
wire and then that black one it takes
its<00:04:30.290> power<00:04:30.470> from<00:04:30.800> up<00:04:30.920> top<00:04:31.100> here<00:04:31.400> see<00:04:31.910> these<00:04:32.090> are

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
its power from up top here see these are

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.990 
its power from up top here see these are
the<00:04:32.240> generator<00:04:32.750> wires<00:04:33.020> here<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.550> I<00:04:34.730> can't

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
the generator wires here so and I can't

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.470 
the generator wires here so and I can't
I<00:04:35.560> can't<00:04:36.560> select<00:04:36.800> both<00:04:37.160> I<00:04:37.460> have<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:38.030> pick<00:04:38.210> one

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
I can't select both I have to pick one

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.550 
I can't select both I have to pick one
or<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.810> other<00:04:39.050> so<00:04:40.010> if<00:04:40.160> I<00:04:40.340> go<00:04:40.460> here<00:04:41.320> I'm<00:04:42.320> taking

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
or the other so if I go here I'm taking

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.220 
or the other so if I go here I'm taking
power<00:04:42.920> from<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.220> generator<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:44.180> if<00:04:44.390> I<00:04:44.510> in<00:04:45.050> the

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
power from the generator and if I in the

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.050 
power from the generator and if I in the
bottom<00:04:46.010> position<00:04:47.650> power<00:04:48.650> from<00:04:49.040> the<00:04:49.250> panel

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
bottom position power from the panel

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.690 
bottom position power from the panel
there<00:04:50.530> here's<00:04:51.530> some<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.890> ductwork<00:04:52.220> for<00:04:52.580> my

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
there here's some of the ductwork for my

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.360 
there here's some of the ductwork for my
furnace<00:04:53.350> this<00:04:54.350> used<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:54.740> be<00:04:54.860> an<00:04:54.980> electric

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
furnace this used to be an electric

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.000 
furnace this used to be an electric
furnace<00:04:55.520> but<00:04:56.390> all<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.140> electric<00:04:57.530> elements

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
furnace but all the electric elements

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.560 
furnace but all the electric elements
have<00:04:58.130> been<00:04:58.160> removed<00:04:58.640> and<00:04:58.850> I've<00:04:58.970> just<00:04:59.120> got<00:04:59.390> this

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
have been removed and I've just got this

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.950 
have been removed and I've just got this
hot<00:05:00.140> water<00:05:00.410> a<00:05:00.530> radiator<00:05:00.950> in<00:05:01.040> there<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.810> so<00:05:02.810> all

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
hot water a radiator in there and so all

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.930 
hot water a radiator in there and so all
I<00:05:02.990> use<00:05:03.200> from<00:05:03.410> this<00:05:03.560> really<00:05:03.920> is<00:05:04.010> just<00:05:04.040> my

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
I use from this really is just my

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.700 
I use from this really is just my
furnace<00:05:05.330> fan<00:05:05.510> and<00:05:05.750> a<00:05:05.840> place<00:05:06.260> to<00:05:06.440> put<00:05:06.590> the

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
furnace fan and a place to put the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.010 
furnace fan and a place to put the
radiator<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.340> that's<00:05:07.580> how<00:05:07.760> my<00:05:07.970> my<00:05:08.600> house<00:05:08.750> is

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
radiator so that's how my my house is

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.820 
radiator so that's how my my house is
heated<00:05:10.090> this<00:05:11.090> black<00:05:11.390> wire<00:05:11.660> right<00:05:11.900> here<00:05:11.960> coming

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
heated this black wire right here coming

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.860 
heated this black wire right here coming
out<00:05:12.860> of<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.040> top<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.250> that<00:05:13.550> switch<00:05:14.180> that's

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
out of the top of that switch that's

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.840 
out of the top of that switch that's
actually<00:05:15.320> underground<00:05:15.890> wire<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:16.610> heads

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
actually underground wire and it heads

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.900 
actually underground wire and it heads
outside<00:05:17.350> to<00:05:18.350> my<00:05:18.530> boiler<00:05:19.250> room<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:19.550> I've<00:05:19.700> got<00:05:19.880> a

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
outside to my boiler room and I've got a

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.420 
outside to my boiler room and I've got a
I<00:05:20.270> got<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.690> place<00:05:20.930> for<00:05:21.170> my<00:05:21.350> generator<00:05:22.100> to<00:05:22.280> hook

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
I got a place for my generator to hook

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.580 
I got a place for my generator to hook
up<00:05:22.580> there<00:05:22.820> so<00:05:23.750> my<00:05:23.990> generator<00:05:24.410> is<00:05:24.560> running

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
up there so my generator is running

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.130 
up there so my generator is running
outside<00:05:25.010> and<00:05:25.610> I<00:05:26.150> got<00:05:26.300> power<00:05:26.450> coming<00:05:26.780> into<00:05:26.990> the

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
outside and I got power coming into the

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.890 
outside and I got power coming into the
house<00:05:27.290> here<00:05:27.680> into<00:05:28.190> my<00:05:28.340> box<00:05:28.640> it's<00:05:29.540> a<00:05:29.660> sweet

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
house here into my box it's a sweet

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.600 
house here into my box it's a sweet
setup<00:05:30.170> I've<00:05:30.380> used<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.740> a<00:05:30.800> couple<00:05:30.830> of<00:05:31.130> times<00:05:31.310> you

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.810 
setup I've used it a couple of times you
know<00:05:32.240> powers<00:05:32.630> out<00:05:32.870> bang<00:05:33.170> I<00:05:33.460> switch<00:05:34.460> over<00:05:34.640> to

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
know powers out bang I switch over to

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.900 
know powers out bang I switch over to
generator<00:05:35.300> fire<00:05:35.810> up<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.050> generator<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.910> then

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
generator fire up the generator and then

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.290 
generator fire up the generator and then
we're<00:05:38.120> all<00:05:38.600> under<00:05:38.840> control<00:05:38.870> here<00:05:39.380> so<00:05:39.760> but<00:05:40.760> yeah
