00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560 
sometimes sooner depending on buildup

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
and then I divide it into four mostly

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.550 
and then I divide it into four mostly
equal<00:00:21.720> sections

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
equal sections

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.590

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
each section click detangling tip when

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.960 
each section click detangling tip when
you're<00:01:22.830> detangling<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.460> want<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> work<00:01:23.820> your

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
you're detangling you want to work your

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.210 
you're detangling you want to work your
way<00:01:24.090> from<00:01:24.150> your<00:01:24.659> ends<00:01:25.080> up<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.740> roots<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
way from your ends up to your roots and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.450 
way from your ends up to your roots and
also<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.060> feel<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.439> everyone<00:01:28.439> should<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
also I feel like everyone should have a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.370 
also I feel like everyone should have a
watch<00:01:29.670> whose<00:01:29.909> comb<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> detangle<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.170> just

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
watch whose comb to detangle it it just

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.319 
watch whose comb to detangle it it just
makes<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> whole<00:01:31.740> detangling<00:01:32.340> process<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.060> bit

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
makes the whole detangling process a bit

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.330 
makes the whole detangling process a bit
easier

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
easier

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.139 
easier
now<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.270> hair<00:01:36.540> tends<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.930> soak<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.619> water

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
now my hair tends to soak up water

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.609 
now my hair tends to soak up water
superfast<00:01:39.149> so<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> always<00:01:39.899> have<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.259> make<00:01:40.409> sure

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
superfast so I always have to make sure

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.609 
superfast so I always have to make sure
I<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.310> water<00:01:41.670> bottle<00:01:42.149> next<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.930> me<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.380> keep

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
I have a water bottle next to me to keep

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.950 
I have a water bottle next to me to keep
wetting<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.460> hair<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.240> stays<00:01:45.630> wet

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
wetting my hair so that it stays wet

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.240 
wetting my hair so that it stays wet
throughout<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> whole<00:01:46.590> process<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.220> doing

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
throughout the whole process of doing

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.609 
throughout the whole process of doing
this<00:01:47.960> after<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.049> done<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.409> all<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
this after I'm done with all the

this<00:02:11.519> is<00:02:11.640> how<00:02:11.760> much<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.030> typically<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.660> lose

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this is how much I typically you lose

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.900

and<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.799> every<00:02:14.069> two<00:02:14.220> weeks<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> think

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
and this is every two weeks so I think

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.259

that's<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.209> decent<00:02:15.390> amount<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:17.060> finally<00:02:18.060> here

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
that's a decent amount and finally here

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.850 
that's a decent amount and finally here
