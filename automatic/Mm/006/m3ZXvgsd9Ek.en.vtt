00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.420
 Hello everyone, you are the sides of the park. 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.050
 guru 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.200
 My name is Dmitry and today we talk about 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.730
 laminate classes 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:23.269
 often choose flooring people 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:28.609
 They see that I offer lamination to the same 32 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:31.039
 33 class but sometimes I do not understand what it is 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:36.110
 what class represents itself 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:39.920
 use consists of two numbers 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:46.629
 first number all sound digit 1 digit 2 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.710
 1 digit indicates the type of room. 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.399
 respectively applies to home 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.940
 of use 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:58.210
 three for public spaces 44 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:03.980
 2 production loops 5 degree of load 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:06.080
 low average high and few years 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.150
 back has appeared still ultrahigh this 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.880
 four 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.799
 respectively, laminate 32 classes can 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.939
 decipher how long over for 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.880
 public spaces with medium 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.640
 passability average passability is 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.329
 some small offices may be 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.329
 high-end high-class laminate 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.970
 degree of load 33 class it can 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.610
 be there too some shops 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.320
 food here if you take 34 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.870
 cool exchange it may already be 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.850
 there for the airport naturally taken 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.950
 maximum load that can 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.950
 withstand even the flooring 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.979
 lemming flooring forty 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.020
 third grade there is such it for 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.450
 industrial premises with high 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.340
 load where it may already be where 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.130
 there is mariah carey and so on class 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.060
 laminate is determined by the low parameter 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.860
 it is impact resistance 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.820
 impact resistance many more parameters there 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.580
 for moisture resistance and so on here this 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.980
 the complex of these parameters determines 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.430
 the class 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.180
 Naturally laminate classes were 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.100
 developed European norms and started then 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.560
 was the German norm then moved into 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.630
 European norm and if you take some 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.769
 chinese laminate no standards 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.360
 accordingly there is no namely how 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.630
 european meaning it may not be 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.330
 match up chinese by 33 class with 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.340
 European you me there 33 situation is 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.200
 absolutely can be different and the train 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.580
 durability and impact resistance 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.580
 absolute can be of different quality 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.780
 well and the conclusion call us by phone 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.780
