00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
a boat going out like 10 15 minutes out

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.829 
a boat going out like 10 15 minutes out
into<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> sea<00:00:35.039> and<00:00:35.309> then<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.510> inside<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:36.839 
into the sea and then going inside a

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:39.680 
into the sea and then going inside a
cage<00:00:37.199> but<00:00:38.129> they<00:00:38.429> might<00:00:38.609> get<00:00:38.789> the<00:00:38.909> wise<00:00:39.089> idea

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
cage but they might get the wise idea

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.079 
cage but they might get the wise idea
jump<00:00:40.409> over<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.859> cage<00:00:41.069> because<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.519> know<00:00:41.730> TIFF

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
jump over the cage because I know TIFF

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:43.790 
jump over the cage because I know TIFF
would<00:00:42.300> say<00:00:42.480> she<00:00:42.809> ain't<00:00:42.870> scared<00:00:43.109> of<00:00:43.350> no<00:00:43.469> shark

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
would say she ain't scared of no shark

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.500 
would say she ain't scared of no shark
so<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.309> might<00:00:44.489> sense<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.390> like

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
so they might sense that and be like

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
so they might sense that and be like
what<00:00:45.749> you<00:00:46.170> ain't<00:00:46.289> fucking<00:00:46.469> scared<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.979> us<00:00:47.129> and

what you ain't fucking scared of us and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.219 
what you ain't fucking scared of us and
then<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.089> might<00:00:48.239> jump<00:00:48.569> over<00:00:48.929> and<00:00:49.050> try<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:49.229 
then they might jump over and try to

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:50.719
