another<00:03:18.569> neat<00:03:18.810> feature<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.759> by<00:03:20.759> turning<00:03:21.180> this

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
another neat feature is by turning this

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.979 
another neat feature is by turning this
bezel<00:03:22.739> here<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.739> turn<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:26.569> intake<00:03:27.569> on<00:03:27.810> or

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
bezel here you can turn the intake on or

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.860 
bezel here you can turn the intake on or
off<00:03:28.109> so<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.799> water<00:03:28.979> does<00:03:29.250> not<00:03:29.389> escape<00:03:30.389> out<00:03:30.750> of

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
off so that water does not escape out of

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.640 
off so that water does not escape out of
here<00:03:31.639> it<00:03:32.639> does<00:03:33.000> have<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.209> fairly<00:03:33.540> wide<00:03:34.079> opening

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
here it does have a fairly wide opening

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.339 
here it does have a fairly wide opening
so<00:03:34.949> you<00:03:35.269> can<00:03:36.269> fit<00:03:36.449> ice<00:03:36.599> cubes<00:03:36.959> in<00:03:37.139> here<00:03:39.349> it's

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
so you can fit ice cubes in here it's

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.610 
so you can fit ice cubes in here it's
also<00:03:40.530> makes<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.859> little<00:03:41.009> easier<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.459> clean<00:03:42.620> both

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
also makes a little easier to clean both

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.129 
also makes a little easier to clean both
