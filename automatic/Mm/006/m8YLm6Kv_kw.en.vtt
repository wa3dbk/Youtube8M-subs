00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479 
just more maneuverability you can get

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.989 
just more maneuverability you can get
off<00:00:43.929> curbs<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:44.829> a<00:00:44.949> little<00:00:45.339> more<00:00:45.460> freestyle

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:45.999 
off curbs and a little more freestyle

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.789 
off curbs and a little more freestyle
tricks<00:00:46.420> some<00:00:46.629> freeride<00:00:47.019> tricks<00:00:47.350> maybe<00:00:47.559> some

blunt<00:00:48.039> slides<00:00:48.309> that<00:00:48.549> sort<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:48.879> thing<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:50.469> has<00:00:51.190> a

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:51.959 
blunt slides that sort of thing it has a

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:55.229 
blunt slides that sort of thing it has a
pretty<00:00:52.959> unique<00:00:53.469> construction<00:00:54.100> here<00:00:54.579> they<00:00:55.030> got

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
pretty unique construction here they got

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.319 
pretty unique construction here they got
a<00:00:55.829> vertically<00:00:56.829> laminated<00:00:57.519> maple<00:00:57.729> in<00:00:58.120> there

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
a vertically laminated maple in there

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.660 
a vertically laminated maple in there
and<00:00:58.600> also<00:00:58.749> some<00:00:58.870> maple<00:00:59.229> going<00:00:59.739> the<00:01:00.190> regular

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
and also some maple going the regular

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.719 
and also some maple going the regular
way<00:01:00.909> as<00:01:01.119> well<00:01:01.449> it<00:01:02.379> has<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.589> kind<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.219> gentle

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
way as well it has a kind of a gentle

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.460 
way as well it has a kind of a gentle
Fleck<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.299> it<00:01:04.449> does<00:01:04.659> have<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:04.900> little<00:01:05.199> bit<00:01:05.350> of

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
Fleck so it does have a little bit of

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.320 
Fleck so it does have a little bit of
flex<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:06.010> give<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.160> little<00:01:06.400> energy<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:06.820> your<00:01:07.030> car

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
flex to give a little energy to your car

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.050 
flex to give a little energy to your car
some<00:01:07.990> vibration<00:01:08.620> dampening<00:01:09.220> which<00:01:09.910> is

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
some vibration dampening which is

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.610 
some vibration dampening which is
actually<00:01:10.360> kind<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.660> nice<00:01:10.840> for<00:01:11.230> when<00:01:11.410> you're

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
actually kind of nice for when you're

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.260 
actually kind of nice for when you're
when<00:01:12.130> you're<00:01:12.250> learning<00:01:12.400> your<00:01:12.730> slides<00:01:13.030> it's

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
when you're learning your slides it's

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.140 
when you're learning your slides it's
not<00:01:13.390> overly<00:01:13.720> stiff<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.460> takes<00:01:15.850> away<00:01:16.120> from

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
not overly stiff so it takes away from

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.830 
not overly stiff so it takes away from
those<00:01:16.570> vibrations<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.290> little<00:01:17.530> bit<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:19.720> a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
those vibrations a little bit just a

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.430 
those vibrations a little bit just a
great<00:01:20.200> all-around<00:01:20.500> board<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.640> comes<00:01:21.880> with<00:01:22.150> the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
great all-around board it comes with the

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.390 
great all-around board it comes with the
actually<00:01:23.440> before<00:01:23.710> I<00:01:23.860> start<00:01:24.100> talking<00:01:24.220> about

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
actually before I start talking about

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.370 
actually before I start talking about
the<00:01:24.520> trucks<00:01:24.790> I'll<00:01:25.120> say<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:25.540> they<00:01:25.690> are<00:01:25.870> a<00:01:25.900> drop

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
the trucks I'll say that they are a drop

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.170 
the trucks I'll say that they are a drop
through<00:01:26.650> mounted<00:01:27.130> which<00:01:27.730> means<00:01:27.940> that<00:01:28.090> the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
through mounted which means that the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.140 
through mounted which means that the
base<00:01:28.360> plate<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.810> gonna<00:01:28.930> sit<00:01:29.380> on<00:01:29.620> top<00:01:30.460> of<00:01:30.760> the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
base plate is gonna sit on top of the

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.030 
base plate is gonna sit on top of the
surface<00:01:31.480> of<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.780> board<00:01:32.080> it's<00:01:32.500> gonna<00:01:32.620> get<00:01:32.830> you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
surface of the board it's gonna get you

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.620 
surface of the board it's gonna get you
a<00:01:33.070> little<00:01:33.370> lower<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.970> ground<00:01:34.000> lower

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
a little lower to the ground lower

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.740 
a little lower to the ground lower
center<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:34.990> gravity<00:01:35.250> more<00:01:36.250> stable<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.240> also

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
center of gravity more stable and also

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.780 
center of gravity more stable and also
it's<00:01:38.020> going<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.200> give<00:01:38.440> you<00:01:38.620> a<00:01:38.650> more<00:01:39.040> lateral

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
it's going to give you a more lateral

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.390 
it's going to give you a more lateral
lower<00:01:40.120> leverage<00:01:40.870> on<00:01:41.110> your<00:01:41.320> trucks<00:01:41.620> so<00:01:42.190> if

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
lower leverage on your trucks so if

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.710 
lower leverage on your trucks so if
you're<00:01:42.520> trying<00:01:42.730> to<00:01:42.880> learn<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.180> slide<00:01:43.450> that's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
you're trying to learn to slide that's

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.480 
you're trying to learn to slide that's
really<00:01:43.990> helpful<00:01:44.409> because<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:45.070> just<00:01:45.190> makes<00:01:45.400> it

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
really helpful because it just makes it

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.910 
really helpful because it just makes it
easier<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:45.970> push<00:01:46.720> out<00:01:46.930> it's<00:01:47.590> gonna<00:01:47.710> be<00:01:47.800> a

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
easier to push out it's gonna be a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.860 
easier to push out it's gonna be a
little<00:01:48.100> less<00:01:48.370> grippy<00:01:48.909> that<00:01:49.120> way<00:01:49.330> which<00:01:49.840> is

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
little less grippy that way which is

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.990 
little less grippy that way which is
really<00:01:50.170> helpful<00:01:50.409> because<00:01:50.650> once<00:01:51.010> you<00:01:51.250> figure

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
really helpful because once you figure

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.280 
really helpful because once you figure
out<00:01:52.030> how<00:01:52.120> to<00:01:52.240> get<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.450> sideways<00:01:52.810> then<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.140> can

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
out how to get it sideways then you can

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.450 
out how to get it sideways then you can
learn<00:01:53.409> how<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.590> control<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.190> that's<00:01:54.280> really

78 a race formula wheels these are a
really<00:02:19.189> fun<00:02:19.489> wheel<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.849> I've<00:02:19.969> spent<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.269> lot

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
really fun wheel that I've spent a lot

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.410 
really fun wheel that I've spent a lot
of<00:02:20.450> time<00:02:20.750> on<00:02:20.959> its<00:02:21.799> a<00:02:21.859> good<00:02:22.010> grippy<00:02:22.430> formula<00:02:22.969> but

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
of time on its a good grippy formula but

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.339 
of time on its a good grippy formula but
it<00:02:23.510> does<00:02:23.659> have<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.019> rounded<00:02:24.560> lip<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:26.349> it's

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
it does have that rounded lip and it's

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.839 
it does have that rounded lip and it's
gonna<00:02:27.560> break<00:02:27.859> free<00:02:28.099> a<00:02:28.159> little<00:02:28.459> easier<00:02:28.700> that

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
gonna break free a little easier that

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.390 
gonna break free a little easier that
that<00:02:29.269> way<00:02:29.450> not<00:02:30.349> stone-ground<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:31.220> it's<00:02:31.310> gonna

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
that way not stone-ground so it's gonna

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.710 
that way not stone-ground so it's gonna
take<00:02:31.579> a<00:02:31.640> little<00:02:31.790> effort<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.209> break<00:02:32.390> them<00:02:32.569> in

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
take a little effort to break them in

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.140 
take a little effort to break them in
but<00:02:33.230> once<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.739> get<00:02:33.890> these<00:02:34.069> sliding<00:02:34.519> they're

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
but once you get these sliding they're

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.670 
but once you get these sliding they're
gonna<00:02:35.239> feel<00:02:35.450> really<00:02:35.629> good<00:02:35.810> really<00:02:36.019> consistent

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
gonna feel really good really consistent

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.890 
gonna feel really good really consistent
easy<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.069> control<00:02:37.400> they<00:02:37.970> have<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> new<00:02:38.359> core<00:02:38.689> on

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
easy to control they have a new core on

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.020 
easy to control they have a new core on
them<00:02:39.049> this<00:02:39.200> year<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.040> just<00:02:40.280> updated<00:02:40.849> for

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
them this year that we just updated for

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.759 
them this year that we just updated for
a<00:02:41.060> lot<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.329> new<00:02:41.480> wheels<00:02:41.719> it's<00:02:42.290> going<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.620> be

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
a lot of the new wheels it's going to be

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.270 
a lot of the new wheels it's going to be
you<00:02:43.549> know<00:02:43.670> just<00:02:43.939> wider<00:02:44.299> harder<00:02:44.900> faster<00:02:45.319> it's

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
you know just wider harder faster it's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.699 
you know just wider harder faster it's
gonna<00:02:46.430> give<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:47.239> wheels<00:02:47.420> longer<00:02:48.109> life<00:02:48.349> and

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
gonna give the wheels longer life and

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.800 
gonna give the wheels longer life and
more<00:02:49.099> consistent<00:02:49.670> wear<00:02:49.849> as<00:02:50.030> well<00:02:50.060> which<00:02:50.780> is

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
more consistent wear as well which is

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.929 
more consistent wear as well which is
really<00:02:51.230> cool<00:02:51.439> I<00:02:51.709> think<00:02:52.700> that's<00:02:52.849> about
