using a proprietary power cable here

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.050 
using a proprietary power cable here
mainly<00:01:41.960> because<00:01:42.249> microUSB<00:01:43.249> is<00:01:43.369> not<00:01:43.579> powerful

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
mainly because microUSB is not powerful

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.660 
mainly because microUSB is not powerful
enough<00:01:44.329> to<00:01:44.539> charge<00:01:44.929> a<00:01:45.079> full<00:01:45.259> sized<00:01:45.469> tablet<00:01:45.740> so

I<00:01:46.729> feel<00:01:46.909> like<00:01:46.939> I<00:01:47.090> should<00:01:47.240> point<00:01:47.359> that<00:01:47.539> out<00:01:47.659> in

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
I feel like I should point that out in

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.529 
I feel like I should point that out in

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350

try<00:04:16.090> them<00:04:16.209> both<00:04:16.390> on<00:04:16.570> for<00:04:16.780> size<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:19.959> can<00:04:20.079> see

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
try them both on for size so you can see

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.780 
try them both on for size so you can see
the<00:04:20.320> keys<00:04:20.470> are<00:04:20.590> not<00:04:20.739> raised<00:04:21.010> at<00:04:21.220> all<00:04:21.370> here

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
the keys are not raised at all here

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.210 
the keys are not raised at all here
pretty<00:04:22.720> much<00:04:22.810> just<00:04:23.170> flat<00:04:23.530> I<00:04:23.560> think<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.040> main

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
pretty much just flat I think the main

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.010 
pretty much just flat I think the main
difference<00:04:24.580> is<00:04:24.700> that<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:25.000> allows<00:04:25.270> you<00:04:25.540> to<00:04:25.570> use

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
difference is that it allows you to use

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.720 
difference is that it allows you to use
it<00:04:26.050> more<00:04:26.530> like<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.770> laptop<00:04:27.040> because<00:04:27.340> once<00:04:27.640> you

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
it more like a laptop because once you

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.370 
it more like a laptop because once you
have<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.910> kickstand<00:04:28.390> up<00:04:28.570> you've<00:04:29.110> got<00:04:29.230> this

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
have the kickstand up you've got this

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.890 
have the kickstand up you've got this
laying<00:04:29.710> flat<00:04:29.950> like<00:04:30.190> an<00:04:30.310> actual<00:04:30.580> keyboard<00:04:31.030> you

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
laying flat like an actual keyboard you

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.000 
laying flat like an actual keyboard you
can<00:04:31.930> kind<00:04:32.200> of<00:04:32.290> type<00:04:32.440> away<00:04:32.590> it<00:04:32.860> doesn't

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
can kind of type away it doesn't

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.640 
can kind of type away it doesn't
honestly<00:04:33.610> make<00:04:34.420> that<00:04:34.690> much<00:04:34.930> sense<00:04:34.960> other<00:04:35.500> than

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
honestly make that much sense other than

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.940 
honestly make that much sense other than
the<00:04:35.950> fact<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.250> it's<00:04:36.460> like<00:04:36.940> a<00:04:36.970> pretty<00:04:37.210> color

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
the fact that it's like a pretty color

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.320 
the fact that it's like a pretty color
let's<00:04:38.950> see<00:04:39.040> how<00:04:39.160> they<00:04:39.250> work<00:04:39.280> does<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.580> case<00:04:40.080> ok

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
let's see how they work does a case ok

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.100 
let's see how they work does a case ok
dang<00:04:43.330> nice<00:04:44.760> can't<00:04:45.760> close<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.090> pretty<00:04:46.930> nice

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
dang nice can't close it pretty nice

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.810 
dang nice can't close it pretty nice
little<00:04:47.260> cover<00:04:47.560> kind<00:04:47.890> of<00:04:48.040> like<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> Apple<00:04:48.640> one

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
little cover kind of like the Apple one

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.740 
little cover kind of like the Apple one
I<00:04:49.419> like<00:04:50.350> my<00:04:50.530> pink<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.190> then<00:04:52.090> when<00:04:52.270> I<00:04:52.300> open<00:04:52.660> it

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
I like my pink and then when I open it

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.440 
I like my pink and then when I open it
up<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:53.890> turns<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.340> on<00:04:54.460> just<00:04:54.970> like<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.330> Apple

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
up it turns it on just like the Apple

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:02.790 
up it turns it on just like the Apple
thing<00:04:56.070> then<00:04:57.070> I<00:04:58.020> can<00:04:59.020> kick<00:04:59.890> stand<00:05:00.660> Baba<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:02.710> I

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
thing then I can kick stand Baba and I

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.180 
thing then I can kick stand Baba and I
have<00:05:02.950> my<00:05:03.100> whole<00:05:03.220> little<00:05:03.520> baby<00:05:03.700> laptop<00:05:04.150> set<00:05:04.360> up

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
have my whole little baby laptop set up

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.950 
have my whole little baby laptop set up
one<00:05:06.190> other<00:05:06.340> thing<00:05:06.640> they<00:05:07.090> made<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.510> point<00:05:07.750> of

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
one other thing they made a point of

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.200 
one other thing they made a point of
telling<00:05:08.110> me<00:05:08.350> was<00:05:09.040> that<00:05:09.250> when<00:05:09.550> I<00:05:09.580> flip<00:05:10.000> the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
telling me was that when I flip the

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.600 
telling me was that when I flip the
cover<00:05:10.390> around<00:05:10.660> this<00:05:10.900> way<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.979> stops<00:05:12.370> working

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
cover around this way it stops working

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.880 
cover around this way it stops working
so<00:05:13.300> I<00:05:13.330> can't<00:05:13.720> accidentally<00:05:14.350> sort<00:05:14.620> of<00:05:14.680> type

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
so I can't accidentally sort of type

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.230 
so I can't accidentally sort of type
things<00:05:15.190> while<00:05:15.430> I'm<00:05:15.520> holding<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:15.940> which<00:05:16.120> is

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
things while I'm holding it which is

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.700 
things while I'm holding it which is
nice

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
nice

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.310 
nice
alright<00:05:17.710> let's<00:05:17.890> compare<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.400> our<00:05:19.320> little

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
alright let's compare it to our little

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.540 
alright let's compare it to our little
think<00:05:20.620> pad<00:05:20.800> guy<00:05:21.010> here<00:05:23.070> that's<00:05:24.070> pretty<00:05:24.340> nice

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
think pad guy here that's pretty nice

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.880 
think pad guy here that's pretty nice
actually<00:05:24.970> how<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:25.180> snaps<00:05:25.300> right<00:05:25.660> on<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:26.680> then

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
actually how it snaps right on and then

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.520 
actually how it snaps right on and then
we<00:05:27.010> have<00:05:27.190> our<00:05:27.340> little<00:05:27.490> desk<00:05:28.300> top<00:05:28.720> station<00:05:29.080> set

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
we have our little desk top station set

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.530 
we have our little desk top station set
up<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:29.950> guess<00:05:30.460> that's<00:05:30.669> why<00:05:30.790> this<00:05:30.850> only<00:05:31.210> comes<00:05:31.390> in

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
up I guess that's why this only comes in

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.909 
up I guess that's why this only comes in
black<00:05:31.570> because<00:05:32.020> this<00:05:32.290> is<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.500> business

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
black because this is the business

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.300 
black because this is the business
option<00:05:33.400> but<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.150> think<00:05:34.390> that's<00:05:34.540> kind<00:05:34.630> of<00:05:34.810> boring

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
option but I think that's kind of boring

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.650 
option but I think that's kind of boring
I'm<00:05:36.310> gonna<00:05:36.490> try<00:05:36.700> these<00:05:36.880> both<00:05:37.090> out<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.450> see<00:05:37.540> how

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
I'm gonna try these both out and see how

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.590 
I'm gonna try these both out and see how
they<00:05:37.780> go<00:05:37.930> but<00:05:38.710> unfortunately<00:05:38.979> I<00:05:39.850> do<00:05:40.150> have<00:05:40.300> to

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
they go but unfortunately I do have to

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.719 
they go but unfortunately I do have to
send<00:05:40.810> Jeff<00:05:40.990> kanata<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:41.560> pink<00:05:41.800> one<00:05:42.040> for<00:05:42.640> the

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
send Jeff kanata the pink one for the

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.630 
send Jeff kanata the pink one for the
torture<00:05:43.060> testing<00:05:43.390> a<00:05:44.070> quick<00:05:45.070> word<00:05:45.310> about

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
torture testing a quick word about

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.790 
torture testing a quick word about
Windows<00:05:46.180> RT<00:05:46.450> so<00:05:46.870> there<00:05:47.050> are<00:05:47.140> going<00:05:47.320> to<00:05:47.440> be<00:05:47.560> two

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
Windows RT so there are going to be two

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.620 
Windows RT so there are going to be two
versions<00:05:48.370> of<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.610> surface<00:05:48.940> tablet<00:05:49.300> that<00:05:49.419> run

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
versions of the surface tablet that run

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.090 
versions of the surface tablet that run
two<00:05:49.900> different<00:05:50.320> versions<00:05:50.470> of<00:05:50.860> Windows

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
two different versions of Windows

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.230 
two different versions of Windows
Windows<00:05:51.940> RT<00:05:52.360> is<00:05:53.320> not<00:05:53.919> a<00:05:53.950> botched<00:05:54.220> retweet<00:05:54.729> it

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
Windows RT is not a botched retweet it

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.540 
Windows RT is not a botched retweet it
is<00:05:55.540> the<00:05:56.020> version<00:05:56.290> that<00:05:56.500> is<00:05:56.950> more<00:05:57.160> like<00:05:57.370> the

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
is the version that is more like the

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.430 
is the version that is more like the
Metro<00:05:58.090> interface<00:05:58.390> that<00:05:58.960> you've<00:05:59.080> been<00:05:59.200> hearing

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
Metro interface that you've been hearing

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.710 
Metro interface that you've been hearing
so<00:05:59.590> much<00:05:59.710> about<00:05:59.770> that's<00:06:00.190> these<00:06:00.400> tiles<00:06:00.970> it<00:06:01.360> will

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
so much about that's these tiles it will

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.620 
so much about that's these tiles it will
only<00:06:01.990> run<00:06:02.470> apps<00:06:03.100> from<00:06:03.760> the<00:06:03.970> Microsoft<00:06:04.419> app

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
only run apps from the Microsoft app

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.380 
only run apps from the Microsoft app
store<00:06:04.960> so<00:06:05.229> this<00:06:05.380> is<00:06:05.590> totally<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.940> mobile

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
store so this is totally the mobile

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.730 
store so this is totally the mobile
version<00:06:07.720> of<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:07.840> operating<00:06:08.169> system<00:06:08.350> it

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
version of the operating system it

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.590 
version of the operating system it
doesn't<00:06:08.950> interoperate<00:06:09.760> with<00:06:09.790> regular<00:06:10.419> old

it just confuses things even more at a
time<00:06:31.960> when<00:06:32.350> honestly<00:06:32.800> you<00:06:32.919> just<00:06:33.130> want<00:06:33.280> to<00:06:33.340> say

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
time when honestly you just want to say

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.960

like<00:06:33.490> kind<00:06:34.270> of<00:06:34.360> like<00:06:34.480> the<00:06:34.630> iPad<00:06:34.960> but<00:06:35.260> Windows<00:06:35.590> I

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
like kind of like the iPad but Windows I

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.310 
like kind of like the iPad but Windows I
think<00:06:36.970> it's<00:06:37.090> a<00:06:37.150> perfectly<00:06:37.570> nice<00:06:37.720> tablet<00:06:38.020> I'm

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
think it's a perfectly nice tablet I'm

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.080 
think it's a perfectly nice tablet I'm
looking<00:06:38.620> forward<00:06:38.889> to<00:06:38.919> using<00:06:39.160> it<00:06:39.430> I'm<00:06:39.940> looking

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
looking forward to using it I'm looking

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.659 
looking forward to using it I'm looking
forward<00:06:40.600> to<00:06:40.720> seeing<00:06:40.930> if<00:06:41.110> Steven<00:06:41.919> Sinofsky<00:06:42.130> was

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
forward to seeing if Steven Sinofsky was

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.450 
forward to seeing if Steven Sinofsky was
right<00:06:42.850> about<00:06:43.090> how<00:06:43.240> tough<00:06:43.300> it<00:06:43.600> is<00:06:44.040> but<00:06:45.040> I<00:06:45.070> can't

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
right about how tough it is but I can't

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.370 
right about how tough it is but I can't
lie<00:06:45.729> despite<00:06:46.180> the<00:06:46.330> line<00:06:46.540> at<00:06:46.720> the<00:06:46.810> pop-up<00:06:47.169> store

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
lie despite the line at the pop-up store

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.710 
lie despite the line at the pop-up store
today<00:06:47.560> I<00:06:47.680> think<00:06:47.979> Microsoft<00:06:48.250> has<00:06:48.729> a<00:06:49.060> tough<00:06:49.479> road

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
today I think Microsoft has a tough road

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.870 
today I think Microsoft has a tough road
ahead
