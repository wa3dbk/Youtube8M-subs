dragging them across from one window to
another<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.400> makes<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.790> much<00:02:38.910> easier<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.090 
and you can see onto the desktop and if
I<00:02:57.930> move<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.140> away<00:02:58.350> I'll<00:02:58.710> get<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
I move that away I'll get the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.170 
I move that away I'll get the
applications<00:02:59.610> back<00:02:59.820> again<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.700> hopefully<00:03:03.090> you

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
applications back again so hopefully you

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.400 
applications back again so hopefully you
like<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.450> enhancements<00:03:03.960> are<00:03:04.080> major<00:03:04.230> than

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
like the enhancements are major than

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.410 
like the enhancements are major than
your<00:03:04.500> taskbar<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.640> managing<00:03:06.000> windows<00:03:06.270> on

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
your taskbar and to managing windows on

your taskbar and to managing windows on
the<00:03:06.450> desktop<00:03:06.750> now<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.620> next<00:03:07.710> I<00:03:07.920> want<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.130> talk

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
the desktop now the next I want to talk

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.240 
the desktop now the next I want to talk
about<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.730> working<00:03:09.300> with<00:03:09.390> libraries<00:03:10.250> now

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
about is working with libraries now

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.040 
about is working with libraries now
libraries<00:03:11.670> provide<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:12.030> way<00:03:12.210> of<00:03:12.330> aggregating

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
libraries provide a way of aggregating

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.170 
libraries provide a way of aggregating
folders<00:03:13.830> from<00:03:13.980> multiple<00:03:14.370> locations<00:03:14.430> under

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
folders from multiple locations under

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.570 
folders from multiple locations under
one<00:03:15.750> category<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.830> example<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.310> might<00:03:17.400> have

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
one category so example you might have

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.950 
one category so example you might have
some<00:03:17.790> work<00:03:18.000> documents<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.690> training

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
some work documents and training

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.050 
some work documents and training
documents<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.560> personal<00:03:19.680> documents<00:03:20.070> then

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
documents and personal documents then

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.130 
documents and personal documents then
you<00:03:21.150> want<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.360> be<00:03:21.420> able<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.600> aggregate<00:03:21.690> those

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
you want to be able to aggregate those

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.730 
you want to be able to aggregate those
under<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:23.070> category<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.790> documents<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.620> can

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
under a category of documents so you can

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.320 
under a category of documents so you can
see<00:03:25.890> here<00:03:26.070> with<00:03:26.190> my<00:03:26.310> documents<00:03:26.820> library<00:03:26.970> I've

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
see here with my documents library I've

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.680 
see here with my documents library I've
got<00:03:27.810> directories<00:03:28.350> from<00:03:28.920> multiple<00:03:29.370> locations

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
got directories from multiple locations

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.750 
got directories from multiple locations
on<00:03:30.690> my<00:03:30.840> computer<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:32.280> advantage<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.640> this

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
on my computer the advantage of this

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.220 
on my computer the advantage of this
means<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.240> have<00:03:33.270> a<00:03:33.450> kind<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.720> an<00:03:33.810> aggregate

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
means that I have a kind of an aggregate

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.520 
means that I have a kind of an aggregate
view<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.770> all<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.340> files<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.180> directories

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
view of all the files and directories

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.070 
view of all the files and directories
inside<00:03:37.530> by<00:03:37.680> library<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.480> can<00:03:39.480> also<00:03:39.690> arrange

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
inside by library I can also arrange

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.140 
inside by library I can also arrange
them<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.740> arrange<00:03:41.010> them<00:03:41.280> by<00:03:41.310> type<00:03:41.760> or<00:03:42.000> by

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
them so I can arrange them by type or by

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.240 
them so I can arrange them by type or by
name<00:03:42.390> or<00:03:42.420> or<00:03:42.900> whatever<00:03:43.470> one<00:03:43.620> again<00:03:43.860> whatever

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
name or or whatever one again whatever

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.790 
name or or whatever one again whatever
the<00:03:44.370> best<00:03:44.640> suited<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.180> can<00:03:45.690> also<00:03:45.960> search<00:03:46.440> across

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
the best suited I can also search across

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.250 
the best suited I can also search across
all<00:03:47.160> those<00:03:47.520> directories<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.690> document

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
all those directories and that document

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.350 
all those directories and that document
library<00:03:49.620> for<00:03:50.220> example<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:50.640> can<00:03:50.880> go<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.150> search

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
library for example I can go and search

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.260 
library for example I can go and search
for<00:03:51.390> windows<00:03:51.840> 7<00:03:52.190> it's<00:03:53.190> also<00:03:53.430> very<00:03:53.670> easy<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.120> add

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
for windows 7 it's also very easy to add

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.660 
for windows 7 it's also very easy to add
existing<00:03:54.450> folders<00:03:55.260> into<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.620> library<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.550> for

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
existing folders into a library so for

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.700 
existing folders into a library so for
example<00:03:56.700> if<00:03:57.270> I<00:03:57.390> came<00:03:57.540> over<00:03:57.630> here<00:03:57.780> into<00:03:58.380> my<00:03:58.500> data

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
example if I came over here into my data

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.670 
example if I came over here into my data
directory<00:03:59.220> and<00:04:00.110> I've<00:04:01.110> got<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.230> directory<00:04:01.560> here

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
directory and I've got a directory here

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.220 
directory and I've got a directory here
called<00:04:01.890> legacy<00:04:02.310> up<00:04:02.730> here<00:04:03.360> at<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.480> top<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:04.110> the
