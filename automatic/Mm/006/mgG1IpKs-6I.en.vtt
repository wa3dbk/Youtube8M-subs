 Pokemon download a mobile android 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.230
 remembering that I'm recording with my 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.690
 digital camera and I do not know if this will 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.030
 get very good because i know there android 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.410
 digital camera did not cost subject 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.710

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.710

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.290
 white box 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.150
 well I 'm not going to really let down the game 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.239
 the emulator will be in the description of the 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.850
 video paste is quite easy to download and 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.480
 install a good problem 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:09.180
 here I am going to give what I already have 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:13.530
 account explaining the game very good 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.990
 the android and with that player would give to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.080
 play pokémon xy i tried just not 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.689
 worked here you have several options 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 because mine I have at the port on 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.450
 but it did not work because it's 3ds 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.340

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:40.110

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.210
 I'm trying to cac alfred that I do not 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.149

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.130
 the ace still asks me to cut the package 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:02.369
