 with this a very divintà wine annoys wilde 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.680
 how can we see the same menu status start deleted by clicking

 screen was closed opens 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.390
 i - TV programs - settings made with what to see here we have the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.320
 settings 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.610
 those that. nava love to set page start settings in this case there 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.840
 let's see directly 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.359
 in this new start menu

 whore my night of love I'll make you a vowel 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.739
 all the commonly used software installed in the child's garments 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.169
 we can try again in this with wind roma s. 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.889
 matters of taste personally the honeycomb filmstrip with such icons 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.879
 I don't like sweeps much I preferred much more 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.850
 of the sec. a possibility of having four columns as in this case but 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.739
 with the coordinates 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.069
 eh eh eh 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.289
 one could easily adopt it by installing part of twitter on windows 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:54.580
 mobail itself. 1 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.139
 in that case indeed 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.879
 the icons that were always divided into four crowns then the page 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.620
 much more exploitable without boundaries ragged 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.939
 However 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.469
 the fact that they are. misaligned then the fact that for example today 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.469
 gps system connection management settings 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:20.439
 daikin stations find us the agility connection manager primante 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.049
 before the tv games 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.260
 the fact that they actually use 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.079
 this this style of 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:35.749
 of assurances are the fact that they are not in alphabetical order 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.489
 peel for people who are used to finding thickened 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.340
 eheim in the various folders organized and present in alphabetical order 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.630
 it is an inconvenient little thing and obviously there is only one mere question 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.009
 trash 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:53.489
 personally I just preferred the misguided change nothing to say in 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.929
 terminal is good 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:04:00.859
 emmelle pecchè as regards the multimedia sector, there are some 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.369
 they will live life during this there was not a think that can 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:12.409
 improve from the point of view of photographic capacity or to create 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.219
 video 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.180
 determining the terminal has always had a big flaw in making videos 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.519
 which are bolton spouses poorly defined 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.530
 however, the one hoped for the new htc terminals is going to be a 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.030
 compartment of the new cameras much better from this point of view 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.430
 for the rest there are no night &amp; lt demerit particular celnano news 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.169
 in this case in manila - in the last version I have in mind I tell you to do 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.439
 we can see it is a new version of the phoenix 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.870
 for the rest, to finish, I judge him very good with this woman's name 

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:51.939
 complete the iron 100 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:56.689
 and to everything necessary for a user better than windows mobail a 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.740
 handy 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.759
 usual compatibility in our vast majority of cases 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:11.229
 and with applications for us also windows mobail s i. 1 we can tell you 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.240
 very often 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.240
 install on six. 5 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.240
 and should still work properly 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.370
 for the rest, he has a practical test 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.909
 with 3-year extraction 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.279
