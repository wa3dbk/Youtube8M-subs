Shh<00:01:46.090> Riley<00:01:46.690> I<00:01:46.930> think<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.820> dinosaur<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.510> back

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
Shh Riley I think this dinosaur is back

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.620 
Shh Riley I think this dinosaur is back
because<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.410> wants<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:50.740> tell<00:01:50.890> us<00:01:50.950> something<00:01:51.630> 10

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
because it wants to tell us something 10

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.040 
because it wants to tell us something 10
obviously<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.500> think<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.490> dinosaur<00:01:55.150> is

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
trying to find us because he's been here

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.080 
trying to find us because he's been here
now<00:01:58.660> twice<00:01:58.720> as<00:01:59.410> Annie<00:01:59.620> this<00:01:59.800> dinosaur<00:02:00.340> last

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
now twice as Annie this dinosaur last

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.260 
now twice as Annie this dinosaur last
time<00:02:01.510> when<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.900> dinosaurs<00:02:02.530> here<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:04.030> found

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
time when the dinosaurs here we found

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.120 
time when the dinosaurs here we found
bones<00:02:04.510> and<00:02:04.810> footprints<00:02:05.170> didn't<00:02:05.560> we<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:05.860> now

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
bones and footprints didn't we and now

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.890 
bones and footprints didn't we and now
the<00:02:06.190> dinosaurs<00:02:06.820> back<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.390> he's<00:02:07.480> done<00:02:07.630> another

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
poo in our playground I think that

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.410 
poo in our playground I think that
