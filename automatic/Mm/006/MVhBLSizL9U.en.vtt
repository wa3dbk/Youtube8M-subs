00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.940 
couldn't quite do it yeah obviously we
knew<00:02:07.729> what<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.000> expect<00:02:08.259> with<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.560> berries

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
knew what to expect with the berries

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.570 
knew what to expect with the berries
about<00:02:10.130> or<00:02:10.280> watch<00:02:10.399> them<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.850> what<00:02:11.450> direct<00:02:11.810> and

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
about or watch them and what direct and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.210 
about or watch them and what direct and
defend<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.910> first<00:02:14.209> mean<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.660> was

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
defend like that first mean it was

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.890 
defend like that first mean it was
disappointing<00:02:16.239> obviously<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.270> game<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.780> give

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
disappointing obviously a game to give

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.010 
disappointing obviously a game to give
to<00:02:18.110> two<00:02:18.440> penalties<00:02:18.860> against<00:02:19.160> those<00:02:19.250> handles

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
to two penalties against those handles

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.510 
to two penalties against those handles
they<00:02:21.020> were<00:02:21.110> both<00:02:21.290> not<00:02:21.620> Stonewall<00:02:22.130> ones<00:02:22.340> they

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
they were both not Stonewall ones they

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.670 
they were both not Stonewall ones they
were<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.880> know<00:02:23.000> could<00:02:23.600> be<00:02:23.690> disputed<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.410> then

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
were you know could be disputed and then

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.590 
were you know could be disputed and then
i<00:02:24.920> suppose<00:02:25.220> i<00:02:25.430> want<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.970> say<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.239> same<00:02:26.420> without

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
i suppose i want to say the same without

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.660 
i suppose i want to say the same without
as<00:02:26.870> well<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.290> look<00:02:27.920> was<00:02:28.130> really<00:02:28.340> happy<00:02:28.580> with

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
as well so look was really happy with

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.060 
as well so look was really happy with
the<00:02:28.760> way<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:28.910> pushed<00:02:29.300> on<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.830> thought<00:02:30.830> as<00:02:31.010> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
the way we pushed on I thought as the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.010 
the way we pushed on I thought as the
game<00:02:31.220> went<00:02:31.430> on<00:02:31.610> we<00:02:31.790> were<00:02:31.970> like<00:02:32.180> we'd<00:02:32.750> get<00:02:32.930> an

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
game went on we were like we'd get an

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.440 
game went on we were like we'd get an
equalizer<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.910> think<00:02:34.910> we<00:02:34.970> probably<00:02:35.120> would<00:02:35.390> have

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
equalizer I think we probably would have

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.340 
equalizer I think we probably would have
been<00:02:35.630> in<00:02:36.110> deserved<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.739> end<00:02:36.890> but<00:02:38.350> early

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
been in deserved in the end but early

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.449 
been in deserved in the end but early
thaw<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.560> your<00:02:39.769> first<00:02:39.980> time<00:02:40.130> game<00:02:40.370> you

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
thaw is your first time game you

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.470 
thaw is your first time game you
obviously<00:02:40.730> want<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.880> start<00:02:41.090> with<00:02:41.120> positive

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
obviously want to start with positive

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.850 
obviously want to start with positive
result<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.930> we<00:02:42.380> didn't<00:02:42.560> get<00:02:42.650> one<00:02:42.799> so

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860
