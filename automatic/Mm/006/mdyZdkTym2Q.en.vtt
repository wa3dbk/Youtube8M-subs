00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.770 
condensed soup is that you can control
how<00:02:45.320> much<00:02:45.380> liquid<00:02:45.880> because<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.360> don't<00:02:47.570> want

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
how much liquid because you don't want

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.410 
how much liquid because you don't want

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
this absolutely swimming in liquid but

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.480 
this absolutely swimming in liquid but
will<00:02:50.900> need<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> little<00:02:51.350> bit<00:02:51.530> more<00:02:51.770> than<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.160> so

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
will need a little bit more than this so

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.820 
will need a little bit more than this so
just<00:02:52.910> very<00:02:53.150> gently<00:02:53.810> stirring<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.470> together

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
just very gently stirring it together

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.220 
just very gently stirring it together
because<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.820> don't<00:02:56.030> want<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.270> break<00:02:56.510> up<00:02:56.750> and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
because you don't want it break up and

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.280 
because you don't want it break up and
completely<00:02:57.950> obliterate<00:02:58.550> all<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.210> the<00:02:59.450> all<00:03:00.230> of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
completely obliterate all of the all of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.600 
completely obliterate all of the all of
the<00:03:00.560> tuna<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:03.650> I'm<00:03:03.740> just<00:03:03.890> going<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.160> add<00:03:04.310> a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
the tuna and so I'm just going to add a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.170 
the tuna and so I'm just going to add a
little<00:03:04.850> bit<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.090> water<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.810> pan<00:03:06.910> just<00:03:07.910> a

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
little bit of water to the pan just a

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.570 
little bit of water to the pan just a
little<00:03:08.540> that's<00:03:08.720> probably<00:03:09.170> about<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.800> quarter

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
little that's probably about a quarter

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.970 
little that's probably about a quarter
fill<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.420> they'll<00:03:11.630> just<00:03:11.660> give<00:03:12.020> it<00:03:12.170> hopefully

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
fill and they'll just give it hopefully

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.000 
fill and they'll just give it hopefully
without<00:03:13.900> spilling<00:03:14.900> too<00:03:15.260> much<00:03:15.470> just<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.770> little

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
without spilling too much just a little

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.510 
without spilling too much just a little
swirl<00:03:16.250> around<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.660> tin<00:03:18.100> just<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.250> sort<00:03:19.490> of

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
swirl around the the tin just to sort of

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.160 
swirl around the the tin just to sort of
clean<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.060> inside<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.690> tin

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
clean the inside of the tin

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.480 
clean the inside of the tin
we'll<00:03:21.380> add<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.709> in<00:03:21.950> as<00:03:22.160> well<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:24.250> then<00:03:25.250> just

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
we'll add that in as well and then just

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.110
