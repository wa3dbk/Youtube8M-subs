been fixed and no corrosion is a really

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.210 
been fixed and no corrosion is a really
big<00:05:15.660> bonus<00:05:16.140> so<00:05:17.270> real<00:05:18.270> world<00:05:18.600> another<00:05:19.440> back<00:05:20.070> to

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
big bonus so real world another back to

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.680 
big bonus so real world another back to
the<00:05:20.370> coal<00:05:20.850> mill<00:05:21.030> kind<00:05:21.270> of<00:05:21.330> jumping<00:05:21.600> around

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
the coal mill kind of jumping around

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.900 
the coal mill kind of jumping around
here<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.740> climb<00:05:23.010> performance<00:05:23.220> with<00:05:23.730> two

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
here the climb performance with two

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.320 
here the climb performance with two
engines<00:05:24.330> is<00:05:24.690> phenomenal<00:05:25.590> I<00:05:26.130> usually<00:05:27.060> figure

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
engines is phenomenal I usually figure

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.900 
engines is phenomenal I usually figure
if<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:27.930> need<00:05:28.170> to<00:05:28.380> it'll<00:05:28.620> do<00:05:28.740> 2500<00:05:29.550> foot<00:05:29.730> per

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
if I need to it'll do 2500 foot per

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.110 
if I need to it'll do 2500 foot per
minute<00:05:29.940> if<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:30.990> put<00:05:31.260> it<00:05:31.350> right<00:05:31.530> on<00:05:31.940> st.<00:05:32.940> are

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
minute if you put it right on st. are

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.960 
minute if you put it right on st. are
both<00:05:34.020> engine<00:05:34.410> best<00:05:34.620> rate<00:05:34.830> of<00:05:34.950> climb<00:05:35.190> that's<00:05:35.880> a

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
both engine best rate of climb that's a

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.520 
both engine best rate of climb that's a
little<00:05:36.150> impractical<00:05:36.510> at<00:05:37.020> a<00:05:37.050> hundred<00:05:37.230> knots

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
little impractical at a hundred knots

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.840 
little impractical at a hundred knots
you're<00:05:37.800> pretty<00:05:38.130> much<00:05:38.280> pointing<00:05:38.610> straight<00:05:38.730> up

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
you're pretty much pointing straight up

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.000 
you're pretty much pointing straight up
in<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.150> sky<00:05:39.390> I<00:05:39.660> usually<00:05:40.410> climb<00:05:40.590> out<00:05:40.800> at<00:05:40.950> about

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
in the sky I usually climb out at about

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.030 
in the sky I usually climb out at about
135<00:05:41.820> knots<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:42.720> that'll<00:05:42.990> yield<00:05:43.200> 2,000<00:05:43.860> foot

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
135 knots and that'll yield 2,000 foot

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.720 
135 knots and that'll yield 2,000 foot
at<00:05:44.160> sea<00:05:44.340> level<00:05:45.350> 1500<00:05:46.350> foot<00:05:46.590> up<00:05:46.770> at<00:05:46.920> 5,000<00:05:47.610> and

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
at sea level 1500 foot up at 5,000 and

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.160 
at sea level 1500 foot up at 5,000 and
still<00:05:47.910> well<00:05:48.090> over<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.390> thousand<00:05:48.840> foot<00:05:48.960> per

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.170 
still well over a thousand foot per

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.210 
still well over a thousand foot per
minute<00:05:49.200> at<00:05:49.560> 10,000<00:05:50.190> feet<00:05:50.220> so<00:05:50.870> just<00:05:51.870> a<00:05:51.960> great

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
minute at 10,000 feet so just a great

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.730 
minute at 10,000 feet so just a great
great<00:05:53.220> performing<00:05:53.730> aircraft<00:05:54.500> really<00:05:55.500> a<00:05:55.530> nice

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
great performing aircraft really a nice

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.360 
great performing aircraft really a nice
airplane<00:05:56.510> so<00:05:57.510> let's<00:05:58.140> go<00:05:58.320> fly<00:05:58.800> it<00:05:58.860> a<00:05:59.010> little<00:05:59.220> bit

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
airplane so let's go fly it a little bit

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.860 
airplane so let's go fly it a little bit
and<00:05:59.550> see<00:06:00.510> how<00:06:00.660> she<00:06:00.720> flies<00:06:01.260> well<00:06:01.650> mount<00:06:01.920> the

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
and see how she flies well mount the

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.630 
and see how she flies well mount the
headset<00:06:03.870> camera<00:06:04.200> up<00:06:04.350> and<00:06:04.560> we'll<00:06:05.250> see<00:06:05.430> how<00:06:05.520> it

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
headset camera up and we'll see how it

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.790 
headset camera up and we'll see how it
does
