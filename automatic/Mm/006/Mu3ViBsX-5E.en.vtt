00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.980
 description of the video I say 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.090
 now the description needs to be 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.549
 listened to our requests and point 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.769
 comments that's boring so there 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.230

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.530
 2004 in the modes you double click 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.530
 above 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.840
 it opens so you need a rare or 7 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.660
 to think about it as you wish 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.650
 a dat file have two principles you the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.650
 slide on your desktop

 his charge then said so if we close so 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.799
 that we will not need any more then 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:11.840
 date as two points vip louvre we go 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:14.810
 in menu and there is background so the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.480
 first if we slide on the desktop 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.549
 so it's back ground zero a che 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.079
 really strong then we removed 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.090
 down the window next here so this 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.790
 who will have to do already so the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.650
 Landais ds hit in png so

 you if you can not you change the 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.819
 format of finally the format of 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.920
 file one have to go on the internet and he 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.540
 there will be tutorials so you have to put it in 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.670
 png otherwise them 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.980
 paint.net will not open it so the army 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.239
 yes so you looked on the internet ago 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.350

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.670

 you have your photo side I hope 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.000
 that it will be big enough I hope 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.140
 they are not too small 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.329
 so here are otherwise dsi ne 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.950

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.540
 do not open it so hop you do a 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.480
 added a layer alleles m p tit 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:18.100
 I hope it does not screw her up 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.829
 in short you align you enlarge it 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.570
 is going to be a little disgusting 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.430
 that's excuse me I 'm trying to reject them 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.289
 will put it right correctly it's just 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.900
 to show how closely I 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.630
 would do it properly it's normal I 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.570
 would find it mean to re-record it 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.240
 so hop you save you wait 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.710
 and there you do right-click 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.460
 renamed wanting to go into ds the ds 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.660
 excuse me I find in the microphone 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.729
 because I like my usual microphone 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.139
 it is true that it is difficult 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.690
 then the little one the folder of the 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.780
 thesis as well as you have 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:59.159
 reduced you reopen and baghran 01 you 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.229
 slide in and you do yes 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.520
 so you replace it to check 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.020
 you slide back on your desktop 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.909
 you put up and if it's the same 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.580
 who appears I 'll get there I missed 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:12.400
 find that my microphone is even after 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.169
 everything is good so here I see it 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.330
 delete after and so they are 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.039
 locked 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.560
 so here is the data and ce2 and 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.919
 then we will go in so in this 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.090
 in your pc here is in our where 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.409
 is that you have installed two years 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.000
 so do I put them in the 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.449
 second ticket of the chorus that it is in 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.599
 2015 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.490
 and there you will have a file so 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.310
 I had already replaced the coup 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.039
 but normally it's called data s2 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.320
 point g ar so there you take it you 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.090
 the direct delete you thought not 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.400
 you do not think you will follow him 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.210
 is then you take the attacked 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.759
 on your blog 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.070
