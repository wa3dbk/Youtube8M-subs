00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
so he's got a little bit of that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.139 
so he's got a little bit of that
pressure<00:01:49.829> still<00:01:50.159> want<00:01:50.369> him<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.700> agree<00:01:50.970> what

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
pressure still want him and I agree what

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.700 
pressure still want him and I agree what
you<00:01:51.299> want<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> say<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.200> once<00:01:52.380> he<00:01:52.470> dropped

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you want to say that once he dropped

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380 
you want to say that once he dropped
about<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.070> pressure<00:01:53.310> sort<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.640> dropped<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
about that pressure sort of dropped and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.999 
about that pressure sort of dropped and
I<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> good<00:01:55.140> thing<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.950> him

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
I think that was a good thing for him

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.280 
I think that was a good thing for him
that<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.579> he<00:01:57.119> got<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.420> experience<00:01:57.570> now

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that you know he got that experience now

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.830 
that you know he got that experience now
now<00:01:59.189> he<00:01:59.250> could<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.640> basically<00:01:59.969> run<00:02:00.299> wreak

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
now he could just basically run wreak

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.969 
now he could just basically run wreak
havoc<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.350> he<00:02:01.469> doesn't<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
havoc and he doesn't have to have a

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.789 
havoc and he doesn't have to have a
title<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.750> i<00:02:06.960> can't<00:02:07.229> call<00:02:07.380> Sheamus

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
title to do so so i can't call Sheamus
