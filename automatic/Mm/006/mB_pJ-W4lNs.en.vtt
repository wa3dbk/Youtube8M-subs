a<00:04:19.950> song<00:04:20.990> changing<00:04:21.990> up<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.290> word<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.190> it's

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
a song changing up the word so it it's

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.260 
a song changing up the word so it it's
super<00:04:24.570> like<00:04:24.780> runescape<00:04:25.140> ish<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:27.090> don't

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
super like runescape ish and I don't

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.490 
super like runescape ish and I don't
know<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.420> think<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:27.900> just<00:04:27.930> gonna<00:04:28.110> be<00:04:28.230> funny

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
know I think it's just gonna be funny

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.380 
know I think it's just gonna be funny
and<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:29.070> think<00:04:29.130> it's<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.490> great<00:04:29.520> way<00:04:30.000> for<00:04:30.060> us<00:04:30.300> to

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
and I think it's a great way for us to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.570 
and I think it's a great way for us to
get<00:04:30.570> some<00:04:30.750> publicity<00:04:30.920> is<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.370> do

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
get some publicity is to just do

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.250 
get some publicity is to just do
something<00:04:32.850> different<00:04:33.330> with<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.750> game<00:04:33.930> you

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
something different with the game you

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.110 
something different with the game you
know<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:35.610> think<00:04:35.790> it's<00:04:35.910> going<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.060> be

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
know and I think it's going to be

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.110
