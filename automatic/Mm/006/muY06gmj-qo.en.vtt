you're<00:00:08.790> familiar<00:00:08.910> with<00:00:09.240> loop<00:00:09.750> scratching<00:00:10.290> it

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
you're familiar with loop scratching it

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.339 
you're familiar with loop scratching it
was<00:00:10.800> popularized<00:00:11.309> by<00:00:11.840> James<00:00:12.840> Abella

was popularized by James Abella
and<00:00:13.559> he<00:00:14.040> would<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.490> on<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.089> CDJ<00:00:15.599> 1000s<00:00:16.470> with

and he would do it on the CDJ 1000s with

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.859 
and he would do it on the CDJ 1000s with
the<00:00:16.710> FX<00:00:17.100> what<00:00:17.340> does<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.820> eventually<00:00:18.720> he

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the FX what does and eventually he

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.529

the FX 1000 to add effects to his loop
scratching<00:00:28.590> well<00:00:29.460> basically<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
scratching well basically I'm going to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.089 
scratching well basically I'm going to
show<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> do<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> loop<00:00:31.560> scratching

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
show you how to do the loop scratching

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.910 
show you how to do the loop scratching
with<00:00:32.340> some<00:00:32.700> limited<00:00:33.090> effects<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.260> XD<00:00:34.530> jrx

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
with some limited effects on the XD jrx

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.970 
with some limited effects on the XD jrx
so<00:00:35.760> first<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.450> need<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.649> scratch

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
so first what you need is a scratch

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.520 
so first what you need is a scratch
sample<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:39.149> scratch<00:00:39.420> sample<00:00:39.899> you'll<00:00:40.020> need<00:00:40.200> is

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
sample the scratch sample you'll need is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.760 
sample the scratch sample you'll need is
basically<00:00:41.399> anything<00:00:41.910> though<00:00:42.379> it's<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.590> little

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
basically anything though it's a little

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.580 
basically anything though it's a little
bit<00:00:43.890> along<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.870> what<00:00:45.870> I'm<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> use<00:00:46.350> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
bit along on what I'm going to use is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.860 
bit along on what I'm going to use is
that<00:00:46.770> scratch<00:00:47.160> sample<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.640> goes<00:00:47.820> sure<00:00:48.629> wah

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that scratch sample that goes sure wah

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.529 
that scratch sample that goes sure wah
and<00:00:49.140> I'm<00:00:49.829> sure<00:00:50.160> you've<00:00:50.399> heard<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.910> used<00:00:51.300> by

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
and I'm sure you've heard it used by

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.200 
and I'm sure you've heard it used by
many<00:00:51.780> scratch<00:00:52.410> DJ's<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.120> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
many scratch DJ's so this is what it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:04.310 
many scratch DJ's so this is what it
sounds<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:57.920> stick<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.010> out<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.219> loop<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.600> once

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
sounds like stick it out of loop so once

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320 
sounds like stick it out of loop so once
you<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.710> sample<00:01:04.949> load<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.150> any

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you have that sample load it to any

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.859 
you have that sample load it to any
whatever<00:01:07.020> deck<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.409> own<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> XD<00:01:08.220> jrx<00:01:08.869> once

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
whatever deck you own on the XD jrx once

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.620 
whatever deck you own on the XD jrx once
you<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> loaded<00:01:11.150> you're<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.360> press

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you have it loaded you're going to press

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719 
you have it loaded you're going to press
loop<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> beginning<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.549> sample

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
loop in at the beginning of the sample

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.450 
loop in at the beginning of the sample
and<00:01:15.500> towards<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> end<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> sample<00:01:17.130> you're

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and towards the end of the sample you're

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.149 
and towards the end of the sample you're
going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> press<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> loop<00:01:18.030> out<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.979> makes

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
going to press the loop out so it makes

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.530 
going to press the loop out so it makes
that<00:01:20.369> sound<00:01:21.590> now<00:01:22.590> go<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.759> transform

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that sound now go to your transform

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.859 
that sound now go to your transform
effect<00:01:25.250> set<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.939> whatever<00:01:27.270> deck<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
effect set it to whatever deck the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.830 
effect set it to whatever deck the
scratch<00:01:28.080> samples<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:29.240> make<00:01:30.240> sure<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> level

scratch samples on make sure the level

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.410 
scratch samples on make sure the level
depth<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:33.049> 3<00:01:34.049> o'clock<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:35.299> what<00:01:36.299> you're

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
playing on the other deck if you look at

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.710 
playing on the other deck if you look at
the<00:01:41.430> BPM<00:01:41.899> make<00:01:42.899> sure<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:44.479> what<00:01:45.479> you're<00:01:45.570> going

to want to do is keep that in mind

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.020 
to want to do is keep that in mind
because<00:01:48.049> once<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.200> playing

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.539
