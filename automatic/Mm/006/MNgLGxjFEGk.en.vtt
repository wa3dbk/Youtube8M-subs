00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.570 
i want to show you this actual
old-school<00:00:06.000> redstone<00:00:06.810> ore<00:00:07.080> yeah<00:00:08.010> Universal

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
old-school redstone ore yeah Universal

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.080 
old-school redstone ore yeah Universal
Dethklok<00:00:09.030> um<00:00:10.010> so<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.280> put<00:00:11.550> out<00:00:11.670> one<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:11.940> these

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
Dethklok um so I put out one of these

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.539 
Dethklok um so I put out one of these
earlier<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.320> called<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.769> an<00:00:13.860> old<00:00:14.070> school<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
earlier and called it an old school and

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.790 
earlier and called it an old school and
but<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.790> reality<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.299> was<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.450> pre<00:00:15.870> 1.5

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
but in reality it was a pre 1.5

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800 
but in reality it was a pre 1.5
Universal<00:00:17.789> Dethklok<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.390> that's<00:00:18.510> because<00:00:18.630> it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
Universal Dethklok and that's because it

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.460 
Universal Dethklok and that's because it
used<00:00:18.960> pistons<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.750> yeah<00:00:21.750> pretty<00:00:22.080> much<00:00:22.170> use

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
used pistons and yeah pretty much use

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.160 
used pistons and yeah pretty much use
pistons<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.250> one<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.670> made<00:00:24.240> using<00:00:24.720> just

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
pistons so this one I made using just

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.740 
pistons so this one I made using just
torches<00:00:25.920> dust<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.760> blocks<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.359> then<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.480> put

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
torches dust and blocks and then I put

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.910 
torches dust and blocks and then I put
some<00:00:27.930> lamps<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.289> there<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.590> those<00:00:28.710> are<00:00:28.890> just

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
some lamps in there but those are just

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
some lamps in there but those are just
kind<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.750> for<00:00:30.750> display<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.669> for<00:00:32.669> display

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
kind of for display and for display

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
kind of for display and for display
purposes<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:36.270> way<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.750> thing<00:00:37.020> works<00:00:37.100> is

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
purposes so the way this thing works is

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.889 
purposes so the way this thing works is
we<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> three<00:00:38.670> second<00:00:39.000> redstone<00:00:39.690> torch

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
we have a three second redstone torch

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.470 
we have a three second redstone torch
clock<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.670> line<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.090> turns<00:00:42.360> on

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
clock here just this line here turns on

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.869 
clock here just this line here turns on
every<00:00:42.719> three<00:00:42.899> seconds<00:00:43.320> turns<00:00:43.920> off<00:00:44.100> switches

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
every three seconds turns off switches

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.310 
every three seconds turns off switches
between<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.420> off<00:00:45.600> every<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> half

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
between on and off every one and a half

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.520 
between on and off every one and a half
seconds<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> did<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.410> made

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
seconds and then what I did was I made

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.860 
seconds and then what I did was I made
some<00:00:49.920> kind<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.340> pulse<00:00:50.670> doublers<00:00:51.210> now

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
some kind of like pulse doublers now

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.660 
some kind of like pulse doublers now
I'll<00:00:52.079> demonstrate<00:00:52.230> one<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:53.160> units<00:00:53.520> on

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
I'll demonstrate one of these units on

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.420 
I'll demonstrate one of these units on
the<00:00:53.760> top<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.860> each<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.070> these<00:00:56.190> long

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the top here and each of these long

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.700 
the top here and each of these long
units<00:00:56.820> kind<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.090> has<00:00:57.210> two<00:00:57.480> parts<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.050> first

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
units kind of has two parts the first

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.750 
units kind of has two parts the first
part<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.520> a<00:01:00.500> pulse<00:01:01.500> maker<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.340> put<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
part is a pulse maker so if I put a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.450 
part is a pulse maker so if I put a
torch<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:04.519> there<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.049> turn<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.460> this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
torch here and there and turn on this

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.570 
torch here and there and turn on this
line<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.780> torch<00:01:10.140> will<00:01:10.320> turn<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.740> for

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
line here on this torch will turn on for

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820 
line here on this torch will turn on for
just<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.090> split<00:01:12.240> second<00:01:12.840> wash<00:01:13.170> watch<00:01:13.590> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
just a split second wash watch that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
just a split second wash watch that
torch<00:01:16.189> so<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.280> saw<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.270> torch

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
torch so you saw that there this torch

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.090 
torch so you saw that there this torch
just<00:01:18.720> turns<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> second<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:19.979> is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
just turns on for a second so this is

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.399 
just turns on for a second so this is
like<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> redstone<00:01:20.820> torch<00:01:21.060> pulse<00:01:21.570> maker<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
like a redstone torch pulse maker and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.780 
like a redstone torch pulse maker and
the<00:01:22.439> way<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.830> works<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.369> an<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.700> gate

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the way it works is we have an and gate

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.499 
the way it works is we have an and gate
and<00:01:24.439> then<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.650> line<00:01:25.920> immediately<00:01:26.520> goes<00:01:27.240> into

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and then this line immediately goes into

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.090 
and then this line immediately goes into
this<00:01:27.600> torch<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:27.990> turning<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.619> off<00:01:28.740> allowing

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
this torch here turning it off allowing

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.039 
this torch here turning it off allowing
this<00:01:29.310> torch<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> turn<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:30.689> after

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this torch to turn on but then after

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.399 
this torch to turn on but then after
delay<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:32.150> this<00:01:33.150> torch<00:01:33.509> will<00:01:33.689> turn<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
delay here this torch will turn on and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.319 
delay here this torch will turn on and
then<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.520> torch<00:01:35.909> will<00:01:36.060> turn<00:01:36.210> back

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
then you know that torch will turn back

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.649 
then you know that torch will turn back
off<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.009> then<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.250> thing<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
off and then this thing we have here is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.679 
off and then this thing we have here is
a<00:01:39.720> memory<00:01:40.710> lock<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.729> toggles<00:01:42.240> when<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.509> gets

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
a memory lock that toggles when it gets

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.260 
a memory lock that toggles when it gets
a<00:01:42.780> pulse<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.619> see<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.909> lamp<00:01:45.149> at

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
a pulse so you can see the the lamp at

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.380 
a pulse so you can see the the lamp at
their<00:01:45.360> zone<00:01:45.570> Oh<00:01:49.610> like<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.790> sorry<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> was

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
their zone Oh like that sorry I was

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.410 
their zone Oh like that sorry I was
rerouting<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.320> redstone<00:01:52.590> wire<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.420> if

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
rerouting this redstone wire here and if

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.420 
rerouting this redstone wire here and if
I<00:01:54.570> do<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:56.659> switches<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:59.310> can

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
I do this it switches and you can

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.090 
I do this it switches and you can
actually<00:01:59.579> see<00:01:59.759> there<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.390> end<00:02:01.100> lamp

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
actually see there that the end lamp

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.610 
actually see there that the end lamp
went<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.430> there

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
went on there

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.220 
went on there
so<00:02:04.550> yeah<00:02:04.850> then<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.210> just<00:02:05.450> because<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.900> know<00:02:05.990> oh

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
so yeah then I just because you know oh

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.690 
so yeah then I just because you know oh
I'll<00:02:06.710> just<00:02:06.920> put<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.130> ton<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.340> these<00:02:07.550> things

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
I'll just put a ton of these things

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.020 
I'll just put a ton of these things
together<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:08.630> did<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.500> math<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:10.030> the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
together so I did the math and the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.670 
together so I did the math and the
number<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.510> thing<00:02:11.690> these<00:02:12.140> things<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.620> need

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
number of thing these things that I need

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.040 
number of thing these things that I need
is<00:02:13.120> um<00:02:14.120> like<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.170> log<00:02:15.440> base<00:02:15.710> 2<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.750> 10<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:18.020> the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
is um like the log base 2 of 10 to the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.100 
is um like the log base 2 of 10 to the
100<00:02:18.710> divided<00:02:19.130> by<00:02:19.250> three<00:02:19.520> i<00:02:19.550> think<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.570> how<00:02:20.870> long

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
100 divided by three i think is how long

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.140 
100 divided by three i think is how long
it<00:02:22.480> there's<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.540> lot<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.810> them<00:02:24.080> here<00:02:24.940> actually<00:02:25.940> I

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
it there's a lot of them here actually I

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.560 
it there's a lot of them here actually I
think<00:02:26.210> it's<00:02:26.570> more<00:02:27.310> than<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:29.000> added

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
think it's more than that but I added

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.820 
think it's more than that but I added
some<00:02:29.600> extra<00:02:29.810> clocks<00:02:30.260> here<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.650> should

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
some extra clocks here so it should

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.590 
some extra clocks here so it should
still<00:02:31.070> be<00:02:31.130> good<00:02:31.250> but<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.270> point<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.510> this

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
still be good but the point of this

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.210 
still be good but the point of this
thing<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.020> should<00:02:33.290> take<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.500> google<00:02:33.950> years

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
thing is that should take a google years

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.450 
thing is that should take a google years
for<00:02:34.460> this<00:02:34.550> thing<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.940> finish<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:36.560> with<00:02:37.280> my

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
for this thing to finish and with my

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.610 
for this thing to finish and with my
math<00:02:37.670> i<00:02:37.820> figured<00:02:38.090> i<00:02:38.150> would<00:02:38.300> take<00:02:38.420> 330<00:02:38.990> one<00:02:39.500> of

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
math i figured i would take 330 one of

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.520 
math i figured i would take 330 one of
these<00:02:39.740> clocks<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.880> have<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.270> last<00:02:41.990> to<00:02:42.230> google

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
these clocks to have it last to google

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.270 
these clocks to have it last to google
seconds<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:44.600> this<00:02:45.140> particular<00:02:46.010> one<00:02:46.160> has

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
seconds and so this particular one has

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.360 
seconds and so this particular one has
340<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.330> these<00:02:47.450> little<00:02:47.600> pulse<00:02:47.900> doublers

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
340 of these little pulse doublers

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.590 
340 of these little pulse doublers
actually<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.430> should<00:02:49.940> check<00:02:50.120> because<00:02:50.240> I'm<00:02:50.420> not

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
actually I should check because I'm not

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.760 
actually I should check because I'm not
sure<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.990> thing's<00:02:51.200> actually<00:02:51.350> above<00:02:51.650> a

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
sure this thing's actually above a

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.740 
sure this thing's actually above a
google<00:02:52.040> years<00:02:52.250> now<00:02:52.460> but<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:53.390> get<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.600> idea

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
google years now but you get the idea

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.020 
google years now but you get the idea
it's<00:02:54.320> pretty<00:02:54.740> clear<00:02:54.830> this<00:02:55.160> wouldn't<00:02:55.550> say<00:02:55.850> no

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
it's pretty clear this wouldn't say no

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.300 
it's pretty clear this wouldn't say no
long<00:02:56.240> clock<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:57.710> know<00:02:57.770> if<00:02:57.830> we<00:02:57.920> watch<00:02:58.070> down

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
long clock so you know if we watch down

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.940 
long clock so you know if we watch down
here<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:59.180> lamp<00:02:59.450> tacos<00:03:00.110> every<00:03:00.350> three<00:03:00.590> seconds

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
here this lamp tacos every three seconds

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.570 
here this lamp tacos every three seconds
and<00:03:01.420> then<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.690> one<00:03:02.750> over<00:03:03.170> here<00:03:03.340> tacos<00:03:04.340> every

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
and then this one over here tacos every

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.220 
and then this one over here tacos every
six<00:03:04.880> seconds<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.570> then<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.750> know<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:05.990> on<00:03:06.110> and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
six seconds and then you know so on and

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.930 
six seconds and then you know so on and
so<00:03:06.290> forth<00:03:06.380> this<00:03:06.770> one<00:03:06.980> turns<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.490> off<00:03:07.580> every

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
so forth this one turns on and off every

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.990 
so forth this one turns on and off every
12<00:03:08.930> seconds<00:03:09.260> here<00:03:09.920> we<00:03:10.040> should<00:03:10.100> be<00:03:10.220> able<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.730> we

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
12 seconds here we should be able to we

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.949 
12 seconds here we should be able to we
should<00:03:11.180> be<00:03:11.270> able<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.480> catch<00:03:11.630> this<00:03:11.780> one

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
should be able to catch this one

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.600 
should be able to catch this one
switching<00:03:13.540> give<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.750> sec<00:03:15.190> there<00:03:16.190> we<00:03:16.220> go<00:03:16.400> and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
switching give it a sec there we go and

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.830 
switching give it a sec there we go and
then<00:03:16.730> yeah<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:17.030> see<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:17.239> powers<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.570> next

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
then yeah you see it powers the next

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.180 
then yeah you see it powers the next
lamp<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:18.320> on<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:18.620> forth<00:03:18.709> down<00:03:19.130> the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
lamp and so on and so forth down the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.750 
lamp and so on and so forth down the
line<00:03:20.110> yeah<00:03:21.110> that's<00:03:21.830> about<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.130> actually<00:03:22.580> so

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
line yeah that's about it actually so

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.150 
line yeah that's about it actually so
you<00:03:22.820> know<00:03:23.060> purely<00:03:23.690> old-school<00:03:24.230> universal

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
you know purely old-school universal

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.740 
you know purely old-school universal
Dethklok<00:03:25.610> it's<00:03:26.000> actually<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.300> lot<00:03:26.450> smaller

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
Dethklok it's actually a lot smaller

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.380 
Dethklok it's actually a lot smaller
than<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.080> expected<00:03:27.200> but<00:03:27.680> yep<00:03:28.640> there<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.030> go<00:03:29.150> and

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
than I expected but yep there you go and

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.080 
than I expected but yep there you go and
then<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:30.250> clock<00:03:31.250> here<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.550> kind<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.850> simple

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
then you clock here is kind of simple

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.020 
then you clock here is kind of simple
but<00:03:32.390> yep<00:03:33.320> that's<00:03:34.070> all<00:03:34.220> thanks<00:03:34.640> for<00:03:34.760> watching

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
but yep that's all thanks for watching

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.370 
but yep that's all thanks for watching
see<00:03:35.570> how<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:35.720> guys<00:03:35.900> later<00:03:36.170> with<00:03:36.350> another
