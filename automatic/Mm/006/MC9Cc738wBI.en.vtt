from<00:00:38.700> everywhere<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.870> don't<00:00:40.050> kill<00:00:40.290> all<00:00:40.500> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
from everywhere if you don't kill all of

from everywhere if you don't kill all of
them<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.250> are<00:00:41.280> coming<00:00:41.760> from<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> ceiling

them that are coming from the ceiling

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.600 
them that are coming from the ceiling
then<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:43.110> will<00:00:43.350> follow<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.190> skillet

also<00:00:47.100> dumb<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> break<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.270> here

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
also dumb is a break in this one here

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
also dumb is a break in this one here
and<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.780> pretty<00:00:48.989> hard<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.289> control<00:00:49.590> her<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and it's pretty hard to control her and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.810 
and it's pretty hard to control her and
this<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:51.000> very<00:00:51.329> very<00:00:51.629> close<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.260> example

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
this was very very close for example

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.760 
this was very very close for example
also<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.690> make<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> spiderweb<00:00:55.620> at

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
also you have to make the spiderweb at

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.560 
also you have to make the spiderweb at
the<00:00:55.890> start<00:00:56.129> respawning<00:00:56.910> any<00:00:57.090> other<00:00:57.390> one

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the start respawning any other one

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.260 
the start respawning any other one
really<00:00:58.079> because<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:59.489> aren't<00:00:59.910> enough

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
really because there aren't enough

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.349 
really because there aren't enough
enemies<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> main<00:01:01.350> path<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.520> there<00:01:03.210> are

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
enemies on the main path and there are

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
enemies on the main path and there are
roadblocks<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.769> which

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
roadblocks like this one here which

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.190 
roadblocks like this one here which
force<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.670> take<00:01:05.850> your<00:01:06.030> time<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.049> other

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
force you to take your time on the other

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.679 
force you to take your time on the other
hand<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:08.939> easy<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.450> fail

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
hand it is really really easy to fail

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.950 
hand it is really really easy to fail
this<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.439> because<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.970> time<00:01:12.270> constraints

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this just because the time constraints

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.090 
this just because the time constraints
are<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.380> very<00:01:13.650> tight<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.860> should<00:01:17.009> not

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
are very very tight and you should not

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.149 
are very very tight and you should not
get<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.610> course<00:01:17.880> yourself<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:19.290> always<00:01:19.799> run

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
get it of course yourself I always run

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.980 
get it of course yourself I always run
to<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.490> bone<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.509> too<00:01:21.780> much

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to that bone because I'm just too much

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.679 
to that bone because I'm just too much
in<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.229> hurry<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:24.119> game<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.570> is

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
in a hurry this game here is

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.140 
in a hurry this game here is
particularly<00:01:25.530> tight<00:01:26.070> about<00:01:26.430> its<00:01:26.700> damage

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
particularly tight about its damage

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.870 
particularly tight about its damage
points<00:01:27.890> you're<00:01:28.890> not<00:01:29.040> allowed<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.340> take<00:01:29.610> more

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
points you're not allowed to take more

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.490 
points you're not allowed to take more
than<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.119> believe<00:01:30.270> six<00:01:30.780> points<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.320> damage

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
than I believe six points of damage

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.710 
than I believe six points of damage
because<00:01:31.979> before<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.460> gets<00:01:33.060> abstract<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
because before you gets abstract at a

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.800 
because before you gets abstract at a
point<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> afterwards<00:01:34.710> every<00:01:34.950> four<00:01:35.280> points

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
point and afterwards every four points

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.200 
point and afterwards every four points
is<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.140> point<00:01:37.409> obstructed<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.220> that's<00:01:38.490> pretty

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
is one point obstructed so that's pretty

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.319 
is one point obstructed so that's pretty
tough<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> don't<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.369> hit<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.030> can

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
tough so don't get hit at all if you can

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
tough so don't get hit at all if you can
help<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.960> single<00:01:43.619> grace<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> one

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
help it a single grace like the one

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.569 
help it a single grace like the one
before<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.210> usually<00:01:45.750> ok<00:01:46.040> to<00:01:47.040> add<00:01:47.100> insult<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
before is usually ok to add insult to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.990 
before is usually ok to add insult to
injury<00:01:47.610> after<00:01:49.100> having<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.399> horrible

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
just take too long so at the end it's

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.009

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
 you can hit CL with the Z saber

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.680 
 you can hit CL with the Z saber
and<00:02:18.830> he<00:02:19.459> will<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:19.760> always<00:02:19.970> be<00:02:20.150> nice<00:02:20.390> enough<00:02:20.629> to

doing this on normal on hardware means

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.449 
doing this on normal on hardware means
you<00:02:38.660> will<00:02:38.840> always<00:02:38.870> have<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.620> watch<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.069> intro
