they shall knew no fear it wouldn't work
in<00:03:40.709> size<00:03:40.920> they<00:03:41.220> automatically<00:03:41.760> pass<00:03:42.060> all<00:03:42.300> my

in size they automatically pass all my
tests<00:03:43.019> but<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.350> is<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> chance<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.239> 22<00:03:45.239> gun

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
tests but it is a chance that 22 gun

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.069 
tests but it is a chance that 22 gun
drones<00:03:45.750> gets<00:03:46.170> rid<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.549> 6<00:03:47.549> 12<00:03:47.940> but<00:03:48.269> 15<00:03:48.690> Steelers

drones gets rid of 6 12 but 15 Steelers

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.350 
drones gets rid of 6 12 but 15 Steelers
I<00:03:49.320> think<00:03:50.100> that's<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.400> best<00:03:50.610> chance<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.150> guns

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
I think that's the best chance to guns

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.740 
I think that's the best chance to guns
rooms<00:03:51.600> will<00:03:51.810> ever<00:03:51.959> have<00:03:52.200> against<00:03:53.360> 16<00:03:54.360> Steelers
