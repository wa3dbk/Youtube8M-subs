00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
minimize the the percentage that we get

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.910 
minimize the the percentage that we get
of<00:00:45.539> them<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.920> I'm<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.640> very<00:00:47.850> glad<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.920> we

of them so I'm just very glad that we

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.709 
of them so I'm just very glad that we
have<00:00:50.219> another<00:00:50.550> call<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.910> duty<00:00:51.120> developer<00:00:51.539> on

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
have another call of duty developer on

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.840 
have another call of duty developer on
the<00:00:51.750> scene<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:52.800> there's<00:00:53.190> going<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.520> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the scene because there's going to be so

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.420 
the scene because there's going to be so
many<00:00:54.329> new<00:00:54.600> implementations<00:00:55.590> hopefully<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
many new implementations hopefully to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.889 
many new implementations hopefully to
this<00:00:56.579> upcoming<00:00:56.789> call<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> duty<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.660> have

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
this upcoming call of duty that we have

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.500 
this upcoming call of duty that we have
not<00:00:58.050> been<00:00:58.109> seen<00:00:58.469> before<00:00:58.649> ever<00:00:59.340> you<00:01:00.120> know<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
not been seen before ever you know you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.939 
not been seen before ever you know you
have<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.690> think<00:01:00.960> maybe<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.649> they've<00:01:01.770> only

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
have to think maybe but they've only

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.850 
have to think maybe but they've only
assisted<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.670> modern<00:01:03.300> warfare<00:01:03.480> 3<00:01:03.860> with

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
assisted in modern warfare 3 with

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.230 
assisted in modern warfare 3 with
Infinity<00:01:05.220> Ward<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:05.580> haven't<00:01:05.760> never

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
Infinity Ward so they haven't never

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600 
Infinity Ward so they haven't never
really<00:01:06.570> created<00:01:06.869> their<00:01:06.960> own<00:01:06.990> call<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.530> duty<00:01:07.799> so

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
really created their own call of duty so

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.399 
really created their own call of duty so
a<00:01:08.640> there's<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.450> many<00:01:09.570> things<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.229> could

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
a there's so many things that they could

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.710 
a there's so many things that they could
probably<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.060> many<00:01:12.180> doors<00:01:12.390> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
probably you know so many doors of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.300 
probably you know so many doors of
possibilities<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.740> open<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.130> with

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
possibilities that I can open up with

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.310 
possibilities that I can open up with
call<00:01:14.520> duty<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.030> take<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.630> down<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> whole

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
call duty and take it down a whole

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.350 
call duty and take it down a whole
different<00:01:16.770> new<00:01:16.860> road<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.250> know<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:18.180> was

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
different new road you know and I was

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.149 
different new road you know and I was
very<00:01:18.420> exciting<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.049> they<00:01:19.409> could<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
very exciting because they could you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
very exciting because they could you
know<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> said<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.540> haven't

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
know we have it like I said we haven't

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
know we have it like I said we haven't
seen<00:01:21.840> them<00:01:21.930> done<00:01:22.110> anything<00:01:22.320> before<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.189> they

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
seen them done anything before so they

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
seen them done anything before so they
could<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.450> bring<00:01:24.630> some<00:01:24.689> new<00:01:24.900> stuff<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
could just bring some new stuff to the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
could just bring some new stuff to the
table<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.420> change

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
table that is really going to change

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.870 
table that is really going to change
call<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.020> duty<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.409> call<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.159> forever<00:01:29.430> really

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
call of duty and call it forever really

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.480 
call of duty and call it forever really
so<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.200> big<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> other<00:01:32.100> side

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
so it's very big but on the other side

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.810 
so it's very big but on the other side
we<00:01:32.850> won't<00:01:33.210> see<00:01:33.659> zombies<00:01:34.350> returning<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.759> year

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
we won't see zombies returning this year

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.210 
we won't see zombies returning this year
and<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.720> treyarch<00:01:37.110> office<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.680> next<00:01:37.890> year

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and so treyarch office will be next year

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.390
