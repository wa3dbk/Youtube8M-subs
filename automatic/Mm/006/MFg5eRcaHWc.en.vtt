00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.740

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 where there is a big fight and there 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.630

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.400

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.529

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.530

 He is very beautiful that she is very 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.820
 A lot of show, just look at the face, it's really cool. 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.960
 already with playing on this map she and I will 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.190
 show you a little more 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.649
 about him wants to show a little of the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.989
 arrows and such where the flags are 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.000
 here begins the flag of this map 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.129
 normal way of spain but some 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.809
 vehicles here to take care not to 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.340
 hit the poles in the command of hamilton 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.199
 on here 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.379
 here we have this great building that you 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.609
 also find in the beque 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.080
 pay a structure you have here are 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.390
 virtually the same as they have in the game 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 normal here is flag b here 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.700
 respawn plus some of the more vehicles 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.680
 did not respect the guy this map here I 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.200
 was playing him a contest of 40 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.659
 people who was and is very well placed is 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.670
 very cool here we have the flags and 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.200
 you can see the flags are not so 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.700
 separated from each other but is better 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.009
 you have a vehicle if you want to see 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.290
 this kind of flag map and why 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.329
 here and there we have that flag that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.369
 let's say the main map flag 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.350
 It was you who is that kind of 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.150
 flag flag 2 iuan afternoon is the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.070
 ardil maps main flag 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:46.049
 so we have here our flag from where 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.390
 You pick it up and get that map and here we 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.060
 we have more scales but I already showed there 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.880
 I showed yes or no I showed good and no 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.799
 showed that it was showing again 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.479
 here we have the way again and where it has 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.070
 a tank and destroy what gives back 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.020
 around here 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.880
 so if you catch this flag you 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.500
 Can you get another tank for your 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.709
 team and we'll see we have the eff wood 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.950
 stay away from anger and in this 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.810
 road map here 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.330
 It's also very cool to play for 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.530
 here if you have a tank for you 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.660
 care has a tent with these houses 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.069
 because people are hiding in them and 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.590
 pretty hard you kill and kill and 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.739
 expand our homes and last here 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.630
 we have the flag g1 that the flag that 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.620
 exit to see closer to another team 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.530
 take 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.090
 Look how nice so you can see. 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.890
 that this map is neither another than 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.380
 has more details and things like 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.630
 but the detail of it wanting map at night 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.680
 and the fact of being the night is a good thing 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.299
 because I think it exploits a 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.209
 little more in the geographic neighborhood 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.810
 of three since we had day maps 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.400
 in this game and let try to make the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.790
 joke that you could spend 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.459
 underneath this bridge with my 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.720
 Helicopter what I think I will not 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.799
 get it because I'm really bad 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.799
 playing with this business 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:12.720
 Look, I 'm just getting it. 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.760
 our pilot rafael very much then 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.060
 People, I guess that's it for this one. 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.180
 map and then show the maps to 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.700
 you from the closet that ugly ugly ugly 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.290
 ugly just keep talking while I go 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.359
 Trying to do this again will not see if it will 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.100
 dar came again but after showing 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.870
 for you maps as you are casting now 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.840
 this map tomorrow I'll bring a 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.519
 conquest gameplay on this map 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.829
 I'll show the map after the 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.950
 Valmor zonta mountains what a snow map 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:44.519
 and if this expansion and after that the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.489
 Guys I want our faithful piloting. 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:51.030
 long after showing all maps 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.230
 Why do you have the kick I want? 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.329
 show you 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.880
 the vehicles you have available that 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.310
 game and what you can use these 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.829
 vehicles like the attacks but for them 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.139
 as the infantry vehicle came from 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.400
 Destruction of tepetitan wanted to show 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.590
 all they have to you than 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.970
 you can use and take care already 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.639
 sent a warning to you guys are playing 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.470
 that truck that plays the missiles take 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.299
 very careful because he has a business 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.519
 that you release after you play the game. 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.320
 time with him wants you to destroy the 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.150
 infantry to kill infantry you are 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.800
 near you want around you 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.820
 It's like a fire business that they 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.370
 around him but that 's killing him 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.020
 O 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.520
 is killing the very person who 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.479
 play business because you have to have 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.340
 inside the vehicle 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.020
 it's like a flash just that it is 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.300
 to show to kill in farÃ­as is that 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.210
 is killing the guy inside the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.330
 vehicle or else you are going to commit suicide 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.370
 if you try to do this and it is not the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.199
 The first time you die the girl goes 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.810
 to leave you with 60% of life but 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.850
 Monday is no chance the second time you 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.860

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.940
