the platoon I discussed in the last
video<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:46.510> I've<00:00:47.020> realized<00:00:47.590> because<00:00:47.920> I<00:00:48.399> play

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
video now I've realized because I play

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.299 
video now I've realized because I play
on<00:00:48.730> PC<00:00:49.180> it's<00:00:49.360> only<00:00:49.720> eligible<00:00:50.020> for<00:00:50.560> players<00:00:50.980> on

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
on PC it's only eligible for players on

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.360 
on PC it's only eligible for players on
pc<00:00:51.880> so<00:00:52.720> what<00:00:53.170> I<00:00:53.200> would<00:00:53.260> like<00:00:53.320> is<00:00:53.739> people<00:00:54.160> from

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
pc so what I would like is people from

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.040 
pc so what I would like is people from
from<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.239> different<00:00:55.510> console<00:00:55.870> platforms

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
from the different console platforms

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.680 
from the different console platforms
that<00:00:56.470> would<00:00:56.710> be<00:00:56.800> willing<00:00:56.980> to<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:58.149> set<00:00:58.420> up<00:00:58.540> a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
that would be willing to to set up a

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.840 
that would be willing to to set up a
platoon<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.380> ask<00:00:59.530> me<00:00:59.739> first<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.430> i'll<00:01:00.640> pick

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
platoon to ask me first and i'll pick

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.790 
platoon to ask me first and i'll pick
someone<00:01:01.210> out<00:01:01.239> from<00:01:01.570> each<00:01:01.690> one<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:02.290> then

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
someone out from each one and then

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.530 
someone out from each one and then
hopefully<00:01:03.040> we<00:01:03.280> can<00:01:03.430> get<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.700> a<00:01:03.730> stage<00:01:04.030> where<00:01:04.059> we

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
hopefully we can get to a stage where we

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.539 
hopefully we can get to a stage where we
could<00:01:04.689> have<00:01:04.930> this<00:01:05.140> platoon<00:01:05.710> on<00:01:06.009> every

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
could have this platoon on every

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.870 
could have this platoon on every
platform<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:07.329> the<00:01:07.990> idea<00:01:08.890> is<00:01:08.979> really<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:09.790> we

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
platform and the idea is really that we

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.149 
platform and the idea is really that we
could<00:01:10.030> set<00:01:10.270> up<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.479> platoon<00:01:11.109> so<00:01:11.469> you<00:01:11.530> always<00:01:11.799> got

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
could set up a platoon so you always got

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.010 
could set up a platoon so you always got
someone<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.609> play<00:01:12.819> with<00:01:12.850> someone<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.810> have<00:01:13.990> fun

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
someone to play with someone to have fun

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.830 
someone to play with someone to have fun
