rest we just work our butts off in terms

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.069 
rest we just work our butts off in terms
of<00:00:59.910> comparing<00:01:00.300> last<00:01:00.480> year's<00:01:00.719> team<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:00.989> this

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

year's<00:01:01.350> team<00:01:01.410> though<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.090> very

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
year's team though I think it's very

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.109 
year's team though I think it's very
similar<00:01:03.979> it's<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.570> younger<00:01:06.570> probably<00:01:07.380> less

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
similar it's a younger probably less

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.020 
similar it's a younger probably less
experienced<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.130> been<00:01:11.250> very<00:01:11.580> clear

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
