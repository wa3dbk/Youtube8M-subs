00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:04.110
 livestock and now we see that not 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.310
 lost but not in the area created 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.069

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.160
 let's take 5 except bright appearance 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.090
 Romanov breed is distinguished by high 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.980
 performance 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.369
 high-quality meat and thick wool 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.060
 shares in this action began to engage in 2100 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.149
 year, the breed was chosen traditionally 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.149
 Central Russia if not easy 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.780

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.220
 breeding work 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.120
 we set ourselves the task of moving these 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.270
 three years old 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.070
 missing after the composition of spleen 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.450
 farms and something that concerns them is not 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.120
 hours of paper of the year directly 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.740
 and the overall rate is therefore adoption 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.140
 special station Moscow region 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.870
 for this we were receiving reports and 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.440
 shocked when we took livestock 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.780
 cleaned by breeding stock 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.470
 that is, why do it 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.360
 in order for m to sell 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.390

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.880
 thick and long hair and now 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.210
 seek to receive from one 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.730
 stocks as much as possible offspring

 different areas of animal husbandry 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.909

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.780
 all countries all the demand for lamb 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.490
