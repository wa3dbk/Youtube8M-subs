00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 yesterday watch interception on the lever first 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.620
 the number weakens the gripping object 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.960
 sent to destination go to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.500
 the next section of our film which 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.570
 is dedicated to taking binding and donning 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.699
 handcuffs 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.910
 at first we will show just technical 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.960
 binding techniques 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.850
 It should be noted that any subject which 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.530
 binding the enemy 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.690
 called viscous 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.300
 it could be a rope it could be 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.070
 belt and so on this way 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.719
 binding is called 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.170
 soft handcuffs for ease hands 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.730
 the object is bound in front of the chest but 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.289
 better tie them behind him so 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.860
 it will be impossible to reach with your teeth yes 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:04.439
 mating 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:10.939
 and gnaw through them as you see the attempt 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:13.470
 freeing itself to nothing leads like 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:18.450
 used reception held reception 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 soft knit cuffs running end 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.670
 several times in tight turns 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.509
 around the hands in the wrist band 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:36.740
 the joint then overtighten 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:41.159
 across increasing pressure on related 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.200
 hands and then both ends 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.670
 mating tied but in this case 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.250
 for simplicity on one turn as you see 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.130
 tear them impossible to take out too 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.130
 it is impossible that it is very dense 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.000
 tying the waist belt with 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.610
 using a double loop like this 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.600
 that's the way si takes the belt 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.600
 double loop is laid
