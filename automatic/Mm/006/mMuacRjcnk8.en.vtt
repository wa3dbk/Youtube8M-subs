00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.750 

first<00:01:11.170> this<00:01:11.320> is<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.500> pretty<00:01:11.740> big<00:01:11.920> map<00:01:12.220> so<00:01:12.580> the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
first this is a pretty big map so the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.730 
first this is a pretty big map so the
odds<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:13.030> it<00:01:13.180> hitting<00:01:13.330> you<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.720> city<00:01:13.990> are<00:01:14.230> not

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
odds of it hitting you the city are not

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.340 
odds of it hitting you the city are not
that<00:01:14.920> great<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.880> horse<00:01:18.880> skylab<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:20.140> never

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
that great that horse skylab you never

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.610 
that great that horse skylab you never
knew<00:01:20.620> you<00:01:24.450> remember<00:01:25.450> in<00:01:25.570> fallout<00:01:26.170> 1<00:01:26.380> when<00:01:26.590> you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
knew you remember in fallout 1 when you

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.980 
knew you remember in fallout 1 when you
could<00:01:26.830> find<00:01:27.130> skylab<00:01:27.790> just<00:01:28.180> lying<00:01:28.540> out<00:01:28.720> in<00:01:28.780> the

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
could find skylab just lying out in the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.080 
could find skylab just lying out in the
middle<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.290> desert<00:01:29.560> what<00:01:30.460> was<00:01:30.580> that<00:01:30.610> near

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
middle of the desert what was that near

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.450 
middle of the desert what was that near
I<00:01:32.370> think<00:01:33.370> it<00:01:33.490> was<00:01:34.800> we're<00:01:35.800> doing<00:01:35.980> the<00:01:36.040> toxic

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
I think it was we're doing the toxic

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.330 
I think it was we're doing the toxic
cloud<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:37.290> let's<00:01:38.290> go<00:01:38.410> Jerry<00:01:38.710> Bruckheimer<00:01:39.160> on

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
cloud to let's go Jerry Bruckheimer on

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.130 
cloud to let's go Jerry Bruckheimer on
this<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.700> start<00:01:39.880> stacking<00:01:40.420> disaster<00:01:40.960> that

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
this and start stacking disaster that

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:51.000 
this and start stacking disaster that
was<00:01:41.290> always<00:01:41.560> been<00:01:41.740> finished<00:01:42.070> at<00:01:42.250> fun<00:01:46.560> fire

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.060 

oh<00:03:28.490> yeah<00:03:29.180> you're<00:03:29.600> supposed<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.050> trigger<00:03:30.860> the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
oh yeah you're supposed to trigger the

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.790 
oh yeah you're supposed to trigger the
siren<00:03:31.520> as<00:03:31.670> soon<00:03:32.000> as<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.360> notice<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.200> disaster

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
siren as soon as you notice the disaster

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.260 
siren as soon as you notice the disaster
and<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:35.510> theory<00:03:35.930> yet<00:03:36.200> huh<00:03:37.100> yeah<00:03:37.610> in<00:03:37.880> theory<00:03:38.150> I

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
and in theory yet huh yeah in theory I

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.940 
and in theory yet huh yeah in theory I
guess<00:03:38.360> it<00:03:38.720> cuts<00:03:38.930> down<00:03:39.140> on<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.380> down<00:03:39.620> der<00:03:39.860> it

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
guess it cuts down on the down der it

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.980 
guess it cuts down on the down der it
makes<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.310> take<00:03:40.850> longer<00:03:41.060> for<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:41.420> disasters

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
makes it take longer for the disasters

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.920 
makes it take longer for the disasters
to<00:03:42.170> spread<00:03:42.500> but<00:03:43.490> usually<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:44.030> just<00:03:44.060> use<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.720> to

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
to spread but usually you just use it to

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:57.820 
to spread but usually you just use it to
make<00:03:45.260> everyone<00:03:45.560> run<00:03:45.830> for<00:03:46.130> cover<00:03:46.310> and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.350 

yeah<00:03:58.830> look<00:03:59.040> at<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.550> passive<00:04:00.210> rain
