stitch it's
-<00:00:15.250> fabric<00:00:15.490> and<00:00:15.940> it's<00:00:16.090> made<00:00:16.410> by<00:00:17.410> knitting<00:00:18.400> a<00:00:18.670> row

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
- fabric and it's made by knitting a row

- fabric and it's made by knitting a row
and<00:00:19.300> purling<00:00:19.930> over<00:00:23.220> you'll<00:00:24.220> notice<00:00:24.520> here<00:00:24.730> that

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
and purling over you'll notice here that

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.540 
and purling over you'll notice here that
my<00:00:25.000> little<00:00:25.150> sample<00:00:25.660> is<00:00:25.840> curling<00:00:26.439> along<00:00:27.340> the

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
my little sample is curling along the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.900 
my little sample is curling along the
sides<00:00:27.849> and<00:00:28.300> from<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.140> bottom<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:30.040> that's

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
sides and from the bottom and that's

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.150 
sides and from the bottom and that's
just<00:00:31.180> the<00:00:31.329> way<00:00:31.480> that<00:00:31.810> stockinette<00:00:32.529> stitch<00:00:32.770> is

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
just the way that stockinette stitch is

just the way that stockinette stitch is
it's<00:00:33.460> always<00:00:33.910> going<00:00:34.120> to<00:00:34.239> do<00:00:34.450> that<00:00:34.660> no<00:00:34.900> matter

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
it's always going to do that no matter

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.220 
it's always going to do that no matter
what<00:00:35.500> yarn<00:00:35.829> and<00:00:36.190> needles<00:00:36.370> you<00:00:36.790> use<00:00:37.060> a<00:00:37.390> lot<00:00:38.200> of

when<00:00:41.079> this<00:00:41.380> happens<00:00:41.829> but<00:00:42.100> that's<00:00:42.370> just<00:00:42.610> the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
when this happens but that's just the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.040 
when this happens but that's just the
nature<00:00:42.820> of<00:00:43.149> the<00:00:43.300> stitch<00:00:43.660> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:45.610> help

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
control the curl a little bit by adding

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.960 
control the curl a little bit by adding
maybe<00:00:49.930> a<00:00:50.020> garter<00:00:50.530> stitch<00:00:50.830> or<00:00:51.130> seating<00:00:51.730> stitch

stitch<00:01:13.030> will<00:01:13.960> help<00:01:14.259> your<00:01:14.619> fabric<00:01:15.100> lay<00:01:15.280> flat

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
stitch will help your fabric lay flat

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.249 
stitch will help your fabric lay flat
but<00:01:15.820> there's<00:01:15.970> probably<00:01:16.329> still<00:01:16.689> going<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:17.110> be<00:01:17.229> a

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
but there's probably still going to be a

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.700 
but there's probably still going to be a
little<00:01:17.619> bit<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.799> curl<00:01:18.009> left<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.719> do

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
little bit of curl left to it when I do

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.940 
little bit of curl left to it when I do
stocking<00:01:24.310> stitch<00:01:24.840> usually<00:01:25.840> my<00:01:26.109> Row<00:01:26.380> one<00:01:26.649> is<00:01:26.920> a

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
stocking stitch usually my Row one is a

stocking stitch usually my Row one is a
knit<00:01:27.249> row<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:28.149> I<00:01:28.179> cast<00:01:28.749> on<00:01:29.079> and<00:01:29.469> then<00:01:29.829> I<00:01:31.259> start

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
knit row so I cast on and then I start

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.050 
knit row so I cast on and then I start
with<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.380> knit<00:01:32.619> row<00:01:32.799> and<00:01:33.130> then<00:01:33.249> my<00:01:33.429> Row<00:01:33.609> two<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:34.030> a

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
with a knit row and then my Row two is a

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.190 
with a knit row and then my Row two is a
purl<00:01:34.359> row<00:01:34.479> if<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:36.039> want<00:01:36.310> after<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:37.630> cast<00:01:37.869> on

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
purl row if you want after you cast on

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.399 
purl row if you want after you cast on
you<00:01:38.530> can<00:01:38.799> do<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.429> purl<00:01:39.819> row<00:01:39.939> first<00:01:40.569> as<00:01:40.960> your<00:01:41.200> Row

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
you can do a purl row first as your Row

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.370 
you can do a purl row first as your Row
one<00:01:41.649> and<00:01:41.920> then<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:43.149> knit<00:01:43.329> row<00:01:43.509> is<00:01:43.689> your<00:01:43.899> row<00:01:44.319> -

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
one and then the knit row is your row -

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.109 
one and then the knit row is your row -
either<00:01:44.979> way<00:01:45.249> it<00:01:45.340> doesn't<00:01:45.520> matter<00:01:45.639> as<00:01:45.939> long<00:01:45.969> as

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
either way it doesn't matter as long as

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.510 
either way it doesn't matter as long as
you're<00:01:46.389> knitting<00:01:47.289> a<00:01:47.439> row<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:47.859> purling<00:01:48.280> a

you're knitting a row and purling a

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.870 
you're knitting a row and purling a
little<00:01:48.850> alternatively<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.579> I'm<00:01:51.670> just

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
little alternatively so I'm just

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.859 
little alternatively so I'm just
knitting<00:01:52.329> here<00:01:52.749> for<00:01:53.709> my<00:01:53.859> row<00:01:54.130> one<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:57.869> if

you're a big dinner and you don't know
how<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.469> cast<00:02:02.829> on<00:02:03.159> or<00:02:03.459> you<00:02:04.240> don't<00:02:04.420> know<00:02:05.340> how<00:02:06.340> to

make the knit stitch or purl stitch I
have<00:02:08.530> separate<00:02:08.979> videos<00:02:09.580> for<00:02:09.610> those<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.450> go

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
have separate videos for those that I go

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:28.289 
have separate videos for those that I go
slower

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:41.309 

where's<00:02:29.299> my<00:02:29.510> necro<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.439> then<00:02:30.620> my<00:02:30.829> pearl<00:02:31.129> row

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.660 

and<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.920> course<00:02:42.280> you're<00:02:42.549> just<00:02:42.760> repeating<00:02:43.299> that

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
and of course you're just repeating that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:03:15.300 
and of course you're just repeating that
throughout<00:02:45.670> middle<00:02:46.540> row<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.049> color<00:02:47.319> Oh

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.720 

so<00:03:15.760> that's<00:03:16.030> it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
so that's it

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.990 
so that's it
that's<00:03:18.349> stocking<00:03:19.349> stitch<00:03:19.680> or<00:03:20.250> stockinette

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
that's stocking stitch or stockinette

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.870 
that's stocking stitch or stockinette
