00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
I think Les Stroud talks about that in

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.120 
I think Les Stroud talks about that in
his<00:03:57.240> Survivorman<00:03:57.810> series<00:03:58.320> on<00:03:58.500> how<00:03:58.650> hard<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.040> is

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.790 
funny like any wild animal in a snake I
suppose<00:04:59.960> it's<00:05:00.960> kind<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.169> far<00:05:01.320> away<00:05:01.470> but

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
suppose it's kind of far away but

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.530 
suppose it's kind of far away but
there's<00:05:01.980> an<00:05:02.100> eagle<00:05:04.010> immature<00:05:05.120> bald<00:05:06.120> eagle

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
maybe that eagle is looking at pixie

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.140 
maybe that eagle is looking at pixie
because<00:05:14.750> she<00:05:14.900> looks<00:05:15.080> kind<00:05:15.289> of<00:05:15.349> dead<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.940> he's
