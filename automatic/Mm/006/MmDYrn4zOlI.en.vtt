00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.639 

they<00:01:42.130> use<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.369> non<00:01:42.850> voz<00:01:43.509> adhesive<00:01:44.049> now<00:01:44.200> so<00:01:44.500> it's

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
they use a non voz adhesive now so it's

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.550 
they use a non voz adhesive now so it's
all<00:01:44.770> water-based<00:01:45.399> so<00:01:45.909> it<00:01:46.149> needs<00:01:46.659> more<00:01:47.049> surface

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
all water-based so it needs more surface

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.639 
all water-based so it needs more surface
tension<00:01:48.009> for<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.640> adhesive<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.899> adhere<00:01:50.200> to

tension for that adhesive to adhere to
the<00:01:50.770> part<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.860> flame<00:01:54.250> treatment<00:01:54.789> is<00:01:54.970> what

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
the part the flame treatment is what

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.510 
the part the flame treatment is what
actually<00:01:55.630> adds<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.530> surface<00:01:56.979> tension<00:01:57.399> it

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
actually adds that surface tension it

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.859 
actually adds that surface tension it
increases<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.299> dyeing<00:01:58.570> level<00:02:00.869> basically

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
increases the dyeing level basically

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.550 
increases the dyeing level basically
when<00:02:02.110> we<00:02:02.259> started<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:03.130> do<00:02:03.429> plane<00:02:04.119> treatment<00:02:04.630> we

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
when we started to do plane treatment we

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.199 
when we started to do plane treatment we
still<00:02:05.890> could<00:02:06.189> do<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.000> manually<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.849> it

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
still could do it manually but it

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.229 
still could do it manually but it
involves<00:02:11.610> inconsistency<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.700> process

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
involves inconsistency in the process

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.090 
involves inconsistency in the process
and<00:02:14.489> it's<00:02:15.489> not<00:02:15.940> without<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:17.110> risk<00:02:17.500> or<00:02:17.769> operator

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
and it's not without a risk or operator

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.690 
and it's not without a risk or operator
also<00:02:18.640> it's<00:02:19.000> pretty<00:02:19.239> finicky<00:02:20.019> on<00:02:20.350> not<00:02:21.160> treating

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
also it's pretty finicky on not treating

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.550 
also it's pretty finicky on not treating
or<00:02:21.850> over<00:02:22.180> treating<00:02:22.600> once<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.959> ever<00:02:23.140> treat<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
or over treating once you ever treat the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.170 
or over treating once you ever treat the
part<00:02:23.799> and<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.100> glue<00:02:24.280> won't<00:02:24.549> adhere<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:25.030> that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
part and the glue won't adhere to that

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.120 
part and the glue won't adhere to that
as<00:02:25.390> well<00:02:25.600> because<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.080> melts<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.830> part

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
as well because it melts the part

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.690 
as well because it melts the part
essentially<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:29.590> were<00:02:29.799> trying<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.280> find<00:02:30.519> out

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
essentially we were trying to find out

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.490 
essentially we were trying to find out
that<00:02:30.940> way<00:02:31.120> how<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.930> do<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.290> flame

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
that way how we can do the flame

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.979 
that way how we can do the flame
treatment<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.310> really<00:02:33.849> very<00:02:34.150> well<00:02:34.360> controlled

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
treatment in really very well controlled

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.500 
treatment in really very well controlled
way<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:37.560> obvious<00:02:38.560> conclusion<00:02:39.459> was<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.819> we

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
way the obvious conclusion was that we

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:57.280 
way the obvious conclusion was that we
should<00:02:40.690> try<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.019> do<00:02:41.319> it<00:02:42.090> with<00:02:43.090> robots

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.950 

we<00:02:58.290> started<00:02:58.650> with<00:02:58.860> iseman<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.460> 2012<00:03:00.240> we<00:03:00.900> were

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
we started with iseman in 2012 we were

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.290 
we started with iseman in 2012 we were
approached<00:03:01.350> just<00:03:01.860> by<00:03:02.070> word<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.490> mouth<00:03:02.550> from

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
approached just by word of mouth from

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.400 
approached just by word of mouth from
another<00:03:03.750> customer<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:04.470> had<00:03:04.620> worked<00:03:04.830> with

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
another customer that we had worked with

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.400 
another customer that we had worked with
he<00:03:07.410> said<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.430> he<00:03:08.730> had<00:03:08.940> good<00:03:09.210> experience<00:03:09.960> with

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
he said that he had good experience with

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.780 
he said that he had good experience with
fits<00:03:10.890> or<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.690> they<00:03:12.690> always<00:03:13.410> performed<00:03:14.220> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
fits or and they always performed the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.900 
fits or and they always performed the
best<00:03:15.000> way<00:03:15.590> for<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> first<00:03:16.950> pistol<00:03:17.220> project

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
best way for the first pistol project

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.720 
best way for the first pistol project
was<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.930> make<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.320> robotic<00:03:20.220> cell<00:03:20.460> for<00:03:20.640> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
was to make the robotic cell for the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.720 
was to make the robotic cell for the
Corvette<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.390> one<00:03:22.010> we<00:03:23.010> got<00:03:23.190> for

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
Corvette and this one we got for
