got a nice and I completed it quickly
turns<00:01:59.000> transparent<00:02:00.039> while<00:02:01.039> building<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:01.520> I

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
turns transparent while building it I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.029 
turns transparent while building it I
kind<00:02:01.849> of<00:02:01.939> realized<00:02:02.360> how<00:02:02.630> out<00:02:02.659> of<00:02:02.899> scale<00:02:03.319> the

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
kind of realized how out of scale the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.859 
kind of realized how out of scale the
other<00:02:04.189> one<00:02:04.429> of<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.939> original<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.659> game

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.169 
other one of the original and the game
was<00:02:06.079> because<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.860> mean<00:02:07.459> if<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.849> go<00:02:08.000> inside

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
was because I mean if you go inside

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.629 
was because I mean if you go inside
right<00:02:08.660> here<00:02:08.989> it's<00:02:09.200> just<00:02:09.500> an<00:02:09.709> extremely<00:02:10.489> small

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:10.639 
right here it's just an extremely small

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.440 
right here it's just an extremely small
space<00:02:11.150> but<00:02:11.600> in<00:02:11.810> lego<00:02:12.680> island<00:02:12.829> one<00:02:13.220> i<00:02:13.250> mean<00:02:13.609> its

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
space but in lego island one i mean its

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.449 
space but in lego island one i mean its
massive<00:02:14.900> inside<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.829> there's<00:02:16.010> no<00:02:16.190> way<00:02:16.400> you

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
massive inside and there's no way you

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.020 
massive inside and there's no way you
could<00:02:16.730> actually<00:02:16.910> use<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:18.019> elevator<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:19.760> do

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
could actually use the elevator just do

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.670 
could actually use the elevator just do
its<00:02:20.269> construction<00:02:20.720> there's<00:02:21.079> no<00:02:21.230> way<00:02:21.380> when<00:02:21.590> you

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
its construction there's no way when you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.080 
its construction there's no way when you
figure<00:02:21.889> could<00:02:22.040> fit<00:02:22.250> through<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.959> so<00:02:23.959> yeah

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
figure could fit through that so yeah

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.629 
figure could fit through that so yeah
it's<00:02:26.650> it's<00:02:27.650> kind<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.010> fun<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.310> mess<00:02:28.489> around

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:28.639 
it's it's kind of fun to mess around
