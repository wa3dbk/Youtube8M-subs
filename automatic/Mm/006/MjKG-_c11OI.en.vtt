console version of the pc gameplay we

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.350 
console version of the pc gameplay we
can<00:00:41.110> make<00:00:41.230> it<00:00:41.350> all<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.559> gun

has been a great experience so far

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.560 
has been a great experience so far
and<00:00:45.050> we<00:00:45.170> had<00:00:45.260> anticipated<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:46.699> know<00:00:46.820> that<00:00:47.059> the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
and we had anticipated you know that the

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.090 
and we had anticipated you know that the
project<00:00:47.960> really<00:00:48.199> comes<00:00:48.410> down<00:00:48.469> to<00:00:48.649> an

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
project really comes down to an

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.520 
project really comes down to an
interface<00:00:49.610> challenge<00:00:50.059> transfer<00:00:50.930> translating

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
interface challenge transfer translating

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.470 
interface challenge transfer translating
between<00:00:51.559> amounts<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.309> keyboard<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.940> an

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
between amounts of the keyboard to an

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.900 
between amounts of the keyboard to an
Xbox<00:00:53.870> controller<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.489> really<00:00:55.670> was<00:00:55.879> the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
Xbox controller and that really was the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.930 
Xbox controller and that really was the
bulk<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.899> task<00:00:57.379> for<00:00:57.680> us<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:58.040> to<00:00:58.070> vacants<00:00:58.820> make

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
bulk the task for us is to vacants make

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.569 
bulk the task for us is to vacants make
that<00:00:59.120> translation<00:00:59.600> and<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.890> transition<00:01:01.370> and

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
that translation and that transition and

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.030 
that translation and that transition and
make<00:01:01.729> the<00:01:01.909> players<00:01:02.239> not<00:01:02.540> really<00:01:02.809> notice<00:01:03.170> and

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
make the players not really notice and

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.190 
make the players not really notice and
it<00:01:04.309> required<00:01:04.759> redoing<00:01:05.479> every<00:01:05.780> single<00:01:06.080> piece

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
it required redoing every single piece

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.960 
it required redoing every single piece
of<00:01:06.259> interfacing<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:06.950> game<00:01:07.100> every<00:01:07.399> pain<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.850> for

ma I took a completely different
approach<00:01:35.210> from<00:01:35.420> starting<00:01:35.990> bruniklan<00:01:36.230> we<00:01:36.530> had

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
approach from starting bruniklan we had

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.280 
approach from starting bruniklan we had
in<00:01:36.830> our<00:01:36.920> previous

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.380 

partly<00:01:41.040> because<00:01:41.160> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> downturn

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
partly because of the downturn

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.110 
partly because of the downturn
me<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.810> also<00:01:42.960> partly<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:44.010> our<00:01:44.729> own

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120

evolution<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.780> game<00:01:46.020> makers<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:47.010> wanted<00:01:47.430> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
evolution is game makers we wanted a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.270 
evolution is game makers we wanted a
simpler<00:01:48.150> what<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> fish<00:01:48.810> smaller<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:50.010> want<00:01:50.190> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
simpler what a fish smaller we want to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310 
simpler what a fish smaller we want to
get<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.610> titles<00:01:50.940> out<00:01:51.090> faster<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.900> we<00:01:51.930> design
