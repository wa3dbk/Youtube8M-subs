to do was give him room but bath

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.619 
to do was give him room but bath
obviously<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.640> didn't<00:02:39.879> want<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.269> and

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
obviously I didn't want to do that and

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.150 
obviously I didn't want to do that and
he's<00:02:40.720> come<00:02:40.900> off<00:02:41.049> second<00:02:41.379> best<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.739> imagine

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
he's come off second best and I imagine

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.250 
he's come off second best and I imagine
he's<00:02:42.280> crying<00:02:42.549> now<00:02:42.849> well<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.330> think<00:02:43.569> he<00:02:43.870> deserved

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
he's crying now well I think he deserved
