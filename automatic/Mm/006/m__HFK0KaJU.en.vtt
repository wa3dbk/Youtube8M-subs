okay welcome to your first tutorial on

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.059 
okay welcome to your first tutorial on
basic<00:00:04.920> Edition<00:00:06.410> I'm<00:00:07.410> going<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.680> try<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.859> keep

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
basic Edition I'm going to try to keep

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.640 
basic Edition I'm going to try to keep
it<00:00:08.189> as<00:00:08.309> simple<00:00:08.490> as<00:00:08.760> possible<00:00:08.970> for<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:10.200> intro

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
it as simple as possible for this intro

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.850 
it as simple as possible for this intro
to<00:00:11.040> Edition<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.380> we're<00:00:13.380> just<00:00:13.500> going<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.650> start

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
to Edition and we're just going to start

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.250 
to Edition and we're just going to start
with<00:00:14.040> basically<00:00:14.630> addition<00:00:15.630> which<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.809> plus

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
with basically addition which is plus

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.320 
with basically addition which is plus
and<00:00:16.650> I'm<00:00:17.609> gonna<00:00:17.760> go<00:00:17.940> through<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> couple

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
and I'm gonna go through a couple

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.070 
and I'm gonna go through a couple
examples<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.380> show<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.460> how<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.910> this

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
examples and show you how to do this

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.480 
examples and show you how to do this
okay

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
okay

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.580 
okay
the<00:00:23.490> most<00:00:23.699> basic<00:00:24.090> addition<00:00:24.510> problem<00:00:24.900> is

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the most basic addition problem is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.710 
the most basic addition problem is
probably<00:00:26.449> this<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:28.529> plus<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.720> you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
probably this one one plus one you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.659 
probably this one one plus one you
probably<00:00:30.960> already<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.380> is

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
probably already know what that is

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.400 
probably already know what that is
because<00:00:32.669> you've<00:00:32.790> seen<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.120> many<00:00:33.239> times<00:00:33.410> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
because you've seen it so many times and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.660 
because you've seen it so many times and
you've<00:00:34.559> had<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> lot<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.920> practice<00:00:35.280> with<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.550> but

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you've had a lot of practice with it but

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.530 
you've had a lot of practice with it but
I'll<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:36.149> ahead<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.390> explain<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.989> um<00:00:38.540> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
I'll just go ahead and explain it um the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.790 
I'll just go ahead and explain it um the
way<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:39.809> look<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.200> well<00:00:40.440> let's<00:00:40.590> just

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
way we look at this well let's just

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.590 
way we look at this well let's just
firstly<00:00:41.190> look<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.149> point<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
firstly look at what is the point of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.010 
firstly look at what is the point of
addition<00:00:43.020> why<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.320> even<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.559> addition

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
addition why do we even have addition

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.020 
addition why do we even have addition
addition<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.770> tool<00:00:47.989> just<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.140> any<00:00:49.320> other

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
addition is a tool just like any other

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.520 
addition is a tool just like any other
like<00:00:51.030> subtraction<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:51.840> multiplication<00:00:51.870> or

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
like subtraction or multiplication or

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
like subtraction or multiplication or
anything<00:00:52.649> else<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> mathematical<00:00:53.820> tool

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
anything else it's a mathematical tool

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.529 
anything else it's a mathematical tool
and<00:00:54.440> in<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.739> case<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.309> allows<00:00:56.640> us<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.210> count

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and in this case it allows us to count

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.340 
and in this case it allows us to count
things<00:00:59.359> I'll<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.539> write<00:01:00.750> tool<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.289> counting

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
things I'll just write tool for counting

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.730 
things I'll just write tool for counting
now<00:01:04.460> for<00:01:05.460> example<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:06.229> have<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.260> plus<00:01:07.590> one

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
now for example we have one plus one

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
now for example we have one plus one
over<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.490> let's<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.510> say<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.990> one

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
over here and let's just say the one

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.859 
over here and let's just say the one
represents<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:11.939> physical<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.570> an

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
represents something physical like an

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.330 
represents something physical like an
apple<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.479> that's<00:01:15.479> an<00:01:15.689> apple<00:01:16.040> that's<00:01:17.040> one

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
apple so that's an apple that's one

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.120 
apple so that's an apple that's one
Apple<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.630> another<00:01:19.560> Apple

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
Apple and then we have another Apple

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.770 
Apple and then we have another Apple
here<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.090> Apple<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.659> one

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
here so we have one Apple there and one

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
here so we have one Apple there and one
Apple<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.610> count

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
Apple there and if we want to count

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.200 
Apple there and if we want to count
those<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.540> could<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.810> say<00:01:25.159> one<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.520> one

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
those we could just say one and one

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.520 
those we could just say one and one
Apple<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.720> counted<00:01:27.990> those<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.259> we'd<00:01:28.409> have

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
Apple if we counted those up we'd have

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.429 
Apple if we counted those up we'd have
one<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.189> two<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:31.049> basic

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
one and two so if you can do basic

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.310 
one and two so if you can do basic
counting<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.759> should<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.210> okay<00:01:33.509> with

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
counting then you should be okay with

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.690 
counting then you should be okay with
this<00:01:35.070> introduction<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.700> addition<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:38.400> here

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
this introduction to addition so here

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
this introduction to addition so here
I'll<00:01:38.909> go<00:01:39.150> ahead<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.420> say<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:40.560> two<00:01:40.920> apples

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
I'll go ahead and say that's two apples

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.090 
I'll go ahead and say that's two apples
right<00:01:42.150> which<00:01:43.079> makes<00:01:43.320> sense<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.799> put<00:01:43.950> those

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
right which makes sense if I put those

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.870 
right which makes sense if I put those
together<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:44.640> I'd<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:46.439> Apple<00:01:46.880> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
together then I'd get that Apple and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.380 
together then I'd get that Apple and
that<00:01:48.149> Apple<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:49.200> now<00:01:49.619> two<00:01:50.100> apples<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.210> that's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that Apple is now two apples so that's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.590 
that Apple is now two apples so that's
the<00:01:51.540> basic<00:01:51.960> addition<00:01:52.560> equation<00:01:53.450> now<00:01:54.450> I'll

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the basic addition equation now I'll

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.819 
the basic addition equation now I'll
just<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.869> through<00:01:55.079> one<00:01:55.229> more<00:01:55.380> example<00:01:55.619> with

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
just go through one more example with

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.510 
just go through one more example with
that<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:57.320> instead<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.710> plus<00:01:59.009> one<00:01:59.219> let's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that and instead of one plus one let's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:09.020 
that and instead of one plus one let's
do<00:02:00.560> two<00:02:02.119> plus<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:04.130> okay<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.899> now<00:02:06.899> here

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
do two plus one okay so now here

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.840 
do two plus one okay so now here
I've<00:02:09.119> got<00:02:09.590> two<00:02:10.590> apples<00:02:13.460> kind<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.580> looking<00:02:14.820> like

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
I've got two apples kind of looking like

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.940 
I've got two apples kind of looking like
cherries<00:02:15.300> now<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:15.660> those<00:02:15.810> are<00:02:15.990> supposed<00:02:16.770> to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
cherries now but those are supposed to

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.520 
cherries now but those are supposed to
be<00:02:17.010> apples<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.640> then<00:02:18.210> here<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.840> one<00:02:19.170> Apple

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
be apples and then here I have one Apple

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.350 
be apples and then here I have one Apple
okay<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.900> I've<00:02:22.020> got<00:02:22.050> two<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.920> then<00:02:23.520> one<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.180> if

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
okay so I've got two and then one and if

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.880 
okay so I've got two and then one and if
I<00:02:24.450> were<00:02:24.600> just<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.870> count<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.320> I'd<00:02:25.500> have<00:02:25.650> one

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
I were just to count this I'd have one

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.970 
I were just to count this I'd have one
two<00:02:26.220> three<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.400> come<00:02:29.610> over<00:02:29.640> here<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.650> my

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
two three so if I come over here and my

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.850 
two three so if I come over here and my
new<00:02:32.160> group<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.600> group<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.990> three<00:02:34.230> apples<00:02:36.860> so

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
new group is a group of three apples so

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.590 
new group is a group of three apples so
the<00:02:37.980> answer<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.250> our<00:02:38.400> equation<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:39.270> with<00:02:39.420> two

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the answer to our equation here with two

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:48.320 
the answer to our equation here with two
plus<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.380> three<00:02:45.080> now<00:02:46.610> before<00:02:47.610> we<00:02:47.730> end<00:02:47.760> this

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
plus one is three now before we end this

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.600 
plus one is three now before we end this
basic<00:02:48.840> tutorial<00:02:49.350> on<00:02:49.380> addition<00:02:50.250> I'd<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.520> to

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
basic tutorial on addition I'd like to

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.520 
basic tutorial on addition I'd like to
show<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:51.180> more<00:02:51.360> thing<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.350> this

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
show you one more thing and that is this

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.340 
show you one more thing and that is this
so<00:02:56.250> for<00:02:56.910> example<00:02:57.300> before<00:02:57.570> we<00:02:57.780> had<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.290> I'll

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
so for example before we had and I'll

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.110 
so for example before we had and I'll
just<00:02:58.470> go<00:02:58.590> back<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.860> our<00:02:58.950> basic<00:02:59.130> equation<00:02:59.370> I'm

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
just go back to our basic equation I'm

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.800 
just go back to our basic equation I'm
sorry<00:03:00.690> about<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:02.270> okay<00:03:03.270> I'll<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.540> go<00:03:03.660> back

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
sorry about that okay I'll just go back

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.449 
sorry about that okay I'll just go back
to<00:03:03.900> our<00:03:03.959> basic<00:03:04.110> equation<00:03:04.350> which<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.830> 1<00:03:05.160> plus<00:03:05.430> 1

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
to our basic equation which is 1 plus 1

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.490 
to our basic equation which is 1 plus 1
and<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.090> know<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.450> equals<00:03:06.870> 2<00:03:07.110> because<00:03:07.290> we

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
and we know that equals 2 because we

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.250 
and we know that equals 2 because we
know<00:03:07.620> 1<00:03:07.860> 2

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
know 1 2

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.949 
know 1 2
the<00:03:11.220> other<00:03:11.400> way<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.700> might<00:03:11.940> see<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.810> I'm

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
the other way you might see this and I'm

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.539 
the other way you might see this and I'm
going<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.170> use<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.470> symbol<00:03:13.709> here<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:17.310> this

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
going to use this symbol here so this

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.430 
going to use this symbol here so this
says<00:03:18.030> whatever<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.480> write<00:03:18.660> over<00:03:18.900> here<00:03:19.230> is

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
says whatever I write over here is

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.520 
says whatever I write over here is
equivalent<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.610> this<00:03:21.049> over<00:03:22.049> here<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.410> they're

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
equivalent to this over here so they're

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.170 
equivalent to this over here so they're
gonna<00:03:22.650> mean<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.950> same<00:03:23.100> thing<00:03:23.310> now<00:03:23.820> another

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
gonna mean the same thing now another

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.820 
gonna mean the same thing now another
way<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.959> could<00:03:25.170> be<00:03:25.260> written<00:03:25.380> is<00:03:25.650> like

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
way that this could be written is like

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.289 
way that this could be written is like
this<00:03:26.100> 1<00:03:26.910> plus<00:03:27.660> 1<00:03:28.730> is<00:03:29.730> 2<00:03:30.739> now<00:03:31.970> just<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.060> give<00:03:33.209> you

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
this 1 plus 1 is 2 now just to give you

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.880 
this 1 plus 1 is 2 now just to give you
an<00:03:33.420> idea<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.989> may<00:03:34.110> be<00:03:34.170> pretty<00:03:34.410> obvious<00:03:34.739> but

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
an idea it may be pretty obvious but

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.479 
an idea it may be pretty obvious but
I'll<00:03:35.040> go<00:03:35.190> ahead<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.459> very<00:03:36.390> very<00:03:36.750> clear<00:03:37.489> we

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
I'll go ahead and very very clear we

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.990 
I'll go ahead and very very clear we
have<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.180> 1<00:03:39.450> here<00:03:39.780> plus<00:03:39.989> 1<00:03:40.530> equals<00:03:41.070> 2<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.940> you

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
have the 1 here plus 1 equals 2 so you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.670 
have the 1 here plus 1 equals 2 so you
have<00:03:42.030> all<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.239> same<00:03:42.420> basic<00:03:42.750> elements<00:03:42.900> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
have all the same basic elements the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.259 
have all the same basic elements the
obvious<00:03:44.070> difference<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:44.820> written

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
obvious difference is this is written

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.910 
obvious difference is this is written
horizontally<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.470> one<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.769> written

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
horizontally and this one is written

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.380 
horizontally and this one is written
vertically<00:03:47.640> now<00:03:48.860> generally<00:03:49.880> for<00:03:50.880> example<00:03:51.239> if

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
vertically now generally for example if

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.300 
vertically now generally for example if
we're<00:03:51.510> adding<00:03:51.630> things<00:03:52.019> like<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.410> million<00:03:52.980> and

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
we're adding things like a million and

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.420 
we're adding things like a million and
you<00:03:53.640> know<00:03:53.730> 15<00:03:54.239> million<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.870> even<00:03:55.220> 15,000<00:03:56.220> plus

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
you know 15 million and even 15,000 plus

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.310 
you know 15 million and even 15,000 plus
you<00:03:57.030> know<00:03:57.120> two<00:03:57.209> thousand<00:03:57.840> or<00:03:57.930> something<00:03:58.049> like

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
you know two thousand or something like

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.660 
you know two thousand or something like
that

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
that

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.400 
that
with<00:03:59.670> larger<00:04:00.030> numbers<00:04:00.060> it's<00:04:00.630> gonna<00:04:00.780> be<00:04:00.930> easier

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
with larger numbers it's gonna be easier

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.780 
with larger numbers it's gonna be easier
to<00:04:01.620> use<00:04:01.769> this<00:04:02.040> form<00:04:02.430> here<00:04:03.470> okay<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:04.530> either<00:04:05.489> one

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
to use this form here okay so either one

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.670 
to use this form here okay so either one
is<00:04:05.910> correct<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.870> one<00:04:07.079> or<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:07.260> one<00:04:07.320> but

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
is correct this one or this one but

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.830 
is correct this one or this one but
you'll<00:04:08.010> see<00:04:08.280> later<00:04:08.489> as<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.239> move<00:04:09.450> on<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.720> more

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
you'll see later as we move on to more

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.479 
you'll see later as we move on to more
advanced<00:04:10.230> addition<00:04:10.769> that<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.160> will<00:04:11.340> be<00:04:11.459> a

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
advanced addition that this will be a

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.640 
advanced addition that this will be a
more<00:04:11.790> convenient<00:04:12.420> form<00:04:12.600> but<00:04:13.260> for<00:04:13.290> now<00:04:13.500> I'll

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
more convenient form but for now I'll

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.960 
more convenient form but for now I'll
just<00:04:13.709> show<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:14.010> how<00:04:14.640> they're<00:04:14.820> actually

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
just show you how they're actually

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.640 
just show you how they're actually
equivalent<00:04:15.269> so<00:04:15.600> for<00:04:15.720> example<00:04:16.049> we<00:04:16.169> have<00:04:16.320> r1

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
equivalent so for example we have r1

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.670 
equivalent so for example we have r1
here<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:18.479> is<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.840> same<00:04:18.989> as<00:04:19.200> this<00:04:19.380> one

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
here and that is the same as this one

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.020 
here and that is the same as this one
I<00:04:20.739> think<00:04:21.039> I'm<00:04:21.130> kind<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.340> going<00:04:21.489> off<00:04:21.639> the<00:04:21.759> screen

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
I think I'm kind of going off the screen

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.180 
I think I'm kind of going off the screen
there<00:04:22.240> but<00:04:22.389> you<00:04:22.509> get<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.780> idea

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
there but you get the idea

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.469 
there but you get the idea
this<00:04:25.090> one<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:29.070> one<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.310> then<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.090> two<00:04:31.270> is

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
this one is that one and then the two is

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.469 
this one is that one and then the two is
obviously<00:04:31.600> here<00:04:32.520> okay<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:34.000> I'm<00:04:34.120> gonna<00:04:34.240> switch

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
obviously here okay and I'm gonna switch

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.360 
obviously here okay and I'm gonna switch
colors

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
colors

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.820 
colors
now<00:04:37.740> obviously<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.699> plus<00:04:40.000> sign<00:04:40.330> here<00:04:40.840> and

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
now obviously the plus sign here and

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.200 
now obviously the plus sign here and
remember<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.220> did<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:42.639> guess<00:04:42.789> I<00:04:42.880> didn't<00:04:43.060> mention

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
remember I did I guess I didn't mention

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.610 
remember I did I guess I didn't mention
this<00:04:43.389> but<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.660> plus<00:04:43.840> sign<00:04:44.020> is<00:04:44.110> what<00:04:44.229> tells<00:04:44.440> us

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
this but the plus sign is what tells us

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.320 
this but the plus sign is what tells us
that<00:04:44.740> we're<00:04:44.860> adding<00:04:45.009> them<00:04:45.250> together<00:04:45.400> okay

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
that we're adding them together okay

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.570 
that we're adding them together okay
we'll<00:04:46.570> get<00:04:46.690> into<00:04:47.160> subtraction<00:04:48.160> later<00:04:48.370> if

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
we'll get into subtraction later if

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.930 
we'll get into subtraction later if
you've<00:04:48.699> already<00:04:48.820> heard<00:04:49.060> of<00:04:49.150> that<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:50.820> for<00:04:51.820> now

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
you've already heard of that and for now

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.339 
you've already heard of that and for now
just<00:04:52.389> realize<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.900> it<00:04:52.990> means<00:04:53.169> we're

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
just realize that it means we're

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:54.900 
just realize that it means we're
counting<00:04:53.770> things<00:04:54.009> up<00:04:54.250> that's<00:04:54.400> what<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.699> plus

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
counting things up that's what the plus

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.909 
counting things up that's what the plus
sign<00:04:55.090> is<00:04:55.210> basically<00:04:55.570> telling<00:04:55.990> us<00:04:56.229> it'll<00:04:56.740> make

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
sign is basically telling us it'll make

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.320 
sign is basically telling us it'll make
a<00:04:56.949> little<00:04:57.160> bit<00:04:57.370> more<00:04:57.490> sense<00:04:57.759> once<00:04:57.970> we<00:04:58.090> get<00:04:58.180> into

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
a little bit more sense once we get into

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.360 
a little bit more sense once we get into
subtraction<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.080> have<00:04:59.199> somebody<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.949> compare

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
subtraction you have somebody to compare

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.150 
subtraction you have somebody to compare
it<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.520> but<00:05:01.270> for<00:05:01.810> now<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.710> have<00:05:02.800> your<00:05:02.919> plus

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
it to but for now you have your plus

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.370 
it to but for now you have your plus
signs<00:05:03.460> okay<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:04.360> then<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:05.020> only<00:05:05.199> thing

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
signs okay and then the only thing

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.570 
signs okay and then the only thing
that's<00:05:05.560> really<00:05:05.680> different<00:05:05.770> other<00:05:06.190> than<00:05:06.400> like

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
that's really different other than like

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.950 
that's really different other than like
we<00:05:06.699> said<00:05:06.880> this<00:05:07.030> one's<00:05:07.210> horizontal<00:05:07.660> that<00:05:07.780> one's

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
we said this one's horizontal that one's

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.310 
we said this one's horizontal that one's
vertical<00:05:08.440> is<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:09.520> equal<00:05:09.849> sign<00:05:10.090> here<00:05:10.229> so<00:05:11.229> the

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
vertical is the equal sign here so the

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.469 
vertical is the equal sign here so the
equal<00:05:11.590> sign<00:05:11.770> but<00:05:12.400> really<00:05:12.729> we<00:05:12.910> have<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.270> equal

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
equal sign but really we have the equal

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.339 
equal sign but really we have the equal
sign<00:05:13.630> it's<00:05:13.720> this<00:05:13.960> thing

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
sign it's this thing

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.409 
sign it's this thing
all<00:05:14.440> right<00:05:14.560> this<00:05:14.710> bar<00:05:15.099> right<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:15.729> this<00:05:15.880> bar

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
all right this bar right and this bar

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.909 
all right this bar right and this bar
basically<00:05:16.810> says<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.229> stuff<00:05:17.440> we're<00:05:17.590> adding<00:05:17.800> on

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
basically says the stuff we're adding on

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.790 
basically says the stuff we're adding on
top<00:05:18.130> that<00:05:18.639> total<00:05:19.120> is<00:05:19.300> two<00:05:19.960> takes<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.590> same

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
top that total is two takes the same

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.249 
top that total is two takes the same
role<00:05:21.490> as<00:05:21.699> the<00:05:21.849> equal<00:05:22.150> sign<00:05:22.389> here<00:05:22.419> and<00:05:23.020> I'll

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
role as the equal sign here and I'll

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.070 
role as the equal sign here and I'll
probably<00:05:23.410> do<00:05:23.650> another<00:05:23.680> video<00:05:24.130> later<00:05:24.460> on<00:05:25.080> that

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
probably do another video later on that

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.080 
probably do another video later on that
explains<00:05:26.680> what<00:05:26.889> exactly<00:05:26.949> an<00:05:27.400> equal<00:05:27.669> sign<00:05:27.880> is

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
explains what exactly an equal sign is

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.060 
explains what exactly an equal sign is
but<00:05:28.240> for<00:05:28.419> now<00:05:28.539> just<00:05:28.750> realize<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:29.620> same<00:05:29.860> thing

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
but for now just realize the same thing

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.890 
but for now just realize the same thing
as<00:05:30.159> over<00:05:30.340> here<00:05:30.550> it<00:05:30.669> means<00:05:30.789> that<00:05:31.120> your<00:05:31.630> total

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
as over here it means that your total

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.210 
as over here it means that your total
here<00:05:32.440> is<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:33.039> same<00:05:33.400> as<00:05:33.729> your<00:05:34.389> total<00:05:34.690> here<00:05:35.220> okay

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
here is the same as your total here okay

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.810 
here is the same as your total here okay
so<00:05:36.280> that's<00:05:36.639> your<00:05:36.820> basic<00:05:37.030> addition<00:05:37.780> tutorial

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
so that's your basic addition tutorial

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.779 
so that's your basic addition tutorial
