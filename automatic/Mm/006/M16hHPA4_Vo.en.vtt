00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.510
 friends how are you good night 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.120
 I am going to present to you the progress that I have 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.120
 had in the 250-liter tank 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.700
 I will show you 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.110
 to the clown fish 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.110
 remember this little friend 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.009
 he was the pq the real one who was sick 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.079
 of white dot and six months of that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.559
 disease because this one 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.559
 at her best and her little friend 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.580
 see the onyx 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.530
 well the agreement I have already had several 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.160
 modifications or several 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.140
 new tenants 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.410
 I'm going to make a little presentation 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.520
 fast of the tenants we have 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.850
 we have a govern 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.729
 This little fish is responsible for cleaning 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.890
 all the substrate all the pretty that 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.230
 we have if you have opportunity to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.560
 watch the previous videos where 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.180
 all the pretty was certain part this 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.950
 part above all was full of seaweed 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.759
 Well now you can verify 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.350
 how long has completely disappeared and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.270
 Well this is because of many factors 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.509
 that the water is already in optimal 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.000
 conditions since there is a lot 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.300
 of microfauna 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.780
 living in the living rock and cleaning 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.970
 of this little friend that is the dragon goby 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.970
 who spends cleaning 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.220
 every corner of our aquarium we have 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.470
 a yellow surgeon a blue surgeon 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.420
 that is very shy is in the area where 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.270
 he sleeps regularly well there we go 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.270
 to capture the blue surgeon is very shy 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:11.440
 It helps to get good there, it lets you record 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.440
 it shows us a little bit of its colors 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.300
 over here we have 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.110
 scarlet shrimp that is also another 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.000
 extremely shy friend 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.840
 very rarely do you see me before 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.500
 there is in cleaning activity 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.500
 scarlet shrimp 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.819
 and finally we have a 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.499
 2 little friends 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.150
 how do you know if we have the opportunity to 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:47.970
 record them 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.770
 On the one hand we have mandarin goby 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.740
 and this little friend who is 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.740
 my favorite the angel reyna does not remember 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.870
 this little angel queen 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.290
 that is beautiful and good here we go something 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.290

 Fish tank is approximately two years old 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.459
 and how can you account for it today 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.319

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:42.910
 difference between the fish tank that I recorded 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.060
 6 months ago and this is because we already have a 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.760
