it<00:00:16.199> sounds<00:00:16.470> best<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.770> think<00:00:16.800> at<00:00:17.100> 15<00:00:17.430> volts<00:00:17.699> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
it sounds best I think at 15 volts and

chorus<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.989> has<00:00:34.230> speed<00:00:35.130> depth<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:36.660> each<00:00:36.930> side

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
chorus it has speed depth for each side

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
chorus it has speed depth for each side
I<00:00:37.890> turn<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.120> switch<00:00:39.270> between<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
I turn on you can switch between the a

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.819 
I turn on you can switch between the a
side<00:00:40.020> or<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> B<00:00:40.320> side

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
side or the B side

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
side or the B side
I<00:00:40.860> mean<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.670> won't<00:00:41.820> know<00:00:41.969> which<00:00:42.149> side<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.480> on

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
I mean you won't know which side it's on

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.990 
I mean you won't know which side it's on
so<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.809> turn<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.170> ask<00:00:43.980> Mike<00:00:44.280> about<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.700> he

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
so you turn it on ask Mike about that he

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.970 
so you turn it on ask Mike about that he
such<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.379> anything<00:00:46.530> solution<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
such is not really anything solution to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.479 
such is not really anything solution to
it<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.670> kind<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> go<00:00:47.969> with<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:49.489> have

blinks in time and hit the depth toggle

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.149

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
at the ABS which go to the B side which

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.950 
at the ABS which go to the B side which
it<00:01:52.040> will<00:01:52.220> also<00:01:52.550> bring<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:52.820> time<00:01:53.030> see<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.480> gets

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
it will also bring in time see it gets

two courses in here just one course
they're<00:03:19.870> almost<00:03:19.990> sitting<00:03:20.260> still<00:03:20.650> sounds<00:03:20.950> fine

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
my opinion you know I see alkyl using it

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.510 
my opinion you know I see alkyl using it
much<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.210> base<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:26.020> use<00:03:26.860> if<00:03:27.070> I<00:03:27.130> want<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.340> cut<00:03:27.490> a

but<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.360> like<00:03:44.360> most<00:03:44.540> bass<00:03:44.989> players<00:03:45.230> we'll<00:03:45.439> leave

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
but I like most bass players we'll leave

but I like most bass players we'll leave
it<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.890> deep<00:03:46.040> toggle

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.940 

I'll<00:04:07.790> put<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.480> LFO<00:04:08.810> in<00:04:08.989> there<00:04:09.170> it's<00:04:09.590> nice<00:04:09.769> to

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
I'll put the LFO in there it's nice to

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.050 
I'll put the LFO in there it's nice to
give<00:04:10.310> us<00:04:10.430> some<00:04:10.549> dirt

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
give us some dirt

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:33.230 
give us some dirt
sounds<00:04:11.599> really<00:04:11.750> cynthy

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.190 

of<00:04:34.240> course<00:04:34.390> sounds<00:04:34.540> nice<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:34.870> some<00:04:34.960> reverb

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
of course sounds nice and some reverb

00:04:35.200 --> 00:05:01.460 
of course sounds nice and some reverb
behind<00:04:35.500> it

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.000 

but<00:05:02.470> of<00:05:03.190> course<00:05:03.490> right<00:05:03.639> now

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.350 

there's<00:05:09.610> no<00:05:09.670> difference<00:05:10.000> there's<00:05:10.270> no

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
there's no difference there's no

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.210 
there's no difference there's no
preference<00:05:10.930> society<00:05:11.320> or<00:05:11.470> sight<00:05:11.680> be<00:05:11.830> if<00:05:12.100> you

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
preference society or sight be if you

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.700 
preference society or sight be if you
have<00:05:12.340> all<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.670> settings<00:05:13.500> exactly<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.590> same

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
have all the settings exactly the same

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.960 
have all the settings exactly the same
they're<00:05:14.890> gonna<00:05:14.980> sound<00:05:15.160> the<00:05:15.280> same<00:05:15.490> on<00:05:15.730> both

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
they're gonna sound the same on both

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.590 
they're gonna sound the same on both
sides<00:05:16.270> because<00:05:16.500> they<00:05:17.500> are<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:19.120> same<00:05:19.270> circuit

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
sides because they are the same circuit

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.640 
sides because they are the same circuit
it's<00:05:19.720> one<00:05:19.870> circuit<00:05:20.200> with<00:05:20.290> two<00:05:20.410> different

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
it's one circuit with two different

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:32.870 
it's one circuit with two different
presets<00:05:27.120> but<00:05:28.120> it's<00:05:28.660> nice<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:28.810> have<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.910> faster

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
presets but it's nice to have a faster

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.660 
presets but it's nice to have a faster
faster<00:05:33.880> or<00:05:33.940> not<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.710> slower<00:05:35.710> deeper<00:05:36.220> setting

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
faster or not a slower deeper setting

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:55.850 
faster or not a slower deeper setting

I love man by course
so<00:06:00.060> there's<00:06:00.210> technology<00:06:00.630> X<00:06:01.520> like<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.670> nice

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880

so there's technology X like the nice
hammer<00:06:03.150> tone<00:06:03.360> finish<00:06:03.630> that<00:06:04.430> I've<00:06:05.430> only<00:06:05.580> seen
