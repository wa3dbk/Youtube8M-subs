 out the door before everyone is gone and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.050
 back home and texts around the same time 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.129
 so that it costs you a lot 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.170
 time

 minutes to house or not 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.900
 ipl no it's just a matter of 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.550
 good plans and the periods that it 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.280
 is incredibly busy and that takes months 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.870
 working successively 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.470
 its also the periods that you are 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.090
 Well hey, you're as calm and think 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.980
 I am very happy with red 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.110
 blowing outside of you and with whom I stand 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.790
 at the starting line with wendy van dijk and 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.500
 surprise yes that you expect it 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.000
 not but this is this is a moment 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.650
 hear because yes the fastest time goes 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.010
 we are attacked if it goes 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.990

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.610
 41 seconds bag but the question is not 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.770
 what do you think you will end up with 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.550
 well 41 seconds I have nowhere 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.710
 on 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.270
 my personal endeavor is in 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.770
 at least under that menu under the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.930
 minute ok british dekker did one 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.610

 we could get rid of it 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.250
 variation tactic how are you going to tackle it 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.780

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.730
 figure skating like a madman with a little one 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.630

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.190
 jet well this start gets points floating 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.660
 in a separate consumer will take 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.520
 3 2 1 go

 is going to die very smoothly this said something 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.260

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.800

 lord of rounding in expectation ok 16 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.910
 seconds in the first round but that 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.590
 means that they would think that 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.150
 from when it's in my girlfriend tyler beside 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.160
