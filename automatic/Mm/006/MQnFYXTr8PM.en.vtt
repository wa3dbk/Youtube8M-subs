00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:19.270
 hello good today I'm going to show you a 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.680
 way that serves to fly in survival 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:28.119
 that brings some wings and we need them 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.600
 as auxiliary and warts to do the 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.600
 normal rooms 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.110
 they are made like this and we have you 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.590
 to do obsidian 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.590
 we do like this and we have you 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.740
 and to do the others 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.800
 to be the last 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.520
 we counted the two if we put wart and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.520
 we have these 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.379
 good 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:11.610
 this does not have coffee or that is the most 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.610
 quick but the others do. 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.390
 well, each one has a different 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.020
 customization lengths 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.380
 these are darker whiter 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.299
 and each one lasts longer than another, they are all 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.299
 totally different is not the same 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.990
 and this has a duration 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.180
 the room gets here and you can go back 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.740
 right now it 's so creative but 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.740
 put survival 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.880
 and I can also see that it gives me a bit of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.880
 protection 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.290
 this too 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.290
 we are increasing the protection 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.130
 Besides flying you can protect yourself 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.130
 are you very good 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.650
 on the last 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.010
 and this one that has no character that is the 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:28.519
 faster but it puts us very little 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.519
 protection 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.860
 but we go much faster 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.480
 good the living room have a 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.670
 animation open and close 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.090
 thing that in multiplayer you can see very 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.090
 beautiful 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.810
 it opens and closes 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.830
 and is that we believe we are not affected by the 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.270
 damage by fall 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.270
 well this is subtracting 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.310
 will serve us on long journeys good 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.920
 this has been the module the good that 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.160
 will be in the description if you liked it 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.060
 give it a like and subscribe help 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.610
 very much 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.340
 to keep making videos and bring 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.800
 bad 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.400
 Well, that was everything 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.400
 bye
