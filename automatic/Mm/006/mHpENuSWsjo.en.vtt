thing<00:04:01.320> but<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.650> rest<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.070> game<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.430> split

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
thing but the rest of the game is split

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.720 
thing but the rest of the game is split
into<00:04:02.880> different<00:04:03.000> level<00:04:03.540> types<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:05.400> have<00:04:05.550> your

into different level types you have your

protect and kill missions and objective
based<00:04:10.200> missions<00:04:10.650> like<00:04:10.860> launching<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.489> beacon

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
or setting off a detonator perhaps the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.310 
or setting off a detonator perhaps the
most<00:04:14.790> interesting<00:04:15.209> thing<00:04:15.630> about<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:16.019> levels

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
most interesting thing about the levels

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.780 
most interesting thing about the levels
though<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.160> way<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.430> they're<00:04:17.579> laid<00:04:17.760> out

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
though is the way that they're laid out

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.360 
though is the way that they're laid out
because<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.900> game<00:04:19.079> does<00:04:19.320> contain<00:04:19.709> branching

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
because the game does contain branching

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.540 
because the game does contain branching
paths<00:04:21.290> depending<00:04:22.290> on<00:04:22.650> how<00:04:22.830> well<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.100> complete

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
paths depending on how well you complete

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.280 
paths depending on how well you complete
each<00:04:23.640> mission<00:04:23.940> your<00:04:24.510> path<00:04:24.750> through<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.110> game

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
each mission your path through the game

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.460 
each mission your path through the game
will<00:04:25.500> vary<00:04:25.770> much<00:04:25.919> older<00:04:26.370> like<00:04:26.520> starfox<00:04:27.030> 64

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
will vary much older like starfox 64

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.110 
will vary much older like starfox 64
this<00:04:28.470> adds<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.830> huge<00:04:29.100> amount<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.550> replayability

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
this adds a huge amount of replayability

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.330 
this adds a huge amount of replayability
to<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.600> game<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.320> with<00:04:31.470> so<00:04:31.620> many<00:04:31.800> levels<00:04:32.010> it's

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
to the game and with so many levels it's

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.560 
to the game and with so many levels it's
a<00:04:32.400> game<00:04:32.610> which<00:04:32.760> keeps<00:04:33.000> bringing<00:04:33.419> new

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
a game which keeps bringing new
