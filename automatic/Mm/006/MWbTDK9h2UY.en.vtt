00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
after we get the inside piece in we'll

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.480 
after we get the inside piece in we'll
weld<00:01:37.859> this<00:01:38.039> to<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> inside<00:01:38.670> piece<00:01:40.490> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
weld this to the inside piece and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.279 
weld this to the inside piece and
hopefully<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> will<00:01:42.119> blend<00:01:42.359> in<00:01:42.539> pretty<00:01:42.689> good

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
now we have our reinforcement piece

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.440 
now we have our reinforcement piece
set<00:01:51.110> up<00:01:51.260> in<00:01:51.470> here<00:01:51.710> we<00:01:51.980> just<00:01:52.160> laid<00:01:52.400> it<00:01:52.580> in<00:01:52.730> and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
set up in here we just laid it in and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.180 
set up in here we just laid it in and
we're<00:01:53.630> holding<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:54.020> down<00:01:54.200> with<00:01:54.470> a<00:01:54.500> c-clamp

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
we're holding it down with a c-clamp

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.960 
we're holding it down with a c-clamp
now<00:01:55.790> don't<00:01:56.000> forget<00:01:56.360> we<00:01:56.810> have<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:57.610> drain<00:01:58.610> holes

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
now don't forget we have to drain holes

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.230 
now don't forget we have to drain holes
underneath<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.170> frame<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:01.640> we<00:02:01.910> have<00:02:02.090> to

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
underneath this frame that we have to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.260 
underneath this frame that we have to
transfer<00:02:02.900> up<00:02:03.590> here<00:02:04.100> into<00:02:04.310> this<00:02:04.430> metal<00:02:04.760> so<00:02:05.150> we

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
transfer up here into this metal so we

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.300 
transfer up here into this metal so we
can<00:02:05.450> cut<00:02:05.660> it<00:02:05.810> out<00:02:05.990> because<00:02:06.560> we<00:02:06.770> got<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.130> let

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.630 
can cut it out because we got to let
this<00:02:08.300> thing<00:02:08.360> drain<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:09.890> have<00:02:10.220> some<00:02:10.460> white

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
holes so I'm going to spray underneath

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.080 
holes so I'm going to spray underneath
and<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.470> paint<00:02:18.740> will<00:02:18.920> go<00:02:19.070> up<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.910> get

and<00:02:44.810> then<00:02:45.560> cut<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:46.010> one<00:02:46.220> out<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.489> little<00:02:46.850> more

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
and then cut this one out a little more

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.800 
and then cut this one out a little more
like<00:02:47.239> this

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
like this

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.979 
like this
now<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.920> got<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> little<00:02:49.910> sticking<00:02:50.270> over<00:02:50.660> here

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
now I got a little sticking over here

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.380 
now I got a little sticking over here
and<00:02:51.260> made<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.650> little<00:02:51.860> too<00:02:52.010> big<00:02:52.250> here<00:02:52.550> but

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
and made it a little too big here but

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.550 
and made it a little too big here but
that's<00:02:53.510> good<00:02:53.780> for<00:02:53.810> welding<00:02:54.320> that's<00:02:54.769> okay<00:02:56.560> so

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
that's good for welding that's okay so

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.110 
that's good for welding that's okay so
I'm<00:02:57.830> going<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.040> go<00:02:58.190> ahead<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.519> cut<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:58.850> stuff

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
I'm going to go ahead and cut this stuff

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.190 
I'm going to go ahead and cut this stuff
out<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.630> see<00:03:00.110> where<00:03:00.320> we<00:03:00.440> get<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:02.510> chance<00:03:03.019> where

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
out and see where we get so chance where

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.900 
out and see where we get so chance where
I<00:03:03.230> cut<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.680> out<00:03:06.250> I'm<00:03:07.250> probably<00:03:07.549> going<00:03:07.850> to

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
I cut this out I'm probably going to

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.670 
I cut this out I'm probably going to
take<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.269> off<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.810> then<00:03:09.049> grind<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.440> down<00:03:09.500> a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
take it off and then grind it down a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.580 
take it off and then grind it down a
little<00:03:09.830> bit<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.280> make<00:03:10.459> sure<00:03:10.489> she's<00:03:10.940> flat<00:03:11.590> then

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
little bit to make sure she's flat then

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.870 
little bit to make sure she's flat then
after<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.100> I'm<00:03:13.250> going<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.400> put<00:03:13.549> this<00:03:13.700> thing

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
after that I'm going to put this thing

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.180 
after that I'm going to put this thing
right<00:03:14.090> back<00:03:14.299> in<00:03:14.540> again<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:15.019> then<00:03:15.080> I'm<00:03:16.040> going

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
right back in again and then I'm going

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.310 
right back in again and then I'm going
to<00:03:16.250> start<00:03:16.519> spot<00:03:16.850> welding<00:03:17.299> this<00:03:17.450> thing<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:18.049> the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
to start spot welding this thing in the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.970 
to start spot welding this thing in the
back<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.950> in<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.670> front<00:03:20.650> all<00:03:21.650> right<00:03:21.739> I'm

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
back and in the front all right I'm

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.830 
back and in the front all right I'm
gonna<00:03:22.100> have<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.310> get<00:03:22.430> another<00:03:22.549> C<00:03:22.970> clamp<00:03:23.269> put<00:03:23.810> a

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
gonna have to get another C clamp put a

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.410 
gonna have to get another C clamp put a
way<00:03:24.019> back<00:03:24.290> here<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.010> then<00:03:25.580> I<00:03:25.610> just<00:03:25.730> weld<00:03:26.180> in

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
way back here and then I just weld in

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.199 
way back here and then I just weld in
between<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.959> spots<00:03:27.430> now<00:03:28.430> this<00:03:28.670> here<00:03:28.910> really

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
between the spots now this here really

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.530 
between the spots now this here really
isn't<00:03:29.450> down<00:03:29.720> flush<00:03:30.140> for<00:03:30.709> some<00:03:30.920> reason

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.170 

probably<00:03:35.540> because<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:37.160> little<00:03:37.340> step<00:03:37.880> that

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
probably because of the little step that

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.610 
probably because of the little step that
was<00:03:38.959> right<00:03:39.200> here<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:40.310> they<00:03:41.260> depress<00:03:42.260> this

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
was right here that they depress this

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.130 
was right here that they depress this
part<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.130> frame<00:03:43.370> down<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.730> fit<00:03:44.480> into<00:03:44.690> here

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
part of the frame down to fit into here

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.560 
part of the frame down to fit into here
and<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.160> didn't<00:03:46.430> put<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.579> step<00:03:46.910> in<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:47.239> piece

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
and so I didn't put a step in this piece

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.430 
and so I didn't put a step in this piece
here<00:03:48.130> but<00:03:49.360> we<00:03:50.360> can<00:03:50.480> get<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:50.660> pretty<00:03:50.780> close<00:03:51.110> so

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
here but we can get it pretty close so

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.620 
here but we can get it pretty close so
I'm<00:03:52.370> going<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.579> go<00:03:52.700> ahead<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.030> put<00:03:53.480> them<00:03:53.600> all

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
I'm going to go ahead and put them all

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.780 
I'm going to go ahead and put them all
the<00:03:53.810> c-clamp<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.440> here<00:03:54.739> answer<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.459> do<00:03:55.519> this

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
the c-clamp in here answer I do this

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.759 
the c-clamp in here answer I do this
down<00:03:56.060> then<00:03:56.480> we<00:03:56.630> weld<00:03:56.870> in<00:03:57.079> between<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.560> seat

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
down then we weld in between the seat

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.800 
down then we weld in between the seat
clamps<00:03:58.220> we'll<00:03:58.730> just<00:03:58.970> move<00:03:59.180> them<00:03:59.390> will<00:03:59.569> weld

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
clamps we'll just move them will weld

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.900 
clamps we'll just move them will weld
against<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.349> wall<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> little<00:04:00.770> bit<00:04:00.920> then<00:04:01.580> weld

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
against the wall a little bit then weld

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.059 
against the wall a little bit then weld
over<00:04:02.270> here

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
over here

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.530 
over here
might<00:04:03.189> even<00:04:03.370> have<00:04:03.579> to<00:04:03.609> break<00:04:03.939> out<00:04:04.120> my<00:04:04.150> TIG

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
might even have to break out my TIG

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.340 
might even have to break out my TIG
again<00:04:04.870> but<00:04:05.739> we'll<00:04:06.069> see
