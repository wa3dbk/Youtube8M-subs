00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
trajectory of the gravity of the pool so

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.400 
trajectory of the gravity of the pool so
when<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.450> shoot<00:03:01.630> from<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.840> treestand<00:03:02.290> you

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
when you shoot from a treestand you

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.900 
when you shoot from a treestand you
might<00:03:02.590> range<00:03:02.950> them<00:03:03.100> at<00:03:03.220> 30<00:03:03.430> but<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.790> might

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
might range them at 30 but you might

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.330 
might range them at 30 but you might
need<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.120> shoot<00:03:04.240> in<00:03:04.360> 427<00:03:04.900> really<00:03:05.890> cool<00:03:06.100> deal
