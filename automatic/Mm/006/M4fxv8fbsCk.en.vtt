00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.959
 white we are here today with a new video 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.929
 dedicated to the career with ours 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.330
 player on m2k 14 we had been chosen 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.490
 from the ranks of the testaments sixters e 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.650
 we had moved to the washington 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.050
 wizards a little more team 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.570
 competitive but which may not be 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.949
 our last destination for the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.000
 our project during the first one 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.029
 year 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.470
 we played with the houston rockets 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.449
 match based office for ios is not 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.489
 a great team before starting me 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.949
 you asked how to crush 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.010
 I simply advise you raise the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.610
 dunk to raise elevation c 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.680
 take the packages those type ie 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.390
 show posterization sprite why 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.650
 so they make them crush even entering 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.769
 that you have seen before a beautiful one 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.059
 crushed in the face of another person 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.299
 then another defender has them 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.400
 crushed in the face said this yesterday 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.519
 evening during the night then in the 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.060
 night between thursday and friday there was the 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.979
 draft ne 2014 we have already seen 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.740
 some prospects in our career 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.399
 su mai gm where we chose parquet 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.109
 smart rugby we chose them with 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.630
 boston celtics obviously are not 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:23.899
 went to the choices then cipe players 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.409
 but on all of the first ones 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:30.499
 seven positions in particular cleveland 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.689
 chose as quite predictable 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:34.850
 chosen wiggins which probably is not 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.270
 at the moment the strongest player of the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.740
 draft certainly plays a player 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.200
 futuristic that has a great future if there is 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.810
 work with this player I do n't think 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.159
 will be a bennet two then a rookie who 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.469
 goes to disappoint expectations like 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.119
 this year second position already varied 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.560
 parks was pretty obvious with 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.109
 milwaukee who goes to choose what 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.460
 remains between wiggins and barkers so yes 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.249
 however, please a great player 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.359
 parker 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.999
 personally I prefer it too 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.889
 slightly at the moment to wiggins third 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.610
 position here was to stop one 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:08.820
 surprise 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.250
 in b defined as ipad and you feel yes I say 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.040
 surprise because anyway i 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.680
 services will already be from the last draft 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.390
 so they have two centers that are a little bit 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.670
 a double in one of the other I don't know if 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.260
 they will exchange 1 we count that amy 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.030
 should be out of four to six 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.270
 months so it might even come back 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.250
 for next year so could 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.020
 to be taken in great perspective to see 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.810
 we like this year and then at the most 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.420
 exchange it other choices here maybe the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.520
 real surprise was gordon chosen at 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.830
 4 from orlando orlando I thought it was going 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.390
 on a playmaker type x1 smart instead 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.700
 went to get gordon then a wing 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.340
 very athletic also on him we will need 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.190
 work on it very good player anyway 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.160
 he too at the fifth utah jazz 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.180
 they go to take the summit on a 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.770
 Australian has a big point 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.600
 question about this many player 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.580
 they say it is one of the strongest of 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.750
 this bratti in perspective but I want 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.270
 see it in a context like that 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.920
 American maybe slightly more 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.310
 competitive that surely championship 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.350
 only your celtics choose smart 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.780
 then a point of contact with the 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.459
 our career never gm smart great 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.290
 prime, however, in my opinion 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.700
 at this point they will give away because 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.260
 they are two players however in the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.630
 role of play maker are similar 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.850
 and we close with the lakers with to take 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.160
 randall that is however it is probably 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.720
 the most ready player in this 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.730
 moment is in nba 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.799
 that is among those from the drafts is the most 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.959
 ready perhaps the one with less margin of 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.600
 improvement but then we'll see a little 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.190
 how this will develop 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.500
 player hopefully good for mine 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.730
 lakers who then treated another 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.220
 on the second tour he takes a city 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.810
 washington in any case was kind 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.930
 chosen in this chart chosen 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.730
 minnesota timberwolves word choice 52 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.640
 anywhere on the second lap is then 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.519
 been exchanged and went to the houston 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.959
 probably kindly rockets will have to do 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.180
 another year in europe because it is not 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.100
 I see at all ready in any case we'll see 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.840
 we have the fifth Italian in mine 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.610
 so which we have concluded if there is 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.590
 you must leave a layman a comment 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.430
 subscribe to the channel nor will we see you soon 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.430

 handle the two dresses nguyen coach and new gas 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.300
 at the beginning spain 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.540
 gennaro helps 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.000
 rabiu but towards the speakers
