00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.070
 Yes very much Hello 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:11.630
 It is this time to put emphasis on both not a little from this year 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:16.510
 I bought a blitz cubometer Vacuum meter I think maybe 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:22.540
 I think it is an unfamiliar to me but I will briefly explain this meter 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:26.300
 Children suck in air and explode to give power, but with this meter, which one 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:30.859
 We know roughly be called or just sucking air 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.180
 Of whether the fact that it is seen squid know how much the air is out of the sitting in a circle gorilla machine force 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.540
 I understand that 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.340
 So what do you know if you know it 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:45.620
 If you drive as much as possible, the fuel efficiency will be improved 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.640
 A little is if the operation so as not to as much as possible to increase the needle with the way the meter but slightly Tsukedo 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.530
 You can make a product pew 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.220
 This crown is pretty much better than the town but only about 7 to 8 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.199
 Though 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.309
 I installed Pretty O q meter this time to say that it should be a little better 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.850
 Will you be 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:11.250
 At first the harness of this sensor in the room 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:19.960
 It's about trying to do because it is the hardest thing you want to pull in 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:25.600
 It took a lot of time to start wiring, but the wiring was finally over 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.780
 Even if the space is too narrow , the battery is removed 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.780
 so 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.840
 Action 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:40.710
 I 'm sorry I can not see you for a moment 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.340
 Glove box removal holder mandar cover removal deco bracing from cpu 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.610
 Kana 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.770
 Beneath descended barely light wiring this it's there or something amplifier removal 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.479
 After all 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:02:03.080
 Wiring pull back pull-in has been through this I very retraction is the most large now room 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:04.480
 Nde came we have as far as the Tender Well Hey other through here 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.590
 The time being 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:14.470
 I would like to restore this fall apart 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:17.300
 I'm sorry that there is a slight shake this 8 from the back of the air conditioning panel always 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.450
 Power supply ignition on power supply 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.400
 Earth of the small after battery 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.770
 All of them were branched by electro tap 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:34.960
 Following this with 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:40.330
 The waiter is a good side, and I will continue to play with this coupler with a wire connected to it. 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:43.260
 Next is the meter panel no This panel has a cat meter but this 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.140
 I removed it to winter here 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.800
 Drill holes for the meter wires 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.910
 In and it hits as measured by generally issued a guideline to a man sting 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.490
 It was 6 mm when closing was measured by Noh technology 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.650
 Huh 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.650
 We will open six holes in the impact 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:21.760
 Next, cut a part of the engine rule building and attach a sensor that measures this negative pressure. 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.760
 Kai First Once this has removed the cover with the cover is the way 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.930
 Masu Tei 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.909
 Where are you 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.180
 Well it is well negative圧図Rutokonan of 2 jz 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.040
 There is an intake manifold , maybe 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.890
 Maa coco 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.800
 I cut this pipe and scoop it up, but it's a little unusual with this guy included 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.360
 Ne 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.930
 8 Because it was too early to come thinly if it was this 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.950
 a 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.990
 And 646 towards the 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.610
 I bought it at the yellow hat 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:07.990
 I removed this 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.990
 No and Tsu rake in this kind of disconnect we will not buy this three-pronged 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.769
 I thought that piping cuts would increase 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.829
 Well I'd civil feeling was it you were and said, this after 6 mm Sha A win 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.470
 It is all right in the same 4 mm, but a woman a 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:30.080
 I bought it but I did not use it yeah 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:35.360
 I can't cut it and fix it with tie wraps and hide it nicely 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:40.190
 The installation of the vacuum gauge which is now in the room is finished 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.110
 We put in the place of the black one ton at the meter to like this 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.110
 Let's start the engine with 8 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.200
 I put in there is a opening ceremony ceremony in feeling like a rock 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.770
 Properly if there is a tension 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.870
 It will not move 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.870
 The person who is crawling the accelerator in 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.569
 Such feeling Paris moves vote today 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:23.699
 It took a while to say a 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:27.349
 Here and there because the thing to have a little hand attachment of Fuji Bas-class intangible was the end 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.349
 I am very sorry for shaking 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:38.090
 Fujii vacuum Prefecture attached to Frau has ended with that 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:42.350
 Field break would tighten the is not much honest 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:46.190
 I think that I think we also many people Tteyuu Maybe Once was Toka boost gauge 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:50.490
 But the need for breaks does n't occur very often. 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:55.129
 It is a meter with a high degree of depression-it is very fun to see 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:06:00.800
 That is highly recommended for those who ride na 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:06.139
 The difficulty of installing the Reamer a little is honestly a bit high 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:09.080
 The child also was Toka the other say I ne ordinary wiring I'd need to pass through the indoor wiring 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.979
 It is not so difficult to do this 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:17.569
 But that coupler After all the course of employment company is after all 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:20.820
 I'm processing the grommet at the buber force head , but put my hand there 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:24.810
 Maybe space is almost nothing 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:27.300
 So if you get rid of the battery and click on it, the theme and time are still a little 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:32.600
 I think honestly I think it takes 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:36.340
 Please try to put the people of happy na ride because it is a meter of hot Recommended 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.340
 Thank you for viewing it
