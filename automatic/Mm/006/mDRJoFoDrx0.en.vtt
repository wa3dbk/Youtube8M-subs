and you'll get the picture what to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.890 
and you'll get the picture what to
change<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.060> document<00:00:20.150> this<00:00:21.150> select<00:00:21.570> pro

change on the document this select pro

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.599 
change on the document this select pro
and<00:00:22.760> make<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:26.510> 512<00:00:27.510> by<00:00:27.660> 512<00:00:28.519> recommend<00:00:29.519> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and make it 512 by 512 recommend to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.020 
and make it 512 by 512 recommend to
resize<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.439> under<00:00:31.439> tools<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.279> select<00:00:32.730> plain

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
resize it under tools you select plain

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.900 
resize it under tools you select plain
3d<00:00:34.850> you<00:00:35.850> draw<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> canvas<00:00:37.610> make<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
3d you draw it on the canvas make it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.760 
3d you draw it on the canvas make it
editable<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.899> make<00:00:40.739> polymesh3d<00:00:41.309> out<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.969> it

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
editable and make polymesh3d out of it

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.090 
editable and make polymesh3d out of it
now<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.800> should<00:00:44.840> press<00:00:45.840> F<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.829> keyboard

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
now you should press F on the keyboard

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.000 
now you should press F on the keyboard
just<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.960> mesh<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.379> covering<00:00:49.829> all

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
just to see if the mesh is covering all

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.930 
just to see if the mesh is covering all
the<00:00:50.160> canvas<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.410> doesn't

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
the canvas as we can see here it doesn't

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.680 
the canvas as we can see here it doesn't
it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.619 
it
still<00:00:55.110> shows<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> canvas<00:00:56.340> end<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.480> is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
still shows on the canvas end that is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.529 
still shows on the canvas end that is
not<00:00:57.809> okay<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.160> zoom<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.930> until

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
not okay so we have to zoom in until

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.390 
not okay so we have to zoom in until
when<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.780> click<00:01:04.409> F<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:06.119> mesh<00:01:06.299> should<00:01:07.400> cover

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
when we click F the mesh should cover

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.620 
when we click F the mesh should cover
everything<00:01:10.369> then<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> go<00:01:12.030> down<00:01:12.210> down

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
everything then we have to go down down

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.929 
everything then we have to go down down
to<00:01:12.840> geometry<00:01:13.229> turn<00:01:14.189> off<00:01:15.020> smooth<00:01:16.020> modifier<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
to geometry turn off smooth modifier and

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:24.380 
to geometry turn off smooth modifier and
subdivide<00:01:18.560> till<00:01:19.560> level<00:01:20.100> 5<00:01:22.220> then<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.700> shoot

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
subdivide till level 5 then we shoot

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.460 
subdivide till level 5 then we shoot
under<00:01:24.750> transform<00:01:25.670> which<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.090> find<00:01:27.330> here

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.330 

activate<00:01:31.470> symmetry<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.490> z<00:01:32.700> axis<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:34.340> radial

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
activate symmetry the z axis and radial

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
activate symmetry the z axis and radial
count<00:01:36.000> set<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.720> 25<00:01:38.750> now<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.229> draw

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
count set to 25 now we can draw

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.060 
count set to 25 now we can draw
something<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.460> canvas

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
something on the canvas

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.880 
something on the canvas
I'm<00:01:44.070> not<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.820> explain<00:01:45.659> how<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.439> should

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
I'm not going to explain how you should

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.100 
I'm not going to explain how you should
create<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.820> own<00:01:48.439> design<00:01:49.439> because<00:01:50.899> ZBrush<00:01:51.899> is

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
create your own design because ZBrush is

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.190 
create your own design because ZBrush is
all<00:01:52.320> about

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.050 

experimenting<00:02:00.160> so<00:02:01.480> after<00:02:02.480> you<00:02:02.630> have<00:02:03.010> created

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
experimenting so after you have created

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.880 
experimenting so after you have created
something<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.540> like<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.970> go<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.990> alpha<00:02:09.619> and

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
something you like you go to alpha and

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.350 
something you like you go to alpha and
click<00:02:10.880> grab<00:02:11.630> top<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.790> Alpha<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.300> created

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
click grab top and the Alpha is created

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.510 
click grab top and the Alpha is created
so<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.420> have<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.020> make<00:02:18.200> sure<00:02:18.490> everything<00:02:19.490> that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
so you have to make sure everything that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.920 
so you have to make sure everything that
is<00:02:19.970> on<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.330> canvas<00:02:20.660> should<00:02:21.290> face<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:22.930> because

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
is on the canvas should face you because

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.650 
is on the canvas should face you because
when<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.530> grab<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.950> document<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.940> creates<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
when you grab the document it creates a

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.170 
when you grab the document it creates a
copy<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:30.020> what<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.890> showing<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.000> canvas

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
copy of what is showing on the canvas

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.830 
copy of what is showing on the canvas
now<00:02:35.180> we<00:02:35.239> shoot<00:02:35.900> before<00:02:36.590> we<00:02:36.800> save<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.610> brush<00:02:37.970> we

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
now we shoot before we save the brush we

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.000 
now we shoot before we save the brush we
should<00:02:39.140> try<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.620> out<00:02:39.800> on<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.730> sphere<00:02:41.830> make<00:02:42.830> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
should try it out on the sphere make the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.760 
should try it out on the sphere make the
poly<00:02:43.280> mesh<00:02:44.920> again<00:02:46.390> subdivided<00:02:47.390> till<00:02:48.200> level<00:02:49.190> 5

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
poly mesh again subdivided till level 5

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.960 
poly mesh again subdivided till level 5
and<00:02:54.160> used<00:02:55.160> rectangle<00:02:56.090> for<00:02:56.420> stroke<00:02:56.800> on

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
and used rectangle for stroke on

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.009 
and used rectangle for stroke on
standard<00:02:58.970> brush<00:02:59.440> we're<00:03:00.440> going<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:01.480> just<00:03:02.480> draw

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
standard brush we're going to just draw

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:09.640 
standard brush we're going to just draw
the<00:03:04.239> new<00:03:05.239> design<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.989> button<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:09.350> now<00:03:09.590> we

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
the new design of the button so now we

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.699 
the new design of the button so now we
can<00:03:09.980> see<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.790> intensity<00:03:11.420> is<00:03:11.660> pretty<00:03:12.230> low<00:03:12.410> so

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
can see the intensity is pretty low so

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:25.060 
can see the intensity is pretty low so
we<00:03:13.100> can<00:03:13.130> increase<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:20.920> hold<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:23.380> all<00:03:24.380> but

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
we can increase it and hold it all but

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:33.270 
we can increase it and hold it all but
you<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.610> see<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.060> can<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:29.600> can<00:03:29.989> make<00:03:30.829> it

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.870 

subdivided<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:38.680> when<00:03:39.680> we<00:03:39.890> oh<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.280> are<00:03:40.430> happy

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
subdivided so when we oh you are happy

with<00:03:41.150> your<00:03:41.390> Z<00:03:41.989> intensity<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:43.549> you<00:03:44.420> go<00:03:44.690> up<00:03:44.870> to

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
with your Z intensity and you go up to

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.259 
with your Z intensity and you go up to

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
your hard drive this this and this is

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.120 
your hard drive this this and this is
pretty<00:03:55.519> much<00:03:55.610> it<00:03:56.090> if<00:03:56.390> you<00:03:56.600> are<00:03:56.900> creating<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
pretty much it if you are creating the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.289 
pretty much it if you are creating the
Alpha<00:03:58.730> which<00:03:58.940> is<00:04:00.280> flowing<00:04:01.280> upwards<00:04:01.940> from<00:04:02.209> the

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
Alpha which is flowing upwards from the

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.550 
Alpha which is flowing upwards from the
plain<00:04:02.810> 3d

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:14.140 

because<00:04:06.640> if<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:07.790> go<00:04:07.940> back<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:12.790> design<00:04:13.790> you

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
because if you go back to the design you

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.620 
because if you go back to the design you
can<00:04:14.330> see<00:04:14.599> if<00:04:14.810> we<00:04:14.959> go<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.349> the<00:04:15.739> side<00:04:16.040> view<00:04:16.630> the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
can see if we go to the side view the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.400 
can see if we go to the side view the
plane<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.739> 3d<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.310> starting<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:21.049> lowest

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
plane of the 3d is starting the lowest

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:30.450 
plane of the 3d is starting the lowest
point<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:23.060> mesh<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:26.750> is<00:04:26.930> okay<00:04:27.320> but<00:04:27.710> if<00:04:28.520> we

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
point of the mesh this is okay but if we

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:41.070 
point of the mesh this is okay but if we
make<00:04:33.070> something<00:04:34.720> lower<00:04:35.720> then<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:40.580> plane

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
make something lower then the plane

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.590 
make something lower then the plane
which<00:04:42.080> we<00:04:42.260> can<00:04:42.440> see<00:04:42.620> now<00:04:42.800> here<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:44.240> can<00:04:44.389> see

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
which we can see now here you can see

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.040 
which we can see now here you can see
these<00:04:44.750> points<00:04:45.260> are<00:04:45.410> lower<00:04:45.650> than<00:04:45.979> the<00:04:46.100> plane<00:04:46.340> 3d

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
these points are lower than the plane 3d

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.629 
these points are lower than the plane 3d
then<00:04:48.050> we<00:04:49.630> can<00:04:50.630> have<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:50.990> problem<00:04:51.470> when<00:04:51.710> we<00:04:51.740> grab

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
then we can have a problem when we grab

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.780 
then we can have a problem when we grab
the<00:04:52.790> document<00:04:53.740> because<00:04:54.740> now<00:04:54.950> we<00:04:55.010> can<00:04:55.130> see<00:04:57.790> the

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
the document because now we can see the

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.350 
the document because now we can see the
plane<00:04:59.600> 3d<00:04:59.960> is<00:05:00.020> also<00:05:02.169> shown<00:05:03.169> in<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.440> oven<00:05:03.830> and

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
plane 3d is also shown in the oven and

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.990 
plane 3d is also shown in the oven and
this<00:05:05.360> can<00:05:05.750> create<00:05:05.990> some<00:05:06.710> problems<00:05:07.340> when

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
this can create some problems when

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:18.340 
this can create some problems when
applying<00:05:12.070> this<00:05:13.070> kind<00:05:13.430> of<00:05:13.630> button<00:05:17.169> oops

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
applying this kind of button oops

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:26.440 
applying this kind of button oops
you<00:05:19.190> have<00:05:19.700> to<00:05:19.910> make<00:05:20.120> it<00:05:20.390> a<00:05:22.750> drag<00:05:23.750> rectangle<00:05:25.450> so

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
you have to make it a drag rectangle so

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.820 
you have to make it a drag rectangle so
here's<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.410> problem<00:05:27.620> we<00:05:27.950> have<00:05:28.130> this<00:05:28.280> edge

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
here's the problem we have this edge

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:36.580 
here's the problem we have this edge
because<00:05:31.660> in<00:05:32.660> our<00:05:33.020> fund<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:34.600> plane<00:05:35.600> 3d<00:05:35.930> is<00:05:36.110> also

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
because in our fund the plane 3d is also

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.080 
because in our fund the plane 3d is also
being<00:05:37.340> shown<00:05:38.680> we<00:05:39.680> can<00:05:39.710> fix<00:05:40.039> that<00:05:40.280> by<00:05:40.520> going<00:05:40.940> to

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
being shown we can fix that by going to

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.570 
being shown we can fix that by going to
alpha<00:05:41.389> I'm<00:05:42.110> going<00:05:42.470> to<00:05:42.620> dock<00:05:42.860> it<00:05:43.039> on<00:05:43.190> the<00:05:43.340> side

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
alpha I'm going to dock it on the side

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.760 
alpha I'm going to dock it on the side
and<00:05:43.910> order<00:05:44.630> under<00:05:44.900> modify<00:05:45.460> we<00:05:46.460> can<00:05:46.870> set<00:05:47.870> the

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
and order under modify we can set the

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.219 
and order under modify we can set the
min<00:05:48.979> value<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:51.500> mean<00:05:51.650> value<00:05:52.039> pushes<00:05:52.430> the<00:05:53.229> this

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
min value the mean value pushes the this

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.500 
min value the mean value pushes the this
outer<00:05:54.530> parts<00:05:55.479> inwards<00:05:56.479> so<00:05:56.750> we<00:05:57.470> can<00:05:57.919> see<00:05:58.510> with

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
outer parts inwards so we can see with

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.730 
outer parts inwards so we can see with
settings<00:06:01.570> 27<00:06:02.570> it's<00:06:02.810> already<00:06:03.320> too<00:06:03.560> much

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
settings 27 it's already too much

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.300 
settings 27 it's already too much
posting<00:06:04.490> so<00:06:04.850> we<00:06:05.060> can<00:06:05.979> go<00:06:06.979> maybe<00:06:07.250> to<00:06:07.550> 25<00:06:09.310> check

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
posting so we can go maybe to 25 check

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.130 
posting so we can go maybe to 25 check
it<00:06:10.490> out<00:06:11.320> 20<00:06:12.320> to<00:06:12.380> 25<00:06:14.050> for

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
it out 20 to 25 for

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.250 
it out 20 to 25 for
and<00:06:16.430> now<00:06:17.430> we<00:06:17.490> can<00:06:17.910> see<00:06:18.240> we<00:06:18.480> have<00:06:18.510> no<00:06:19.140> longer<00:06:19.440> any

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
and now we can see we have no longer any

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.560 
and now we can see we have no longer any
border<00:06:22.260> issues<00:06:24.170> we<00:06:25.170> can<00:06:25.350> refine<00:06:25.740> it<00:06:25.980> with

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
border issues we can refine it with

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.230 
border issues we can refine it with
radial<00:06:27.570> fade<00:06:27.870> just<00:06:28.170> to<00:06:28.740> make<00:06:28.890> sure

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
radial fade just to make sure

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:37.460 
radial fade just to make sure
three<00:06:30.240> is<00:06:30.390> enough<00:06:32.390> to<00:06:33.390> clear<00:06:33.660> any<00:06:33.960> any<00:06:36.470> borders

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
three is enough to clear any any borders

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:46.100 
three is enough to clear any any borders
that<00:06:37.710> we<00:06:37.920> might<00:06:38.640> missed<00:06:40.670> so<00:06:44.510> so<00:06:45.510> we<00:06:45.690> can<00:06:45.870> see

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
that we might missed so so we can see

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.460 
that we might missed so so we can see
here<00:06:46.500> we<00:06:47.490> still<00:06:47.700> had<00:06:48.000> a<00:06:48.510> little<00:06:48.960> bit<00:06:49.080> border

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
here we still had a little bit border

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.450 
here we still had a little bit border
which<00:06:49.680> we<00:06:50.030> refined<00:06:51.030> with<00:06:51.360> Radio<00:06:52.020> fate<00:06:52.400> now<00:06:53.400> we

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
which we refined with Radio fate now we

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.620 
which we refined with Radio fate now we
don't<00:06:53.670> have<00:06:53.820> it<00:06:54.000> anymore

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
don't have it anymore

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.150 
don't have it anymore
so<00:06:55.380> this<00:06:55.740> is<00:06:55.890> it<00:06:56.070> again<00:06:56.610> you<00:06:57.150> go<00:06:57.390> to<00:06:57.680> brush<00:06:58.680> and

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
so this is it again you go to brush and

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:08.920 
so this is it again you go to brush and
save<00:07:00.090> it<00:07:00.240> I<00:07:05.840> hope<00:07:06.840> you<00:07:07.020> learn<00:07:07.530> something<00:07:07.950> new

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
save it I hope you learn something new

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:15.290 
save it I hope you learn something new
and<00:07:11.030> till<00:07:12.030> next<00:07:12.240> time<00:07:12.480> bye
