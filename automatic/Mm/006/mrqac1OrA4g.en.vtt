however they are giving us a little
glimpse<00:00:17.850> at<00:00:18.060> some<00:00:18.119> new<00:00:18.869> features<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.590> may

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
glimpse at some new features that we may

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.550 
glimpse at some new features that we may
not<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.130> seen<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> last<00:00:20.760> screenshot<00:00:21.560> now

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
not have seen in the last screenshot now

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.870 
not have seen in the last screenshot now
at<00:00:22.710> first<00:00:22.949> glance<00:00:23.160> there<00:00:23.430> doesn't<00:00:23.730> actually

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
at first glance there doesn't actually

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029 
at first glance there doesn't actually
appear<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.390> be<00:00:24.480> any<00:00:24.630> new<00:00:24.779> features<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
appear to be any new features on the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.410 
appear to be any new features on the
tutorial<00:00:26.460> island<00:00:26.640> which<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:26.910> actually<00:00:27.180> what

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
tutorial island which is actually what

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.480 
tutorial island which is actually what
the<00:00:27.539> screenshot<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.109> up<00:00:28.320> however<00:00:29.070> if<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.310> look

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the screenshot is up however if we look

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.859 
the screenshot is up however if we look
closely<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.539> there<00:00:30.660> are<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
closely we can see that there are a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.440 
closely we can see that there are a
couple<00:00:31.320> new<00:00:31.650> things<00:00:31.700> now<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.759> first<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.420> that

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
couple new things now the first is that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.600 
couple new things now the first is that
on<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.750> building's<00:00:34.200> far<00:00:34.440> away<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> sandstone

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
on the building's far away the sandstone

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.459 
on the building's far away the sandstone
appears<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.510> different<00:00:37.050> texture<00:00:37.350> than

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
appears to have a different texture than

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.530 
appears to have a different texture than
anything<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.129> currently<00:00:38.370> seen<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.390> can

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
anything we have currently seen you can

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.209 
anything we have currently seen you can
see<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> closer<00:00:40.170> building<00:00:40.620> appears<00:00:40.980> to

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
see that the closer building appears to

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.069 
see that the closer building appears to
have<00:00:41.370> kind<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.030> textured<00:00:42.420> sandstone

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
have kind of a more textured sandstone

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.110 
have kind of a more textured sandstone
while<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> further<00:00:44.129> away<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.430> appears<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.030> be

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
while the further away it appears to be

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.150 
while the further away it appears to be
smoother<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.680> leads<00:00:46.860> me<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.129> believe

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
smoother so that leads me to believe

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.830 
smoother so that leads me to believe
that<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.640> may<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.850> seeing<00:00:48.120> chiseled<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that we may be seeing chiseled and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.260 
that we may be seeing chiseled and
smooth<00:00:49.170> sandstone<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> next<00:00:50.250> update<00:00:50.340> that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
smooth sandstone in the next update that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.000 
smooth sandstone in the next update that
you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.539> see<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.770> normal

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
you can see here I have just a normal

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.650 
you can see here I have just a normal
piece<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.340> sandstone<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.059> already<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.539> this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
piece of sandstone we already have this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.080 
piece of sandstone we already have this
in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> game<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.190> minecraft<00:00:56.699> PC

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
in the game and here on the minecraft PC

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.180 
in the game and here on the minecraft PC
they<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:58.050> also<00:00:58.230> excuse<00:00:58.829> me<00:00:58.949> already

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
they are so they also excuse me already

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.430 
they are so they also excuse me already
have<00:00:59.460> chiseled<00:00:59.820> sandstone<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.690> smooth

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
have chiseled sandstone and smooth

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.920 
have chiseled sandstone and smooth
sandstone<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> next<00:01:03.300> update<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.690> think

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
sandstone so in the next update I think

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.149 
sandstone so in the next update I think
that<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.589> seeing<00:01:04.830> something

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
that we are going to be seeing something

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.609 
that we are going to be seeing something
like<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.670> maybe<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:06.810> exact<00:01:07.200> textures

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
like this maybe not these exact textures

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.960 
like this maybe not these exact textures
with<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> creeper<00:01:08.430> phase<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.880> in

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
with you know the creeper phase here in

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
with you know the creeper phase here in
this<00:01:09.060> exact<00:01:09.420> smooth<00:01:09.659> because<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.170> looked<00:01:10.380> like

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
this exact smooth because it looked like

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.679 
this exact smooth because it looked like
in<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.159> actual<00:01:11.340> screenshot<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.119> had<00:01:12.330> kind<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
in the actual screenshot it had kind of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.910 
in the actual screenshot it had kind of
a<00:01:12.780> different<00:01:13.080> texture<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.500> chiseled

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
a different texture on the chiseled

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
a different texture on the chiseled
however<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.790> think<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.360> will<00:01:15.450> be

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
however I do think that we will be

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.480 
however I do think that we will be
seeing<00:01:15.810> some<00:01:16.140> variation<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.070> chiseled

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
seeing some variation of a chiseled

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.580 
seeing some variation of a chiseled
version<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.850> sandstone<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.960> variation<00:01:19.470> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
version of sandstone and a variation of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.460 
version of sandstone and a variation of
smooth<00:01:19.860> sandstone<00:01:20.479> okay<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.540> next<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
smooth sandstone okay so next up in the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.050 
smooth sandstone okay so next up in the
screenshot<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
screenshot you can actually see that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.480 
screenshot you can actually see that
there<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.270> actually<00:01:24.900> corner<00:01:25.259> stairs<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
there are actually corner stairs and a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.490 
there are actually corner stairs and a
corner<00:01:26.850> stair<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> made<00:01:27.509> by<00:01:27.659> simply<00:01:28.049> placing<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
corner stair is made by simply placing a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.960 
corner stair is made by simply placing a
stair<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.040> coming<00:01:29.280> off<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> corner

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
stair and then coming off to the corner

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270 
stair and then coming off to the corner
of<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.329> placing<00:01:31.110> another<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:31.860> simply

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
of it and placing another one or simply

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
of it and placing another one or simply
by<00:01:32.400> placing<00:01:32.750> stairs<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.020> different

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
by placing stairs in different

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170 
by placing stairs in different
directions<00:01:34.439> next<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.159> each<00:01:35.250> other<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
directions next to each other and you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.940 
directions next to each other and you
can<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.570> by<00:01:36.869> using<00:01:37.079> corner<00:01:37.530> stairs<00:01:37.799> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
can see that by using corner stairs you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.350 
can see that by using corner stairs you
can<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.189> create<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.610> very<00:01:38.880> cool<00:01:39.119> looking

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
can actually create a very cool looking

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
can actually create a very cool looking
roof<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.110> your<00:01:40.200> homes<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.250> will<00:01:41.369> make

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
roof for your homes and it will make

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.990 
roof for your homes and it will make
them<00:01:41.729> look<00:01:41.909> overall<00:01:42.329> less<00:01:42.750> crappy<00:01:43.079> now

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
them look overall less crappy now

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.889 
them look overall less crappy now
another<00:01:45.000> thing<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.570> actually<00:01:45.659> see

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
another thing that we can actually see

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.690 
another thing that we can actually see
in<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.049> screenshot<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.740> actually<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.549> there

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
appeared to be I'm not entirely sure but

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.889 
appeared to be I'm not entirely sure but
there<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.430> appear<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.180> different<00:01:51.600> color

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899

torches<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:53.939> right<00:01:54.240> here

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
torches and you can see that right here

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.569 
torches and you can see that right here
that<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.710> appears<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.219> maybe<00:01:56.490> a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.560 
xbox 360 slightly different than the pc
version<00:02:05.040> possibly<00:02:05.880> make<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.149> even<00:02:06.299> better

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
version possibly make it even better

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.839 
version possibly make it even better
than<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.899> pc<00:02:07.290> version<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.770> maybe<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.640> is

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
than the pc version and maybe this is

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.660 
than the pc version and maybe this is
their<00:02:09.179> first<00:02:09.239> step<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.989> doing<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.430> now<00:02:11.430> on

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
their first step in doing that now on

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.130 
their first step in doing that now on
the<00:02:11.819> pc<00:02:12.150> version<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.629> clearly<00:02:12.870> see<00:02:12.989> that

the pc version you can clearly see that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.910 
the pc version you can clearly see that
there<00:02:13.410> are

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
there are

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.440 
there are
not<00:02:14.010> actually<00:02:14.490> any<00:02:14.670> different<00:02:15.090> kinds<00:02:15.360> of

standard torch that is you know made of

the normal wood and doesn't really do

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.479 
the normal wood and doesn't really do
anything<00:02:21.450> special<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.110> maybe<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.130> 4j

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
anything special so maybe this is 4j

from solely pc updates now the last very
notable<00:02:28.560> thing<00:02:28.739> that<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.670> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
notable thing that we can see in the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.910 
notable thing that we can see in the
screenshot<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.989> there<00:02:31.140> are<00:02:31.170> also<00:02:31.410> top

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
screenshot is that there are also top

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.760 
screenshot is that there are also top
slabs<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.550> bottom<00:02:32.880> slabs<00:02:33.150> now<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> top<00:02:34.319> slab<00:02:34.620> is

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
slabs and bottom slabs now a top slab is

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.650 
slabs and bottom slabs now a top slab is
made<00:02:34.950> simply<00:02:35.280> by<00:02:35.400> clicking<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> top<00:02:36.209> fifty

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
made simply by clicking on the top fifty

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.229 
made simply by clicking on the top fifty
percent<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.530> block<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.069> now<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.760> can

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
percent of a block and now you can

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.570 
percent of a block and now you can
effectively<00:02:39.720> make<00:02:40.110> staircases<00:02:40.800> out<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.310> slabs

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
effectively make staircases out of slabs

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.890 
effectively make staircases out of slabs
which<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.940> something<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.269> could<00:02:42.510> never<00:02:42.540> do

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
which is something you could never do

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.030 
which is something you could never do
before<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.170> said<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.800> previous
