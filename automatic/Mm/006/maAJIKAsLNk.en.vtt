00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.200
 and when I was 28 I was a trampoline 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:16.099
 elastic I was training every day with 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.920
 a mind of 22 hours two and a half hours three 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.529
 years ago during a workout at the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.739
 return of the Christmas holidays are 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.970
 fell into a jump and got hurt 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:31.759
 after that after various hospitals or starts 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.070
 I have decided to continue doing 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.000
 sport and I chose to vote 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.330
 my life changed after the accident 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.080
 but for me it was like me 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.210
 restart 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.890
 it was like a natural thing is not 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.930
 not even a restart 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.730
 the thing has changed enough you have to 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.730
 facing it is not crying 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.390
 least never that I hurt myself on 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.760
 trampoline stay calm I have not done 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.539
 badly doing something I liked and 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:14.070
 not hurt and then say no I can't 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:19.530
 do the most trampoline I am strongly 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:23.550
 convinced of this thing she didn't want us 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.970
 sing is the list I want to note all 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.970

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:10.140
