00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.829
 very good to all of us today we are going to see a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.480
 very very special movement 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.969
 and I say special because there had to be 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.680
 been published in harmony in 2011 but 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.449
 in the end I did not publish it the movement is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.960
 a variation of a classic that is called 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.839
 knits murphy that is more or less like that and the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.610
 variation is a variation of mine adapted 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.559
 to do an aerial is a movement 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.010
 totally original of mine and it looks more or 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.010
 less so 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.560
 as a prior note say first 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.119
 which is a movement that has to be 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.820
 do after doing a sequence of 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.040
 cuts swing the cut sign what is explained 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.500
 ok but you're going to explain it in a moment 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.600
 it's very very simple to take the deck 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.210
 in this way with the right middle finger 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.220
 here with your thumb here and with the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.159
 index finger that will be the one that makes the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.500
 cuts are worth then put here the 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.190
 index finger and pivots the deck in the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.220
 thumb of the left hand picks up 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.590
 is cutting, you can do it another 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.210
 once for the times you want but 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.580
 leave them the number of letters 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.440
 enough to make the gv tea in the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.110
 right hand a good amount of 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.420
 letters is usually between a quarter of the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.220
 shuffles and half maybe a little more 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.229
 half would also be fine from the 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.420
 moment of gv what is based is on the 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.860
 force exerted by the middle fingers and 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.260
 thumb in it 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.480
 on the right side of this package 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.960
 letters by not exerting much force 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.760
 package is left as loose in this way 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.430
 does this movement 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.590
 we will use this movement to 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.810
 make the rotation the axis of rotation will be 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.440
 therefore the imaginary line that 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.990
 would join this point with this vale then 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.760
 the movement would be like this 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.160
 as you can see, it's a very moving 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.250
 interesting because as I say it is done 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.680
 after a swing cut we cut 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.270
 we cut and now for example I already have the 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.710
 number of cards needed to be able 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.950
 do it with this hand and in the way that 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.690
 he executed it I am passing this this arm 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.090
 below this vale 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.510
 in this way in the left hand will be 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.250
 the one that picks up the packet like this I'm going to 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.720
 Repeat to leave a cleaner 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:50.340
 cut swing or other cut up 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.890
 and you gv as you see this hand lang the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.870
 shuffle and this hand picks it up as you know 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.520
 if you can read when I publish the air 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.640
 one already says that the aerial movements 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.530
 are my favorite tv is one of my 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.660
 favorites or because it allows you to close a 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.610
 sequence of cuts in a very 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.800
 very elegant while 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.030
 spectacular and unexpected because if 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.590
 you want let's see a few 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.090
 more details in view above the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.810
 shoulder and then I would go into detail 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.810
 Some curiosities 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
 Y 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.160
 well as I say the movement is a 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.690
 movement of my favorites and as I say 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.220
 had I been published in harmony 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.739
 what happens that in the end I decided not to 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.269
 publish it because there have been many 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.980
 modifications of this movement and 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.560
 I really did not know if it was original to me or 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.820
 I still do not know but what I do know 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.600
 sure it is that I arrived by my 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.520
 own account 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.050
 to this movement plus I think that 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.610
 can be very useful for you 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.960
 cutting sequences it is good to add that 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.970
 this movement what published for the first 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.340
 once in your periods but publish it 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.380
 using a small variant that does not 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.780
 I'm going to comment on this video because 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.160
 I just want to talk about the movement 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.979
 tv3 the variant I will leave you so that the 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.260
 link is to produce a letter using 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.700
 the global fabric in the letter is just 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.440
 in the middle of the deck that I do that 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.700
 up is a very interesting variant 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.950
 that is, what can be done with this 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.220
 movement I will not detail the name 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.620
 because weaving of gvt weaves then I have to 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.180
 knitting murphy is like a little tribute 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.919
 to the original movement that is the weaving 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.400
 murphy the ice of v well everything is very 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.740
 simple 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.210
 means the university barcelona takes 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.370
 to the university barcelona and between 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.479
 so many hours of study 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.729
 during which the 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.180
 many movements one of those that 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.800
 it happened to me 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.960
 so that's why I put this name 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.490
 leave to keep me that many of the 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.960
 movements that those who see in the head 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.310
 I came when I was studying in 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.690
 epochs of which I was studying and 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.430
 you have the deck in your hand you can 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.690
 a movement really appears so 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.699
 well that's all I hope you have 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.470
 liked move practice it and we 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.470
 we see in the next video see you later
