00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.770
 let us mabe the cow together 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.900
 I'll show you how it's really done 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.480
 simple let's start from the pasta of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.480
 white sugar love we give you the 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.780
 we see the shape of a species of cone 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.590
 let's make four choirs in smaller ones 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.989
 our legs will be more or less like this 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.680
 a little more squashed at the tip and more 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.680
 wide at high 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.870
 let's take the head 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.670
 it too must be enough 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:09.979
 tapered a little more squashed by a 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:11.540
 side a little wider here alessandra ad 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:21.770
 add the various details 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:24.259
 let's start right from the muzzle we go to 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.850
 do in c but two holes with a tool 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.759
 precisely or simply with the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.060
 lower stem of the brush 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.710
 these will be our nostrils with a 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.530
 engraving tool we go to make the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.810
 mouth from left to right 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.050
 we are going to open slightly in this 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.050
 way 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.640
 with the remaining pink part we go to 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.350
 finish our legs this way 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.350
 simply by applying diskettes 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:17.450
 we engrave we take the pasta of 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.890
 white sugar and queue with 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.049
 the sugar paste still white 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.910
 let's make the eyes I proceed by color 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.680
 because later we will use in black and this yes 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.209
 your hands will be very dirty to make 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.459
 ears we make two very small ones 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.069
 balls with a very small continuous of 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.930
 pink in the center then first white and then 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.200
 at the center we put a very small one 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.290
 percentage of rose in this way that 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.510
 crush and let's insert on the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.030
 head of the cow and now if we go to 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.730
 we amuse ourselves with black spots 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.040
 our most asymmetrical cow are and more 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.650
 the cow will therefore be nice 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.959
 just take a small black page 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.260
 from crush we apply it where you 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.260
 who loves 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.730
 with a black ball we go to make the 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.680
 tail then we turn and we crush 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.810
 one end so with a mixture of one 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.209
 small knife with a pair of scissors we go to 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.790
 affect what may be i 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.930
 hair and let's apply to the end 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.099
 of our tail we finally go to 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:36.120
 put the pupils inside the 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:38.819
 excellent eyes still with patience 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.819
 because I want to give my cow a nice one 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.769
 little flower between paws members the cow that 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.110
 bring the flowers and ready for 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.579
 whatever you write I answer and 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.579
 see you next time
