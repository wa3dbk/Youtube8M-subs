I<00:00:37.050> thought<00:00:37.320> about<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.760> as<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.059> current<00:00:39.600> macbook

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I thought about it as a current macbook

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.760 
I thought about it as a current macbook
pro<00:00:40.649> owner<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.250> was<00:00:41.820> hoping<00:00:42.200> that<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.469> ipad

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
pro owner I was hoping that the ipad

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.580 
pro owner I was hoping that the ipad
would<00:00:44.309> deliver<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.820> lot<00:00:45.030> more<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.200> said

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
would deliver a lot more but that said

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.180 
would deliver a lot more but that said
it<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.670> give<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.300> viable<00:00:49.050> alternative<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
it can give a viable alternative to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.450 
it can give a viable alternative to
perhaps<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.300> netbook<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> laptop<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:53.250> most

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
perhaps a netbook or a laptop for most

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.080 
perhaps a netbook or a laptop for most

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
obviously more applications designed

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.240 
obviously more applications designed
just<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.110> device<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.710> i<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
just for the device so i think it's a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.590 
just for the device so i think it's a
really<00:01:50.579> really<00:01:51.420> good<00:01:51.689> choice<00:01:53.180> now<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
really really good choice now on to

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.240 
really really good choice now on to
pricing<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> lot<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.829> people<00:01:55.920> were

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
thinking this would come in at just

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.709 
thinking this would come in at just
under<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.990> thousand<00:01:58.500> dollars<00:01:58.909> well<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.450> big

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.220 
little bit of surfing foot for a whole
month<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:24.230> for<00:03:25.130> me<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.970> mifi<00:03:26.480> could<00:03:26.870> be<00:03:27.079> the

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
month so for me the mifi could be the

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.440 
month so for me the mifi could be the
answer<00:03:27.380> but<00:03:27.860> then<00:03:28.519> i<00:03:28.760> read<00:03:29.390> some<00:03:29.860> slight<00:03:30.860> lean

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
answer but then i read some slight lean

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.500 
answer but then i read some slight lean
slightly<00:03:32.500> disappointing<00:03:33.519> news<00:03:34.519> and<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.329> is

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
slightly disappointing news and that is

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.490 
slightly disappointing news and that is
that<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.049> Wi-Fi<00:03:37.040> version<00:03:37.180> of<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:39.079> ipad

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
that the Wi-Fi version of the ipad

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.810 
that the Wi-Fi version of the ipad
doesn't<00:03:39.799> have<00:03:40.239> built-in<00:03:41.239> gps<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:42.980> if<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.579> went

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
doesn't have built-in gps so if you went

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.910 
doesn't have built-in gps so if you went
the<00:03:44.090> Wi-Fi<00:03:45.079> ipad<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:46.239> mifi<00:03:47.239> route<00:03:47.570> then<00:03:48.440> you

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
the Wi-Fi ipad and mifi route then you

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.009 
the Wi-Fi ipad and mifi route then you
would<00:03:49.130> only<00:03:49.489> be<00:03:49.850> able<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.359> have<00:03:50.570> your<00:03:50.780> location

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
would only be able to have your location

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.710 
would only be able to have your location
tracked<00:03:51.829> via<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.700> Wi-Fi<00:03:52.940> train<00:03:53.540> get

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
tracked via the Wi-Fi train get

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.020 
tracked via the Wi-Fi train get

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
was really hoping for was when this iPad

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.800 
was really hoping for was when this iPad
was<00:05:27.949> docked<00:05:28.280> I<00:05:28.550> was<00:05:28.669> hoping<00:05:29.090> it<00:05:29.360> would<00:05:29.539> be<00:05:29.720> able

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
was docked I was hoping it would be able

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.240 
was docked I was hoping it would be able
to<00:05:30.169> dock<00:05:30.800> in<00:05:31.070> a<00:05:31.370> landscape<00:05:32.300> format<00:05:32.990> it<00:05:33.889> seems

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
to dock in a landscape format it seems

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.490 
to dock in a landscape format it seems
it's<00:05:34.639> only<00:05:35.000> cut<00:05:35.270> one<00:05:35.479> 30-pin<00:05:36.260> dock<00:05:36.289> connector

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
it's only cut one 30-pin dock connector

it's only cut one 30-pin dock connector
