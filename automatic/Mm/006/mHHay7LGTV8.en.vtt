00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.279
 video on the channel 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.990
 today I wanted to give you general notions 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.750
 on what is the breeding of 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.500
 cockroaches cockroaches belong together 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.849
 the actor has with almost 4 thousand species are 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.190
 known throughout the world with the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.230
 term cockroaches and are known 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.109
 because they have the habit of settling 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.359
 in human houses only one per 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.510
 one hundred of these 4 thousand species is however one 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.130
 Weed species are loving insects 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.840
 of very hot temperatures 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.880
 in fact, they find this in homes 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.030
 feature and also find a lot 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.440
 food is in seven with an incomplete cycle 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.140
 in fact they do not have a stage 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.989
 larval there are cockroaches they possess 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.000
 there are others instead of none 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.430
 possess put in some species like 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.320
 in doubtful plastic the female this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.629
 here it only has a pair of wings 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 vestiges there while the male like 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.250
 we can see it has long lines 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.199
 wings that uses a few to glide 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.320
 species of cockroaches possess capable wings 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.010
 to make them fly but mainly 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.479
 they all speak finished this short 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.220
 introduction now they give you 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.580
 general information on how to breed 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.380
 in captivity and keep the best 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.360
 I own four species 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.210
 are the cranes does dorino portentosa that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.409
 you have already seen in the previous video 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.409
 blog eros skulls fair cockroach side 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 and b the doubtful psyche 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.730
 for the most common species one can 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.890
 use an if instead empty box without 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.700
 bottom substrate with simple ones 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.700
 egg cartons to be used for 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.560
 provide shelter from our cockroaches like 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.620
 Depending on what we can insert 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.900
 Saucers like this where to put in 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.660
 one of the wet food and in another of the 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.910
 dry food other options are in series 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.200
 wet food here and in series of food 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.270
 dry without saucer or do not insert 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.479
 saucers and even dry and wet mix 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.399
 if we are going to meet for sure buffet 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.140
 some especially recommend for 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.540
 the dubious plastic of serino a 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.630
 substrate composed of nutrients 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.270
 like bran croquettes for the dog for 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.520
 the cat or in any case everything is known about food 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.070
 dry I personally find it useless 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.660
 because if the tank will have little 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.209
 reaction will create moisture inside 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.250
 of the tank and substrate will tend to 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.350
 moldy so decided to abolish 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.120
 any type of substrate for the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.900
 dubious practice as well as for the fight 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.570
 side box setups for cockroaches 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.730
 let's say this is standard here and setup 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.680
 however some species are standard like the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.390
 big turkey in portentous as mentioned 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.260
 in the other video it is able to scale 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.760
 smooth walls 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.800
 therefore we should find some 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.510
 system to prevent cockroaches 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.110
 reach the lid and in some 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.790
 way out of the holes from the reaction 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.220
 other species instead are arboreal or 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.519
 arboreal seeds and therefore will need 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.230
 of a simply raised area 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.330
 we can insert more cartons of eggs 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.050
 one above the other in order to create one 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.450
 raised area 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.310
 in the case of brave rus renault scarani 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.010
 still but almost all of them 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.739
 bloggers including and giant os or 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.810
 other species have linear than they have 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.880
 fossari habit therefore for this 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.140
 species I use a substrate the 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.580
 substrate was initially composed 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.680
 from peat 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.140
 if on the other hand it peats from very very dry 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.140
 in order to avoid any problems 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.420
 mold or something 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.220
 in fact the lines to me of like this 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.550
 I will guide you 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.370
 now they will pass 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.940
 here it is they will spend most of it 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.040
 some time under the substrate will succeed 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.560
 just to eat sometimes not 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.240
 they can't even eat because of 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.020
 under substrate they manage to take the 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.300
 food and brought under a rule that 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.600
 applies to almost all cockroaches and that if 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.660
 the temperature will be kept high on 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.700
 their development will be very fast and even 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.000
 reproduction in case of temperatures 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.840
 too low instead we will have a person arrested 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.140
 of reproduction or a reduction 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.609
 some growth speeds 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.890
 species of cockroaches require moisture 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.280
 higher than others in species like 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.690
 the plastic side is doubtful 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.830
 the humidity may not even be kept 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.980
 under control 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.140
 in fact there are serious meet of 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.480
 very dry humidity in other species 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.070
 instead a big give me will be required 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.450
 quite high 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.400
 this can be achieved or entered 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.800
 damp substrate however as we have said 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.770
 before it can cause mold 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.720
 or the lid keep it closed but 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.640
 with few out of direction 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.030
 in this way the military will come more 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.360
 constant in the order blatto goddess exist 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.120
 two ways to give birth to trials 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.560
 one method is the free man method while 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.360
 the other is the first oviparous method 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.900
 method I came to describe and the 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.390
 method or do you want the female more italo 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.310
 will produce a display case containing eggs 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.800
 which will hold inside the abdomen for 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.690
 the whole cycle of development eggs to 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.700
 moment of hatching will hatch 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.440
 inside the abdomen of the female e 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.470
 then they will be expelled small 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.090
 directly live the second method 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.249
 instead it is the free one 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.199
 in fact the female 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:37.519
 they will produce reliquary containing eggs 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:39.529
 this case will be left alone let's say 

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:41.509
 the female will not take care of it 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.579
 at the time of hatching at the moment 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.829
 of this hatching this optic that 

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:49.129
 practically it is practically a case 

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:51.199
 containing the eggs will open and come out 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.449
 linear of this is a blatter case 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.399
 we arrived at the end of 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.199
 also this video in this video is 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:58.819
 obvious given a very much smattering 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.589
 general about what the breeding of the 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.929
 various milk information 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:05.989
 very simple very much impact 

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:07.729
 very fast i hope i enjoyed it hopefully 

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:09.709
 that you continue to support me at
