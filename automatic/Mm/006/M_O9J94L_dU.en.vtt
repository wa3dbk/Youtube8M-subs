00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
hey YouTube riding over here today I'm

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.200 
hey YouTube riding over here today I'm
going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> be<00:00:11.340> playing<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.610> little<00:00:11.639> different

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
going to be playing a little different

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.290 
going to be playing a little different
I'm<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:15.320> test<00:00:16.320> at<00:00:16.650> how<00:00:16.920> fast<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.180> can

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
I'm going to do a test at how fast I can

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.800 
I'm going to do a test at how fast I can
get<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.779> thing<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.550> 100<00:00:21.240> kilometres<00:00:21.689> an

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
get this thing up to 100 kilometres an

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.029 
get this thing up to 100 kilometres an
hour<00:00:21.930> or<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:24.210> basically<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.869> zero<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> 60<00:00:25.740> miles

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
hour or so basically a zero to 60 miles

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.849 
hour or so basically a zero to 60 miles
per<00:00:26.189> hour<00:00:26.310> test<00:00:26.730> over<00:00:26.970> there<00:00:27.180> zero<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.859> 100

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
per hour test over there zero to 100

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.120 
per hour test over there zero to 100
kilometres<00:00:29.400> per<00:00:29.429> hour<00:00:29.609> test<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:31.230> ideally

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
kilometres per hour test I think ideally

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.459 
kilometres per hour test I think ideally
if<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.390> my<00:00:34.190> 5.6<00:00:35.190> seconds<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
if I can do it in my 5.6 seconds but I

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.330 
if I can do it in my 5.6 seconds but I
am<00:00:38.149> pretty<00:00:39.149> sure<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.379> lot

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
am pretty sure I'm going to be a lot

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.569 
am pretty sure I'm going to be a lot
slower<00:00:41.790> or<00:00:42.300> quite<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> bit<00:00:42.870> slower<00:00:43.050> than<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
slower or quite a bit slower than that

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.990 
slower or quite a bit slower than that
because<00:00:44.579> I'm<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.050> professional<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.460> yeah

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
because I'm not a professional but yeah

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.610 
because I'm not a professional but yeah

I'm pulled over on the highway and it's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
I'm pulled over on the highway and it's
really<00:00:54.870> late<00:00:55.079> at<00:00:55.230> night<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.739> was<00:00:55.829> barely

thought out before we're good that's one
yeah<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.540> beauty<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.810> doing<00:01:52.900> this<00:01:53.170> late<00:01:53.380> at

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
yeah the beauty of doing this late at

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500 
yeah the beauty of doing this late at
night<00:01:53.530> is<00:01:53.860> that<00:01:54.040> there's<00:01:54.280> not<00:01:54.550> many<00:01:54.850> cars<00:01:55.180> out

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
night is that there's not many cars out

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.990 
night is that there's not many cars out
and<00:01:55.810> it's<00:01:56.020> not<00:01:56.200> really<00:01:56.860> illegal<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.700> do<00:01:57.820> this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
and it's not really illegal to do this

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.400 
and it's not really illegal to do this
at<00:01:58.180> all<00:01:58.210> because<00:01:58.540> I'm<00:01:58.720> just<00:01:58.810> going<00:01:59.020> over<00:01:59.230> on

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
at all because I'm just going over on

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.430 
at all because I'm just going over on
the<00:01:59.500> side<00:01:59.680> which<00:01:59.980> is<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.540> completely<00:02:01.540> legal<00:02:01.720> so

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
the side which is a completely legal so

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.960 
the side which is a completely legal so
I'm<00:02:02.530> not<00:02:02.620> sure<00:02:02.680> how<00:02:02.950> well<00:02:03.190> that<00:02:03.430> was<00:02:03.640> but<00:02:03.940> I

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
I'm not sure how well that was but I

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.230 
I'm not sure how well that was but I
think<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:04.420> feel<00:02:05.380> like<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.590> start<00:02:05.860> off<00:02:06.240> slow

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
think I feel like I start off slow

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.780 
think I feel like I start off slow
another<00:02:08.080> question<00:02:08.530> too<00:02:08.770> late<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.369> think<00:02:09.430> I

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:28.560 
don't know we'll see imma try again
right<00:02:11.110> now<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:26.340> don't<00:02:27.340> know<00:02:27.430> question<00:02:28.060> how<00:02:28.390> well

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
whenever I get the best of the three

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.490 
whenever I get the best of the three
three<00:02:46.180> tries<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.690> probably<00:02:46.990> going<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.200> be<00:02:47.260> what

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
three tries is probably going to be what

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.340 
three tries is probably going to be what
it<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.510> there's<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:49.660> more<00:02:49.780> cars<00:02:50.050> moving
