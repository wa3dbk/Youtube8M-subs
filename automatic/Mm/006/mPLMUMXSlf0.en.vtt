 hello hello beautiful alessandro is the typical 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.500
 boy of today who nevertheless does not give it to 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.170
 see but is protective of 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.979
 but some sisters are alive 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.709
 to live 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.759

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:06.289
 hermetic alessandro and not his things if 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:09.170

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.099

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.569
 studying English in London he goes to school 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.110
 indeed the sandro is coming well 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.110
 they are few 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:28.310
 we are sure there is no alessandro in the house 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:33.650
 certainly for PC but for us when 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:38.600
 most holy, the least busy TV we can 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.940
 use it also with us but we miss it a lot 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:47.840
 in fact sometimes we go with a video clip with 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:53.510
 he to greet us what brings me what 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:56.109

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.800

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.400
 detached the sisters a lot we say 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.400

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.260

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.080
 we are a little too quiet 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.950
 too calm should come a little 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.990
