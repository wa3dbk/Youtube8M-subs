00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.840
 in one of the videos in which I showed 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.639
 how can you decide so 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.330
 what operating system puts on 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.190
 your computer 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.800
 grow 2 bit lose four 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.050
 bit I showed how you can 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.050
 determine whether the processor understands 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.699
 installed and your computer 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.679
 64-bit commands I used 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.470
 standard command line using 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.140
 set commands brought here such a list 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.359
 your computer settings and said 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.700
 what about processor architecture 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.280
 this parameter can be defined 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.469
 Does the processor accept 64-bit 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.870
 commands or not but I allowed some 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.210
 inaccuracy the fact is that he is at the time 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.570
 I did not know the following video recording 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.730
 fact is already quite a long time 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.760
 even processors that have 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.010
 x86 architecture 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.350
 can understand 64-bit commands 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.260
 so when choosing the operating option 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.199
 systems we need to be based not on 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.650
 processor architecture it is what 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.870
 types of commands or instructions he can 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.510
 understand and understand this to us with you 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.580
 with help the program helps you 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.930
 we installed in order to 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.180
 determine what equipment 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.830
 installed in our computer but except 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.410
 this program gives us 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.420
 enough complete information in general about 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.820
 all computer device including 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.920
 about the central processor if we are with you 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.870
 Go to the central processing unit is 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.630
 here you and I will be interested here 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.910
 This is a line of instructions in this. 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.400
 The building lists all the instructions for 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.600
 There are all commands that understands this 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.910
 processor type 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.700
 if we rewind a little now 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:47.140
 this line is here in this line 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.970
 there is here point intel 64 digit 64 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.890
 we are told in principle that 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.610
 this processor 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.170
 understands 64-bit instructions and 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.710
 accordingly, in principle, this 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.330
 computer 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.520
 I can install 64-bit 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.280
 operating system because 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.440
 the processor is quite normal to deal with 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.720
 those teams that this operating 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.700
 the system will give him but you see 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.650
 that for example here the instructions in this 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.600
 There is a lot of window and in your case 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.040
 they may differ slightly from 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.019
 what I have 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.180
 and what is the instruction to us unequivocally 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.640
 will indicate that the processor you understand from 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.609
 four bit command now you see 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.159
 on the screen is a list of those instructions and although 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.469
 if one of them were listed in 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.659
 list you get with 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:33.069
 spikes program then this will mean 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.349
 what is this processor 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.939
 quite normal 64 bit operation 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.030
 teams and you can safely 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.269
 install 6 4 bit system on your 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.269
 computer
