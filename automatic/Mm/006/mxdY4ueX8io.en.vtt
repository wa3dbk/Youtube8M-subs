00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.820
 Family chat Katia Saalfrank 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.710
 Today with a letter I get 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.490
 Amazing in the internet age 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.369
 that is that too, but it does not exist 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.060
 also reach letters and writes 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.910
 my daughter marianne six years 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.890
 is in first grade and comes each one 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.500
 at night regularly in our bed 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.699
 that annoys me because I wake up and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.090
 I do not fall asleep so fast 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.030
 can 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.100
 is that normal that children in the age 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.770
 come and how can I take care of that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.640
 that she stays in her bed many 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.360
 greetings So yes, this might follow 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.600
 I only times is important to me 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.780
 understand that sleep of course separation 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.410
 that means the children have to 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.300
 alone can do it in the night 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.039
 takes a little time and does not work 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.840
 from one day to the next, if you give me now 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.809
 sitting opposite consciously marjan would 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.850
 I ask again, how is it? 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.640
 when is she in her own 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.720
 bed gone those are all things that 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.270
 which one is first then one more time 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.180
 then it can be considered that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.130
 second is to sleep through is one 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 giant theme again and again at parents 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.970
 sleep important too there again 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.680
 to make it clear that you are asleep 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.570
 not us adults 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.009
 do not sleep by we turn up 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.330
 the other side will wake up for a moment 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.759
 can fall asleep very quickly 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.159
 because we have the security in us 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.290
 in there because it does not matter ultimately and 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.520
 nothing was uncertain 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.380
 you look at you sometimes have 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.850
 we also sleep disorders why is this 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.070
 I do not know the partner snores 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.320
 or we'll be startled somehow 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.570
 from the sleep phase actually into one 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.399
 growing phase then come into a stream 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.229
 phase out of which we do not work anymore 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.079
 can cancel that is with the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.659
 children out and right now 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.070
 They feel like yearning for us 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.780
 who want themselves alone 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.450
 reinsure is the mum is still there 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.369
 the daddy still there that's it 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.409
 first relatively normal 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.979
 Now it would be important to me 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.899
 once more questioned 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.899
 yes what is in the life of 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.970
 my daughter 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.959
 So why is that right now 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.730
 maybe she's in school 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.840
 just arrived at this 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.730
 ask again a little security 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.760
 at night , yes, and the last thing 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.140
 I can think of it maybe that's it 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.700
 that you talk about it again 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.349
 really that makes you exhausting and 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.569
 maybe find a solution where can 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.030
 you get your security here what 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.430
 maybe she needs it completely 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.109
 unproblematic the possibility that they 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.810
 I do not know a mattress for 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:43.180
 Example under the bed puts under yours 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.340
 what they then pull themselves out 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.560
 Can with bedding and where they are then 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.409
 can lay on it and so that as possible 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.030
 little riot arises and you too 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.700
 do not wake up at this point so 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.500
 I think it's important that you as 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.970
 Parents give her the feeling she is 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.709
 welcome and she is allowed herself 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.329
 go back to her bed or bring her 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.340
 depending on what's good for you 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.159
 because children want to work independently 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.659
 Actually you will want to 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.889
 be great at this point and knows 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.319
 your room, too, so maybe 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.769
 post them to ask again what you 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.180
 need is and they help with 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.169
 the security that she needs now 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.810
 to obtain these too 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:22.949
 So thank you very much for the question 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.949
 see you next time
