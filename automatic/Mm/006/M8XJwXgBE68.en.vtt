00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
basically not recreations they're like

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.910 
basically not recreations they're like
copies<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.970> a<00:01:03.270> few<00:01:03.750> slight<00:01:03.989> changes<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
copies with a few slight changes of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.590

other<00:01:05.100> horror<00:01:05.339> films<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.450> for

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
other horror films in there so for

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.150 
other horror films in there so for
example<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.200> pretty<00:01:07.470> much<00:01:07.680> meant<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> be

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
example this is pretty much meant to be

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.639 
example this is pretty much meant to be
their<00:01:08.820> version<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.180> pinhead<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.780> think<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.380> it's

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
their version of pinhead I think so it's

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.410 
their version of pinhead I think so it's
kind<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.160> center<00:01:11.430> by<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.640> really<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.270> he's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
kind of a center by it really so he's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.160 
kind of a center by it really so he's
got<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> help<00:01:12.750> center<00:01:13.020> by<00:01:13.140> five<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> yeah<00:01:16.020> he

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
got a help center by five and so yeah he

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.359 
got a help center by five and so yeah he
just<00:01:16.350> he's<00:01:16.440> not<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.740> film<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.070> very<00:01:17.220> much

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
just he's not in the film for very much

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.400 
just he's not in the film for very much
but<00:01:17.640> he's<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.869> awesome<00:01:18.869> character<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.290> has<00:01:19.380> a

to<00:02:17.400> apply<00:02:17.840> liquid<00:02:18.840> latex<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> sponge<00:02:19.860> all

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
to apply liquid latex with a sponge all

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.820 
to apply liquid latex with a sponge all
over<00:02:20.880> my<00:02:21.060> face<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:22.230> when<00:02:22.410> it's<00:02:22.530> dry

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
over my face just so then when it's dry

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.550 
over my face just so then when it's dry
the<00:02:23.400> spirit<00:02:24.270> gum<00:02:24.390> will<00:02:24.540> stick<00:02:24.900> really<00:02:25.260> nicely

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.290 
the spirit gum will stick really nicely
that's<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.310> idea<00:02:26.610> because<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.849> tends<00:02:27.180> to

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
that's the idea because it tends to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.550 
that's the idea because it tends to
stick<00:02:27.420> better<00:02:27.630> than<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.050> natural<00:02:28.410> skin

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
stick better than just a natural skin

stick better than just a natural skin

made<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.590> look<00:03:40.709> make<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.100> look<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.250> lot<00:03:41.430> more

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
made it look make it look a lot more

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.699 
made it look make it look a lot more
grey<00:03:41.850> but<00:03:42.150> also<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:43.020> it<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.200> look<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.350> bit<00:03:43.470> dirty

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
grey but also on it to look a bit dirty

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.710 
grey but also on it to look a bit dirty
so<00:03:44.459> that's<00:03:44.790> why<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.000> didn't<00:03:45.240> mix<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:45.570> in<00:03:45.630> with

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
so that's why I didn't mix it in with

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.210 
so that's why I didn't mix it in with
the<00:03:45.780> color<00:03:46.080> because<00:03:46.440> otherwise<00:03:46.770> it'd<00:03:47.070> be<00:03:47.190> a

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
the color because otherwise it'd be a

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.860 
the color because otherwise it'd be a
uniform<00:03:47.670> grey<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.090> want<00:03:48.240> it<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.360> be<00:03:48.480> fairly

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
uniform grey and I want it to be fairly

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.110 
uniform grey and I want it to be fairly
darker<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.350> some<00:03:49.560> areas<00:03:49.800> but<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.220> idea<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.580> do

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
darker in some areas but the idea is do

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.790 
darker in some areas but the idea is do
it<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.270> well-ventilated<00:03:51.450> area<00:03:52.230> spray<00:03:52.620> a

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
it in a well-ventilated area spray a

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.890 
it in a well-ventilated area spray a
very<00:03:53.250> far<00:03:53.550> distance<00:03:53.580> really<00:03:54.450> far<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.870> don't

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
very far distance really far you don't

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.240 
very far distance really far you don't
want<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.260> be<00:03:55.320> just<00:03:55.470> like<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> huge<00:03:55.860> blob<00:03:56.130> of

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
want it to be just like a huge blob of

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.130 
want it to be just like a huge blob of
black<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:57.000> just<00:03:57.090> want<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.300> want<00:03:57.810> go<00:03:57.900> once

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
black and you just want to want go once

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.810 
black and you just want to want go once
or<00:03:58.290> twice<00:03:58.500> over<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.040> face<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.489> neck<00:03:59.520> just

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
or twice over the face and the neck just

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.790 
or twice over the face and the neck just
to<00:03:59.970> has<00:04:00.420> said<00:04:00.810> dial<00:04:01.050> it<00:04:01.170> up

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.140 

so<00:04:04.800> then<00:04:05.010> I'm<00:04:05.070> going<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.220> take<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.520> bruise<00:04:05.880> will

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
so then I'm going to take a bruise will

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.780 
so then I'm going to take a bruise will
and<00:04:06.390> this<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.380> by<00:04:07.590> mehron<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.460> believe

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
and this is this is by mehron I believe

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.010 
and this is this is by mehron I believe
but<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.120> can<00:04:09.240> get<00:04:09.330> them<00:04:09.420> from<00:04:09.540> Ben<00:04:09.750> Nye<00:04:09.780> and

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
but you can get them from Ben Nye and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.320 
but you can get them from Ben Nye and
Crowell<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.710> places<00:04:10.920> like<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.340> but<00:04:12.180> I'm

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
Crowell and places like that and but I'm

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.870 
Crowell and places like that and but I'm
going<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.540> use<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:13.110> dark<00:04:13.590> dark<00:04:14.100> blue<00:04:14.490> color

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
going to use the dark dark blue color

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.120 
going to use the dark dark blue color
here<00:04:15.150> it's<00:04:15.450> really<00:04:16.140> nice<00:04:16.230> color<00:04:16.470> but<00:04:16.860> the<00:04:16.920> idea

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
here it's really nice color but the idea

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.920 
here it's really nice color but the idea
is<00:04:17.190> not<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.459> use<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:17.730> too<00:04:17.880> harshly<00:04:18.540> I'll<00:04:18.810> use<00:04:18.900> a

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
is not to use it too harshly I'll use a

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.900 
is not to use it too harshly I'll use a
tiny<00:04:19.170> bit<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.470> then<00:04:19.590> spread<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.160> around<00:04:20.220> I'm

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
tiny bit and then spread it around I'm

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.910 
tiny bit and then spread it around I'm
going<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.090> use<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.360> all<00:04:21.540> over<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:22.200> eyelids<00:04:22.620> and

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
going to use it all over the eyelids and

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.490 
going to use it all over the eyelids and
I'm<00:04:23.400> going<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.550> go<00:04:23.730> quite<00:04:24.240> far<00:04:24.600> down<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.260> give

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
I'm going to go quite far down to give

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.020 
I'm going to go quite far down to give
the<00:04:25.650> illusion<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:26.040> eye<00:04:26.160> bags<00:04:26.490> but<00:04:26.760> I<00:04:26.790> don't

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
the illusion of eye bags but I don't

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.940 
the illusion of eye bags but I don't
want<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.540> be<00:04:27.750> too<00:04:28.080> dark

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
want it to be too dark

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.350 
want it to be too dark
you'll<00:04:29.160> see

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.520 

so<00:04:34.360> then<00:04:34.480> before<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.750> do<00:04:34.840> any<00:04:35.020> more<00:04:35.140> detailing

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
so then before I do any more detailing

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.750 
so then before I do any more detailing
I'm<00:04:35.710> going<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:35.920> start<00:04:36.130> sticking<00:04:36.310> these<00:04:36.520> blades

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
I'm going to start sticking these blades

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.500 
I'm going to start sticking these blades
on<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:37.420> what<00:04:37.570> I've<00:04:37.660> got<00:04:37.840> here<00:04:38.110> is<00:04:38.290> basically

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
on so what I've got here is basically

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.600 
on so what I've got here is basically
regular<00:04:40.510> CDs<00:04:41.050> just<00:04:41.410> compact<00:04:42.310> this<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.550> I've

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
regular CDs just compact this that I've

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.430 
regular CDs just compact this that I've
just<00:04:42.760> cut<00:04:43.000> up<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.510> spray-painted<00:04:44.410> silver

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
just cut up and spray-painted silver

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.990 
just cut up and spray-painted silver
with<00:04:44.980> little<00:04:45.160> bits<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.370> black<00:04:45.550> on<00:04:45.760> to<00:04:45.850> make<00:04:45.970> a

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
with little bits of black on to make a

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.920 
with little bits of black on to make a
look<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.150> bit<00:04:46.240> tarnished

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
look a bit tarnished

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.290 
look a bit tarnished
yeah<00:04:47.740> just<00:04:48.250> like<00:04:48.340> these<00:04:48.490> my<00:04:48.700> CV<00:04:49.000> syllabi

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
yeah just like these my CV syllabi

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.910 
yeah just like these my CV syllabi
tutorial<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.380> idea<00:04:50.590> is<00:04:50.650> I'm<00:04:50.740> going<00:04:50.860> to

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
tutorial and the idea is I'm going to

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.620 
tutorial and the idea is I'm going to
glue<00:04:51.010> them<00:04:51.310> on<00:04:51.460> with<00:04:51.610> some<00:04:51.790> pro<00:04:52.000> stick<00:04:52.330> or<00:04:52.480> some

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
glue them on with some pro stick or some

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.410 
glue them on with some pro stick or some
spirit<00:04:52.960> gum<00:04:52.990> in<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.760> shape<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:54.880> want<00:04:54.910> I've<00:04:55.240> cut

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
spirit gum in the shape I want I've cut

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.850 
spirit gum in the shape I want I've cut
them<00:04:55.600> so<00:04:55.810> they<00:04:55.900> conform<00:04:56.170> to<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.440> head<00:04:56.590> shape<00:04:56.830> a

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
them so they conform to the head shape a

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.200 
them so they conform to the head shape a
little<00:04:56.980> bit<00:04:57.100> better<00:04:57.190> I'm<00:04:57.760> going<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:57.910> take<00:04:58.030> some

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
little bit better I'm going to take some

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.000 
little bit better I'm going to take some
spirit<00:04:58.540> gum<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:59.080> I'm<00:04:59.140> going<00:04:59.260> to<00:04:59.290> line<00:04:59.530> the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
spirit gum and I'm going to line the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.320 
spirit gum and I'm going to line the
base<00:05:00.520> of<00:05:00.820> my<00:05:01.530> saw<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:03.030> I'm<00:05:04.030> just<00:05:04.120> going<00:05:04.300> to

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
base of my saw and I'm just going to

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.810 
base of my saw and I'm just going to
hold<00:05:04.660> that<00:05:04.780> in<00:05:04.990> place<00:05:05.140> until<00:05:05.710> it<00:05:05.830> dries<00:05:06.070> nice

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
hold that in place until it dries nice

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:19.810 
hold that in place until it dries nice
and<00:05:07.180> strong

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.800 

so<00:05:20.820> there<00:05:20.970> we<00:05:21.060> are<00:05:21.090> so<00:05:21.300> when<00:05:21.420> it's<00:05:21.540> all<00:05:21.630> stuck

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
so there we are so when it's all stuck

it's amazing so it's going to dot it all

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.520 
it's amazing so it's going to dot it all
around<00:06:18.000> my<00:06:18.150> face<00:06:18.180> and<00:06:18.570> random<00:06:18.870> locations<00:06:19.410> and

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
around my face and random locations and

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.170 
around my face and random locations and
then<00:06:19.620> spray<00:06:20.040> it<00:06:20.190> from<00:06:20.250> a<00:06:20.460> distance<00:06:20.820> just<00:06:20.910> to

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
then spray it from a distance just to

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.850 
then spray it from a distance just to
activate<00:06:21.420> it<00:06:21.690> so<00:06:21.720> it<00:06:21.960> looks<00:06:22.140> like<00:06:22.410> there's

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
activate it so it looks like there's

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.280 
activate it so it looks like there's
been<00:06:22.980> blood<00:06:23.220> splatter<00:06:23.610> in<00:06:24.000> random<00:06:24.600> areas<00:06:24.870> just

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
been blood splatter in random areas just

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.980 
been blood splatter in random areas just
so<00:06:25.470> it's<00:06:25.620> not<00:06:25.770> as<00:06:25.950> white<00:06:26.340> and<00:06:26.760> pale<00:06:27.150> as<00:06:27.450> this<00:06:27.810> it

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
so it's not as white and pale as this it

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:35.399 
so it's not as white and pale as this it
needs<00:06:28.080> some<00:06:28.260> more<00:06:28.440> texture<00:06:28.710> I<00:06:28.830> think

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:35.409 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:37.839 

okay<00:06:36.409> so<00:06:36.739> I<00:06:37.009> think<00:06:37.099> all<00:06:37.309> dark<00:06:37.520> and<00:06:37.669> I<00:06:37.699> would

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
okay so I think all dark and I would

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.189 
okay so I think all dark and I would
tiny<00:06:38.089> bit<00:06:38.239> more<00:06:38.389> some<00:06:38.719> more<00:06:38.749> hairspray

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 
tiny bit more some more hairspray

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.570 
tiny bit more some more hairspray
because<00:06:39.469> there's<00:06:39.800> no<00:06:39.949> other<00:06:40.099> color<00:06:40.399> though

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
because there's no other color though

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.909 
because there's no other color though
it's<00:06:40.759> mainly<00:06:40.999> gray<00:06:41.389> and<00:06:41.659> yeah<00:06:42.589> I<00:06:42.649> think<00:06:42.709> it

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
it's mainly gray and yeah I think it

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:43.839 
it's mainly gray and yeah I think it
needs<00:06:43.039> to<00:06:43.069> be<00:06:43.129> a<00:06:43.189> bit<00:06:43.309> darker

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849 
needs to be a bit darker

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:45.609 
needs to be a bit darker
why<00:06:44.029> not<00:06:44.239> so<00:06:44.659> keep<00:06:44.869> playing<00:06:45.110> around<00:06:45.319> written

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:45.619 
why not so keep playing around written

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:46.600 
why not so keep playing around written
to<00:06:45.739> you're<00:06:45.860> happy<00:06:46.009> with<00:06:46.099> the<00:06:46.219> color<00:06:46.249> you've

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610

to you're happy with the color you've
got<00:06:46.819> I<00:06:46.939> think<00:06:47.209> this<00:06:47.449> is<00:06:47.569> the<00:06:47.689> closest<00:06:48.019> I'm

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
got I think this is the closest I'm

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.679 
got I think this is the closest I'm
gonna<00:06:48.379> get<00:06:48.559> I<00:06:48.589> think<00:06:48.709> to<00:06:49.099> the<00:06:49.300> skin<00:06:50.300> tone<00:06:50.509> that

a<00:07:08.749> little<00:07:08.839> bit<00:07:09.169> more<00:07:09.289> theatrical<00:07:09.830> and<00:07:09.919> might

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039
