00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.000
 Welcome to LG on the ifa 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.580
 2012 shows them again today two 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.740
 super interesting devices first 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.230
 a 29 inch monitor with 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.720
 ips-technology of course exclusive from 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.520
 lg and the special feature one sees it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.500
 right at the very first glance is that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.930
 can if 21 to 9 device if that is 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.090
 see device 21 9 the typical 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.009
 cinoformat also every movie 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.079
 in fact completely without black 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.760
 frame but the device offers of course 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.800
 even more in others 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.540
 for example 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.500
 I splitscreen the possibility of a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.250
 to show four screens 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.590
 Do I really believe that then 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.149
 possibility of up to four tables more 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.610
 of course I also have the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.260
 possibility besides the excel tables he 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.910
 could be a little boring yet 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.860
 to watch a movie namely the whole 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.320
 dual or, as I said, up to fourfold 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.660
 show split screen and of course that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.539
 whole in a whole new design 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.280
 the a93 series is expected to become 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.639
 chin of next year also in us 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 Germany available the lga 83 is a 

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:12.719
 high end graphic monitor 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.520
 you can see this right here on the device 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.359
 we have the possibility of hardware 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.740
 Calibration with all commercially available 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.270
 external calibration factors we say 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.729
 of course, we move in each one here 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.829
 Relationship in the professional field for 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.959
 graphics applications or photography to 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:32.579
 example, the device has a 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:35.069
 native resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.280
 this is the so-called full hd 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.680
 default 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.390
 the device is also here in the new design 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.909
 probably also directly to the beginning 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.350
 be available the next year and 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.000
 the important one is of course one 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.909
 so-called wide color expression 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.460
 we move to 99 percent everytime you 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.350
 like RGB color space when you swivel 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.060
 then we actually see you 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.840
 have a trial as a camera 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.040
 affiliated 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.380
 we actually have the opportunity 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.320
 a hundred percent color match 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:07.740
 to achieve between original photo and 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.740
 screen she read
