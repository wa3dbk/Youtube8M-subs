00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.450 

so<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:25.990> can<00:03:26.230> spend<00:03:26.560> two<00:03:26.770> minutes<00:03:26.890> on<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.280> face

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
so you can spend two minutes on the face

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.300 
so you can spend two minutes on the face
and<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:28.570> can<00:03:28.720> actually<00:03:28.900> do<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.740> minute

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
and you can actually do a minute

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.560 
and you can actually do a minute
so<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:31.150> minute<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.720> up<00:03:31.990> for<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.350> neck<00:03:32.530> area<00:03:32.800> and

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
so a minute is up for the neck area and

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.290 
so a minute is up for the neck area and
after<00:03:34.570> three<00:03:35.200> minutes<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:36.340> device<00:03:36.670> will<00:03:37.060> turn

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
after three minutes the device will turn

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.200
