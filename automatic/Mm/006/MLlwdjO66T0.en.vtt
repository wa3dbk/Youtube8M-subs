00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 loud and welcome to this 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.770
 video i am healthy again and i can 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.240
 Therefore, talk again and would like 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.170
 then immediately start with a video and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.690
 two the 2012 27 inches compared to 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.530
 macbook pro with retina display in the 15th 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.530
 inch variant 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.580
 first of all compare here 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.529
 Practically apple and pear 1 is a 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.420
 laptop computer 1 Result which one of any 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.189
 that's how people accept it 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.870
 reliant on mobility are the 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.920
 should be in the macbook area then 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.090
 deal with 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.070
 unfortunately I can not do that here 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.050
 help but it is pretty much here 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.670
 to the specification of the two devices 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.530
 And if the price then too 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.390
 justified is the first purchase reason 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.850
 in addition to mobility at the retina macbook 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.550
 pro is of course the retina display and 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.370
 Although we have a resolution of 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.780
 2,880 1,800 pixels at 15 inches 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.670
 the imac has 27 2 2560 for comparison 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.010
 x 1440 pixels 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.300
 but what brings in the whole in the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.610
 Pay pixel if you do not have enough 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.720
 space on the display has to work 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.030
 I probably already have it 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.149
 so accustomed to the 27 inch that 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.530
 we are just too small 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.390
 at least as was the computer I 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.950
 then we have a look at the house 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.170
 For example , you can see photoshop on 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.729
 really that you do not have much space 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.619
 By the way, something else in others 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.940
 to make windows clear you can 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.759
 to the macbook still an external display 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.590
 to buy but it is already so grasp 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.720
 more expensive than the imac we have here with me 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.640
 stands and then again for 200 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.679
 or maybe only 100 euros in the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 to buy display is then but one 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.860
 On the other hand , that is a bit expensive 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.149
 solution from hey i have a big one 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 display at home and if I have 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.990
 hipster starbucks i can do that 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.880
 macbook simply take quite 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.709
 cool that means you have a computer 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.240
 which one can use everywhere but now 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.380
 enough of the whole theory zeugs and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.910
 we'll just have a look 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.500
 on how the performance of the two devices so 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.670
 is the specs are and in the video 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.009
 describe you can you by it 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.509
 read here at budapest it is like that 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.429
 the macbook the very little tick 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.979
 faster is where the macbook is too 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.940
 has less installed and has a ssd 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.170
 during the imac a merger triple 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.810
 Let's come to our favorite 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.460
 cinebench test the imac left the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.250
 macbook pro right and me at 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.010
 imac 44 99 pictures per second at 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.160
 opengl test and the cpu test so that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.260
 render from a 3d image 75 points 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.590
 reached the macbook pro has in 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.950
 quotes only 38 54 pics per 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.410
 second from the graphics card and 674 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.670
 Points of the cpu is to say 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.230
 that once really clear 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.060
 faster with the cpu test so when 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.550
 rendering of image was known as the macbook pro 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.350
 the mrk needed about 30 seconds 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.390
 the macbook pro was one and a half 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.190
 minutes with it then there is still 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.270
 the black magic discs speed test at the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.370
 we can test how fast the 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.960
 Hard drives are the imac we 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.150
 a fusion drive so a normal one 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.460
 hard disk combined with the ssd and 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.680
 the macbook pro just just a ssd 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.360
 which then always just 100 mbit 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.190
 faster is both in writing as 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.180
 also in reading while the one with mine 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.250
 opinion, however, still 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.690
 unbeaten it remains when rendering 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.240
 I have videos here in twelve seconds 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.260
 before the small transition my imovie 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.489
 edited together 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.209
 on both devices since he changes in 10 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.520
 seconds 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.620
 meanwhile the macbook per 20 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.550
 Seconds then I hope this 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.410
 video has you such a small one 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.239
 Overview of the two devices given 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.890
 I can make more precise decisions for you 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.870
 unfortunately not meeting you is still 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.970
 even know what kind of a device you are 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.830
 needs and what does not need him 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.360
 otherwise I hope that my cold 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.150
 agree is now better again and 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.130
 she was reasonably okay and happy 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.390
 see you again in the next video 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.950
 I would go up over my thumb 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.120
 maybe even became an abo if you 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.590
 the video has pleased 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.800
 See you in the next video 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.800
 then
