 Marelli missing the aek they could not 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.820
 correctly identify the amount of 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.980
 What does this car do in the morning? 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.320
 if you are with ethanol suddenly gta - 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.300
 why he identified the smaller volume 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.670
 ethanol which is a lie or is 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.050
 with gasoline he ends up injecting more 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.340
 because instead of identifying a 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.810
 less amount of ethanol is 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.110
 studying a larger quantity or 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.850
 It's a general mess for you to solve. 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.230

 oscilloscopes for both the line and the 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.590
 the diesel line will also 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.930

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.740
 It is a reminder to forget that the term 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.550
 registration is ending with a 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.710
 small good but I have then what neither 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.050
 is that every time this car does not 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.780
 correctly identifies the volume of 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.950
 ethanol in the tank good 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.910
 The big tip is the spark plug 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.630
 I have already put the candle 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.620
 resolved 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.160

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.709
 counterfeit 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.410
 incredible as it may seem you only believe 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.860
 what happened to her was on the market 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.709
 second is going to waste electrode 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.440
 causing an interference or machine 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.260
 bumpy and you're almost 2 trying 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.120
 to hit is 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.560
 the volume and this mountain wanted the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.430
 identification 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.129
 this module and it seems without 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.680
 I exchange zeal the cables the car goal 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.079
 normal but it has also happened to have 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.360
 adulterated fuel problem 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.379
 it's ok too 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.950
 another tip to give another 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.260

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.690
 problem in charging phase sensor and 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:06.560
 on the cruise control unit 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.680

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.990
 by gear dispersion is when 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.720
 they bind here brochure 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.230
 moved by mail we have here 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.400
 O 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.280
 the absence of someone is better where 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.090
 I thought I had the lock here so that 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.530
 apure year 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.220

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.290

 I caught're already going in this very engine 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.620
 so the people are then lost epsilon 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.690
 ignition if lynn as cleared out that 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.209
 play said jenny level sensor is 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.419
 more shooting to kill defect 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.910

 of the direct primary 90 bovine and 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.280
 secondary that the room're memory will 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.750
 pick oscilloscope from sensors and 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.790
 will leave putting primary and secondary 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.430
