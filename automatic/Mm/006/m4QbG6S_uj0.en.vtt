00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
them dry that's really important then

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.590 
them dry that's really important then
we're<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> mix<00:01:02.699> together<00:01:02.940> our<00:01:03.329> dry

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
we're going to mix together our dry

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.780 
we're going to mix together our dry
batter<00:01:04.260> ingredients<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.280> already<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.670> our

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
batter ingredients so I already have our

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.520 
batter ingredients so I already have our
cornstarch<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> add

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
cornstarch in here just going to add

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.340 
cornstarch in here just going to add
some<00:01:07.560> baking<00:01:07.979> powder<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.869> plenty<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> salt

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
some baking powder and plenty of salt

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350 
some baking powder and plenty of salt
now<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.220> does<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.760> make<00:01:11.790> sure<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
now what that does is make sure that the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.260 
now what that does is make sure that the
wet<00:01:12.540> batter<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:13.080> sticks<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> wings

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
wet batter really sticks to the wings

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
wet batter really sticks to the wings
then<00:01:15.270> we're<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.540> mix<00:01:15.659> together<00:01:15.900> our<00:01:16.110> wet

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
then we're going to mix together our wet

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.320 
then we're going to mix together our wet
batter<00:01:16.770> ingredients<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> separate<00:01:18.119> Bowl

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
batter ingredients in a separate Bowl

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.149 
batter ingredients in a separate Bowl
now<00:01:18.600> we're<00:01:18.750> using<00:01:18.869> both<00:01:19.229> cornstarch<00:01:19.890> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
now we're using both cornstarch and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130 
now we're using both cornstarch and
flour<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> base<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.810> we're<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
flour as the base then we're going to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.480 
flour as the base then we're going to
add<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.409> baking<00:01:22.799> powder<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
add in baking powder which is going to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
add in baking powder which is going to
accomplish<00:01:23.790> two<00:01:24.180> things<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.110> raises<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
accomplish two things one it raises the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
accomplish two things one it raises the
pH<00:01:25.799> level<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> batter<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.119> help<00:01:27.299> brown<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
pH level of the batter to help brown the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.380 
pH level of the batter to help brown the
chicken<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.799> also<00:01:28.979> creates<00:01:29.549> as<00:01:29.729> tiny<00:01:30.090> air
