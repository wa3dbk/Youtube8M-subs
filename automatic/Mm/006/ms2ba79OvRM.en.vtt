00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:07.979 
one of the issues we've had on our coach

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.350 
one of the issues we've had on our coach
for<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.250> while<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:09.050> this<00:00:10.050> piece<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.710> trim<00:00:10.980> that's

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
for a while is this piece of trim that's

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.190 
for a while is this piece of trim that's
separated<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:13.110> we'll<00:00:13.559> see<00:00:13.709> if<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:13.980> fix<00:00:14.160> it

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
separated and we'll see if we can fix it

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.480 
separated and we'll see if we can fix it
this<00:00:16.200> is<00:00:16.320> Venice<00:00:16.619> way<00:00:16.770> or<00:00:16.920> since<00:00:17.160> we've<00:00:17.340> had

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
this is Venice way or since we've had

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.929 
this is Venice way or since we've had
the<00:00:17.760> coach<00:00:18.450> and<00:00:19.200> it's<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:20.130> been<00:00:20.490> basically

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the coach and it's just been basically

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.980 
the coach and it's just been basically
because<00:00:21.500> they<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.699> down<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.390> it's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
because they just think down here it's

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.900 
because they just think down here it's
got<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> screw<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.099> bottom<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.670> but

got a screw in the bottom of it but

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.230 
got a screw in the bottom of it but
screws<00:00:27.869> busted<00:00:28.529> off<00:00:28.679> and<00:00:29.429> they<00:00:29.910> didn't<00:00:30.150> use

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
screws busted off and they didn't use

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.960

any kind of adhesive to hold it up there
so<00:00:34.340> what<00:00:35.340> we're<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.879> we're<00:00:36.059> going

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
marine adhesive sealant 5200 now 5200 is

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.430 
marine adhesive sealant 5200 now 5200 is
used<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.180> marine<00:00:54.420> industry<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:55.140> things

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
used in the marine industry for things

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.569 
used in the marine industry for things
like<00:00:56.480> fittings<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> deck<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.579> cleats

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
like fittings on the deck and cleats

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.220 
like fittings on the deck and cleats
those<00:01:00.120> kind<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.420> things<00:01:00.629> deck<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> whole

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
those kind of things deck the whole

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.970 
those kind of things deck the whole
joints<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.449> really<00:01:03.870> strong<00:01:04.320> stuff<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
joints and it's really strong stuff and

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.670 
joints and it's really strong stuff and
it's<00:01:05.280> all<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:05.730> guaranteed<00:01:06.120> to<00:01:06.390> hold<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
it's all but guaranteed to hold and I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039 
it's all but guaranteed to hold and I
don't<00:01:07.890> think<00:01:08.130> it'll<00:01:08.280> ever<00:01:08.520> come<00:01:08.850> undone<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
don't think it'll ever come undone you

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.020 
don't think it'll ever come undone you
know<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.830> takes<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.189> two<00:01:11.460> days<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.939> this

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
know it takes about two days for this

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.170 
know it takes about two days for this
stuff<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> dry<00:01:13.850> okay<00:01:14.850> now<00:01:16.369> basically<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
stuff to dry okay now basically this is

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.330 
stuff to dry okay now basically this is
one<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.450> those<00:01:18.570> soft<00:01:18.810> puncturing<00:01:19.259> things<00:01:22.400> okay

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
one of those soft puncturing things okay

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.600 
one of those soft puncturing things okay
let<00:01:26.340> me<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.579> a<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:26.790> bit<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> tests<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:28.610> see

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
let me do a little bit of tests here see

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.139 
let me do a little bit of tests here see
how<00:01:29.759> easy<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.970> come<00:01:32.970> out

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
how easy this is going to be to come out

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.240 
how easy this is going to be to come out
because<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.780> may<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.140> take<00:01:34.890> too<00:01:35.100> much

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
because it may just take too much

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:44.080 
because it may just take too much
pressure

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.550 

yeah<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.330> just<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.080> hard<00:01:46.380> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
yeah it's just it's going to be hard to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
yeah it's just it's going to be hard to
squeeze<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.920> think<00:01:50.750> what<00:01:51.750> you're<00:01:51.900> gonna<00:01:51.990> get

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
squeeze I think what you're gonna get

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.740 
squeeze I think what you're gonna get
out<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:53.270> hell<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.479> probably

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
out of it so on hell they probably

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.830 
out of it so on hell they probably
should<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.110> using<00:01:55.260> gloves<00:01:55.920> here<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.660> is<00:01:57.660> this

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
should be using gloves here but is this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.359 
should be using gloves here but is this
stuff<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.410> get<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.800> you<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.100> kind<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
stuff they get it on you it's kind of a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.640 
stuff they get it on you it's kind of a
messy<00:01:59.700> thing<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:00.900> I'm<00:02:01.020> gonna<00:02:01.140> pull<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.440> down

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
messy thing so I'm gonna pull this down

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.040 
messy thing so I'm gonna pull this down
just<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:02.070> little<00:02:02.100> bit<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:06.050> Santa

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
just a little bit and then Santa

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.040 
just a little bit and then Santa
probably<00:02:07.409> she<00:02:07.530> brings<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.360> no<00:02:09.360> pair<00:02:09.959> of

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
probably she brings it up no pair of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.979 
probably she brings it up no pair of
gloves<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:13.730> I'm<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:15.000> gonna<00:02:15.920> get<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> good

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.080 

this<00:02:22.739> stuff<00:02:22.950> will<00:02:23.100> clean<00:02:23.310> up<00:02:23.340> Dubai<00:02:23.790> before

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.569 
this stuff is not inexpensive either so
I<00:02:55.760> hate<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.329> know<00:02:57.450> use<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:58.250> or<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.280> should

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
I hate to you know use for or I should

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.930 
I hate to you know use for or I should
say<00:02:59.790> waste<00:03:00.060> more<00:03:00.329> this<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.750> one<00:03:01.260> fluid<00:03:01.739> ounce

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
say waste more this is one fluid ounce

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.460 
say waste more this is one fluid ounce
is<00:03:02.940> around<00:03:03.239> $10<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.440> it's<00:03:05.190> not<00:03:05.340> cheap<00:03:06.470> all

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
is around $10 so it's not cheap all

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.069 
is around $10 so it's not cheap all
right

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
right

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.530 
right
I'm<00:03:10.079> thinking<00:03:10.470> that's<00:03:10.650> good<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:11.190> there<00:03:11.540> and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
I'm thinking that's good for there and

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.530 
I'm thinking that's good for there and
I'm<00:03:12.660> just<00:03:12.840> going<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.760> load<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:15.000> little<00:03:15.150> bit<00:03:15.299> more

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
I'm just going to load a little bit more

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.630 
I'm just going to load a little bit more
in<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> top<00:03:17.360> okay<00:03:19.250> now<00:03:21.620> I've<00:03:22.620> got<00:03:22.860> this<00:03:23.130> these

in the top okay now I've got this these

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.380 
in the top okay now I've got this these
are<00:03:23.790> nice<00:03:23.970> these<00:03:24.780> wolf<00:03:25.170> craft<00:03:26.299> clamps<00:03:27.299> because

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
are nice these wolf craft clamps because

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.930 
are nice these wolf craft clamps because
you<00:03:27.630> can<00:03:27.780> reverse<00:03:28.380> them<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.340> that's<00:03:29.730> what

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
you can reverse them and that's what

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.960 
you can reverse them and that's what
I've<00:03:30.000> done<00:03:30.030> here<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:31.070> I'm<00:03:32.070> going<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.250> try<00:03:32.489> to

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.870 

bring<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.120> up<00:03:36.239> get<00:03:36.720> over<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.730> I

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
bring it up get over like that and I

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:49.440 
bring it up get over like that and I
just<00:03:42.000> have<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.329> get<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.570> right<00:03:43.340> angle

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.160 

yeah<00:03:49.690> there<00:03:50.440> we<00:03:50.590> go<00:03:51.330> okay<00:03:54.569> that's<00:03:55.569> got<00:03:55.780> it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
yeah there we go okay that's got it

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.210 
yeah there we go okay that's got it
I<00:03:56.760> think<00:03:57.760> I'll<00:03:57.880> put<00:03:57.970> another<00:03:58.090> clamp<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:59.680> here

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
I think I'll put another clamp in here

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.250 
I think I'll put another clamp in here
to<00:04:00.370> clamp<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:00.790> in<00:04:02.520> you<00:04:03.520> know<00:04:03.959> just<00:04:04.959> basically

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
to clamp it in you know just basically

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.920 
to clamp it in you know just basically
have<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.560> wait<00:04:05.709> for<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.220> couple<00:04:06.910> days<00:04:07.180> on<00:04:07.600> stuff

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
have to wait for a couple days on stuff

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.160 
have to wait for a couple days on stuff
to<00:04:08.110> cure<00:04:08.380> I<00:04:09.150> think<00:04:10.150> I'll<00:04:10.239> put<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.450> little<00:04:10.780> bit<00:04:11.020> of

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
to cure I think I'll put a little bit of

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.120 
to cure I think I'll put a little bit of
it<00:04:11.290> more<00:04:11.500> in<00:04:11.680> this<00:04:11.920> syringe<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.489> can<00:04:17.130> at

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
it more in this syringe so that I can at

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.600 
it more in this syringe so that I can at
least<00:04:22.020> get<00:04:23.020> some<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.380> net<00:04:24.100> little<00:04:24.370> joint

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
least get some the net little joint

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:39.989 
least get some the net little joint
there<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:29.100> whoa

now not spent three days since we
applied<00:05:32.470> to<00:05:32.800> 5,200<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:34.540> weather's<00:05:34.870> turned

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
applied to 5,200 the weather's turned

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.110 
applied to 5,200 the weather's turned
kind<00:05:35.470> of<00:05:35.560> cold<00:05:35.770> it's<00:05:36.040> only<00:05:36.250> about<00:05:36.430> 35<00:05:36.940> degrees

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
kind of cold it's only about 35 degrees

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.670 
kind of cold it's only about 35 degrees
out<00:05:37.510> here<00:05:37.540> today<00:05:37.690> in<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.260> middle<00:05:38.470> of<00:05:38.560> April

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
out here today in the middle of April

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.020 
out here today in the middle of April
and<00:05:40.200> so<00:05:41.200> it<00:05:41.320> did<00:05:41.530> take<00:05:41.680> maybe<00:05:41.980> a<00:05:42.100> day<00:05:42.310> extra<00:05:42.490> to

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
and so it did take maybe a day extra to

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.990 
and so it did take maybe a day extra to
get<00:05:43.390> it<00:05:43.510> fully<00:05:43.750> cured<00:05:44.170> but<00:05:44.890> now<00:05:45.010> that<00:05:45.220> it<00:05:45.310> has<00:05:45.460> I

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
get it fully cured but now that it has I

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.640 
get it fully cured but now that it has I
mean<00:05:46.090> it's<00:05:46.480> not<00:05:46.690> going<00:05:46.840> to<00:05:46.930> go<00:05:47.050> anywhere

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
mean it's not going to go anywhere

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.470 
mean it's not going to go anywhere
I<00:05:47.790> did<00:05:48.790> find<00:05:49.060> also<00:05:49.270> that<00:05:49.480> you<00:05:50.350> can<00:05:50.620> use<00:05:50.860> alcohol

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
I did find also that you can use alcohol

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.080 
I did find also that you can use alcohol
isopropyl<00:05:52.480> alcohol<00:05:53.080> basically<00:05:53.950> to<00:05:54.700> clean

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
isopropyl alcohol basically to clean

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.650 
isopropyl alcohol basically to clean
around<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.590> excess<00:05:57.580> 52-hundred<00:05:58.300> net<00:05:58.480> you

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
around the excess 52-hundred net you

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.320 
around the excess 52-hundred net you
want<00:05:58.810> to<00:05:58.900> take<00:05:59.080> off<00:05:59.290> now<00:06:00.250> one<00:06:00.460> caution<00:06:01.000> is<00:06:01.150> if

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
want to take off now one caution is if

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.610 
want to take off now one caution is if
you<00:06:01.420> do<00:06:01.570> use<00:06:01.780> alcohol<00:06:03.420> it<00:06:04.420> will<00:06:04.690> prevent<00:06:05.200> the

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
you do use alcohol it will prevent the

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.330 
you do use alcohol it will prevent the
5200<00:06:06.340> from<00:06:06.460> curing<00:06:06.910> if<00:06:07.060> it<00:06:07.210> if<00:06:07.600> it<00:06:08.160> comes<00:06:09.160> into
