you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.890> where<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.130> hits<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.460> yellow<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you can see where it hits the yellow it

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.249 
you can see where it hits the yellow it
turns<00:01:42.299> Coralie<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.740> where<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.950> hits<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
turns Coralie and where it hits the

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.859 
turns Coralie and where it hits the
blue-green<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.470> turns<00:01:46.710> violet<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.600> I'll<00:01:48.720> just

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
blue-green it turns violet and I'll just

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.270 
blue-green it turns violet and I'll just
let<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.079> take<00:01:49.470> up<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> while<00:01:50.070> because

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
let that take up for a while because

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.679 
let that take up for a while because
that<00:01:50.460> looks<00:01:50.640> more<00:01:50.880> interesting<00:01:50.909> than<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> did

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that looks more interesting than it did

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.719 
that looks more interesting than it did
before<00:01:51.840> although<00:01:52.680> some<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.430> probably

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
before although some of you probably

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.690 
before although some of you probably
said<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.180> looks<00:01:54.689> hideous

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
said it looks hideous

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.740 
said it looks hideous
but<00:01:56.700> that's<00:01:56.909> okay<00:01:57.210> because<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
but that's okay because it's a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.469 
but that's okay because it's a
progression<00:01:58.490> if<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.640> don't<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.329> it

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
progression if I don't like the way it

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.569 
progression if I don't like the way it
looks<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:00.960> continue<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.860> add<00:02:02.040> more<00:02:02.070> things

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
looks I can continue to add more things

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.300 
looks I can continue to add more things
so<00:02:03.570> I'm<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.990> add<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> acid<00:02:04.680> now

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.359 

and<00:02:08.179> there's<00:02:08.479> no<00:02:08.690> extra<00:02:09.170> water<00:02:09.500> in<00:02:09.770> here<00:02:10.130> other

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
and there's no extra water in here other

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.280 
and there's no extra water in here other
than<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:11.180> which<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.600> put<00:02:12.100> into<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.430> die<00:02:13.550> path

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
than that which I put into the die path

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.020 
than that which I put into the die path
Laurel<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.650> show<00:02:16.069> this<00:02:16.280> frying<00:02:16.610> pan<00:02:16.730> now

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
Laurel can you show this frying pan now

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.610 
Laurel can you show this frying pan now
we'll<00:02:17.300> just<00:02:17.420> talk<00:02:17.630> about<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:18.080> well<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.380> one's

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
we'll just talk about it well this one's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.520 
we'll just talk about it well this one's
taken<00:02:19.040> up<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:19.790> Laurel<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:20.990> already<00:02:21.290> tried

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
taken up so Laurel and I already tried

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.180 
taken up so Laurel and I already tried
to<00:02:21.680> make<00:02:21.800> one<00:02:22.040> video<00:02:22.220> but<00:02:22.430> our<00:02:24.190> producer

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
to make one video but our producer

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.430 
to make one video but our producer
forgot<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.090> put<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.360> right<00:02:26.510> memory<00:02:26.870> card<00:02:27.230> in

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
forgot to put the right memory card in

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.309 
forgot to put the right memory card in
and<00:02:27.709> so<00:02:28.370> we<00:02:28.610> made<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.000> two-minute<00:02:29.660> thing

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
and so we made like a two-minute thing

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.809 
and so we made like a two-minute thing
but<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.620> already<00:02:30.830> started<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.250> process<00:02:31.459> of

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
but we already started the process of

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.110 
but we already started the process of
this<00:02:31.940> one<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:33.230> was<00:02:33.380> sort<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.760> not<00:02:34.760> died

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
this one it was sort of not died

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.150 
this one it was sort of not died
smoothly<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.930> blue<00:02:36.140> part<00:02:36.470> had<00:02:36.770> a<00:02:36.800> lot<00:02:37.040> of

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
smoothly the blue part had a lot of

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.770 
smoothly the blue part had a lot of
white<00:02:37.430> chunks<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.910> them<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.120> lot<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.420> darker

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
white chunks in them a lot of darker

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.320 
white chunks in them a lot of darker
chunks<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.290> what<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.920> did<00:02:40.160> was<00:02:40.310> poured<00:02:40.670> blue

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
chunks and what I did was poured blue

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.170 
chunks and what I did was poured blue
violet<00:02:41.780> through<00:02:42.050> here<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.730> some<00:02:43.730> blue<00:02:43.970> down

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
violet through here and some blue down

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.000 
violet through here and some blue down
here<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.780> I'm<00:02:44.870> just<00:02:44.900> letting<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.410> slowly<00:02:45.739> take

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
here and I'm just letting it slowly take

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.880 
here and I'm just letting it slowly take
up<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.340> kind<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:47.110> blend<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:48.410> can<00:02:48.650> see<00:02:48.800> an

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
up to kind of blend that you can see an

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.800 
up to kind of blend that you can see an
area<00:02:49.100> here<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.700> sort<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.000> let<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.300> see<00:02:50.510> what<00:02:50.720> it

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
area here it sort of let you see what it

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.120 
area here it sort of let you see what it
was<00:02:50.900> like<00:02:51.080> only<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.560> course<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:51.860> was<00:02:51.950> much

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
was like only of course it was much

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.580 
was like only of course it was much
lighter<00:02:52.430> before<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.930> now<00:02:54.080> this<00:02:54.230> is<00:02:54.410> getting

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
lighter before so now this is getting

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.580 
lighter before so now this is getting
all<00:02:54.830> smoothed<00:02:55.220> out<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:57.080> I'm<00:02:57.170> probably<00:02:57.380> going

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
all smoothed out and I'm probably going

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.530 
all smoothed out and I'm probably going
to<00:02:57.650> come<00:02:57.860> back<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.310> here<00:02:58.519> in<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.700> second<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.360> add

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
to come back in here in a second and add

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.770 
to come back in here in a second and add
some<00:02:59.810> more<00:02:59.840> blue<00:03:00.140> violet<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:02.360> now<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.569> can

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
some more blue violet so now you can

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.979 
some more blue violet so now you can
hear<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.140> sizzling<00:03:03.680> probably<00:03:04.280> which<00:03:04.989> no

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
hear the sizzling probably which no

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.600 
hear the sizzling probably which no
worries<00:03:06.319> it's<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.620> good<00:03:06.769> sound<00:03:07.069> it's<00:03:07.280> just<00:03:07.489> the

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
worries it's a good sound it's just the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.220 
worries it's a good sound it's just the
water<00:03:07.850> moving<00:03:08.300> around<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.780> there

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.140 

so<00:03:14.709> now<00:03:14.830> I'm<00:03:14.920> going<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.130> take<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.520> look<00:03:15.790> at<00:03:15.970> this

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
so now I'm going to take a look at this

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.309 
so now I'm going to take a look at this
and<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.450> think<00:03:16.510> I'm<00:03:16.780> going<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:16.990> mix<00:03:17.110> up<00:03:17.260> some

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
and I think I'm going to mix up some

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.530 
and I think I'm going to mix up some
orange<00:03:18.010> because<00:03:18.520> that's<00:03:18.880> just<00:03:19.120> going<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.420> make

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
orange because that's just going to make

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.870 
orange because that's just going to make
me<00:03:19.690> happy<00:03:23.040> pour<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.160> over<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.580> see<00:03:24.730> what

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
happens sometimes too with these pieces

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.500 
happens sometimes too with these pieces

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
big jumps of color and I'll use a deep

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.740 
big jumps of color and I'll use a deep
dive<00:04:16.660> ass<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.760> then<00:04:18.760> sometimes<00:04:19.269> I<00:04:19.450> have<00:04:19.720> a

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
dive ass and then sometimes I have a

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.539 
dive ass and then sometimes I have a
very<00:04:20.019> shallow<00:04:20.289> one<00:04:20.650> because<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:21.039> just<00:04:21.220> want

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
very shallow one because I just want

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.460

these<00:04:21.850> little<00:04:22.270> highlights<00:04:22.750> or<00:04:22.960> spots<00:04:23.289> of

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
these little highlights or spots of

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.760 
these little highlights or spots of
color<00:04:23.710> I<00:04:25.979> was<00:04:26.979> beginning<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.430> think<00:04:27.729> that<00:04:27.850> on

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
color I was beginning to think that on

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.380 
color I was beginning to think that on
spot<00:04:29.770> dyes<00:04:30.010> had<00:04:30.310> sort<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.640> gone<00:04:30.850> out<00:04:30.880> of<00:04:31.180> vogue

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
spot dyes had sort of gone out of vogue

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.029 
spot dyes had sort of gone out of vogue
because<00:04:31.660> people<00:04:32.140> weren't<00:04:32.289> buying<00:04:32.560> them<00:04:32.860> so

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
because people weren't buying them so

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.730 
because people weren't buying them so
much<00:04:33.190> anymore<00:04:33.490> but<00:04:34.419> people<00:04:35.080> recently<00:04:35.320> have

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
much anymore but people recently have

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.260 
much anymore but people recently have
begun<00:04:35.890> asking<00:04:36.460> for<00:04:36.669> them<00:04:36.789> again<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.180> they're

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
begun asking for them again and they're

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.640 
begun asking for them again and they're
a<00:04:37.300> great<00:04:37.539> thing<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.960> have<00:04:38.169> in<00:04:38.350> your<00:04:38.380> repertoire

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
a great thing to have in your repertoire

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.200 
a great thing to have in your repertoire
because<00:04:39.130> they<00:04:39.220> can<00:04:39.370> do<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.490> lot<00:04:39.700> of<00:04:39.729> little<00:04:39.970> work

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
because they can do a lot of little work

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.300 
because they can do a lot of little work
for<00:04:40.419> you<00:04:43.020> now<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.050> might<00:04:44.410> like<00:04:44.590> look<00:04:45.010> at<00:04:45.160> this
