00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
four tutorial and today we're going to

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.710 
four tutorial and today we're going to
be<00:00:04.680> going<00:00:04.770> through<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.339> ins<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:05.730> outs<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.089> the

be going through the ins and outs of the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.690 
be going through the ins and outs of the
map<00:00:06.990> kit<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.740> as<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.099> can<00:00:08.189> see<00:00:08.280> we've<00:00:08.460> got<00:00:08.670> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
map kit it as you can see we've got a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.089 
map kit it as you can see we've got a
basic<00:00:09.150> map<00:00:09.420> view<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:09.929> front<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.290> us<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.950> know

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
basic map view in front of us you know

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.789 
basic map view in front of us you know
we<00:00:11.550> can<00:00:11.670> click<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.210> zoom<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.049> where<00:00:13.620> we're

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
we can click in zoom in to where we're

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.170 
we can click in zoom in to where we're
at<00:00:13.830> Lincoln<00:00:14.340> Nebraska<00:00:14.839> go<00:00:15.839> huskers<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:17.180> I'm

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
at Lincoln Nebraska go huskers and I'm

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.150 
at Lincoln Nebraska go huskers and I'm
in<00:00:18.359> zoom<00:00:18.630> out<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.350> know<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.500> forget<00:00:19.980> how<00:00:20.070> to

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
in zoom out you know I forget how to

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.820 
in zoom out you know I forget how to
zoom<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.580> simulator<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:21.720> anyways<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.619> can

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
zoom out simulator but anyways you can

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.320 
zoom out simulator but anyways you can
zoom<00:00:23.039> at<00:00:23.420> so<00:00:24.769> if<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.949> start<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.699> new<00:00:26.939> project

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
zoom at so if we start a new project

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.089 
zoom at so if we start a new project
we're<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> single<00:00:28.800> View

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
we're just going to do a single View

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.290 
we're just going to do a single View
application<00:00:29.130> we're<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:29.939> gonna<00:00:30.029> put<00:00:30.269> that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
application we're just gonna put that

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.959 
application we're just gonna put that
simple<00:00:30.810> map<00:00:31.019> view<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:32.820> just

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
simple map view in there so I'm just

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.940 
simple map view in there so I'm just
going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> put<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> map<00:00:33.600> kit<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.649> know<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.829> can

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
going to put a map kit you know you can

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.540 
going to put a map kit you know you can
put<00:00:35.100> whatever<00:00:35.219> matt<00:00:35.700> view<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:37.399> then<00:00:38.399> we're

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
put whatever matt view and then we're

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.740 
put whatever matt view and then we're
going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> go<00:00:38.910> ahead<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.149> launch<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.480> project

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
going to go ahead and launch a project

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.770 
going to go ahead and launch a project
save<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.530> wherever<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.480> want<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> eat<00:00:42.719> your

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
save it wherever I want to eat your

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.900 
save it wherever I want to eat your
project<00:00:43.200> loaded<00:00:43.559> we're<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.280> add<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
project loaded we're going to add in the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.750 
project loaded we're going to add in the
frameworks<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.809> needed<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.670> go

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
frameworks that we needed so if you go

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.040 
frameworks that we needed so if you go
up<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.850> your<00:00:48.000> project<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:48.780> make<00:00:49.020> sure

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
up to your project up here make sure

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.400 
up to your project up here make sure
you're<00:00:49.379> within<00:00:49.590> their<00:00:49.890> target<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.670> your

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
you're within their target of your

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.510 
you're within their target of your
application<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:53.250> over<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
application here and go over to the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490 
application here and go over to the
build<00:00:53.730> phases<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.539> hop<00:00:54.780> now<00:00:55.379> we're

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
build phases up to this hop now we're

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.709 
build phases up to this hop now we're
gonna<00:00:55.559> put<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.949> two<00:00:56.250> libraries<00:00:56.969> now<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> first

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
gonna put in two libraries now the first

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.560 
gonna put in two libraries now the first
library<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.920> your<00:00:59.160> basic

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
library is just going to be your basic

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.830 
library is just going to be your basic
map<00:01:00.570> kit<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.969> this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> hold<00:01:03.510> pretty

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
map kit and this is going to hold pretty

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.800 
map kit and this is going to hold pretty
much<00:01:03.989> everything<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.830> need<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:06.210> generate

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
much everything that we need to generate

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.170 
much everything that we need to generate
this<00:01:07.380> map<00:01:07.680> view<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.610> there's<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.970> additional

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
this map view but there's one additional

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.700 
this map view but there's one additional
framework<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.020> we're<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> add

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
framework that we're just going to add

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.469 
framework that we're just going to add
now<00:01:11.010> even<00:01:11.400> though<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.610> probably<00:01:11.909> won't<00:01:12.180> use

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
now even though we probably won't use

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.899 
now even though we probably won't use
until<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> next<00:01:13.110> tutorial<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
until the next tutorial and that's the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.350 
until the next tutorial and that's the
core<00:01:15.150> locations<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.880> which<00:01:17.880> should<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.210> like

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
core locations and which should be like

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.560 
core locations and which should be like
something<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:19.070> core<00:01:20.070> location<00:01:20.360> search<00:01:21.360> for

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
something like core location search for

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.859 
something like core location search for
that<00:01:21.720> nope<00:01:22.110> not<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:23.570> just<00:01:24.570> put<00:01:24.780> in

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that nope not that one just put in

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.999 
that nope not that one just put in
location<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.750> there<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:27.840> go<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.740> space

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
location and there we go so I know space

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.130 
location and there we go so I know space
core<00:01:29.340> location<00:01:29.490> framework<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.840> ahead<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.049> add

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
core location framework go ahead and add

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.630 
core location framework go ahead and add
that<00:01:31.350> into<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> project<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.189> well<00:01:32.369> now<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that into the project as well now the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.069 
that into the project as well now the
core<00:01:32.880> location<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.689> added<00:01:33.960> in

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
core location is going to be added in

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.880 
core location is going to be added in
the<00:01:34.170> future<00:01:34.500> when<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.950> actually<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.430> down<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
the future when we actually get down to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
the future when we actually get down to
figuring<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.040> where<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.640> device<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.920> it's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
figuring out where the device is it's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.469 
figuring out where the device is it's
going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> pull<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.610> core<00:01:42.000> locations

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
going to pull from that core locations

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.999 
going to pull from that core locations
framework<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.259> look<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.979> know

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
framework to look for you know

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.800 
framework to look for you know
coordinates<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:45.119> vertical<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.720> your

other<00:01:48.090> stuff<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.020> that's<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.680> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
other stuff like that so that's going to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.340 
other stuff like that so that's going to
be<00:01:49.829> used<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> future<00:01:50.640> tutorial<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.540> we're

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
be used in the future tutorial so we're

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.249 
be used in the future tutorial so we're
just<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.710> add<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.040> at<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.310> point<00:01:53.549> now

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
just going to add it at this point now

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.899 
just going to add it at this point now
I'm<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.590> tuck<00:01:55.860> my<00:01:56.100> frameworks

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
I'm just going to tuck my frameworks

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.319 
I'm just going to tuck my frameworks
into<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> grouping<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.939> now<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.000> can

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
into the grouping here and now we can

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.440 
into the grouping here and now we can
begin<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.530> when<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.829> load<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.369> our<00:02:02.670> main<00:02:03.000> story

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
begin so when we load up our main story

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.240 
begin so when we load up our main story

this<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.520> basically<00:02:10.030> where<00:02:10.270> we're<00:02:10.420> going<00:02:10.540> to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
this is basically where we're going to

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.570 
this is basically where we're going to
put<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.840> map<00:02:11.050> view<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.100> if<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.250> over<00:02:12.400> our

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
put the map view so if you over our

you<00:02:15.520> should<00:02:15.760> come<00:02:15.970> across<00:02:16.330> an<00:02:16.800> object<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:18.040> is

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
you should come across an object that is

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.560 
you should come across an object that is
the<00:02:18.520> map<00:02:18.820> view<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.940> we're<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.270> drag

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
the map view and we're going to drag

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.010 
the map view and we're going to drag
that<00:02:22.600> on<00:02:22.870> screen<00:02:23.520> now<00:02:24.520> if<00:02:24.790> you've<00:02:24.970> got<00:02:25.210> your<00:02:25.420> MK

view<00:02:31.960> you're<00:02:32.200> looking<00:02:32.440> for<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.160> if<00:02:33.220> you're

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
view you're looking for so if you're

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.740 
view you're looking for so if you're
familiar<00:02:33.460> with<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.940> Google<00:02:34.270> applicator

google<00:02:35.230> maps<00:02:35.410> you've<00:02:36.040> got<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> satellite<00:02:36.520> a

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
google maps you've got a satellite a

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.240 
google maps you've got a satellite a
hybrid<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.080> basic<00:02:38.440> maps<00:02:38.710> well

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
hybrid and just the basic maps well

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.460 
hybrid and just the basic maps well
these<00:02:39.370> are<00:02:39.580> exactly<00:02:40.240> these<00:02:41.080> are<00:02:41.230> polled

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
these are exactly these are polled

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.800 
these are exactly these are polled
exactly<00:02:42.160> from<00:02:42.520> Google's<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.630> going<00:02:43.750> to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
exactly from Google's so it's going to

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.449 
exactly from Google's so it's going to
be<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.959> direct<00:02:44.350> reflection<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:45.100> what<00:02:45.310> you've

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
be a direct reflection of what you've

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.630 
be a direct reflection of what you've
got<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.990> we're<00:02:47.530> going<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.800> go<00:02:47.980> with<00:02:48.190> just<00:02:48.520> a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
got so we're going to go with just a

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.410 
got so we're going to go with just a
basic<00:02:48.850> map<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.630> this<00:02:49.810> case<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:51.430> then<00:02:52.300> we're

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
basic map in this case and then we're

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.840 
basic map in this case and then we're
going<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.570> move<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.930> what's<00:02:53.830> next<00:02:54.130> year<00:02:54.610> is

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
going to move on to what's next year is

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.180 
going to move on to what's next year is
hooking<00:02:55.450> up<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:55.990> map<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:57.250> our<00:02:57.610> controller<00:02:59.190> so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
hooking up this map to our controller so

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.100 
hooking up this map to our controller so
we're<00:03:00.430> going<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.610> simply<00:03:01.090> hold<00:03:01.540> control<00:03:02.080> and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
we're going to simply hold control and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.470 
we're going to simply hold control and
once<00:03:03.100> you've<00:03:03.250> got<00:03:03.430> your<00:03:03.459> editor<00:03:03.970> open<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.300> hold

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
once you've got your editor open a hold

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.790 
once you've got your editor open a hold
control<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:04.930> we're<00:03:05.410> going<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.560> throw<00:03:05.709> this

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
control and we're going to throw this

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.060 
control and we're going to throw this
into<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:09.310> Ord<00:03:09.760> H<00:03:10.209> file<00:03:10.480> here<00:03:10.989> as<00:03:11.170> an<00:03:11.380> outlet<00:03:11.860> and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
into in Ord H file here as an outlet and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.860 
into in Ord H file here as an outlet and
you<00:03:12.700> can<00:03:12.880> just<00:03:13.060> name<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:13.450> something<00:03:13.810> like

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
you can just name this something like

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
you can just name this something like
Matt<00:03:14.230> view<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.459> go<00:03:16.090> ahead<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.300> connect<00:03:16.600> it

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
Matt view and go ahead and connect it

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.479 
Matt view and go ahead and connect it
now<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:17.980> last<00:03:18.280> thing<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.610> we<00:03:18.820> have<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:18.970> do<00:03:19.269> is

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
now the last thing that we have to do is

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.229 
now the last thing that we have to do is
we're<00:03:21.489> going<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.670> switch<00:03:21.850> over<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.090> the

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
we're going to switch over to the

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.330 
we're going to switch over to the
standalone<00:03:22.690> editor<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:23.950> go<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
standalone editor and just go to the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.850 
standalone editor and just go to the
view<00:03:24.580> controller<00:03:24.880> dot<00:03:25.269> H<00:03:25.480> here<00:03:25.750> we've<00:03:26.680> got<00:03:26.830> to

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
view controller dot H here we've got to

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.310 
view controller dot H here we've got to
add<00:03:27.070> in<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.489> framework<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:28.209> we're<00:03:28.390> using<00:03:28.660> so

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
add in the framework that we're using so

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.060 
add in the framework that we're using so
at<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.500> point<00:03:29.890> as<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:31.630> can<00:03:31.780> see<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.890> see

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
at this point as you can see you see

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.430 
at this point as you can see you see
we've<00:03:33.220> got<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.430> little<00:03:33.959> we've<00:03:34.959> got<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.170> little

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
we've got a little we've got a little

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.960 
we've got a little we've got a little
air<00:03:35.680> that's<00:03:35.950> come<00:03:36.130> up<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.519> is<00:03:36.790> basically

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
air that's come up it is basically

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.540 
air that's come up it is basically
saying<00:03:37.300> an<00:03:37.480> unknown<00:03:37.930> type<00:03:38.380> name<00:03:38.680> mkay<00:03:39.280> map

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
saying an unknown type name mkay map

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.550 
saying an unknown type name mkay map
view<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.150> that's<00:03:40.570> because<00:03:40.840> we<00:03:41.080> haven't

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
view and that's because we haven't

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.490 
view and that's because we haven't
actually<00:03:41.680> imported<00:03:42.610> our<00:03:42.790> map<00:03:43.390> kit<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.380> we

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
actually imported our map kit that we

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.410 
actually imported our map kit that we
have<00:03:44.650> linked<00:03:45.070> in<00:03:45.220> so<00:03:45.550> we<00:03:45.670> already<00:03:45.910> linked<00:03:46.269> in

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
have linked in so we already linked in

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.320 
have linked in so we already linked in
our<00:03:46.660> map<00:03:47.230> kit<00:03:47.560> brought<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.310> now<00:03:48.910> we<00:03:48.970> have<00:03:49.239> to

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
our map kit brought it in now we have to

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.040 
our map kit brought it in now we have to
import<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.900> into<00:03:50.019> our<00:03:50.320> header<00:03:50.800> file<00:03:51.160> here<00:03:52.050> so

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
import it into our header file here so

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.940 
import it into our header file here so
as<00:03:53.140> we<00:03:53.260> import<00:03:53.739> our<00:03:53.860> header<00:03:55.080> map<00:03:56.080> kit<00:03:56.440> /<00:03:56.680> map

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
as we import our header map kit / map

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.720 
as we import our header map kit / map
kids<00:03:57.340> dot<00:03:57.880> H<00:03:58.209> as<00:03:58.600> we<00:03:59.410> import<00:03:59.830> that<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.340> click

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
kids dot H as we import that and click

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.370 
kids dot H as we import that and click
off<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.239> you're<00:04:01.420> gonna<00:04:01.510> see<00:04:01.630> the<00:04:01.900> air<00:04:02.049> is

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
off of it you're gonna see the air is

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.100 
off of it you're gonna see the air is
gone<00:04:02.830> because<00:04:03.280> now<00:04:03.580> it<00:04:03.760> knows<00:04:03.970> where<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:04.989> find

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
gone because now it knows where to find

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.880 
gone because now it knows where to find
the<00:04:05.380> map<00:04:05.560> mkay<00:04:06.400> map<00:04:06.700> view<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:08.350> should<00:04:08.739> be

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
the map mkay map view so we should be

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.289 
the map mkay map view so we should be
good<00:04:08.920> I<00:04:09.280> just<00:04:09.459> want<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.670> take<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:09.970> in<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.239> show

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
good I just want to take you in and show

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.309 
good I just want to take you in and show
you<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:11.110> view<00:04:11.290> controller<00:04:11.440> em<00:04:12.280> because<00:04:12.549> as

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
you the view controller em because as

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.170 
you the view controller em because as
you<00:04:13.349> know<00:04:13.469> once<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.400> put<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.609> property<00:04:15.090> in

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
you know once you put a property in

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.490 
you know once you put a property in
there<00:04:15.329> you've<00:04:15.540> got<00:04:15.749> to<00:04:15.840> synthesize<00:04:16.320> the

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
there you've got to synthesize the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.189 
there you've got to synthesize the
property<00:04:17.009> in<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.459> implementation<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.509> since

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
property in the implementation and since

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.979 
property in the implementation and since
we<00:04:19.320> already<00:04:19.440> hooked<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.859> up<00:04:20.000> since<00:04:21.000> synthesize

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
we already hooked it up since synthesize

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.960 
we already hooked it up since synthesize
does<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.560> for<00:04:22.830> us<00:04:22.860> or<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.310> program<00:04:23.639> does<00:04:23.820> it

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
does it for us or the program does it

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.330 
does it for us or the program does it
for<00:04:24.180> us<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.509> it<00:04:24.630> already<00:04:24.780> drops<00:04:25.199> in<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.650> so

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
for us that it already drops in and so

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.499 
for us that it already drops in and so
we're<00:04:26.520> good<00:04:26.699> go<00:04:27.050> now<00:04:28.100> just<00:04:29.100> click<00:04:29.430> run<00:04:29.759> let's

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
we're good go now just click run let's

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.960 
we're good go now just click run let's
make<00:04:30.690> sure<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:31.020> works<00:04:31.289> now<00:04:31.970> alright

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
make sure it works now alright

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.409 
make sure it works now alright
clickety-clack<00:04:33.750> there's<00:04:34.410> our<00:04:34.620> map<00:04:35.419> again

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
clickety-clack there's our map again

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.870 
clickety-clack there's our map again
knowing<00:04:36.539> zoom<00:04:36.660> in<00:04:37.020> stuff<00:04:37.349> like<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.530> not<00:04:38.490> real

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
knowing zoom in stuff like that not real

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.850 
knowing zoom in stuff like that not real
interactive<00:04:39.660> now<00:04:39.930> because<00:04:40.440> we<00:04:40.590> haven't

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
interactive now because we haven't

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.110 
interactive now because we haven't
gotten<00:04:40.979> into<00:04:41.190> some<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.580> more<00:04:41.789> advanced

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
gotten into some of the more advanced

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.180 
gotten into some of the more advanced
things<00:04:42.270> but<00:04:42.990> that's<00:04:43.139> kind<00:04:43.349> of<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.500> basics<00:04:43.919> just

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
things but that's kind of a basics just

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.860 
things but that's kind of a basics just
you<00:04:44.340> got<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.550> pull<00:04:44.729> the<00:04:44.820> framework<00:04:45.180> in<00:04:45.360> then

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
you got to pull the framework in then

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.749 
you got to pull the framework in then
you<00:04:45.960> got<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.110> hook<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.380> up<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.500> your<00:04:46.759> your

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
you got to hook it up to your your

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.540 
you got to hook it up to your your
storyboard<00:04:48.690> or<00:04:49.020> your<00:04:49.259> interface<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:49.979> then

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
storyboard or your interface and then

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.490 
storyboard or your interface and then
also<00:04:50.820> hook<00:04:51.240> it<00:04:51.360> into<00:04:51.479> your<00:04:51.660> header<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.320> your

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
also hook it into your header in your

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.920 
also hook it into your header in your
implementation<00:04:52.770> as<00:04:53.400> far<00:04:53.669> as<00:04:53.849> where<00:04:54.240> or<00:04:54.539> what

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
implementation as far as where or what

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.960 
implementation as far as where or what
it's<00:04:55.320> going<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.560> be<00:04:55.680> so<00:04:56.039> hopefully<00:04:56.610> that<00:04:56.940> helps

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
it's going to be so hopefully that helps

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.150 
it's going to be so hopefully that helps
you<00:04:57.240> just<00:04:57.449> put<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.690> basics<00:04:58.229> of<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.500> map<00:04:58.740> kit

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
you just put the basics of the map kit

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.659 
you just put the basics of the map kit
and<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.460> map<00:05:00.270> view<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:01.250> would<00:05:02.250> be<00:05:02.430> getting

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
and the map view and would be getting

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.939 
and the map view and would be getting
into<00:05:02.820> smaller<00:05:03.240> more<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.110> advanced<00:05:04.530> features

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
into smaller more the advanced features

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.270 
into smaller more the advanced features
with<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.280> map<00:05:05.460> views<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.650> we'll<00:05:07.650> catch<00:05:08.130> you

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
with the map views so we'll catch you

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.360 
with the map views so we'll catch you
guys<00:05:08.370> in<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.550> next<00:05:08.639> tutorials
