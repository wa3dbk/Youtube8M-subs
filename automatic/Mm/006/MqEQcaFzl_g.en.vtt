platform now the following links were
actually<00:01:09.450> found<00:01:09.750> two<00:01:10.020> different<00:01:10.350> areas<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
actually found two different areas of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.859 
actually found two different areas of
the<00:01:11.010> website<00:01:11.430> making<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> seem<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the website making it seem like a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.690 
the website making it seem like a
competition<00:01:13.500> where<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> sign<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:14.580> your

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
competition where you sign up with your

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.850 
competition where you sign up with your
team<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.840> link<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.409> terms<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
team then a link with terms and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.030 
team then a link with terms and
conditions<00:01:17.340> all<00:01:17.580> pages<00:01:17.939> currently<00:01:18.570> lead<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
conditions all pages currently lead to a

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.010 
conditions all pages currently lead to a
503<00:01:20.040> error<00:01:20.580> page<00:01:21.060> apart<00:01:21.570> from<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> main

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
503 error page apart from the main

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140 
503 error page apart from the main
countdown<00:01:22.530> page<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.460> very<00:01:23.580> likely<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
countdown page so it's very likely that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.080 
countdown page so it's very likely that
there<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.189> contest<00:01:26.759> for

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
there is going to be this contest for

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
there is going to be this contest for
something<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.170> there<00:01:28.350> seems<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.770> be

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
something and that there seems to be

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
something and that there seems to be
some<00:01:29.130> prizes<00:01:29.490> which<00:01:30.090> we'll<00:01:30.270> talk<00:01:30.299> about<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
some prizes which we'll talk about in a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.350 
some prizes which we'll talk about in a
moment<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.490> actually<00:01:32.670> find<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
moment and you can actually find this

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.469 
moment and you can actually find this
right<00:01:33.900> now<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.560> 503<00:01:35.549> error<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
right now it's just 503 error but it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
right now it's just 503 error but it
looks<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:36.840> when<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> countdown<00:01:37.680> actually

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
looks like when the countdown actually

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.730 
looks like when the countdown actually
runs<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.759> may<00:01:39.240> six<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.810> may<00:01:39.990> actually<00:01:40.259> see

runs out on may six we may actually see
