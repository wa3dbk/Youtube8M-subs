hello again after some of our recent

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.980 
hello again after some of our recent
videos<00:00:03.969> we<00:00:04.210> thought<00:00:04.360> it<00:00:04.420> was<00:00:04.509> time<00:00:04.690> to<00:00:04.720> focus

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:04.990 
videos we thought it was time to focus

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.440 
videos we thought it was time to focus
in<00:00:05.379> a<00:00:05.589> bit<00:00:05.799> more<00:00:05.979> on<00:00:06.189> lights<00:00:06.729> and<00:00:07.120> how<00:00:07.299> they

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
in a bit more on lights and how they

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.660 
in a bit more on lights and how they
work<00:00:07.660> in<00:00:07.839> hitfilm<00:00:08.400> specifically<00:00:09.400> with

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
work in hitfilm specifically with

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.329 
work in hitfilm specifically with
relation<00:00:10.120> to<00:00:10.150> shadows<00:00:10.839> because<00:00:11.799> hip<00:00:12.009> film<00:00:12.280> is

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:12.339 
relation to shadows because hip film is

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:13.950 
relation to shadows because hip film is
a<00:00:12.370> 3d<00:00:12.790> compositor<00:00:13.389> that<00:00:13.540> gives<00:00:13.719> you<00:00:13.809> all<00:00:13.929> kinds

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
a 3d compositor that gives you all kinds

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.450 
a 3d compositor that gives you all kinds
of<00:00:14.320> cool<00:00:14.530> things<00:00:14.559> you<00:00:14.799> can<00:00:14.950> do<00:00:15.070> with<00:00:15.190> shadows

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
of cool things you can do with shadows

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.420 
of cool things you can do with shadows
that<00:00:15.940> you<00:00:16.000> can't<00:00:16.270> do<00:00:16.480> in<00:00:16.600> a<00:00:16.660> 2d<00:00:17.020> compositor<00:00:17.590> so

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
that you can't do in a 2d compositor so

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.790 
that you can't do in a 2d compositor so
let's<00:00:18.760> use<00:00:18.910> this<00:00:19.060> really<00:00:19.270> really<00:00:19.600> very<00:00:20.260> simple

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
let's use this really really very simple

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.440 
let's use this really really very simple
example<00:00:21.400> to<00:00:21.430> show<00:00:21.640> you<00:00:21.700> exactly<00:00:21.970> what's<00:00:22.240> going

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
example to show you exactly what's going

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.570 
example to show you exactly what's going
on<00:00:22.600> first<00:00:23.470> we'll<00:00:23.710> just<00:00:23.860> jump<00:00:24.070> out<00:00:24.190> to<00:00:24.400> the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
on first we'll just jump out to the

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.340 
on first we'll just jump out to the
perspective<00:00:24.820> view<00:00:25.120> so<00:00:25.450> you<00:00:25.480> can<00:00:25.570> see<00:00:25.840> what

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
perspective view so you can see what

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.900 
perspective view so you can see what
this<00:00:26.470> project<00:00:26.800> is<00:00:27.040> I've<00:00:27.310> got<00:00:27.490> set<00:00:27.700> up<00:00:27.730> here

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
this project is I've got set up here

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.750 
this project is I've got set up here
it's<00:00:28.870> basically<00:00:29.200> a<00:00:29.320> grey<00:00:29.740> plane<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.430> a<00:00:30.550> bit<00:00:30.670> of

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
it's basically a grey plane and a bit of

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.639 
it's basically a grey plane and a bit of
text<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.270> the<00:00:31.660> text<00:00:31.810> as<00:00:32.020> you<00:00:32.110> can<00:00:32.230> see<00:00:32.439> is

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
text and the text as you can see is

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.889 
text and the text as you can see is
slightly<00:00:32.980> in<00:00:33.190> front<00:00:33.370> of<00:00:33.579> the<00:00:33.760> plane<00:00:34.179> that's

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
slightly in front of the plane that's

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.810 
slightly in front of the plane that's
all<00:00:35.019> there<00:00:35.109> is<00:00:35.140> to<00:00:35.320> it<00:00:35.440> but<00:00:36.070> it's<00:00:36.190> a<00:00:36.399> nice<00:00:36.640> way

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
all there is to it but it's a nice way

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.189 
all there is to it but it's a nice way
of<00:00:36.850> showing<00:00:37.239> how<00:00:37.359> this<00:00:37.570> stuff<00:00:37.780> works

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
of showing how this stuff works

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.349 
of showing how this stuff works
you'll<00:00:38.710> also<00:00:38.859> note<00:00:39.160> here<00:00:39.789> that<00:00:39.820> I've<00:00:40.030> got<00:00:40.059> my

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
you'll also note here that I've got my

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.720 
you'll also note here that I've got my
viewer<00:00:40.749> split<00:00:41.050> into<00:00:41.170> three<00:00:41.559> panels<00:00:41.949> this<00:00:42.609> is

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
viewer split into three panels this is

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.680 
viewer split into three panels this is
actually<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:42.999> first<00:00:43.059> time<00:00:43.329> I<00:00:43.390> think<00:00:43.539> that

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
actually the first time I think that

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.630 
actually the first time I think that
we've<00:00:43.870> shown<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.739> fact<00:00:44.949> that<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.129> can<00:00:45.309> split

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
we've shown the fact that you can split

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.009 
we've shown the fact that you can split
the<00:00:45.760> viewer<00:00:45.999> this<00:00:46.390> is<00:00:46.629> obviously<00:00:46.870> really

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
the viewer this is obviously really

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.110 
the viewer this is obviously really
useful<00:00:47.409> when<00:00:47.469> you're<00:00:47.589> working<00:00:47.620> in<00:00:47.949> 3d<00:00:48.399> this<00:00:48.969> is

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
useful when you're working in 3d this is

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.290 
useful when you're working in 3d this is
a<00:00:49.149> hit<00:00:49.420> from<00:00:49.600> ultimate<00:00:49.929> feature<00:00:50.159> and<00:00:51.239> yeah<00:00:52.239> you

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
a hit from ultimate feature and yeah you

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.119 
a hit from ultimate feature and yeah you
can<00:00:52.480> go<00:00:52.569> up<00:00:52.629> to<00:00:52.749> four<00:00:52.960> views<00:00:53.499> if<00:00:53.769> you<00:00:53.949> want

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
can go up to four views if you want

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.529 
can go up to four views if you want
we'll<00:00:54.640> stick<00:00:54.850> with<00:00:54.879> three<00:00:55.089> for<00:00:55.269> this<00:00:55.390> because

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
we'll stick with three for this because

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.989 
we'll stick with three for this because
that's<00:00:55.960> what<00:00:56.079> we<00:00:56.170> need<00:00:56.429> okay<00:00:57.429> so<00:00:57.670> let's<00:00:57.940> just

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
that's what we need okay so let's just

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.319 
that's what we need okay so let's just
quickly<00:00:58.510> jump<00:00:58.839> back<00:00:58.929> into<00:00:59.140> our<00:00:59.379> camera<00:01:00.329> so

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
quickly jump back into our camera so

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.209 
quickly jump back into our camera so
let's<00:01:01.479> add<00:01:01.629> this<00:01:01.809> white<00:01:02.350> light<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:03.069> we've

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
let's add this white light that we've

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.120 
let's add this white light that we've
set<00:01:03.429> up<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.870> can<00:01:05.019> see<00:01:05.170> in<00:01:05.260> these<00:01:05.380> views<00:01:05.920> here

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
set up you can see in these views here

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.650 
set up you can see in these views here
the<00:01:06.280> orthographic<00:01:06.790> views<00:01:07.000> you've<00:01:07.300> got<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.420> top

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
the orthographic views you've got a top

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.960 
the orthographic views you've got a top
view<00:01:07.690> here<00:01:08.020> in<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.170> left<00:01:08.410> view<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:09.370> light<00:01:09.640> is

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
view here in the left view the light is

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.850 
view here in the left view the light is
pointing<00:01:10.570> at<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.720> text<00:01:11.170> which<00:01:11.320> is<00:01:11.350> this<00:01:11.590> just

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
pointing at the text which is this just

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.430 
pointing at the text which is this just
here<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.370> you've<00:01:12.730> got<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.910> plane<00:01:13.150> back<00:01:14.110> here

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
here and you've got the plane back here

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.910 
here and you've got the plane back here
and<00:01:14.730> as<00:01:15.730> you<00:01:15.850> can<00:01:15.880> see<00:01:16.150> in<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.390> camera<00:01:16.750> view

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and as you can see in the camera view

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.840 
and as you can see in the camera view
this<00:01:17.920> is<00:01:18.100> lit<00:01:18.280> up<00:01:18.430> it's<00:01:18.580> a<00:01:18.610> nice<00:01:18.760> little

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
this is lit up it's a nice little

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.730 
this is lit up it's a nice little
spotlight<00:01:19.480> to<00:01:19.660> circle<00:01:20.020> going<00:01:20.140> on<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.560> we've

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
spotlight to circle going on and we've

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.040 
spotlight to circle going on and we've
got<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:20.920> shadow<00:01:21.160> that's<00:01:21.340> appeared<00:01:21.700> here<00:01:22.050> of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
got a shadow that's appeared here of

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.050 
got a shadow that's appeared here of
course<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.560> benefit<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:23.950> working<00:01:24.460> in<00:01:24.610> 3d<00:01:25.000> is

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
course the benefit of working in 3d is

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.340 
course the benefit of working in 3d is
that<00:01:25.180> you<00:01:25.330> can<00:01:25.450> move<00:01:25.600> this<00:01:25.780> around<00:01:25.930> and<00:01:26.290> it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
that you can move this around and it

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.380 
that you can move this around and it
will<00:01:26.440> just<00:01:26.590> work<00:01:26.770> naturally<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:27.760> we<00:01:28.120> can<00:01:28.240> move

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
will just work naturally so we can move

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.300 
will just work naturally so we can move
the<00:01:28.630> light<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.230> left<00:01:29.440> or<00:01:29.770> move<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.160> to<00:01:30.220> the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
the light to the left or move it to the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.070 
the light to the left or move it to the
right<00:01:30.550> you<00:01:30.880> can<00:01:31.390> see<00:01:31.510> that<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.720> shadow<00:01:31.930> is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
right you can see that the shadow is

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.860 
right you can see that the shadow is
updating<00:01:32.650> as<00:01:32.860> we<00:01:33.190> move<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.490> light<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.810> that's

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
updating as we move the light so that's

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.140 
updating as we move the light so that's
one<00:01:35.050> nice<00:01:35.140> &amp;<00:01:35.320> symfon<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.680> kind<00:01:35.830> of<00:01:35.860> works<00:01:36.150> more

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
one nice &amp; symfon it kind of works more

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.760 
one nice &amp; symfon it kind of works more
or<00:01:37.330> less<00:01:37.510> like<00:01:37.840> real<00:01:38.050> life<00:01:38.230> so<00:01:38.470> you<00:01:38.530> don't<00:01:38.590> have

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
or less like real life so you don't have

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.460 
or less like real life so you don't have
to<00:01:38.890> think<00:01:39.010> too<00:01:39.190> much<00:01:39.220> about<00:01:39.370> light<00:01:39.850> placement

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
to think too much about light placement

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.540 
to think too much about light placement
it's<00:01:41.470> different<00:01:41.680> types<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.070> lights<00:01:42.220> this<00:01:42.370> is<00:01:42.520> a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
it's different types of lights this is a

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.770 
it's different types of lights this is a
spotlight<00:01:43.000> which<00:01:43.120> we'll<00:01:43.270> be<00:01:43.300> using<00:01:43.360> for<00:01:43.630> this

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
spotlight which we'll be using for this

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.050 
spotlight which we'll be using for this
demo<00:01:44.110> you've<00:01:45.100> got<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.220> lot<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.340> control<00:01:45.700> over

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
demo you've got a lot of control over

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.550 
demo you've got a lot of control over
how<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.360> light<00:01:46.570> works<00:01:46.870> you<00:01:47.080> can<00:01:47.200> see<00:01:47.350> here

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
how the light works you can see here

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.200 
how the light works you can see here
there's<00:01:47.680> all<00:01:47.770> sorts<00:01:48.070> of<00:01:48.190> settings<00:01:48.790> for

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
there's all sorts of settings for

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.460 
there's all sorts of settings for
filling<00:01:49.540> around<00:01:49.750> we<00:01:49.870> won't<00:01:50.020> go<00:01:50.110> into<00:01:50.260> all<00:01:50.380> of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
filling around we won't go into all of

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.340 
filling around we won't go into all of
those<00:01:50.590> in<00:01:51.070> detail<00:01:51.730> at<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.880> moment<00:01:52.300> okay<00:01:53.200> let's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
those in detail at the moment okay let's

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.300 
those in detail at the moment okay let's
turn<00:01:53.470> on<00:01:53.590> some<00:01:53.620> more<00:01:53.890> lights<00:01:54.100> because<00:01:54.250> you

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
turn on some more lights because you

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.350 
turn on some more lights because you
don't<00:01:54.430> have<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.610> work<00:01:54.760> with<00:01:54.850> just<00:01:54.940> one<00:01:55.150> light

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
don't have to work with just one light

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.610 
don't have to work with just one light
you<00:01:55.450> can<00:01:55.600> have<00:01:55.720> as<00:01:55.930> many<00:01:56.050> as<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.320> want

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
you can have as many as you want

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.610 
you can have as many as you want
for<00:01:57.160> example<00:01:57.490> let's<00:01:57.610> turn<00:01:57.730> on<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:57.940> red<00:01:58.120> light

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
for example let's turn on this red light

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.860 
for example let's turn on this red light
here<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.650> can<00:01:59.980> see<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.340> lights<00:02:00.550> are

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
here you can see that the lights are

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.910 
here you can see that the lights are
blending<00:02:01.870> together<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:02.440> we've<00:02:02.530> got<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.710> white

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
blending together so we've got the white

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.680 
blending together so we've got the white
and<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.490> red<00:02:03.640> light<00:02:03.820> working<00:02:04.270> here<00:02:04.450> we've<00:02:04.600> got

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
and the red light working here we've got

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.330 
and the red light working here we've got
the<00:02:04.810> two<00:02:04.990> shadows<00:02:05.380> this<00:02:05.560> one<00:02:05.770> here<00:02:05.980> from<00:02:06.190> the

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
the two shadows this one here from the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.860 
the two shadows this one here from the
white<00:02:06.520> light<00:02:06.730> this<00:02:07.120> one<00:02:07.330> here<00:02:07.480> from<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.720> red

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
white light this one here from the red

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.229 
white light this one here from the red
light<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.950> shadow<00:02:09.310> has<00:02:09.459> been<00:02:09.579> set<00:02:09.789> up<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.119> be

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
light this shadow has been set up to be

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.699 
light this shadow has been set up to be
a<00:02:10.269> bit<00:02:10.390> more<00:02:10.509> diffused<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:11.079> it's<00:02:11.230> softer<00:02:11.680> than

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
a bit more diffused so it's softer than

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.699 
a bit more diffused so it's softer than
this<00:02:12.159> really<00:02:12.430> harsh<00:02:12.640> shadow<00:02:12.969> here

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
this really harsh shadow here

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.890 
this really harsh shadow here
can<00:02:13.950> turn<00:02:14.069> on<00:02:14.159> a<00:02:14.220> blue<00:02:14.430> light<00:02:14.610> again<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.720> light

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
can turn on a blue light again the light

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.690 
can turn on a blue light again the light
will<00:02:16.170> blends<00:02:16.409> together<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.040> we've<00:02:17.280> got<00:02:17.430> 1/3

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
will blends together and we've got 1/3

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.940 
will blends together and we've got 1/3
shadow<00:02:18.079> you<00:02:19.079> can<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.379> over<00:02:19.560> here<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.769> we've

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
shadow you can see over here that we've

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.319 
shadow you can see over here that we've
got<00:02:20.069> our<00:02:20.189> three<00:02:20.340> lights<00:02:20.640> showing<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
got our three lights showing the

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.360 
got our three lights showing the
position<00:02:21.720> our<00:02:21.870> cameras<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:22.379> here<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.250> it's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
position our cameras just here so it's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.890 
position our cameras just here so it's
very<00:02:23.400> easy<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.790> position<00:02:24.269> all<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.420> stuff<00:02:24.689> in

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
very easy to position all this stuff in

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.229 
very easy to position all this stuff in
3d<00:02:25.439> okay<00:02:26.370> let's<00:02:26.549> just<00:02:26.670> look<00:02:26.819> at<00:02:26.970> another

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
3d okay let's just look at another

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.690 
3d okay let's just look at another
example<00:02:28.010> we'll<00:02:29.010> go<00:02:29.129> over<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:29.430> we've<00:02:29.670> got

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
example we'll go over here we've got

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.270 
example we'll go over here we've got
another<00:02:30.239> plane<00:02:30.599> here<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:30.900> some<00:02:31.530> text<00:02:31.980> sitting

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
another plane here and some text sitting

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.920 
another plane here and some text sitting
on<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.879> can<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.239> shadow<00:02:33.480> at<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.689> base

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
on it you can see the shadow at the base

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.780 
on it you can see the shadow at the base
here<00:02:34.319> where<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.950> text<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.340> connecting<00:02:35.760> with

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
here where the text is connecting with

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.000 
here where the text is connecting with
the<00:02:35.939> plane<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.450> fairly<00:02:37.019> sharp<00:02:37.290> where<00:02:37.709> as<00:02:37.769> it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
the plane is a fairly sharp where as it

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.429 
the plane is a fairly sharp where as it
gets<00:02:38.189> further<00:02:38.400> away<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.060> get<00:02:39.450> softer<00:02:39.959> we've

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
gets further away you get softer we've

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.809 
gets further away you get softer we've
animated<00:02:40.859> this<00:02:40.920> text<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.370> moved<00:02:41.579> slightly

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
animated this text and moved slightly

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.280 
animated this text and moved slightly
you<00:02:42.120> can<00:02:42.239> see<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.540> as<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:42.659> moves<00:02:42.989> away<00:02:43.170> from

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
you can see that as it moves away from

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.780 
you can see that as it moves away from
the<00:02:43.530> plane<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.010> shadow<00:02:44.189> actually<00:02:44.459> gets

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
the plane the shadow actually gets

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.879 
the plane the shadow actually gets
softer<00:02:45.269> this<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.959> all<00:02:46.079> optional<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.560> depends

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
softer this is all optional and depends

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.890 
softer this is all optional and depends
how<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.069> set<00:02:47.310> up<00:02:47.340> your<00:02:47.519> project<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.599> you<00:02:48.750> can

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
how you set up your project but you can

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.210 
how you set up your project but you can
see<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.139> if<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.319> want<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.590> can<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:49.739> very

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
see that if you want you can have very

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.580 
see that if you want you can have very
very<00:02:50.430> realistic<00:02:51.090> shadows<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:52.200> for<00:02:52.319> one<00:02:52.409> more

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
very realistic shadows so for one more

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.930 
very realistic shadows so for one more
example<00:02:52.859> let's<00:02:53.129> go<00:02:53.159> back<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.579> this<00:02:53.700> scene

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
example let's go back to this scene

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.220 
example let's go back to this scene
which<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.090> saw<00:02:54.329> earlier<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> week<00:02:54.989> with

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
which you saw earlier in the week with

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.750 
which you saw earlier in the week with
some<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.530> particles<00:02:56.010> we've<00:02:56.159> customized

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
some of the particles we've customized

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.460 
some of the particles we've customized
it<00:02:56.940> slightly<00:02:57.389> so<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.840> particles<00:02:58.230> behave

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
it slightly so the particles behave

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.140 
it slightly so the particles behave
differently<00:02:58.889> and<00:02:59.430> set<00:02:59.639> up<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.819> light<00:03:00.000> that's

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
differently and set up a light that's

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.360 
differently and set up a light that's
actually<00:03:00.420> casting<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.870> shadow<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.189> see

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
actually casting a shadow so you can see

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.009 
actually casting a shadow so you can see
here<00:03:02.609> that<00:03:02.790> as<00:03:02.909> the<00:03:03.060> particles<00:03:03.599> are<00:03:03.689> created

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
here that as the particles are created

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.750 
here that as the particles are created
they're<00:03:04.200> casting<00:03:04.530> shadows<00:03:04.859> on<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.159> floor<00:03:05.400> and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
they're casting shadows on the floor and

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.720 
they're casting shadows on the floor and
on<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:05.939> walls<00:03:06.209> as<00:03:06.540> required

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
on the walls as required

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.860 
on the walls as required
we've<00:03:08.730> only<00:03:08.819> set<00:03:09.030> up<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.209> single<00:03:09.420> light<00:03:09.659> here

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
we've only set up a single light here

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.240 
we've only set up a single light here
for<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.079> demonstration<00:03:10.260> coming<00:03:11.040> down<00:03:11.189> from

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
for this demonstration coming down from

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.069 
for this demonstration coming down from
the<00:03:11.370> top<00:03:11.400> sort<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.180> simulating<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:12.840> light

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
the top sort of simulating this light

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.690 
the top sort of simulating this light
here<00:03:13.319> obviously<00:03:14.040> if<00:03:14.099> you<00:03:14.189> wanted<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.609> could

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
here obviously if you wanted you could

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.580 
here obviously if you wanted you could
also<00:03:14.849> set<00:03:15.120> up<00:03:15.239> lights<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.959> match<00:03:16.170> these<00:03:16.409> other

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
also set up lights to match these other

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.589 
also set up lights to match these other
ones<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:17.639> you've<00:03:17.730> got<00:03:17.819> a<00:03:17.849> lot<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.060> flexibility

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
ones so you've got a lot of flexibility

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.610 
ones so you've got a lot of flexibility
whether<00:03:18.870> you're<00:03:18.989> trying<00:03:19.169> to<00:03:19.230> match<00:03:19.379> something

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
whether you're trying to match something

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.500 
whether you're trying to match something
in<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:19.859> live-action<00:03:20.069> shot<00:03:20.699> or<00:03:20.910> create<00:03:21.329> some

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
in a live-action shot or create some

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.509 
in a live-action shot or create some
interesting<00:03:21.750> motion<00:03:22.290> graphics<00:03:22.739> as<00:03:23.190> always

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
interesting motion graphics as always

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.379 
interesting motion graphics as always
let<00:03:23.790> us<00:03:23.819> know<00:03:23.910> if<00:03:24.090> you've<00:03:24.180> got<00:03:24.269> questions
