00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.260 

a<00:00:34.900> pint<00:00:35.500> of<00:00:35.620> water

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.700 

it's<00:00:40.720> really<00:00:41.080> hard<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:42.630> paint<00:00:43.630> paint<00:00:44.440> of<00:00:44.560> water

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
it's really hard to paint paint of water

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.320 
it's really hard to paint paint of water
look<00:00:45.310> like<00:00:45.520> a<00:00:45.550> cup<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:45.880> tea<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.450> easy<00:00:48.330> just

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
look like a cup of tea that easy just

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.290 
look like a cup of tea that easy just
sit<00:00:49.540> down<00:00:49.570> nicely<00:00:50.580> and

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.530 

and<00:00:55.719> shut<00:00:56.020> this

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:10.780 

it's<00:01:02.960> about<00:01:03.170> what<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.380> wear

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.420 

comes<00:01:11.420> with<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.630> neoprene<00:01:12.320> cover<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:13.040> take

off

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.540 

that's<00:01:17.140> what<00:01:17.440> I<00:01:17.650> think<00:01:17.920> it's<00:01:18.070> just<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.400> keep

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
that's what I think it's just to keep

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.390 
that's what I think it's just to keep
things<00:01:18.610> warm<00:01:19.210> inside<00:01:19.510> it<00:01:19.900> on<00:01:20.290> your<00:01:20.470> vote<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
things warm inside it on your vote and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.649 
things warm inside it on your vote and
it<00:01:24.400> also<00:01:24.640> has<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.910> lid<00:01:25.650> silicon<00:01:26.650> lid<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.340> kin

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
it also has a lid silicon lid and kin

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.930 
it also has a lid silicon lid and kin
little

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
little

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.240 
little
right<00:01:35.210> at<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.420> bottom<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.750> carry<00:01:35.960> on<00:01:36.140> nice

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.800 

that's<00:01:43.880> grown

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
that's grown

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.270 
that's grown
probably<00:01:46.500> an<00:01:46.560> already

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.660 

come<00:01:53.850> on

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:30.650 

I<00:02:20.110> think<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.800> condenser<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.670> matter<00:02:21.910> what

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.770

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.610 

it's<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> good<00:03:29.060> read<00:03:29.240> test<00:03:29.540> hot<00:03:29.720> water<00:03:29.930> red<00:03:30.410> hot

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.690 

hardening<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.580> cast<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.150> full<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.080> know

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:54.870 

and<00:03:42.209> turn<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.629> off

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:02.400 

that's<00:03:55.270> hot<00:03:55.480> enough<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.810> boiler<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.900> that

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
that's hot enough the boiler and that

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.890 
that's hot enough the boiler and that
was<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:06.370> under<00:04:06.820> three<00:04:07.060> minutes<00:04:07.270> to<00:04:07.510> full

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.620 
was just under three minutes to full
boil<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.350> reckon
