now let's look at the benefits of each

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.300 
now let's look at the benefits of each
individual<00:01:36.000> BCA<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:37.619> first<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.189> will

individual BCA the first one we will

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.840 
individual BCA the first one we will
discuss<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.909> leucine<00:01:39.979> leucine<00:01:40.979> increases

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
discuss is leucine leucine increases

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
discuss is leucine leucine increases
insulin<00:01:42.150> secretion<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:43.409> better<00:01:43.590> uptake<00:01:43.829> of

insulin secretion for better uptake of
carbohydrates<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.030> protein<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:46.560> help

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
carbohydrates and protein this will help

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.880 
carbohydrates and protein this will help

to build more muscle leucine also works

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
to build more muscle leucine also works
in<00:01:50.070> conjunction<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> other<00:01:50.909> two<00:01:51.210> BCA<00:01:51.600> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
in conjunction with the other two BCA is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.410 
in conjunction with the other two BCA is
