00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
need to do is plug in the battery if you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.850 
need to do is plug in the battery if you
trouble<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.570> zero<00:00:45.989> that's<00:00:46.289> very<00:00:46.500> bored

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
trouble at zero that's very bored

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:56.979 
trouble at zero that's very bored
important<00:00:48.110> put<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.010> way

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.459 

never<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:59.059> over<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.390> bead<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
never here right over a bead and it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.090 
never here right over a bead and it
means<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.190> bonded<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:03.090> transmitter

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
means it's bonded to your transmitter

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.219 
means it's bonded to your transmitter
now<00:01:05.100> when<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> first<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.450> fly<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.869> you

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
now when you first want to fly it you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.460 
now when you first want to fly it you
always<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.010> calibrate<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:10.260> will

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
always have to calibrate it so it will

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.490 
always have to calibrate it so it will
fly<00:01:10.680> straight<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.689> first<00:01:13.049> what<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.200> need<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
fly straight so first what you need to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.149 
fly straight so first what you need to
do<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.890> place<00:01:14.280> your<00:01:14.340> hips<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.090> x4<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:16.290> flat

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
do is place your hips on x4 on flat

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.240 
do is place your hips on x4 on flat
ground<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:19.710> got<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:21.299> best<00:01:21.570> gyro<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.860> gyro

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
ground so you got the best gyro the gyro

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.630 
ground so you got the best gyro the gyro
so<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.840> most<00:01:25.110> stabilized<00:01:25.740> only

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so that is the most stabilized only

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880 
so that is the most stabilized only
because<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> place<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.619> will

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
because if you place like this it will

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.910 
because if you place like this it will
fly<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.290> where<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.770> this

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
fly like this where your do it like this

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.770 
fly like this where your do it like this
will<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.520> hover<00:01:33.350> quite<00:01:34.350> good<00:01:34.650> without

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
will just hover quite good without

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
will just hover quite good without
having<00:01:36.780> much<00:01:36.930> trim<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.070> see<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.700> works

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
having much trim so you can see it works

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.719 
having much trim so you can see it works
right<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:40.939> what<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> first<00:01:42.299> need<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.780> is

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
right now what you first need to do is

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.800 
right now what you first need to do is
put<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.470> expert<00:01:46.470> mode<00:01:46.579> which<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.880> it's

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
put it on expert mode which is it's

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.840 
put it on expert mode which is it's
flickering<00:01:49.290> down<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:50.310> means<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.700> an

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
flickering down that means it's an

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.630 
flickering down that means it's an
expert<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.470> do<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.649> by<00:01:52.890> pressing<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
expert that do this by pressing the

expert that do this by pressing the
other<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:58.640> for<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.939> backward<00:02:00.299> stick<00:02:00.960> one

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
other on and for and backward stick one

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.750 
other on and for and backward stick one
time

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
time

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760 
time
now<00:02:04.760> it<00:02:04.970> means<00:02:05.180> when<00:02:05.720> flickering<00:02:06.320> that's<00:02:06.560> on

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
now it means when flickering that's on

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.950 
now it means when flickering that's on
expert<00:02:07.370> mode<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:07.760> says<00:02:08.090> also<00:02:08.539> on<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.899> screen
