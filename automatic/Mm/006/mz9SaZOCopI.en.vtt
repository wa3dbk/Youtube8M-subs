00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.230
 a folder and completely 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.660
 nominees 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.750
 no we go through the area where the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.920
 ergoline chip occurred 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.670
 it's like flying over it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.979
 it is very beautiful and drawn or want that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.450
 I'm not sure 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.479
 it would not be cheap and switch too 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.479
 to make 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.990
 it is his whole story together then 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.640
 also video photos texts images together 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.350
 course, makes it pretty to costs 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.320
 a costly project and the html5 piece 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.610
 so they put the whole project together so there 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.930
 is being written 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.680
 whisper that it is a few tons 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.430
 has cost but it also has some 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.560
 flush the chapter sari toasting 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.259
 more texts it pictures for us 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.649
 another small video often turns it around 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.920
 muscle impact what more does it feel 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.479
 story really makes you feel like your 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.340
 england you can experience and in between 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.560
 an advertisement because yes it is only 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.360
 later put between I noticed in 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.280
 it started when i viewed in this site 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.390
 was not yet there between people thought 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.560
 probably let many people come 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.210
 were busy 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.250
 later ad were stuck 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.869
 which is particularly unfortunate that they meet this 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.020
 have chosen to have something nicer in it 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.050
 proud so pretty free 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.690

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.160

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.709

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.980

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.319

 the work look of the area but this 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.269
 was actually for quite so small 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.370
 bit about what exactly is on the strips 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.739

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.180
 crazier than I taught them their necks 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.700
 black spartoo the pipette they have according to 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.489
 piece smeared in a few parts 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.810
 also useful because to do that way 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.120
 for your readers to hold on to 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.610

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.980
 a 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.639
 from a cross media story into one
