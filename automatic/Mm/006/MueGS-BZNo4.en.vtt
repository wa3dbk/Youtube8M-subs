00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:25.620 
now the top one is moving that's pushing
the<00:02:17.260> valve<00:02:17.470> down<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.190> open<00:02:18.730> alright<00:02:20.580> now<00:02:24.630> we

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
the valve down and open alright now we

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.230 
the valve down and open alright now we
can't<00:02:25.900> check<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.290> clearance<00:02:27.060> unless<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
can't check the clearance unless the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.710 
can't check the clearance unless the
valve<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.780> totally<00:02:29.290> slack<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:30.570> don't<00:02:31.570> know<00:02:31.630> if

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
valve is totally slack I don't know if

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.520 
valve is totally slack I don't know if
you<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.900> hear<00:02:32.110> that

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
you can hear that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.680 
you can hear that
now<00:02:33.220> it's<00:02:33.430> slack<00:02:33.760> now<00:02:34.000> how<00:02:34.150> do<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.300> know<00:02:34.480> when

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
now it's slack now how do you know when

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.720 
now it's slack now how do you know when
it's<00:02:34.840> slack<00:02:35.350> well<00:02:35.710> this<00:02:36.160> gear<00:02:36.460> right<00:02:36.700> here

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
it's slack well this gear right here

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.540 
it's slack well this gear right here
when<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.210> spins<00:02:37.510> around<00:02:37.630> 360<00:02:38.440> degrees<00:02:38.920> each

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
when it spins around 360 degrees each

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.090 
when it spins around 360 degrees each
valve<00:02:40.000> will<00:02:40.270> open<00:02:40.420> one<00:02:40.810> time<00:02:41.110> so<00:02:41.800> what<00:02:41.980> you're

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
valve will open one time so what you're

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.310 
valve will open one time so what you're
going<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.280> do<00:02:42.550> is<00:02:42.910> you're<00:02:43.690> going<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.840> spin<00:02:44.200> it

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
going to do is you're going to spin it

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:53.100 
going to do is you're going to spin it
until<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:46.330> valve<00:02:46.570> opens<00:02:50.280> right<00:02:51.280> there<00:02:52.110> and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
until the valve opens right there and

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.100 
until the valve opens right there and
you're<00:02:53.380> going<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.710> right<00:02:54.520> there<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.960> then

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
you're going to right there and then

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.020 
you're going to right there and then
you're<00:02:56.170> going<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.470> make<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.650> mental<00:02:57.070> note<00:02:57.130> as<00:02:57.610> to

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
you're going to make a mental note as to

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.600 
you're going to make a mental note as to
which<00:02:58.390> part<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.050> cam<00:02:59.350> shaft<00:03:00.190> right<00:03:00.580> here

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
which part of the cam shaft right here

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.000 
which part of the cam shaft right here
is<00:03:01.090> facing<00:03:01.540> upwards<00:03:01.960> and<00:03:02.200> then<00:03:02.740> we're<00:03:02.920> going

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
is facing upwards and then we're going

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.900 
is facing upwards and then we're going
to<00:03:03.070> go<00:03:03.660> on<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:04.930> 80<00:03:05.020> degrees<00:03:05.580> from<00:03:06.580> there

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
to go on it and 80 degrees from there

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.500 
to go on it and 80 degrees from there
which<00:03:07.420> would<00:03:07.630> be<00:03:07.870> right<00:03:08.110> there<00:03:08.560> okay<00:03:09.450> now<00:03:10.450> we

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
which would be right there okay now we

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.540 
which would be right there okay now we
take<00:03:10.840> out<00:03:11.080> our<00:03:12.570> feeler<00:03:13.570> gauges<00:03:13.810> okay<00:03:14.740> feeler

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
take out our feeler gauges okay feeler

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.640 
take out our feeler gauges okay feeler
gauges<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.150> can<00:03:16.270> use<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.510> angled<00:03:16.990> kind<00:03:17.320> like

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
gauges you can use the angled kind like

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.050 
gauges you can use the angled kind like
these<00:03:17.860> which<00:03:18.100> are<00:03:18.250> pretty<00:03:18.430> much<00:03:18.520> made<00:03:18.820> for

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
these which are pretty much made for

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.090 
these which are pretty much made for
valve<00:03:19.270> jobs<00:03:19.600> or<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.350> can<00:03:20.530> use<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.830> straight

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
valve jobs or you can use the straight

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.070 
valve jobs or you can use the straight
kind<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:22.000> engine<00:03:22.360> has<00:03:22.510> enough<00:03:22.750> clearance

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
kind this engine has enough clearance

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.400 
kind this engine has enough clearance
for<00:03:23.410> either<00:03:23.800> one<00:03:24.360> I'll<00:03:25.360> use<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.810> angle<00:03:26.170> kind

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
for either one I'll use the angle kind

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.199 
for either one I'll use the angle kind
now<00:03:28.350> intake<00:03:29.350> valve<00:03:29.560> clearance<00:03:30.160> is<00:03:30.430> supposed

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
now intake valve clearance is supposed

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.570 
now intake valve clearance is supposed
to<00:03:31.360> be<00:03:31.600> from<00:03:31.930> what<00:03:32.080> I've<00:03:32.230> read<00:03:32.580> six

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
to be from what I've read six

there<00:04:30.340> if<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.180> put<00:04:31.419> seven<00:04:31.900> in<00:04:32.020> there<00:04:32.259> it's<00:04:32.680> going

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
there if I put seven in there it's going

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.420 
there if I put seven in there it's going
to<00:04:32.949> be<00:04:33.069> either<00:04:33.250> tight<00:04:34.889> where<00:04:35.889> won't<00:04:36.039> go<00:04:36.159> in<00:04:36.340> at

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
to be either tight where won't go in at

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.279 
to be either tight where won't go in at
all<00:04:38.460> barely<00:04:39.460> going<00:04:39.819> in<00:04:40.060> if<00:04:40.180> I<00:04:40.270> forced<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.870> in<00:04:41.080> it

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
all barely going in if I forced it in it

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.390 
all barely going in if I forced it in it
could<00:04:41.440> go<00:04:41.620> in<00:04:41.800> maybe<00:04:43.949> that<00:04:44.949> wouldn't<00:04:45.280> be<00:04:45.370> right

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
could go in maybe that wouldn't be right

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.240 
could go in maybe that wouldn't be right
so<00:04:46.210> this<00:04:46.330> one's<00:04:46.539> totally<00:04:46.810> in<00:04:47.110> spec<00:04:47.440> all<00:04:48.039> right

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
so this one's totally in spec all right

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.890 
so this one's totally in spec all right
now<00:04:48.759> for<00:04:48.819> the<00:04:49.090> bottom<00:04:49.240> one<00:04:49.449> I'm<00:04:49.659> going<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.810> do

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
now for the bottom one I'm going to do

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.680 
now for the bottom one I'm going to do
the<00:04:49.990> exact<00:04:50.289> same<00:04:50.319> thing<00:04:50.860> so<00:04:54.210> I'm<00:04:55.210> going<00:04:55.539> to

what position that's in I want to go 180

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.159 
what position that's in I want to go 180
degrees<00:05:08.759> right<00:05:09.759> about<00:05:10.000> there<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.539> now<00:05:11.050> I'm

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.360 
that to the adjuster in this situation
alright<00:05:22.389> here's<00:05:22.629> our<00:05:22.719> exhaust<00:05:23.130> exhaust<00:05:24.130> valve

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
alright here's our exhaust exhaust valve

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.279 
alright here's our exhaust exhaust valve
adjuster<00:05:24.789> let<00:05:25.000> me<00:05:25.060> just<00:05:25.210> say<00:05:25.330> this<00:05:25.479> to<00:05:25.719> this

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
adjuster let me just say this to this

particular<00:05:26.500> scooter<00:05:27.130> is<00:05:27.190> equipped<00:05:28.029> with<00:05:28.120> a

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
particular scooter is equipped with a

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.930 
particular scooter is equipped with a
decompression<00:05:28.960> valve<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:30.310> basically<00:05:30.729> what

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
decompression valve and basically what

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.300 
decompression valve and basically what
that<00:05:30.969> does<00:05:31.120> is<00:05:31.539> it<00:05:31.690> releases<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.680> compression

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
that does is it releases the compression

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.700 
that does is it releases the compression
while<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.150> engine<00:05:34.389> starting<00:05:34.870> it<00:05:35.289> allows<00:05:35.500> the

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
while the engine starting it allows the

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.050 
while the engine starting it allows the
starter<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.279> turn<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.639> engine<00:05:36.940> a<00:05:36.969> little

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
starter to turn the engine a little

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.260 
starter to turn the engine a little
easily<00:05:37.389> more<00:05:38.259> easily<00:05:38.590> however<00:05:38.969> if<00:05:39.969> the<00:05:40.120> D

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
easily more easily however if the D

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.200 
easily more easily however if the D
compressor<00:05:40.870> is<00:05:41.020> engaged<00:05:41.789> it<00:05:42.789> will<00:05:42.969> put

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
compressor is engaged it will put

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.670 
compressor is engaged it will put
pressure<00:05:43.509> on<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:43.960> valve<00:05:44.169> and<00:05:44.319> you<00:05:44.409> will<00:05:44.560> not

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
pressure on the valve and you will not

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.529 
pressure on the valve and you will not
be<00:05:44.800> able<00:05:44.860> to<00:05:44.949> adjust<00:05:45.099> it<00:05:45.430> how<00:05:46.120> do<00:05:46.180> you<00:05:46.270> know<00:05:46.419> if

that's good now let's talk about what

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.920 
that's good now let's talk about what
you<00:06:12.009> would<00:06:12.129> do<00:06:12.370> if<00:06:12.729> the<00:06:13.000> exhaust<00:06:13.419> valve<00:06:13.750> where

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
you would do if the exhaust valve where

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.339 
you would do if the exhaust valve where
the<00:06:14.020> intake<00:06:14.349> valve<00:06:14.590> was<00:06:14.860> not<00:06:15.240> inspect

the intake valve was not inspect

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.180 
the intake valve was not inspect
basically<00:06:17.349> what<00:06:17.529> you<00:06:17.620> would<00:06:17.740> do<00:06:17.860> is<00:06:18.009> you<00:06:18.099> would

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
basically what you would do is you would

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
basically what you would do is you would
take<00:06:18.250> a<00:06:18.400> nine<00:06:18.729> millimeter<00:06:19.000> wrench<00:06:19.710> right<00:06:20.710> here

you would loosen up the lock nut right

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.029 
you would loosen up the lock nut right
here<00:06:25.719> and<00:06:27.120> then<00:06:28.229> just<00:06:29.229> with<00:06:29.349> your<00:06:29.500> fingers<00:06:29.889> you

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
here and then just with your fingers you

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.519 
here and then just with your fingers you
can<00:06:30.190> grab<00:06:30.490> this<00:06:31.210> little<00:06:31.690> screw<00:06:32.050> right<00:06:32.080> here

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:32.529 
can grab this little screw right here

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:33.809 
can grab this little screw right here
the<00:06:32.589> adjuster<00:06:33.039> screw<00:06:33.309> and<00:06:33.519> you're<00:06:33.579> going<00:06:33.759> to

hair and then you're going to tighten it

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:40.439 
hair and then you're going to tighten it
back<00:06:37.449> up<00:06:38.069> after<00:06:39.069> that<00:06:39.249> you<00:06:39.969> check<00:06:40.269> the

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
back up after that you check the

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:41.969 
back up after that you check the
clearance<00:06:40.719> with<00:06:40.989> your<00:06:41.109> feeler<00:06:41.349> gauge<00:06:41.619> and<00:06:41.949> you

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
clearance with your feeler gauge and you

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:43.799 
clearance with your feeler gauge and you
may<00:06:42.189> have<00:06:42.309> to<00:06:42.459> do<00:06:42.609> it<00:06:42.729> a<00:06:42.789> couple<00:06:42.999> times<00:06:43.269> to<00:06:43.539> get

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:43.809 
may have to do it a couple times to get

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:46.769 
may have to do it a couple times to get
it<00:06:43.959> right<00:06:44.199> Honda<00:06:44.949> does<00:06:45.189> sell<00:06:45.549> as<00:06:46.539> most

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:46.779 
it right Honda does sell as most

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.569 
it right Honda does sell as most
manufacturers<00:06:47.409> do<00:06:47.619> a<00:06:47.649> special<00:06:48.099> tool<00:06:48.279> for<00:06:48.489> this

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:48.579 
manufacturers do a special tool for this

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:50.969 
manufacturers do a special tool for this
and<00:06:48.849> it's<00:06:49.359> kind<00:06:49.599> of<00:06:49.659> like<00:06:49.719> a<00:06:49.869> screwdriver<00:06:50.499> that

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979 
and it's kind of like a screwdriver that

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.189 
and it's kind of like a screwdriver that
fits<00:06:51.189> inside<00:06:51.399> of<00:06:51.639> a<00:06:51.849> socket<00:06:52.149> I've<00:06:52.899> never

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
fits inside of a socket I've never

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.229 
fits inside of a socket I've never
needed<00:06:53.379> one<00:06:53.529> and<00:06:53.949> you<00:06:54.639> don't<00:06:54.729> really<00:06:54.879> need<00:06:55.059> one

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:55.239 
needed one and you don't really need one

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:59.699 
needed one and you don't really need one
either<00:06:55.359> so<00:06:56.609> that's<00:06:57.609> that<00:06:57.939> so<00:06:58.599> that's<00:06:59.379> a<00:06:59.499> valve

00:06:59.699 --> 00:06:59.709 
either so that's that so that's a valve

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:03.289 
either so that's that so that's a valve
adjustment<00:06:59.849> it's<00:07:00.849> not<00:07:01.329> too<00:07:01.539> difficult<00:07:01.779> and

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:03.299 
adjustment it's not too difficult and

00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:05.359 
adjustment it's not too difficult and
you<00:07:04.299> should<00:07:04.479> be<00:07:04.569> able<00:07:04.719> to<00:07:04.779> do<00:07:04.869> it<00:07:04.989> yourself

00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:05.369 
you should be able to do it yourself

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:09.059 
you should be able to do it yourself
everything<00:07:06.369> else<00:07:06.579> get<00:07:06.789> is<00:07:06.879> back<00:07:07.059> together<00:07:08.069> in

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:09.069 
everything else get is back together in

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:11.849 
everything else get is back together in
the<00:07:09.219> reverse<00:07:09.519> of<00:07:10.419> what<00:07:10.479> you<00:07:10.749> took<00:07:10.899> it<00:07:11.049> apart<00:07:11.349> my

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:11.859 
the reverse of what you took it apart my

00:07:11.859 --> 00:07:13.919 
the reverse of what you took it apart my
only<00:07:12.219> words<00:07:12.459> of<00:07:12.759> wisdom<00:07:12.969> are<00:07:13.419> when<00:07:13.779> you're

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:13.929 
only words of wisdom are when you're

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:17.219 
only words of wisdom are when you're
putting<00:07:14.259> on<00:07:14.619> the<00:07:15.369> valve<00:07:15.609> cover<00:07:16.049> when<00:07:17.049> you're

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
putting on the valve cover when you're

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.109 
putting on the valve cover when you're
putting<00:07:17.439> on<00:07:17.589> two<00:07:17.739> two<00:07:17.949> main<00:07:18.399> bolts<00:07:18.759> that<00:07:18.969> hold

00:07:19.109 --> 00:07:19.119 
putting on two two main bolts that hold

00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:21.299 
putting on two two main bolts that hold
it<00:07:19.329> on<00:07:19.449> they<00:07:20.019> do<00:07:20.229> not<00:07:20.259> need<00:07:20.649> a<00:07:20.709> lot<00:07:20.799> of<00:07:20.979> pressure

00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:21.309 
it on they do not need a lot of pressure

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:24.119 
it on they do not need a lot of pressure
okay<00:07:21.639> or<00:07:22.479> a<00:07:22.509> lot<00:07:22.749> of<00:07:22.869> torque<00:07:23.169> because<00:07:23.889> they<00:07:24.009> are

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:24.129 
okay or a lot of torque because they are

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:25.949 
okay or a lot of torque because they are
simply<00:07:24.429> going<00:07:24.639> into<00:07:24.999> this<00:07:25.149> soft<00:07:25.449> aluminum

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:25.959 
simply going into this soft aluminum

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:27.959 
simply going into this soft aluminum
right<00:07:26.109> here<00:07:26.409> and<00:07:26.589> it's<00:07:27.009> a<00:07:27.069> steel<00:07:27.339> bolt<00:07:27.579> you<00:07:27.849> got

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:27.969 
right here and it's a steel bolt you got

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:29.129 
right here and it's a steel bolt you got
to<00:07:28.089> remember<00:07:28.239> when<00:07:28.509> you're<00:07:28.659> working<00:07:28.899> with<00:07:28.929> any

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:29.139 
to remember when you're working with any

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:31.289 
to remember when you're working with any
of<00:07:29.229> these<00:07:29.349> engines<00:07:29.799> the<00:07:30.519> majority<00:07:31.029> of<00:07:31.089> time

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:31.299 
of these engines the majority of time

00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:33.299 
of these engines the majority of time
you're<00:07:31.509> putting<00:07:31.749> a<00:07:31.779> steel<00:07:32.019> fastener<00:07:32.619> into<00:07:32.859> an

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:33.309 
you're putting a steel fastener into an

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:35.789 
you're putting a steel fastener into an
aluminum<00:07:33.789> block<00:07:33.939> and<00:07:34.719> obviously<00:07:35.139> steel<00:07:35.559> is

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:35.799 
aluminum block and obviously steel is

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:40.019 
aluminum block and obviously steel is
much<00:07:36.129> more<00:07:36.629> hard<00:07:37.629> than<00:07:37.959> aluminum<00:07:38.739> is<00:07:38.889> so<00:07:39.159> in<00:07:39.879> a

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:40.029 
much more hard than aluminum is so in a

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:42.179 
much more hard than aluminum is so in a
battle<00:07:40.419> Steel's<00:07:41.259> going<00:07:41.379> to<00:07:41.559> win<00:07:41.649> all<00:07:41.829> the<00:07:41.949> time

00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:42.189 
battle Steel's going to win all the time

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:43.739 
battle Steel's going to win all the time
so<00:07:42.849> that's<00:07:43.029> it<00:07:43.209> we're<00:07:43.329> going<00:07:43.419> to<00:07:43.479> put<00:07:43.569> it<00:07:43.659> back

00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:43.749 
so that's it we're going to put it back

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:47.189 
so that's it we're going to put it back
together<00:07:43.959> and<00:07:44.759> see<00:07:45.759> how<00:07:45.789> she<00:07:45.909> runs<00:07:46.119> and<00:07:47.019> there

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 
together and see how she runs and there

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.169 
together and see how she runs and there
she<00:07:47.409> is<00:07:47.439> put<00:07:47.769> back<00:07:47.949> together<00:07:48.129> will<00:07:48.819> take<00:07:49.029> you

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:49.179 
she is put back together will take you

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:52.829 
she is put back together will take you
about<00:07:49.319> maybe<00:07:50.319> a<00:07:50.409> half<00:07:50.649> hour<00:07:50.860> or<00:07:51.159> so<00:07:51.299> to<00:07:52.299> put

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:52.839 
about maybe a half hour or so to put

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:55.949 
about maybe a half hour or so to put
everything<00:07:53.049> back<00:07:53.259> together<00:07:53.529> right<00:07:54.959> that's

00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:55.959 
everything back together right that's

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:57.749 
everything back together right that's
about<00:07:56.169> it<00:07:56.349> so<00:07:56.649> hopefully<00:07:57.339> that<00:07:57.610> was<00:07:57.699> helpful

00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 
about it so hopefully that was helpful

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.839 
about it so hopefully that was helpful
and<00:07:58.529> hopefully<00:07:59.529> worked<00:07:59.799> out<00:08:00.009> for<00:08:00.339> you<00:08:00.429> or<00:08:00.639> will

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:00.849 
and hopefully worked out for you or will

00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:10.480 
and hopefully worked out for you or will
work<00:08:01.059> out<00:08:01.269> for<00:08:01.509> you<00:08:01.689> so<00:08:02.169> best<00:08:02.799> of<00:08:02.949> luck
