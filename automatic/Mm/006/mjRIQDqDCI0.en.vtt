00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
that's that on here I'm gonna do a

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.400 
that's that on here I'm gonna do a
similar<00:03:44.910> thing<00:03:45.090> where<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.450> can<00:03:45.720> it's<00:03:46.170> not<00:03:46.200> going

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
similar thing where I can it's not going

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.100 
similar thing where I can it's not going
to<00:03:46.470> be<00:03:46.560> hard<00:03:47.250> mounted<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:48.330> should<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:48.750> slot

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
to be hard mounted it should this slot

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.870 
to be hard mounted it should this slot
in<00:03:49.320> there<00:03:49.530> like<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:51.020> have<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.050> bar<00:03:52.320> or<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.880> brain

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
in there like that have a bar or a brain

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.580 
in there like that have a bar or a brain
so<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.210> think<00:03:54.480> where<00:03:54.570> I<00:03:54.630> can<00:03:54.780> hang<00:03:54.930> two<00:03:55.560> more
