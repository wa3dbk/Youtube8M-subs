hello<00:00:00.840> roan<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.260> jig<00:00:01.500> and<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.070> test<00:00:02.550> is

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hello roan this is jig and this test is

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.240 
hello roan this is jig and this test is
going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.270> lag<00:00:03.510> my<00:00:03.689> computer<00:00:04.140> it's<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.650> double

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
going to lag my computer it's a double

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.940 
going to lag my computer it's a double
helix<00:00:05.640> kind<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.839> it's<00:00:07.620> going<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.799> be

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
helix kind of and it's going to be

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.610 
helix kind of and it's going to be
spinning<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.580> moment<00:00:08.970> if<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.110> works<00:00:10.410> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
spinning in a moment if this works I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.240 
spinning in a moment if this works I
haven't<00:00:10.920> tried<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.160> yet<00:00:12.440> fingers<00:00:13.440> crossed

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:24.050 

there<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.369> goes<00:00:20.900> I<00:00:22.400> feel<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.670> should<00:00:23.850> try

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060

to<00:00:24.090> speak<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.689> up<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.990> bit<00:00:26.720> well<00:00:27.720> wonder<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
to speak this up a bit well wonder if I

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.270 
to speak this up a bit well wonder if I
can<00:00:28.230> actually<00:00:28.650> jump<00:00:29.189> up<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:30.890> no<00:00:31.890> that's<00:00:34.280> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
can actually jump up it no that's the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.979 
can actually jump up it no that's the
ultimate<00:00:35.430> parkour<00:00:35.940> challenge<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.570> there

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
ultimate parkour challenge know so there

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.310 
ultimate parkour challenge know so there
you<00:00:40.020> go<00:00:41.570> I'm<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> try<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.020> make<00:00:43.200> this

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
we'll try with to delay soul together

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:10.500 
we'll try with to delay soul together
yet<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.710> action<00:01:04.430> there<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.519> go

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
decided to make a series of contraptions

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.700 
decided to make a series of contraptions
and<00:01:56.590> continue<00:01:57.400> this<00:01:57.490> video<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:58.270> one<00:01:58.479> is<00:01:58.810> like

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.200 
and continue this video this one is like
a<00:01:59.790> travelator<00:02:00.790> thing<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.479> pushes<00:02:01.870> stuff<00:02:02.200> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
a travelator thing it pushes stuff and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.260 
a travelator thing it pushes stuff and
including<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:04.390> which<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.710> was<00:02:06.580> actually<00:02:06.820> kind

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
including you which I was actually kind

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.380 
including you which I was actually kind
of<00:02:07.330> surprised<00:02:07.720> about<00:02:09.090> these<00:02:10.090> invisible

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
of surprised about these invisible

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.500 
of surprised about these invisible
blocks<00:02:10.899> do<00:02:11.230> push<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.190> they<00:02:13.000> even<00:02:13.150> push

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
blocks do push you and they even push

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.750 
blocks do push you and they even push
you<00:02:13.660> up<00:02:13.810> however<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:17.440> fall<00:02:17.709> straight<00:02:18.520> back

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
you up however you fall straight back

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.550 
you up however you fall straight back
through<00:02:19.060> them<00:02:19.209> immediately<00:02:19.690> afterwards<00:02:20.320> so

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
through them immediately afterwards so

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.050 
through them immediately afterwards so
that's<00:02:21.130> really<00:02:21.340> weird<00:02:22.380> also<00:02:23.880> there's<00:02:24.880> this

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
other thing over here it's moving on a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.890 
other thing over here it's moving on a
turn<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.780> not<00:02:34.959> really<00:02:36.600> obviously<00:02:37.600> there<00:02:37.870> are

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
turn but not really obviously there are

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.810 
turn but not really obviously there are
a<00:02:38.320> bunch<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.769> pistons<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.519> they're<00:02:39.670> all

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
a bunch of pistons and they're all

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:47.300 
a bunch of pistons and they're all
pushing<00:02:40.620> all<00:02:41.620> these<00:02:41.890> invisible<00:02:42.190> blocks<00:02:42.730> here

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.080

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.500 
so there you go now I'm going to end
this<00:02:52.209> video<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.600> promise<00:02:53.370> unless<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.940> figure

this video I promise unless I figure

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.410 
this video I promise unless I figure
something<00:02:56.290> else<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.680> would<00:02:56.739> be<00:02:57.060> crazy<00:02:58.060> now

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420
